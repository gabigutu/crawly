		<shortDescription>Emotionally powerful film about childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an emotionally powerful (and sad) film about a boy coming to terms with the fact that his mother, who he loves dearly, is dying. It is also about being a child in a world where everyone older than you treats you with great condescension. Adults make decisions affecting his life without so much as asking for his opinion. No one talks about death, but it is in the back of his mind at all times. Everyone tries to hide what is really going on, as if "what you don't know won't hurt you", but the boy is hurting badly.There are no car chases, shoot-outs, or space aliens in this film. This film is about real life, about growing up, and about children's sexuality. It is told wonderfully well, from a child's perspective.A magnificent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really great coming of age film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1950s Sweden a 12 year old boy Ingemar (Anton Glanzelius) is sent to live with relatives. His father is away and his mother is slowly dying of some unnamed disease (I think it's tuberculosis) and can't handle him (he's VERY mischievous and always getting in trouble). With his relatives he grows up and learns how to deal with life, love, feelings of abandonment, sex etc etc.Sounds pretty obvious but it isn't. This film is beautifully directed by Lasse Hallstrom and perfectly captures what it's like to be a young boy growing up. That it takes place in 1950s Sweden makes no difference--all young boys go through the feelings and emotions shown in this movie. Some posters have complained about a (brief) instance of a topless young girl. Well--like it or not, kids that age DO think about sex and do "explore" their feelings with other kids. I actually think it's great that this film didn't shy away from that subject. Glanzelius is just great in the role and has a VERY expressive face (some of the looks he gives are fascinating and hilarious too). An excellent film. This was a surprise hit in the US in 1985. It was so big Glanzelius actually toured the country with his parents to promote the movie. I remember seeing it in 1985 and loving it--it still holds up. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straight to the heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got to watch this film from beginning to end last night, after having caught glimpses of it on television. What is there in this film not to love? Beautiful Swedish landscapes in summer and winter. Attractive blond haired children or women. Hilarious eccentrics who spend their entire lives hammering nails into their roof shingles. Children on the cusp of puberty who engage in a completely unrepressed journey of sexual discovery without tilting the film into x-rating.This is a true story based on the life of a real child whose mother was a famous Swedish writer, who had a terrible temper and also died of a disease of the lungs. As a special, there is a delightful interview with the director which is insightful on several levels. He talks about what it was like working with the child actors and how natural they were about their work. He talked about how he only realized how unconsciously hooked into the film he had become after seeing it several years after completion. The reason given was that he too was the child of a famous writer/mom who needed her space and privacy. He too had children and then was divorced. So, on many levels he found the film a cathartic experience AFTER he had watched it in a theater and watched how other people responded.What is clear about this film is that it is charming without being cheap or smarmy. The unpretentious manner in which a touching and sad story is told is such a joyful antidote to the average Hollywood film. Unlike most American films which say too much, are too loud and spoon feed all thinking into the audience with the assumption that we are dumb, insensitive and unable to connect the dots, this drama delights with it's simplicity, allowing the drama to come to us in an unhurried telling. This film won several awards and most deserving it was. At the end we both cry and smile at the outcome. What is strengthening to know, is that the real life boy whose story this is, thrived. A really great film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bittersweet Charmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This odd little film relates the story of Ingemar, a boy who learns about life, death, loss, and practically everything else. The boy is a charming little fellow, and all the odd people he meets are also charming in their own ways.Because his mother is dying and his father is off in some other part of the world, he and his brother are split up. Ingemar goes to live with relatives in another town. There he must learn the meaning of the strange things that happen in life. He develops a simple but profound philosophy: no matter what happens to him, "It could have been worse." He even has to deal with the thought that he was not wanted by his parents. He distances himself from the pain in his life by comparing his predicaments to things he has heard about in the great, strange world beyond the little town where he lives.This is an amusing, quaint film that shows us that life goes on no matter how difficult and hurtful it seems. Not only that, we can smile like the little boy in the face of all adversity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Life As A Dog, now this is a total delight. The film follows the life of Ingemar in his 12th year as he has to cope with the slow death of his mother. The film takes place in 1959 in Sweden, and is just right in its atmosphere. Hallestrom works wonders with Anton Glanzelius as Ingemar, and he gives a marvelous performance that is truly touching and real. When his mother can no longer care for him and his older brother, Ingemar is sent off to his Uncle who lives in a small town in which it seems that all the residents work at the glass factory, and he soon becomes part of the town's fabric. His adventures are many,and includes his learning to box from the town tomboy who worries about her budding breasts, the chaperoning of the lovely town beauty as she poses nude for a sculptor, and his reading of a lingerie catalog to a dying old man. The film has been accused at least by someone on this list as being pornographic and prurient which is idiotic and stupid. This is a film about childhood and like most childhoods the film includes several scenes about children's growing awareness and curiosity about sex and their bodies and presents it in a real and sensitive way. A word of warning about the DVD transfer of the film. It stinks. Not only is it not letterboxed, but is full of flaws and looks no better than a video, but it is subtitled, and is still a joy to watch. One of the ten best films I saw in 1985.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mit liv sum hund" directed by talented director Lasse Hallström is one of the reasons why I like Scandinavian movies so much. They always have this "real" feeling without ever overdoing things like in Hollywood movies often is the case.The story is very simple and mainly because of that it all feels very real and heartwarming. Once you have started watching this movie you can't keep your eyes of it. It's a movie you'll easily fall in love with. The movie is filled with some great, emotional and heartwarming moments that are never exaggerated or overused in any kind of way.There are some great characters, both adults and kids. I think that is the main reason why this movie is great to watch for adults as well as children. The characters are easy to relate with thanks to the "real" feeling of the movie.A movie that'll not easily forget.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swedish Charmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Swedish film offers a different kind of story and a strangely appealing one. Anton Glanzelius is good as the 12-year-old who not only stars in the movie but does a good job narrating it as well. When he finds himself in a tough situation, he always compares himself to something worse, such as a Soviet space dog and its unfortunate lot. The tomboyish-looking young girl who flirts with him, Melinda Kinnaman, is fun to watch, too. I wonder what she looks like now as an adult?For kids that young, I thought there was a little too much emphasis on sex, but mostly it's just natural curiosity of what the other sex looks like, and the intentions are innocent.Overall, it is a charming film with almost all (one exception: his older brother) likable people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtitles, what subtitles?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a great lover of subtitled films. The highest credit I can give this, is that within 5 minutes, I'd forgotten that they were even there. You cannot take your eyes of this movie. Beautifully filmed with characters who are so real that at times, you feel like you're intruding. I felt so desperately sad for this young lad who nobody seemed to want. He was clearly deeply affected by his mothers illness and was in desperate need of some kind of counselling. Instead, he was sent to live with a relative in a small town. The people there all seemed wrapped up in their little Worlds To an outsider, they all seemed a bit dysfunctional. Sex rears it head at seemingly every turn. Whether it was the dying man wanting his underwear catalogue read to him, the factory worker admiring his co-workers 'melons', the growth of teenage breasts, the artist sculpting the deeply inappropriate image of a woman and her newborn baby...Well, everyone was at it. Does everyone really think and act like this?..Well, probably more than most people think. I really didn't want this movie to end and actually felt at the conclusion, that I would miss seeing the characters. Don't be put off by the subtitles, you won't notice them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most heartwarming, my best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"MY LIFE AS A DOG" is certainly my best film. Especially when I feel somehow composed, this movie always let me notice that such an uneasiness in my heart has been washed by an extremely tender way. Instead of the eradicated dirtiness, unconsciously I get full of warm affection and mildness. About each occurrences in this movie, however, I cannot describe which scene is the most impressive, the sad, or comical, because I think there is no exactly deliberate scene but just a boy's thought and life with his mother, brother, pet dog, other relative, friends, and other villagers.The very basic natural humanity is vividly presented through those people. For example the boy, who is the main character, is normally of sensibilities and admirable as a 12 years old child. He is sometimes mischief and shows curiosity about girls, other time weeps missing his mom and his pet dog. While the boy seems to be about to get the sadness over and be going to grow mentally as well in the village. Because the people, to say the least, love to share something amusing with others.Therefore I say that the heartwarming wonderfulness produced by this movie lies in the whole elements. Any fragment cannot be separated even bright sun ray particle in a car, roof fixing noise, and so on. Every details have a reason for being in the movie actually, so feeling moved comes slowly and deeply, top that off, gently. To get a mild temper, this is one of superb movies. For me, this is the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The joys and heartbreak of childhood...episodic but charming...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came across this coming of age movie about a boy's childhood in 1950s Sweden. I expected to change the channel but soon got caught up in the wonderful simplicity of the tale, made especially memorable by the lead performance of the boy Anton whose expressive face mirrors all of his impish thoughts.As charming as a film of this sort can be, despite the episodic nature of the telling. All of the performances are right on target and the director has woven a tapestry of individual scenes that sparkle with truth and innocence. Makes you examine your own childhood feelings of loneliness or rejection--and the explorations that all of us are subject to.By all means, a film worth watching. I hope to see it again--and this time from the very beginning. I missed some of the film and would like to see the complete work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly still Lasse Hallstroms best film. A terrifically funny and very moving account of the pleasures and pitfalls of growing up. I don't think any other film maker has quite captured the brilliance and innocence of childhood in the way this film does. A fantastic achievement which will stand the test of time very well. Beautifully paced, unsentimental and highly evocative it delivers on every level. This is an example of fine European film making - the like of which is a million miles from the approach that Hollywood would make to the same subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood would have ruined this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's what kept going through my mind the entire film. Given the chance they would have turned a simple story of the life of child and sensationalized it beyond remorse. They would have given lines to an 11 year old that only 35 year old writers can come up with. They would have casted it box office draw. They would have cut 70% of the scenes and the other 30% would have been way over emphasized. The beauty of this film is an innocence that allows us to revisit our childhood many times. Not by creating characters or particular circumstances to identify with, but through it's honesty. No formula available for a film like this. Sorry film students.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful, poignant and not so funny if you lost a parent in childhood. I shed lots of tear in this movie and I never forget it. When I see the mother in bed and the two small children trying to find their way forward - yes "it could have been worse" but this situation is bad enough. I took my wife to see so she could know what I was going through inside.This movie is very brave in its treatment of the challenge of raising a child when you are that child. I would recommend it to anyone who works with childhood trauma, deprivation and neglect. It shows how a child can grow up strong but for me it was not funny. Bring your handkerchief.

		<shortDescription>through the eyes of a child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mischievous young boy with a Puckish smile, unusual table manners, and a sympathetic kinship to Laika the Soviet astro-dog is sent by his ailing mother to live with relatives in the country, where he discovers a town full of people even more eccentric than himself. Director Lasse Hallstrom's popular Swedish import offers a refreshing look at the mysteries and heartbreak of adolescence, with all the charm but none of the cloying sentiment of other, similar coming-of-age films. The rich humor is drawn around an affectionate portrait of small town life, closely observed; the pain comes from the realization that young Ingmar's bedridden mother has already passed away. The pace is often lazy and the film is overlong, but Hallstrom's understanding of human idiosyncrasies is reminiscent of a Jacques Tati comedy, choosing to laugh with instead of at his characters. It's a memorable look at love and mortality, as seen from the innocent eyes of a boy passing through that awkward age when he begins thinking like an adult while still unable to stop acting like a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle, irony can result in a powerful human tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film shows how a blend of subtle, irony can result in a powerful human tale. Universal themes like abandonment, loyalty, and love are responsibly explored. The universal awkwardness of late childhood and adolescence are humorless exposed without ridicule and such pressing questions as "who will load the bananas" are answered. I don't think that I have ever laughed as hard during a movie as when I watched "My Life as a Dog." In addition, such pathos is rarely captured on film. I realize that it is cliché to say that I laughed and cried during a movie. However, this is one of the only movies in which I actually did this. I am hard pressed to think of another movie that risks the range of emotions embraced by this film. I would put this film on the level of great Czech literature as Bohumil Hrabal and Vasclav Havel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Favourites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy a great deal of Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom's films for their moving, bittersweet tone. His first US release (albeit ABBA videos) is astounding and pure in Hallstrom's brilliant storytelling. Ingmar simply is a boy who no one can understand. He is consumately nervous; embittered by his mother's untimely departure. He must move to a sweet small town he eventually finds charming.There is a great deal of people who live their lives as they please in is new town. Still, that does not give peace to his terrified soul.With a smashing (and barking) performance by gifted Swede toddler, Anton Glandzelius, "My Life as a Dog" is a beautiful film. Make sure you see the subtitled version to hear Anton's impassioned dialogue!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hallström's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mitt Liv Som Hund" or simply "My Life as a Dog" is a warming and poetic chronicle of the life of a young boy who learns about what growing up is like when faced to live with another parents after his mother's illness prevents her from taking care of him and his older brother. The boy, Ingemar (the gifted Anton Glanzelius), narrates his distant happy memories while living with his mother and then later his future discoveries and events that changed his life. While telling his stories he keeps comparing his life to the Laika's life, the little dog who was sent to space by the Soviet in 1957, year the movie's story starts. "But one must compare", he says. And the comparison he makes with the dog is a reflexive one which seems totally unrelated with the movie but it's not. It's about the process of growing up, facing the unknown (or little known). Laika in the space, Ingemar on the ground with his eccentric uncles, new friends and far away from the very few people he knew: his sick mother and his brother, sent to another home. One has to be afraid of the unknown, to question it again and again but always compare. Maybe later one will know that aren't hard as it appear to be. It carries the same childhood innocence presented in Truffaut's "L'argent De Poche" which presented several sketches of kids getting involved in pranks, apparently harmless sometimes, other times involving great danger, but always discovering, learning something. It had its great dramatic moments but most of it was a collection of nostalgic and jolly images which brings back one of the most fundamental part of our lives: our childhood. What do we do those moments? Well, we compare it to our experiences (if you remember them) and observe if it was that difficult to break from one phase to another, and if we had strange and bitter days or wonderful and pleasant moments. We have to compare, you have to compare!Lasse Hallström makes of this a glorious, beautiful and funny picture, one to be viewed multiple times not because it's difficult or peculiar but because of its graceful and delicacy, truly reward and temptive. Not only those, he extracted one of the greatest performances by a child actor. Glanzelius is natural, convincing and a true to joy to be seen acting. His Ingemar might have a strange optic of things, a puzzling behavior and a puzzling mannerism (the thing he does with the milk to quote an example) but there's plenty of admirable things to which any of us can relate to him. It's a shame he practically vanished from the movie business after giving one helluva of performance. The golden ticket that brought the director to Hollwyood after his Oscar nomination, this is Hallström's best film to date. Not saying that "Chocolate" and "The Cider House Rules" don't have merits cause they have but gotta admit that Hollywood ruined a bit Mr. Hallström's potential with all the awarded and nominated tearjerkers he made there, most of them flicks that go for the easy tears and easy targets. He's so much more effective with simple presentations, which mirrors life and are relevant to life, going deeper than anything. In "My Life as a Dog" he goes for the smiles and the positive emotions with glimpses of sadness. Sweet as childhood. But that's just my perspective. 10/10</fullReview>

Now after I saw 'My life as a dog', I find that Hallstrom is really great in making films about life. Both films are about daily dramas on ordinary people's lives but 'My life as a dog is more fun to watch than the great but depressing 'What's eating Gilbert Grape''My life as a dog' focuses very well on the joy and sadness of a growing boy, Ingemar. It's set in the beautiful Sweden in 1959. Ingemar has to live in different places and meet different people because of his ill mom. In his being away from home, he gets a lot of experience. In dealing with his experiences, he tells us about what he thinks about life. Although the words come out from a boy's mouth, they actually teach all of us something.Hallstrom intelligently bring small details to make this movie 'alive', rich and inspiringly funny. The casts are excellent. All the children in this film look natural and realistic. 'My life as a dog' is really delightful to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most touching, challenging, downright delightful movies I've seen. It is a portrayal of the coming of age of a young trouble maker whose life is in disrepair. His mother has been victimized by disease and she has this incorrigible little boy whom she loves but can't control. He is suffering from no love and seeks it out where he can. He is the paragon of attention deficit disorder. The movie isn't morose, however. He is genuinely funny and loving when he has the chance to be. He is sent to live with relatives where his life opens up and he begins to have purpose. He is given some latitude and begins to develop a real life. Unfortunately, there are events going on around him that will impact him, including the continuing deterioration of his mother's health and the little dog he left behind. He has so little power in his life as is the case with most little boys, and at times he tries to hard. One delightful connection is a young girl who is a better athlete than the boys in the town. There is this sexual tension that takes place as she matures and begins to fall for him. It is happy and sad and has a lovely message about grasping life whenever we can. See this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lasse Hallstrom shows shades of his later movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I had seen "The Cider House Rules" and "Chocolat", I took some interest in Swedish-born director Lasse Hallstrom, and so I decided to check out one of his movies from his native country. "Mitt liv som hund" ("My Life as a Dog" in English) really impressed me. This story of abandoned boy Ingemar hits the perfect balance between sentimental and gritty, with one scene that was probably there for a little comic relief (you'll know what I mean if you see the movie). Probably the most effective scene is when Ingemar talks about Laika, the Soviet space-dog. Just as happened to Laika, Ingemar didn't want to have to go through this, it was done to him. And both Laika and Ingemar got left in limbo. Both were victims of cold, abstract forces.Anyway, this is definitely one that I recommend. In my opinion, Hallstrom's American movie most like this one was "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", about a destitute family in Iowa. Both are worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>humans just want to be loved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one scene in this movie that stands out in my mind and I will always remember it. It's the one on the movie poster. Ingemar gets back to the small town after his mother's death and is met at the train station by his loving uncle. They both walk towards each other slowly and his uncle raises him up and hugs him for a while. There's a beautiful background music. No words are needed to describe the love they feel for each other. This movie is excellent, probably my favorite movie mainly because it shows that human beings just want to feel loved, and even though we feel we shouldn't when we screw up, deep down we still feel worthy of love. Even if the story is told through the experiences of a 12 yr old boy, anybody can relate no matter what age, because we all feel that hunger to be loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming of age in Sweden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I loved this film! I've seen Lasse Halstrom's English films after reading the novels and wasn't impressed. I think The Shipping News especially did not capture the atmosphere and humour of the novel. But, I love Swedish cinema starting with one of my favorite directors Ingmar Bergman right up to Pelle the Conqueror. I think the Swedish language, landscapes and climate lend themselves to a distinct flavour. I'd say I went into My Life as a Dog with mixed expectations.What I found was probably the most intelligent coming-of-age films I've seen. I'm sure American's have their soft spot for Stand by me and other coming-of-age films they can directly relate to but for those with a broader perspective, this is a very rewarding film. The acting by all the 10-13 year olds is superb. The story, based on a semi-autobiographical book is tender, touching and realistic. There is an element of fantasy but nothing off-putting or tedious like so many French films (Amelie and A Very Long Engagement being two films I especially dislike).The film is set in the late 50's and apart from the coming of age theme, it deals with boxing - Ingemar something or other beat Floyd Pattersen! -; dogs - apparently the Russians sent a dog in space without enough food and young Ingemar's dog is cruelly taken away from one at a particularly vulnerable time; and a budding sexual awakening guaranteed to rile up prudish Americans even if its innocent and unerotic. I won't elaborate on the plot but would strongly a recommend a viewing for those who appreciate intelligent coming-of-age movies from a different culture. You can decide after first viewing whether or not its appropriate for your children to see. I personally see nothing inappropriate in the themes or the treatment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, intensely comical, but also sweet, sad and touching.It shows the life of a young boy (apparently 12 years old) who is discovering life for the first time. He explores such issues as sex, with no understanding (or interest). But he is forced to grow up quickly.This movie is a wonderful picture, full of wonderful scenes and subtleties. It centres on the innocence of childhood and the way in which life works.It has been said that this film errs on the side of child pornography because a young girl exposes herself (just the torso) to the boy. I will just say two things in Europe, sex is taken in a more artistic light than in America, so such things are not digusting or obscene. They are not full of moral wowsers who can't see the art for the breasts...It helps if you watch the movie for a second time, as everything is better and you notice the great subtitles placed in this wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy played out against a melancholic backdrop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ingemar is on the cusp of adolescence. It is the late 1950s Sweden. When the opening scene showed Ingemar on the beach amusing his mother with some childish antics, I was primed for a happy coming-of-age story. But then it is revealed that Ingemar is living at home with his mother who has tuberculosis. This sets the theme of the movie, just when you think things might be looking up for Ingemar, darker issues arise.Anton Glanzelius, who plays Ingemar, embodies a perfect combination of imp and winsomeness. He can cause adults grief with his trouble-making, but much of the time it is his innocence that gets him into trouble, like the time he has a small fire going in a trash dump that gets out of control, or the time he is suckered into an embarrassing prank at school. He has some odd behaviors, like approaching his milk glass with trepidation as if were one of life's great challenges to drink from it.When Ingemar becomes too much for his mother to handle he is sent to a small village down south to live with his uncle's family. This village has more than its share of eccentrics, like an older guy who is constantly repairing his roof, or the uncle's father who asks Ingemar to read to him from the lingerie section of a catalog. Much of the footage at the uncle's is gentle humor interspersed with typical trials of growing up. But then the mother dies. And so it goes.Ingemar has a delightful philosophical bent. As one way to deal with life's challenges he frequently tries to comfort himself by thinking that things could be worse. He keeps meditating on Laika, the dog that the Soviets sent into space in 1957, the first living animal sent up. In thinking of Laika, Ingemar comments, "You have to compare, so you can keep perspective. It helps to keep a little distance." He frets over the thought that Laika was sent into space knowing that he would most certainly starve to death. Maybe Ingemar sensed a wider metaphorical meaning--in some sense we are all shot into space at birth only ultimately to suffer the fate of certain death. The main musical theme perfectly captures the melancholic mood; its memory is one of the things that drew me to re-watch this after having first seen it over twenty years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for My Life as a Dog, and not only did the film meet those expectations it also surpassed them.I was really taken with the emotional core My Life as a Dog had. The scenes where Ingemar gets into mischief are fitfully amusing, but other scenes are very poignant too. I think some of the emotional resonance of the film comes from how truthful and warm My Life as a Dog is, there's even something very Truffautesque about it.My Life as a Dog has an evocative script, a compelling story and characters that feel real, you immediately connect with Ingemar and do so right up to the last second.Lasse Hallstrom directs beautifully, the film looks gorgeous in photography and production values, the score is haunting and Anton Glanzelius's lead performance is astonishing combining charm and wit with innocence and spirit.Overall, a truly wonderful movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

It isn't Laika sent in space at the onset of the movie, but the little boy who identifies with his dog who was put to sleep while he was away at his uncle's place. The little boys is from a modest background, grows up like the rest of the town, and faces problems many faced in those years. In his case his mom was sick and his dad was never home (had he ever been home?). At the uncle's place the boy slowly discovers other facets of the world, never losing his grace. Not much of a plot really. When I first heard about it, I thought this movie was going to suck big times, but my girlfriend of the time insisted to go see it. She was right. It isn't the plot, but the events, the pace, the closeness to real life, the innocence of the early years, ... all these things add up to an amazing experience of almost going again through childhood. I am giving it a 9 because, theoretically, there could be better movies out there, although it's gonna be tough to beat this one.</fullReview>

The story follows the youngest as he moves in with an uncle and his wife. They have no kids of their own, but they are genuinely decent people who try their best. This movie follows the boy during the first year or two of his life with them and you get to see his first love, him playing on a soccer team, etc. While this may sound mundane, it is amazing how well the movie holds your attention--the writing, acting and directing are superb.Although I liked this movie a lot, I was a little surprised that it received the Golden Globe when Jean de Florette was just nominated.

		<fullReview>All of my emotional reaction to this film can be summarized by the devilish look Anton Glanzelius's eyes throughout the picture. Devilish is not necessarily the right word. Wicked is more appropriate as it connotes a level of playfullness and sexuality that the former cannot capture. This movie encapsulated the essence of childhood in its purest form, right down to the hedonism and cold-heartedness with which children often act. My Life As a Dog shows a child precisely as one might find him: imaginative, cruel, forgiving, spoiled, liberated, sensitive, full of hate and full of love, and unconsciously optimistic. You will remember what its like to be a child when you see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bow WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just caught up with this one after a decade or so. I was aware of the acclaim surrounding its release but I was aware also that it was yet another rites-of-passage, coming-of-age entry, a genre which tends to be thick on the ground so I didn't so much avoid it as not make too much of an effort to catch it reasoning that if it were as good as all that it would be around a while and/or resurface regularly. Now I have seen it and I can't put my hand on my heart and say the acclaim was misplaced. Certainly Anton Glazenius is more than up to snuff as the young lead sent away to stay with a maternal uncle just as puberty is kicking in. The twist this time around is that his father is long gone and his mother is in the terminal stages of one of those unspecified diseases once so beloved of Hollywood hacks. Sure enough the small community in which he fetches up has a full complement of what we might call Carson McCullers-lite eccentrics, not least the old man confined to bed who persuades young Ingemar to read aloud from a lingerie catalogue which he whips beneath the blankets each time his wife enters the room. Although it suffers in comparison to 'Le Grand Chemin' I am more than happy to add my voice to those who have endorsed it before me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young 11-year-old boy discovers life, death and girls. My Life as a Dog really is as simple as that. Nothing else really happens, but that's what makes it so magical. Ingemar (Anton Glanzelius) leads a simple but complex life where his mother dies young and he is consequently sent to live with his uncle. At first I thought this would be depressing, but this was not the case. I thought his uncle would abuse him; the other kids wouldn't like him etc. I was pleasantly surprised to see Ingemar loved by all.Ingemar meets a girl on the football pitch, gets beaten by the same girl at boxing and falls through a window trying to spy on a naked women posing for a sculpture. He reads the text from an underwear section in a mail order catalogue to his uncles Dad and learns the art of glass blowing. It's all very simple and silly, but completely enjoyable. There are a few uncomfortable moments, which could be misconstrued as inciting paedophilia, but it's just what kids do when growing up. "You show me yours and I'll show you mine" is all part of growing up, it happens to us all. Whether it should be shown on screen is another thing. I found it uncomfortable to watch but I could relate to it, hence making it compelling. This is not a criticism?it's credit. Anton Glanzelius gives a wonderful performance as 11-year-old Ingemar, as do the rest of the cast. The scenery, when it's not snowing, is green and wonderful to look at. The film barely scrapes the 90minute mark, which is just enough. Anymore and it would have been boring. You can only show so much of the Swedish countryside. Lasse Hallstrom's The Shipping News has a similar simple plot, but was boring because it was too long at 111 minutes. 90 minutes is perfect for something so simple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcok said that the difference between a European film and an American film is that a European film can open with a shot of clouds, cut to a second shot of clouds, and cut to a third shot of clouds. If an American film opens with a shot of clouds by the second shot there must be an airplane and if by the third shot if the plane hasn't crashed the audience is bored. I believe Hitch said that around 40 years ago, further proving his genius. I am an American film fan. I follow Hollywood, major independents and major English language films. I'm not denigrating great European or non-English pictures, but I swear Hitch is right...all these European films I've seen, (even so-called 'masterpieces' like Fellini's "8 1/2"), are boring, meandering, non-sense. I just don't get it!The one exception is Lasse Hallstrom's "My Life as a Dog" (1985). Maybe I'm just a sucker for these kinds of films, but I love this movie! I was browsing in my video store, looking for something different to rent. I was so desperate, I went to the 'foreign language' section and saw the box cover for this movie. Hallstrom was riding high from "The Cider House Rules" (1999) which I had just seen and didn't care that much for, but I did respect it, so I gave "Dog" a chance. For me, this movie played like a "Stand by Me", with subtitles. That's not a fair comparison, but like "Stand" it reminisces about a childhood life in the 50's. But I felt "Dog" was even more honest and accurate about children and the way they think and behave. I certainly will never know what it's like to live a life like Igmar's, but I did some similar things at that age. I won't spoil anything for you. If you liked "Stand By Me" or the TV series, "The Wonder Years" I think you'll like "My Life as a Dog" too. Although unlike those shows there's no voice-over narration here, which is good. As for the sexuality and such, I don't see this film endorsing anything negative at all. It's just presenting a realistic look about how curious children are, something I don't see an any Hollywood film or TV program, certainly.Final rating: 8.25/10 "Almost a classic. Only a few minor flaws keep this from a higher rating."</fullReview>

MY LIFE AS A DOG packs a wallop. For me, it was like seeing parts of my own life reflected on frames of film. (Not for the first time, as noted.) Little Ingemar's quiet dignity, his perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, rings all too true. (One of the brighter moments, ironically, is the communal reaction to the radio broadcast of Ingemar Johannson's win over heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in their first fight- ironic because it was a one-time-only moment of triumph and because it was, for all the fanfare, merely one man beating the daylights out of another; no great feat, in effect, but an everyday occurrence elevated to national focus.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a strange movie. It has so many good critiques that I expected something better. It was good at times, but aside that it was downright dull and with mostly unlikeable characters.Despite being a drama, it isn't as involving and deep as a drama should be. I'd like to sympathize more with the lead character, Ingemar, but I can't always do that. He is hard to evaluate: he isn't annoying, but he ain't sweet peer either. He often seemed like a retard due to his sometimes erratic behavior (such as barking like a dog). Still, he is wonderfully portrayed by the actor Anton Glanzelius.Saga, the tomboy, was another complicated character. She is supposed to like Ingemar, and yet she shows her love for him in a strange manner: by beating him up in a boxing match and hugging him during or after that. She is well played by Melinda Kinnaman.This film makes reference to Laika's story a cup of times. Despite his problems, Ingemar often seeks solace by reciting the tragic story of Laika the space dog. That is one good thing about this film, bringing some poetry and some soul to it.The Swedish film-making and cinematography is another solid point, thanks to the natural beauty of the sunny settings and the characteristic snow and freezy nordic weather.There have been complains about child nudity. What is it with everybody and this paranoia over pedophilia? Just because of one scene of child nudity in a film they already think it's pedophilia. It's scary how people got paranoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was nominated for, and won, several awards across the world, but the specter of Bergman still lingers over the film, even if oppositionally. The Swedes depicted on screen are nothing like those in the Bergman universe. They are not rich, depressed, and well educated. Ingemar and his brother and mother live in a shanty house slum, and his uncle's country place is only a little nicer, even if the scenery is much more wholesome. And despite having far more reason to moan than Bergman's characters do, Ingemar is marked by a perseverance one can only refer to as 'dogged.' The cinematography by Jörgen Persson is solid, although there is a repeated static shot of the cosmos, whenever Ingemar gets reflective, that looks like something from a 1950s sci fi film where the word 'Science!' is spoken ecstatically, which should have been made to look a bit more engaging. Granted, this might be the typical textbook sort of photo that a child would associate with outer space in those days, but it still drags on the often deeper narration Ingemar provides, and simply looks cheap.While the film was based upon a novel with the same title, written by Reidar Jonsson, and the screenplay was written by Hallström, Jonsson, and Brasse Brannstrom and Per Berglund, the character of Ingemar succeeds less on the words the character speaks, and mostly on the uncanny acting ability- or even inability, of Glanzelius- who never had another major starring role. There is just something 'off' about little Ingemar, something which, as reflected in the screenplay, is missing in comparison to Glanzelius's portrayal. The text would lead one to believe Ingemar is just another kid, if perhaps one a bit 'off,' yet Glanzelius's unaffected portrayal reveals him to be perhaps 'slow' or borderline 'autistic'- as he might now be labeled, especially when he goes on all fours and barks like a dog or cannot drink from a glass in public without spilling the liquid all over himself. Then there is the actor's very appearance, which has an odd, almost maniacal twinkle in his mien, akin to a young Jack Nicholson's.All in all, My Life As A Dog is a good non-Hollywood Hollywood film, albeit a deeper one, without forced emotions. It is a film that hints at a promise Hallström has yet to fulfill, opening up the query over whether or not it is better to never fill potential by existence and failure or by not existing at all. Perhaps Ingemar already thought that through whilst pondering that dog high above his own canine plight?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A likable but insignificant film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American critics and audiences sometimes show a tendency to overrate some foreign films which are not THAT much better than similar domestic ones. This is a likable, sweet-natured, never-boring film with some observant moments; however, it essentially consists of a series of episodes, and the episodes never build to a compelling whole. You like the film as you watch it, but you never get the feeling that it is anything more than the story of one particular boy, whose life isn't that exceptional after all. (**)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am dumbfounded as to the reason this film caught flattering attention. I love foreign and art house, and I know why it caught my attention: I watch anything. But I actually stopped watching this tepid tragedy due to disinterest, waited a few days and re-played it, this time all the way through. Despite it's promising subject matter this script is far from adventurous; the boy learns nothing from his experiences and the townspeople are no more eccentric than your average Swede. Due to a miscast of the lead character (he is 12 years old, but the actor seems about 9) the sexual encounters he has are borderline creepy. There could have been a deeper, lost metaphor between the loss of his dog and his thoughts of his dying mother, but if so, it was either lost in translation or wound up on the cutting room floor.If you want an excellent film that tackles looming death or losing a loved one rent "Autumn Spring" or Hallstrom's better venture, "The Shipping News". Hmmm, Death. That reminds me. I was less bored watching the walking scene in "Gerry". Rent that too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swedish Porn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is nothing more than Swedish porn. And to make matters worse, it even qualifies in the category of child porn. Guess the Swedes enjoy that type of smut. This film should be shown in theaters that cater to that type of smut. I can think of two areas that would like to show it. They are Time Square in NYC and Harry Hines Blvd in Dallas, TX. The acting was very amateur and the characters never defined their personalities. All in all, I am grateful that I did not have to spend any money to view this tripe.Also, I noticed that the film itself was in poor shape with a lot of film gate damage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably bad, and probably child porn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God - what a hideous excuse for a film! It seems more like a parody of bad foreign film than an ACTUAL bad foreign film.A young boy suffers through a number of heartbreaking or simply incomprehensible events, then late in the film starts barking like a dog. But finally, while watching a molten glob of glass being thrust into a blast furnace, the young boy smiles when he realizes that despite all of life's woes, he can at least have sex with the 12 year old girl down the street.Frankly, I think it flirts with child porn when the 12 year old girl exposes herself to dog-boy.This is simply a random collection of images, by turns depressing, lewd, or simply bizarre. The only reason pseudo-intellectuals think there's a movie here is because it has subtitles.</fullReview>
