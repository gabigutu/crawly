		<shortDescription>One of the most disturbing and confronting movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching 'Irreversible' makes you question why you watch movies. If you just want movies to be entertainment and nothing more then obviously this is not something you will EVER want to see in your life. But if you think that film, like literature, is capable of many things, including looking at horrible and disturbing subject matter that you would prefer not to deal with, then 'Irreversible' is highly recommended. But beware, I feel I have the ability to stand all kinds of extreme material, but even I found it extremely difficult to watch. Writer/director Gaspar Noe previously made the brilliant and confrontational 'I Stand Alone', a movie that unfortunately never reached a wide audience. He manages to top himself with this one. Both movies make a mockery of supposedly "difficult" Hollywood fare like 'American Psycho', 'Fight Club', 'Boys Don't Cry' and 'Requiem For A Dream', which are pure Disney compared to Noe's work! 'Irreversible' has a similar structure popularized (but not originated) in Christopher Nolan's 'Memento'. The plot is told in reverse chronological order. This means that the early parts of the movie show the most distressing and difficult material and as the movie continues it gets progressively lighter, and therefore ends ironically on a happy ending. The opening sequences, after the first more subdued scene (which incidentally features a cameo from 'I Stand Alone' star Philippe Nahon as quite possibly the same character), are the most difficult to watch, not just because of WHAT happens (one of the most extreme and realistic acts of violence I've ever seen in a movie) but the way it is shown, with trippy, disorienting hand-held camera work. Later in the movie we see why this event happened by witnessing a grueling rape sequence which is almost impossible to watch. It is these two scenes which made this movie so notorious, but neither are gratuitous in my opinion, they are just REAL. This is reality. Things like this happen every day. Watching it is horrible yes, but even more horrible is the idea that real people must experience these events in the real world. This is what makes this such a disturbing and powerful movie if you have the stomach for it. On a technical level it is brilliant, and the acting by Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel, then still a couple off screen (gossip says this is no longer true), and Albert Dupontel is first rate. 'Irreversible' is obviously not a movie for everyone, but if you think you are up to it it comes with my highest possible recommendation, as does 'I Stand Alone' ('Seul contre tous'). These are two astonishing movies which look at the unlookable, and are literally unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If movies are suppose to effect the viewer then this movie is king of the hill. From the dis-orienting camera moves that open the film through the violence in the gay bar, the seemingly never ending rape and the films unraveling of the days events in a backwards march I have yet to meet anyone who has not been deeply effected by this movie - if they were brave enough or stupid enough to watch it. (I'm still trying to figure out a local Best Buy displaying a large number of DVD's as if it was the latest Adam Sandler movie)It is not an easy movie to watch but as an examination of what people are capable and how violence can come from nowhere and from the unexpected its a masterpiece. The backward structure takes what is essentially a dull revenge story and turns it on its ear as we are forced to really examine how things get out of hand very quickly and what people will do when pushed to the limit.If you want a challenge to your psyche and can brave simply some of the most vicious and nasty screen violence (yes its graphic but much is also implied) then see this movie - preferably with out distraction. But be warned, even if you think you know what this movie is about and what your limits in screen violence is, you still won't be prepared for what a mental hot foot this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Today I'm dirty, tomorrow just dirt - Time, deeds, man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Argentinian born French film maker Gaspar Noé is already one of the most important and powerful film makers of all time. His 1998 debut feature film Seul Contre Tous is an unforgettably merciless but also so uniquely rewarding depiction of rotten society with even more rotten human beings that inhabit it with their selfishness and potential to violence and revenge - those things that everyone feels sometimes, more or less often, and things that only create more of them when not kept inactive and off. The last 15 minutes of Seul Contre Tous include some of the most unimaginably brilliant editing and camerawork (including a body-mounted camera and clever communication/estranging with the unsuspecting audience) not to speak of the soundtrack, which force us to see the truth about ourselves and things around us. Those mentioned elements are also the same that stamp the work of Japanese film maker Shinya Tsukamoto (Tetsuo in 1988, Gemini in 1999) who is also a friend of Noé. These two directors do most of the important parts of their film making themselves (camera operating, editing, directing, writing..) and both have the talent to smash the viewer straight to the face and force him and her to think and even change towards something better. Now Noé has even surpassed his power and moment of total breathlessness of Seul Contre Tous with his 2002 film Irréversible, a masterpiece that has the same ability to change people's lives and attitudes towards a better world, but with the kind of power of imagery and soundtrack that only few, unfortunately, as films like these deserved more attention and respect, are willing to accept and understand.Alex (Monica Bellucci), Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel) are three French friends who live peacefully and also in love, as Alex and Marcus are together and love each other genuinely. Alex has also been with Pierre but their thing didn't work and now they are only friends and all three get along more than well. Comes a weekend night and time to go to have some fun with more friends. Then, as some alcohol and drugs are involved, comes some arguing with the lovers and Alex decides to go home to sleep and leave her drunken boyfriend to dance alone. Unfortunately for all (but fortunately for the real ill world and audience for whom this film with its message is made for) she meets the most evil thing ever possible to live inside the flesh and bones of human being and a terrible rape takes place. How does man with his instincts react when he learns something terrible and violent has happened to his loved one and there's also a possibility to get to know who did it? Revenge is a human need has the mighty director said and the man's potential for mindless violence, lack of moral and willing to take revenge are the main themes of this important film and it all is told with so much genius and unique elements the film already belongs to the list of the unmatched and the films that managed to make and achieve something for the first time in the history.The film is told backwards so that we'd see even clearlier what results from what and then we are forced to ask ourselves why, which requires to look inside our own heads and souls and look into the mirror. The film begins with the most infernal 20 minutes of the whole movie history and culminates to the most graphically violent and mentally and physically shocking sequence ever created that leaves no questions for what is the real nature of violence, and thus revenge, like. The incredible colors, lights and darkness of the beginning are already something very powerful and unique, but are accompanied even further by truly incredible usage and movements of camera as it twists and shakes in agony of forthcoming and present terror for the whole beginning of the film. The film has only 19 or so parts/scenes as it's told without single edits inside the parts. The form is very convincing and unconventional and naturally makes it even more realistic and easy to connect to our own world. Those who blame the disturbingly strobing, pounding and restless (sonic) imagery of the beginning don't know how much camera is in cinema and how a talented maker can use it, depict and show with it. It is Hell we're witnessing at the beginning of Irréversible so why would've Noé made it look peaceful, calm and harmless as it's all really bad and wicked even and especially for those who support it as we soon learn at the Rectum finale. It is Hell that can be found anywhere where humans live, be and do deeds together and to one another.Noé's camerawork is definitely something very difficult to imagine to be created and the director has said in interviews that there were indeed some segments (mostly the party sequence) when he thought he'd become crazy as it all was so difficult to do and keep in control. The camera is not so wild and restless after the beginning as there isn't even a reason for that, again an example of what does camera mean in cinema and how it must be used without being gratuitous or meaningless. The crane shots of the beginning of the story but the ending of the film are also breathtaking and hypnotic and also show for one last time what is another key element of (the) film alongside the imagery: the soundtrack and music, sounds and voices of the film. The soundtrack consists of menacing, pounding and with one word infernal sounds and also electric music, but those waves are the ones that are not likely to be found from any other film. The sounds make the happenings of the screen look like how they are inside the film and how they would be if and when something like that happened in real life. Never have I experienced and heard the soundtrack strengtening the images as it does in Irréversible. I had one of the year 2002's greatest and unforgettable moments when I saw the film on big screen, which it demands, and I will never forget the feelings I had during the opening of the film, and after I had read about the elements and creating of the soundtrack, I understood even more about the uneasiness of myself and the audience as well as the genius of its creator. If one decides not to agree with Noé about the anti-violent message of the film, he will be smashed numb in front of the images and sounds whether he wanted it or not.The point of the unspeakable violence of the film is to make it look and feel as bad and irreversible as in real world too. When the revenge takes place and we experience something extremely ugly and both physically and mentally painful Noé forces us to see the things that the avenging minds don't see, at least in time, how violence always requires more of it as human beings are pretty much the same animal and we all share these instincts and potential which still could and can be fought against. The revenge and its destroying face comes clear when we ask ourselves who did, what did, to whom did and finally why did, and when the viewer admits those things and accepts the answers the message Noé meant has been delivered. In films violence can be harrowingly brutal, shocking and graphic without being gratuitous and just cheap exploitation shock, and that is the case with Noé's work as in any other important film that builds and gives, and never takes/exploits anything by raping the tool of cinema. After the Rectum finale, only a stupid and a weak mind can think that any wise decisions were made, after the fateful rape, by the characters, humans.Also the infamous crime scene that started it all is so easy to be judged as "unacceptable" and, even more laughably, "pornographic", as now it is nothing less than effective and useful for its purpose, useful to show the nature of sexual violence and how it really is, ugly, nauseating, sadistic and without respect for human life. If someone asks why such a long scene of rape must be filmed as those kind of things happen in real world all the time, the answer is a new question: since those things happen around us all the time and other tools have not been able to stop them or other violence in our world, why couldn't an artist try his own extremely powerful tool (cinema, image and sound) to change and affect things and people? Can there be enough weapons to stop those things happening around us and why the attempts of cinema and a film maker so often are overlooked and not given the acceptance and importance they deserved? Perhaps because they show too much about our very selves and to admit it, that everyone of us is just a human, is too difficult for many.Another important theme of the film is that of its title, how things and deeds are and remain how they once get done, and the more serious and critical the deed is, the more we look and think about it afterwards, still never being able to change it once it's been done as time is so merciless. Beautiful, sunny and sweet things full of life can turn into destruction, darkness, agony, death and eternal loss especially if wrong and fast decisions are made and too much power for the animal instincts are given. Noé's phrase "time destructs everything" is more than true, but also, to some extent, possible to be affected by us who live this world and life so that no more destruction than there already is would take place. Too often precious things get killed because we didn't understand and see early enough, and that's why films like this are universal and eternally fresh in their themes. The film is not thoroughly pessimistic and hopeless due to certain images of beauty and possibility; the images of the beginning were destructed by a happening not possible to be prevented but the total death and Hell could have been prevented, and that's why we, the audience see it first.The actors all do incredible job as there wasn't a script for the film, only a few written pages about the main happenings and parts of the story so all the dialogue was improvised by Noé's instructions and the three do it very naturally and it is not possible to guess there wasn't a screenplay for them without knowing it. In any possible aspect this film is unique and like no other: it was made like no other, it includes images and sounds like no other, and it has a theme and message so strong like no other film (some getting close) in the whole history of movie making. Great art doesn't need to be conventional and like the other works of its kind, and possibly the greatest thing an artist can achieve is a new, powerful, view and way to present it. That Noé achieved and delivered. He did a masterpiece in 1998 and he did another, even more powerful masterpiece in 2002. Both films are perfect in my values and thus among the most important works ever made. Noé did these two and he's still young and full of ideas about themes and elements which he will use in his forthcoming projects. He must not be left outside the canon of the most important masters and philosophers of cinema like some other have, and the world doesn't even know how much it gets if the financers of his films would understand this too. It is like I and the other audience didn't know what was to come when the hypnotic credits of Irréversible started to roll on the silent screen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy Macaroni! Believe the hype, folks...this really IS one of the most shocking, confronting and raw movies ever made! It actually is one of those rare purchases that makes you wonder what the role of cinema is in modern society. Irréversible certainly can't be classified as 'entertainment', that's for sure. It merely looks like a brutal eye-opener, highly unpleasant to watch at times and it sometimes makes you even feel ashamed to be human! Some of the stuff here goes beyond your most feared nightmares and could easily provoke depression, anti-social behavior and anxiety among influential viewers. It's real-life drama and that makes it so powerful and shocking. Irréversible is told backwards, 'Memento'-style if you wish...only it's a lot more effective here as it was in Memento, which actually was a pretty boring and extremely overrated movie. This very simple backwards-structure aspect gives Irréversible the opportunity to implement a couple of unique and rarely seen style elements. The first half hour (which actually is the end of the story) smacks you in the face right away sets the tone for a non-stop, raw experience. Also, you don't really get to know the characters until the last chapter (which is actually the beginning of the film) The characters are a riddle to you constantly and you can't symphatise with any of them, since you just know too little. Through wild camera movements and simplistic techno-music, a claustrophobic and horrifying atmosphere gets created and the violence is really hard to digest. The infamous scene in which Monica Belluci brutally gets raped is one of the most perverted things I've ever seen. It seems to go on forever and you can really visiualise the painful hell the poor girl is going through. I'd call Irréversible a successful combination of ancient, rough exploitation and modern art-house film-making. The brutality portrayed here is typical for the euro-shock cinema but the stylish shooting lifts it up to Cannes Festival material. Cult as pure as it comes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick with it - not enjoyable, but admirable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After notorious walkouts at Cannes and the controversy around the difficult, long, unrelenting rape scene, this was high on my must-see list of the last year. Not for voyeuristic reasons, but because, like A Clockwork Orange before it, the most controversial films are often those with the most to say.This is not a date movie. Nor is it a pleasant, enjoyable experience. It is, however, pure cinema from a director working at the highest technical level, with the camera, with lighting, with makeup, with scripting and with performance. Irreversible is that rare beast, a self-contained experience which goes beyond the cinematic and aesthetic to show something real, both touching and frightening, beautiful and horrific, simple and innovative. The first twenty minutes are among the toughest you will encounter on the screen. The sound whines and hums, the camera spins in all directions, disorientating and showing glimpses of the scene. Dialogue is sparse, the same lines being repeated over and over again. The subject matter is unpleasant, taking place in a seedy gay club, the protagonists (Dupontel and Cassel) searching for someone called the Tenia (named after a tape-worm). And when they find him, there is a sequence which lasts maybe two minutes which is incredibly difficult to watch, yet difficult not to watch. Almost in disbelief, you cannot believe what you are watching is happening, yet marvel at how real it is, both technically and in terms of human character.Beyond that, the film does not let up for about another half an hour, as the backwards-played story begins to piece itself together, leading to an act of provocation unrivalled in cinema history. My second viewing of the film was with a 21-year-old female who found it the hardest scene she had ever watched. It is the details of the rape that make it so shocking - her constant crying and squirming, his inherent joy at her discomfort, his pinning of her arms and gagging her mouth, the passer-by who sees the scene and walks away, unbeknownst to either of them. And when the long, unsettling scene is over, the greatest act of destruction occurs - the destruction of purity and beauty. Yet, as the film is told backwards, when the rape is over, we know there is more to come as we have already seen the aftermath. The brilliance is in naively praying it won't happen, resigned to the knowledge that it will.My co-viewer demanded that we stop the film there but i had to insist that she finish the film. Without following the film through to the end(or the beginning), we would not know the reason that the director put these scenes in front of us. For me the greatest scenes are those that follow - the party scene, the subway journey of the three main characters, the post-dream awakening of the central couple - because they lift the film out of enfant terrible provocation and into a place of simultaneous beauty and pessimism, making sense of the journey all three characters are about to embark on. In particular the significance of dreams is a key theme, along with the linear, destructive power of time which the whole film is playing around with.The film ends with the most difficult sequence to watch, the spinning beautiful image of Monica Bellucci prior to any of the events of the film followed by a strobe light effect which is physically difficult to watch, burning images and words into the brain.Clearly Noe is a director intent on provoking a reaction and - thank God - it is impossible not to react to this film. You may hate it, you may admire it or you may be disgusted by it. All of these are perfect reactions to it. You cannot be indifferent to it. While it is undoubtedly a hard film to sit through, if you put in the effort it rewards in dividends. And it not only deserves but really requires multiple viewings, if you can stomach it. There is far more than can be taken in on the first visit, much to decipher and interpret that I will not spoil here.While it does seem to reference the controversy of the aforementioned Kubrick classic - taking the violence and sexual abuse aspects to new levels, updating for a new generation - and even directly tips its hat to Kubrick - panning down from a poster of 2001 as classical music swells, before going into a psychadelic head-trip - this is a much harder, yet more humane film than Kubrick ever achieved. There is unpleasantness here, do not be fooled, but there is also insightful comment on the nature of humanity, instinct, violence, even love and relationships which alone makes the film worthy of appreciation. It is not a film all will be able to sit through - for a start, its subtitled! - but it is a film which deserves to be seen at least once by anyone with an appreciation of cinema. It is among the finest examples of modern French cinema available and one of the most intelligent and original films from anywhere in the last five years.Finally, it wouldn't be right to hail the film without mentioning the performers. Monica Bellucci is outstanding in an undoubtedly difficult part, conveying the beauty, intelligence, womanliness, emotion and despair of Alex in a way that never screams "Moviestar!" and is always believable. Dupontel is wonderful in perhaps the film's most interesting role, a complex intellectual who, it is often overlooked, gives in to his most primal urges. He is sad, smart, witty and ultimately disturbed. But highest praise goes to Cassel, one of the most interesting actors working, who carries most of the film, emitting charm, energy, fear, shock, humour and weakness. It is hard not to focus on him in any given scene and impossible to catch him acting, high praise indeed given the other subjects which often fill the screen (not least the stunning Bellucci). Together, they are prime examples of true actors giving themselves over completely to their characters in a way that the likes of Nicole Kidman simply can't. They may be stars, but they are first and foremost brilliant performers.Take caution, but do not miss if you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad, depressing movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot has been said about this movie. Yes, there are a couple of brutal and violent scenes. It's even hard to watch at times, but Irreversible is much more than that.I personally think that the acting is great. There's a natural chemistry between the 3 main characters. Monica Bellucci does a wonderful job as Alex. I give her a lot credit for being involved in such difficult role.I really like the way the story was told. Some people say that it's a rip off of Memento, and that it doesn't work well in this movie, but I have to disagree. The movie "starts" in a dark way, with a lot of graphic images and violence. But at the end there's this kind of peace, a little dose of happiness..."the calm before the storm". It works really well, and that's what make this a really sad story.I really recommend this film. But like I said before, it can be hard to watch. Just watch it with an open mind and give it a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very surprised to see all of the negative complaints towards this film.Like "I Spit on Your Grave" or "I Stand Alone","Irreversible" is only rubbish to those who don't understand it,or don't want to understand it.Gaspar Noe tells us the story about love and revenge-a pregnant young woman(outstanding Monica Bellucci)is violently raped and tortured in the underground passage.Her boyfriend(Vincent Cassel)desperately tries to find her rapist to kill him.The infamous Monica Bellucci's anal rape scene is truly brutal and sickening,but at least the film can't be accused of eroticizing,trivializing or glamourizing rape,something many mainstream movies are guilty of.It actually shows that rape is a brutal and disgusting act.Congratulations should go to this stunningly beautiful actress for her brave performance.It's obvious that women should be treated with respect,unfortunately this is the kind of a sexual violence women are dealing with everyday and everywhere.In that case Cassel's savage behaviour is completely justified.The scenes in "Rectum" are genuinely nightmarish and infernal.The film will leave you shaken and desolated,so if you want to see something totally mind-shattering,then "Irreversible" is a must-see.An absolute 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettably Cruel and Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been watching movies for decades, and as far as I remember, only three movies have disturbed me. The first one was `Soldier Blue', when I was a teenager, explicitly showing the massacre of the American Indians. Later, in 1982, `Sophie's Choice', when a mother has to decide which son shall remain alive. `Irreversible', which I saw yesterday, was the third one. The storyline is very simple: In Paris, a young couple goes to a party with a friend by subway. They discuss, and the woman decides to return back home alone. She is violently raped in an underground passage. Her husband and her friend decide to make justice by themselves. What makes the difference in this polemic movie? First of all, like in `Memento', the story is presented backwards, in a reverse chronology, from the credits to the beginning. Although not being original, unfolded this way, the story shocks much more. Then, the cruelty of at least two very explicit scenes (the rape of Alexandra and the aggression and crime of Pierre in the gay night-club) are amazingly well choreographed and real. The beginning of the film, with the camera spinning randomly, and a weird soundtrack, makes the viewer sick and so disoriented and disturbed as Marcus, the character of Vincent Cassel. Therefore, technically this film is outstanding. The performance of the cast and the direction, photography and soundtrack are stunning. Living in Rio de Janeiro, a violent city, the story is very real and scary, and that is why it shakes up more than a horror movie. We never believe that this situation may happen to ourselves or to our friends, but the daily newspaper shows many similar examples. The idea of the irreversibility of time and its destruction, the same way of the lives of the characters in this movie, is fantastic. Certainly a very sensitive person will be sick and will not like this movie. The box of the DVD should advise that this story is recommended to a specific audience. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `Irreversível' (`Irreversible')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some of the most disturbing scenes ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing that can be stated with utmost certainty, it is that `Irreversible,' a French film by writer/director Gaspar Noe, is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. In fact, this tale of the brutal rape of a helpless young woman is one of the most harrowing films ever made and features two of the most graphic scenes ever committed to film: the rape itself and the killing of the man responsible for the rape.Although I imagine that very few people will end up subjecting themselves to this film in the long run, those who do will witness an amazing piece of work in many ways. Like the movie `Betrayal' from 1983, `Irreversible' tells its story in reverse chronological order. It begins with a frenzied man racing through a gay sex club, madly searching for someone we know merely as Le Tenia. Only as the story develops - as we are taken ever further back in time - do we begin to understand what is going on: that this young man, Marcus, is seeking vengeance on the rapist who has brutally attacked his pregnant girlfriend. Noe keeps us in a state of confusion by filming the scene in such a way as to reflect the maniacal state of Marcus' revenge-obsessed mind. The camera bounces around in epileptic confusion while the audience attempts to get its bearings. Eventually, as the filmmakers backtrack to reveal the events that have led up to this moment, the camera calms down and we get to see the whole ugly story acted out in painfully graphic detail. In fact, in the rape scene itself, Noe reverses his filmmaking style 180 degrees, deliberately leaving the camera stationary and focused on the event as it plays itself out. He simply won't allow us to stop looking.There are some, I imagine, who might object to this film on moral grounds, feeling that it is little more than a cynical exploitation picture with artistic pretensions. Yet that condemnation would do a disservice to the makers of this film who, I believe, do not want us to revel in the sordidness of what we see, but rather to be appalled by the unspeakably brutal way in which human beings can treat their fellow human beings. By having us sit and witness every moment of this brutality without the comforting filter of cutaway shots or easy dissolves, Noe forces us to face the ugly truths about ourselves as a species. The reverse-order structure of the film heightens the tragic nature of the story for it allows us to see just how happy and hopeful these characters are in the time right before the rape shatters their lives. The latter half of the film contains no physical violence, yet watching it unfold is an ineffably sad experience, for we, unlike the characters themselves, are privy to the Sword of Damocles so precariously poised over their unsuspecting heads, yet find ourselves helpless in being able to rescue them from the inevitable destruction it will cause. Thus, the structure robs us of even the remotest option of hoping against hope that the tragedy can somehow be avoided - for we have seen it as an already completed action. For while the film may be `reversible,' life itself is not. In the case of this film, at least, form does, indeed, become content.Vincent Cassel as Marcus, Monica Bellucci as his girlfriend, Alex, and Albert Dupontel as their mutual friend, Pierre, all deliver excellent, heartfelt performances. I doubt that many people will have the intestinal fortitude to make it through large segments of this film, but those who do will surely never forget what they've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3 H's: Horrifc, Haunting and Honest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few months ago while I was going through the message boards on IMDb, someone was talking about disturbing films and one that seemed to come up the most was a film called Irreversible. This film has come up in discussion so many times when the subject of disturbing film is brought to attention. When I think I've seen the worst of the worst, I figured I should see what Irreversible had to offer. I have to admit after watching this movie, it stayed with me. Definitely not being the easiest movie to watch, Irreversible has a style to it and a very disturbing story that can haunt many for different reasons. Wither it's the extreme violence, the cursing, the drugs or the 9 minute rape scene, Gasper Noe takes you into this very dark world and doesn't let you go.The beginning of Irreversible (that is, the chronological end of the story) features two men going to a homosexual S&amp;M nightclub called "The Rectum." Minutes earlier, the men named Marcus and Pierre, are escorted out of that nightclub by the police. Marcus is on a stretcher, apparently injured, and Pierre is in handcuffs. Earlier that evening, Marcus and Pierre arrived at the club in a frantic search for somebody nicknamed le Tenia. Marcus finds the man believed to be le Tenia and attacks him. The man pins down Marcus, then snaps his arm. Pierre rescues Marcus by bludgeoning the attacker's face using a fire extinguisher, brutally and fatally crushing the man's skull after repeated blows. During the onslaught, the real le Tenia is seen to be amused by the situation. It is revealed that le Tenia raped Marcus's girlfriend Alex, and placed her in a coma by beating her severely.Filmed backwards I thought was extremely brilliant, at least the way I interpret it. We see EXTREME violence and sexuality in the beginning, pretty much being up front that this movie is going to be very uncomfortable and not a movie for all. Gasper Noe is basically telling the audience "what you see is what you get", not trying to pull you into something you might not want to be apart of. It also shows that these two men who kill this man violently are possibly the bad guys? No, it turns out as we discover that a woman they both love has been brutally raped and beaten. Then when we meet her, she's not just some woman who is the girlfriend of one of men trying to get revenge or a girl at a party dressed in a skimpy outfit, this is a woman who is walking out of a party trying to get home and comes across the "wrong place, wrong time" situation. The rape scene, reason being that it's so different than any other rape scene you might have viewed in another film, it's long, one angle and the words that come out of the rapist's mouth are just awful. It's the most realistic rape scene I've viewed and I have to warn you that please, if you have a weak stomach or have had that horrific experience, this is not a movie for you.Irreversible is definitely violent, there is a scene that most people debate which is more disturbing, the rape or the fire extinguisher. The fire extinguisher is at the beginning of the film and is definitely realistic and beyond disturbing, because you see everything. Also the hatred behind the killer is just there, he has no remorse for what he is doing. Then when we find out later that he kills the wrong guy, it just makes it that more brutal. Gasper Noe also films the movie in the worst way in the beginning making the audience sick with his spinning camera and disturbing noises. He doesn't lie to you, he knows this film is going to be one of the most frightening pieces of work you'll see, and he doesn't want you comfortable with it. Irreversible is one of the hardest films for me to recommend because it just depends on what kind of a viewer you are. If you can handle extreme violence, sexuality and language, you could get through this. I watched A Clockwork Orange when I was a teenager and hated it because I felt that Kubrick was trying to make me sympathize with Alex, before watching Irreversible, I re-watched A Clockwork Orange and realized I missed the whole message of the film. It wasn't about Alex, but our society and I have the greatest admiration for the film now. Irreversible shows how we can go from hating someone to understanding their position to rooting for them. Are we the animals? Irreversible will have you thinking for days, this is a film I will never forget.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more than the sum of its shocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for film-world hype--always have been, and probably always will be. When I stumble across a film that is so controversial it inspires both gasps of horror and cheers of praise, I flock to it. There is something intriguing about film's capacity to house unpleasantness, and just how far a director will go in conveying his message (it's always interesting to see whether or not they have a justified reason for the excess). "Irreversible," the backward-structured film from French shock auteur Gaspar Noe ("I Stand Alone") spins you out of control with as much regularity as his camera and characters will allow. It's a curious piece of work designed to provoke the audience--at the beginning, you're disoriented and confused (and, if you're like me, getting carsick from the deliberately erratic camera movements), and even repulsed by the actions of the unfamiliar characters hassling the patrons of a seedy homosexual club, a sequence that ends with a ghastly murder. Okay, then, so what? Clearly the rest of the movie is going to give us an explanation...but would the film have had a similar effect if it were told in a straightforward manner? Is the backward motion of "Irreversible" just a gimmick used by Noe (who is not immune from snobbery and pretension) to draw attention to his film? It's hard to say. Personally, I reject the notion of the reverse storyline being used as a gimmick, simply because of how deliberately the previous pieces fit (certain passages of dialog, particularly a discussion of orgasms that serves as a prelude to one of the most horrifying rape scenes in film history); Noe certainly wasn't asleep in his construction of the film. "Irreversible" displays the type of oppressive misanthropy (the dialog is loaded with racial and homophobic slurs) evidenced in Noe's "I Stand Alone" (the tale of an out-of-work butcher driven to madness by everyone around him), but then pulls back from the hard-edged violence to show a tender humanity that might be even more startling, since the film could have easily played itself for nothing but shock value the entire time. "Irreversible" is an unsettling conundrum that guides us through the highs and lows of the human condition--it pushes buttons of morality, shows in graphic detail what others would only suggest, and brings us out the end of the tunnel exhausted, invigorated, and breathless. A stunning film, somewhat hampered by its excessive dialog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brutal depiction of life that will make you question the nature of cinema and entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Gasper Noe is no stranger to controversy as his film prior to Irreversible ended up being censored for its containment of real, albeit blurred, porn images. The genius behind Irreversible then is the way in which it cleverly defies censorship through unfolding the action backwards and in single, uninterrupted takes forcing the audience to witness a climactic and terrifying beginning set against an almost optimistic and happier end. The plot of the film is purely and simply a 'rape and revenge' tale, with the crucial difference being that it is filmed in reverse. This means that after a bizarre, seemingly unrelated conversation between two men, the camera dizzyingly moves out of the window to the Rectum nightclub below, opening the film with the lead character, Marcus (Vincent Cassel) being led away by the police. Moments later, we see the horrifically brutal act of violence that led to his arrest, then Marcus discovering the badly beaten body of his wife Alex (Monica Bellucci), followed by the deeply shocking and powerful nine-minute central scene in which Alex is horrifically attacked both mentally and physically, anally-raped and then brutally beaten after she tragically walks through a subway underpass. This, admittedly, is extremely uncomfortable to sit through and there were numerous reports of walkouts when the film screened at both the Cannes and Edinburgh film festivals. However, the structure of the film means that, perversely and paradoxically, Noe provides his film with a happy ending, since the film leaves us with beautifully intimate and sometimes humorous scenes involving Alex and Marcus as lovers in bed whilst Alex discovers she is pregnant. Visually, the film is extremely impressive as the swooping camera relentlessly follows the actors, plunging us into a world of horrific nightmares and sexual depravity. The fact that the camera never cuts away with each scene lasting up to ten minutes long means that the audience is never given any space to breath and cannot escape the reality of what is happening before us. Similarly, Cassel, Bellucci and Dupontel as their mutual friend, are exceptional through their immensely tender, naturalistic and no doubt-improvised dialogue. The reversal effect of the film is both technically and mentally stunning as the audience in its position of safety and authority examines and replays the films unfolding with a deeper understanding and resonance for the tragedy and horror on screen. The film is undoubtedly an unusual and unique cinematic experience that forces you to examine the way in which you experience a film and indeed your reactions to it. Films like Irreversible, Requiem for a Dream and Ma Soeur force us to consider the question of whether we can ever truly enjoy watching such harrowing films when they appear perhaps too realistic in their depiction of a brutal life. Some might argue that a film which conveys such disturbing images of extreme physical violence and rape must have something redeeming about it in order for the film to be constructed as a worthwhile cinematic experience. Certainly when talking about such controversial films as Irreversible and Requiem for a Dream, it is impossible to say you liked them yet they remain powerful and thought provoking nonetheless. What can we say about it other than it is a film that captures the incapability of fate and consequence, underlying how we are all susceptible to time's destruction. A controversial film yes, but one that is sure to get people into a dialogue into the nature of cinema and entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging and unsuccessful but worth seeing as part of experiencing the diverse world of cinema and creativity, pleasant or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his girlfriend Alex is brutally raped in an underpass, boyfriend Marcus and Alex's ex-boyfriend Pierre are approached by a couple of criminal types who claim to know who did it and lead Marcus on the path to revenge via hookers and a man in a brutal gay club known as the Rectum.I shan't waste my time or yours by writing more of a plot to this film than that because this is all quite thin stuff. Normally I find myself gradually engaged by a film as it develops characters and stories however with Irréversible I was gripped immediately but the effect worked in reverse, just like the film. Others have asked why this film is told backwards, with some waxing lyrical about the film demonstrating the nature of actions and consequences. I don't buy this and I almost believe that the film is structured this way because Noé knows that his film is not good enough to engage the audience with the development of the story and characters to the point where they would still care by the end. Whereas, by starting with his biggest and most impacting sequences he has preventing the audience thinking "this is going nowhere" by putting us right where it is going to.Of course what this means is that the film genuinely has nowhere to go to because the developmental issue is still there ? albeit the need to see roots rather than branches. With this there is nothing and I felt myself becoming more and more disappointed with the film as it went on as it seemed to offer nothing but missed potential. Unlike Memento (which was a thriller with the reason being to find out what caused the end), Irréversible's ending is an act of violence and revenge that, in essence occurs out of bad fortune rather than a series of events that are worth holding out for. With this in mind the focus comes more on the characters and their relationships to find a reason to make the impacting opening to the film feel that much more impacting. Sadly it does fall down and despite some interesting stuff that might have gone somewhere (if not to the actual crime), themes of sexual intimacy, differences in men and women and so on are just suggested but never delivered upon and my interest and respect for the film waned frighteningly quickly.It is a terrible shame because the film had initially won me over quickly. With the first shots of spinning camera, "irrelevant" men and disorientating delivery I prepared myself to hate this film and slate it for being pretentious. This feeling didn't subside much as we were thrown into a gay club ending with an intensely brutal scene of violence that quite sickened me. The reason for this is almost the following scene where we see the beautiful and classy Alex brutally and meaninglessly sodomised on the floor of a dirty underpass for no other reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time and the wrong sex. With my eyes at the time I found these scenes to be quite brilliant but finding out later there was nothing beyond them I take a dimmer view. In his defence, Noé's sequences should not be mentioned in the same breath as the recent Holly wood trend for torture porn because there is nothing erotic here. The rape scene in particular is disturbing, sickening and based on violence, certainly not sex, attraction or arousal. Some comments on IMDb have disturbed me and shown that some people will still "enjoy" these scenes ? one particular comment saying "fans of rape movie will appreciate" the sequence I felt was in particular poor taste. However for me it is as effective as it is unpleasant, Noé does not adopt the angles, style or nudity of pornography and indeed leaves the camera on the floor and lets the actors deliver an experience that is undeniably cruel and wrong. Viewers who chose to get off on that will do so however for those of us not stimulated by the violent degradation of another the effect will be harrowing.The cast are good where they are caught up in things. Cassel is convincing in his revenge scenes but has less to work with in the later (earlier) scenes. Likewise Bellucci is amazing in her key scene; utterly convincing and heart-wrenching in her agony and I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to shoot. Dupontel is interesting but his performance would have benefited from going from innocence to violence and not the other way round. Prestia is a convincing human version of Satan, who is sickeningly real. Noé's direction is impressive even if his ability as writer is not. His camera earlier on matches the frantic violent mood of his characters but gradually calms down. Quite what he is saying with where the film goes or how it ends is beyond me but by then he had done sufficiently little to convince that I shouldn't worry myself too much.Overall an impacting "experience" film that starts out with the potential to be a challenging and difficult art film. However with nothing past these scenes of significant value, the backward telling just seems like a way of having the "big" scenes before losing the audience, rather than afterwards and for all my appreciation and admiration for his intense and creative technique as director, I found Noé the writer to be lacking. In summary I'm not sure if I liked this or not or if it is worth seeing but it is certainly an experience that should be seen by those looking for a diverse taste of cinema whether it is "enjoyable" or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was ever a film that made you want to take a shower afterwards, this is it. I felt dirty, and upset, and confused, but mostly disgusted. Within the first twenty minutes, we witness some various depravities at a gay S&amp;M club called The Rectum, a man get his head crushed in by a fire extinguisher, and a she-male prostitute being assaulted at knife point. Within the following twenty minutes, we see a woman getting savagely raped and beaten for ten plus minutes. The trick here is, we see these events backwards. Like MEMENTO, Christopher Nolan's brilliant 2000 film, IRREVERSIBLE has a reverse chronology. So really, the depravity and beatings I mentioned are really the end of the film, and the beginning is the end. The story revolves around Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Alex (Monica Belluci), a young couple who are deeply in love. She is the woman who was raped and beaten, and Marcus spends the first (last) half of the movie seeking revenge, with his best friend and her ex-lover Pierre (Albert Dupontel) in tow. The first half of the film is extremely tough to get through. The scenes in the gay bar and Alex's rape seem to never end, and we're forced to take in some truly disgusting sights. The man who is killed with the fire extinguisher suffers the no-exaggeration most violent death in film history. I'm not sure quite how the effect was done, but it made me cringe, and I've seen it all. Usually, in scenes where people are beaten to death, we see quick cuts of their bloody face, followed by some shots of the attacker from the back as they do their deed. Here, director Gaspar Noe keeps the camera stationary, right next to the victim's head. It's an amazing shot, but one that will deeply disturb me the rest of my days. By the end of the film, things are more pleasant, but a great sense of melancholy still covers the scene because we know what's going to happen later. The ultimate goal of the film proves not to be a violent exploitation piece but a portrayal of the tragic crime of rape. I can't, in good conscience, recommend this film. It's too disturbing, and what's more, features some of the most nauseating camera-work I've ever seen. I don't have a problem, per se, with trick photography, but I'd like it to have a point. The camera moves underneath people, a couple stories above them, and sometimes just spins around and around in a stationary position. There's a shot at the end (beginning) of a spinning lawn sprinkler, with a child running around it, while the camera spins like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, as operated by a crack fiend. In the end, I understand what the film wanted to do, and I respect it. But there are subtler ways to make a point, and when you're going to use the most graphic images ever put on film, you'd better have a stronger and more oblique message than 'Rape is bad.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE KIDS!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's so much I could say about this movie but I will attempt to keep this short. First off the popular argument is whether this constitutes pornography or not. Some argue that because of the rape scene and it's visual no holds barred intensity it does. The supreme court says that pornography is any medium that causes sexual thought and has no artistic merit. The problem with this definition is that what constitutes art or artistic merit is never defined. Since artistic merit cannot be judged on with an objective opinion, because no opinion is objective then the whole issue gets whitewashed. To say it is pornography is up to each individual viewer along witth the understanding that that does not dictate whether or not it actually constitutes pornography. There's also the unanswered question of who should it cause sexual thought to. I don't know about you but I'm not thinking about shampoo when I see those Hebal Essence commercials, which are advertising and theoretically have no artistic mer it.Beyond all the hulaboo and philosophy I pose the question: Why is pornography always conotated as bad? What's so wrong with mediums of pointless sloppy sex with no regard to supposed high minded ideals?Now with all that behind I'd like to move on to the movie. The first notably thing about the movie is the spinning camera that helps make this movie far more confrontational and challenging to the average movie goer than either the rape or the violence in the movie. I believe that the spinning is the reason for the numerous walk outs. I think if pulp fiction would have spun the camera as wildly there would have been just as many walkouts on that. I see the function of the spinning camera as the movies way of telling us that things just can spin out of control, and i'm sure that most audience would have gotten it quite early on and the technique could have been dropped. This movie does not want to let off the audience that easily.The rape scene is another example of this. Going with this movie's very dark pessimistic view on human nature both in and out of the film this movie dares you with the hands down most graphically violent thing I've ever seen on film and the most unblinking nauseating rape scene ever. This movie practically dares you not just to look at the train wreck with an air of disconnected distance but to actually go right up and examine the bodies of the victims for yourself. While most people harbor the morbid capabilities to watch a car wreck from the safety of their car window or watch a war from the safety of their living room television, most would not prefer to be in the war or at the wreck as a coroner. This movie holds up that hypocracy and dumps all over you.This movie very much reminds me of a movie that might have been shown to Alex during his "treatment" in A Clockwork Orange. With or without drugs this movie might have nauseated him. Save for rapist, misogynist, masochists, and the occasional pedophile I can think of no average human being who could find the rape scene in the least bit appetizing let alone sexually desirable.The warmth of the late scenes would have been quite a touching movie in and of themselves had we not known the beginning. Compared to the romantic comedies and melodramas we are usually fed by Hollywood, these have a certain touching authenticity to them. In this movie overiding agenda of pessimism one valid point is overlooked. Time heals all wounds that time creates. I give it 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible is a movie I have to comment after the difficult Antichrist, because they are often compared to one another due to their level of violence. It makes us wonder how much graphic violence a film needs and whether it is justified or even necessary.For me Irreversible was even more difficult to watch and to endure than Antichrist. Maybe because the violence was so meticulously lifelike. But the movie is exceptionally well conceived and composed - I can almost say that its level of violence is justified.The story line is told in reverse (similar to Memento) starting with the end and going back to the beginning. Irreversible - The title condemns it to alarming finality: you can't undo it, can't change anything anymore because it already happened.The movie begins with an extreme event which is portrayed in an almost unbearable and infernal way. The suspense is increased by every scene leading backwards in the chain of events in order to see what caused it. Sometimes it's more interesting to know the cause of something than the event itself. This cause-and-effect chain is shown like a vicious cycle of violence in reverse: the scenes become calmer and more positive as the movie goes back in time.The strong impression of this movie is amplified by the general knowledge that we are watching something that already happened and not something that has the hope of an uncertain future.It ends with a beginning that is so beautiful and peaceful like Heaven. Like all beginnings or blank canvases: everything is possible. But for those who saw the movie it's clear that it's an illusion because we know what will happen. The movie ends with the sentence: Time destroys everything. We're left alone with this sentence to reflect on what it means in the movie and in general. How can something good lead to something bad? Are all our lives leading from Heaven to Hell?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid and Pretentious *minor spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gaspar Noe's "I Stand Alone" was brilliant, but this film is stupid, disgusting, and pretentious. The story plays out in achronological order, like in "Memento", from graphic murder, through the unrelenting rape and beating that instigated it, to earlier happy times in an attempt to provide an explanation about predestination, but the result isn't real motivation, it's simply a pat attempt to justify the atrocities. The camera movement at the beginning is so disorienting that it's difficult to follow the action, though it grinds to a halt to vividly show both rape and murder. This is a film that revels in it's excess, but is too cowardly to admit that it's exploitation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This very suffocating film is by far the most brutal and graphic piece of work done in a long time. Although the camera work is technically excellent it is overshadowed by the savage scenes which surround it; from the moment Pierre smashes a mans skull and brain to jelly with a fire extinguisher you realize that this inhuman film ranks up there with the most vile and grim ones around. If this seen was not gut- wrenching enough then the very disturbing rape scene that followed simply made the last scene look average. The director's goal was to make the viewer feel as uncomfortable as possible but at the same time make you really understand. Each time the 'Tenia' is shown brutally raping his victim (Monica Belluci) you find it unbearable to watch, smartly the director may use another camera view so that you see less. You might then think it's over and you feel a sign of relief-wrong. Immediately you are thrown right back into the deep end and you begin to drown in her pain and terrible suffering as this very sick and deranged predator keeps going. At times I actually questioned whether it was in my right to watch this, am I watching this because I enjoy watching or am I so disgusted and surprised by the tragedy that I need to know the full extent. For whatever reason there is the director definitely gained my utmost sympathy for this woman and triggered my rage and anger for this rapist. What struck me even more was the fact that after you suffer this scene, which seems to last forever the 'Tenia' then goes on to severely beat his victim to a pulp- how nice as if she had not suffered enough. I could tell you of the brilliant filmwork or the brilliant acting by Vincent Cassel (La Haine, Doberman) and Monica Belluci (The Passion of the Christ, The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions) but we the viewer are simply engulfed by the sadistic atrocities that are the sad highlight of this film. I will say that if you really want to find the hatred within yourself against cold blooded killers and rapists then this film will trigger it. I wouldn't recommend this film to someone in a conversation about films unless the very highly unlikely scenario of rape surfaced. Despite this I wish you could see this film just to understand the full extent of the harsh encounters people have in life, and even if you can't fully watch then only glimpses will do the damage. The background music just to mention is quite daunting and further enhances the surreal and uncomfortable atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film only once. It needs multiple viewings, I feel, to fully appreciate it's merit. This is something that will come in time but I felt it was only right to comment after my first impression. I instantly gave the film 10 out of 10, not because I overly enjoyed it (nigh on impossible) but because it shook me, at times, to my very core and affected me in a way that I cannot easily or fully describe. I can honestly say Irreversible is the most devastating piece of cinema I've ever witnessed. This isn't solely due to it's shocking content but more so the production as a whole and how it has been constructed and packaged. It truly is a work of art. Camera-work, lighting, colour (primarily gaudy, striking tones of red and orange) all combine in an unforgettable amalgam of brilliance. Featuring towering performances from Cassel, Belluci and Dupontel the film lurches backward in time depicting the events of a truly tragic night in the lives of three friends. Alex (Belluci) is brutally raped on her way home from a party and Marcus (Cassel) and Pierre (Dupontel) set off determined to wreak vengeance on the perpetrator. However, that is merely the plot. Admittedly quite a simple premise but the way it is played out is unforgettable. This is a film that everyone should and arguably needs to see as it is, for me, a milestone of modern cinema. Raw and unflinching, can you stomach it?</fullReview>

Worst of all, the filmmaker uses every trick in the book to toy with your emotions. Does it advance the story to make the woman pregnant? No. It only gives the viewer a heightened sense that the forthcoming event is going to be excruciating horrible. Does it advance the story to make the victim extremely beautiful and free spirited? Of course not. Yet Noe knows how that this, too, will affect the viewer. What about the couple in bed before the party foreshadowing their own fate? This trick is used to bring the viewer out of the bliss that they have been experiencing for the last 30 minutes or so and draw your attention back to the rape.If I am supposed to learn anything from this movie, I don't know what it is. Watch it if you want to see something excruciatingly horrible, but not anything new or original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the rarest film I've ever seen in my life. I can understand that sometimes this film is quite hard to put up with it, specially the outrageous Monica Bellucci's rape scene and I can understand too that many people, above all women, left the cinema. Needless to say this film is neither a porno movie nor tasteless sequences screened as if they tendon,t make sense. Lots of readings can be extracted after its showing. What might have gone on if the couple hadn't argued each other? Our life is not always the same as ever, could change a lot depending on occasions. Maybe our future is written in spite of not being aware of it. The performances are quite convincing: Monica Bellucci is a lot more than a pretty face and a stunning body and this transgressive film is going to introduce her to stardom ( I hardly ever imagine an actress so conventional, for example, Julia Roberts played a role like this). The men roles center on her but from my point of view Vincent Cassel's character is a bit upset and overacts at times opposite Albert Dupontel's which is calm and sensible to fly into a rage in a fortunately "politicatelly incorrect" ending. It is certainly a good movie, it's worth seeing unless you've got some preconceived ideas against out-of-the-way movies like this one.

		<shortDescription>A Film Of Two Halves Which Will Polarise The Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came in to this film knowing all about the hype that surrounded it . " Truly stomach churning ... I had to walk out of the theater... I've never seen anything like it in my life " . It's impossible to view this film for the first time with an open mind . Interestingly enough everyone comments on the violence while there's little written on the fact the story is told in reverse chronological order . Perhaps if IRREVERSIBLE was shot in a conventional way few people would consider it so controversial and brutal and challenging ? I'm sure this would have been the case Imagine for a moment Gasper Noe hadn't copied Christopher Nolan's style with MOMENTO ( And to be honest Nolan hadn't invented this style because " reverse editing storytelling " had been done as far back as the silent era ) and told the story in chronological order . We'd have opened with a metaphysical quote that " Time destroys everything " , ( I'll leave it to you to decide what this means if anything ) This is followed by children playing in the park , Alex reading a book , Alex going home with a pregnancy test kit , Alex finding out she's pregnant . How long would it be before the audience start to ask themselves where all this might be going ? If the story had been constructed this way it would have led to all sorts of problems , not least that there's very little going on plot wise . Adjectives like " nauseating " could also accurately describe the cheesy love triangle making up the bulk of the film . It could be argued that the reverse chronology makes it easier to empathise with Alex's rape because if we'd seen her wearing a mini-dress some people might have thought she deserved it , but I hope this isn't the case . No one deserves that As for the rape itself would it be sacrilege to say I've seen worse ? Certainly I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is a film that is far more stomach churning when it comes to rape . Unlike that film however IRREVERSIBLE does have a style and a merit to it . Especially during the opening half hour where Markus and Pierre charge in to The Rectum and the audience are shown one of the most remarkable , shocking and disorientating sequences ever seen in recent cinema . Again though you have to ask why do the cops tell Pierre that he's going down for ten years ? Surely the violence was justified to stop Markus from being raped ? Again there's a problem with the plotting because does it seem so credible that Markus and Pierre would have listened to the pimp who claims he'll find The Tapeworm for them if they give him money ? Is there a subtext to this ? Is Noe saying that revenge is more important than justice ? Your guess is as good as mine IRREVERSIBLE is a film you'll never forget . This is down to the opening half hour and has everything to do with style rather than content . When you switch off the DVD the next day and think about it then unfortunately things start to fall apart . It's also a film that will polarise the audience . If you're not sickened by the violence you'll be nauseated by the cheesy romantic aspects of the film or vice versa . All in all the use of reverse chronology is far more of a gimmick than what it was in MEMENTO</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too sicko for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not make it past the rape scene. That was was way too much to tell a story. It was one shot for what seemed like an eternity of a woman being violently raped in the rectum. This scene comes after a few sequences of a guy looking for a club called the Rectum... obvious in the first bit to be a homosexual club, of which the main character is trying to find because his woman was violently murdered. (and subsequently he also is violently murdered, at the beginning) I am not against any homosexual persons whatsoever, and I gave this movie a chance, but the seen with the woman being anally raped was just way too much. I had to actually shut it off and delete it from my hard drive (it was a purchased download). I am not weak of heart, weak of stomach, prudish or even religious, but that scene just really turned me off for the chance of seeing an actual story. Perhaps something happened later to redeem the movie, but I just couldn't keep watching it. Way too disturbing and violently gratuitous. Besides the "unsteady camera technique". Sorry, but this didn't have enough story to back the violence. I might have well have been watching a snuff film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated shock value, devoid of any real art, and not a particularly good film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is ugly, brutal, depressing, visceral, and hopeless. The first time I saw it, I was devastated. I reeled for days afterwards. But seeing it a 2nd time, I didn't care for it as much, in fact, I feel I've been had. Its impact is really felt the first time you see it, because seeing it the 2nd time, you realise a lot of things about it that aren't particularly good. Most of the dialogue is poor (most of it was improvised, and not very well), the violence of the film is purposely over the top, and Noe the director seems to delight in showing nasty stuff without really bringing a sense of art to it. He enjoys rubbing your face in the sleazy, horrific violence, but has no purpose other than saying "life is brutal". I can't deny that the film did have a great impact upon first viewing, but too often when one's sense are assaulted (like they are here), you can mistake that for great, artistic film-making. Technically, the film is astounding. It was shot mostly in long takes, but edited together with CGI effects (the smashing of the head in the gay bar at the beginning was done digitally, as part of the rape scene). It's definitely a curiosity, but realise what you're getting into. It's really not for the squeamish. The opening scene in the gay bar is dizzying and brutal, and the rape scene is beyond brutal. Noe films the rape scene in one take, which makes it even more difficult to watch. Is the film art? No, it isn't. Simply because the film polarized audiences doesn't make it art (a common assumption by people). Noe's films (he's only complete 2 features) aren't really deep or anything, just pessimistic and brutal.A telling episode about Noe happened a year or so ago. The IFC Theater in NYC has a feature they do occasionally. They bring in a filmmaker to introduce a film they admire. Noe showed his first film, I Stand Alone, and Pasolini's Salo. After Noe's film concluded, he talked to the audience on why he wanted to show Salo. All he talked about was the coprophilia scenes (aka the s**t eating scenes). He didn't talk about anything else that Salo had to offer (in terms of its message on fascism, sexual perversion, the cinematography, the production design). Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom is actually an excellent film. It's incredibly depressing and brutal, but has a real sense of art and is a genuinely controversial film, even to this day. Noe's films (he's made only 2) are not like this at all. Both I Stand Alone and Irreversible hit you in the face the first time you see them, but you shake it off, and Noe has nothing more to give you. This film has no resonance at all. It's just for shock value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most disgusting movies ever made. I can't understand why people like so much this movie. I found it absolutely horrible from beginning to end. There is nothing artistic in showing a women being brutally raped or how a man bash someone's face with a fire extinguisher. There is nothing artistic or beautiful in this film, it is just disgusting and nauseating. What a horrible,horrible film. Gaspar Noé is a terrible filmmaker, who only made sick and disgusting films, like this and "I Stand Alone". "Irreversible" is one of the worst movies I've ever saw. It was so bad as things as "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Caligula". I don't recommend it to anyone.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Usefulness highly questionable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe i've gotten too old for the kind of raw violence that is shown in this movie, or maybe i've seen too much of it myself.Movies are good in my opinion if they fulfill one of two criteria, and preferably both: A movie has to be either enjoyable or it has to be able to give you some perspective on something you didn't have before or at best an entirely new idea.Neither is the case here. Yes the world can be a horribly cruel and violent place - self destructive drug abuse, rape, manslaughter, murder. It's all there and plenty of it too. But why make or watch a movie that does nothing but wrap all those things up in 90 minutes in the course of one night? It so desperately tries to come across as thoughtful, innovative or even philosophical (camera panning and twisting until the brink of complete nausea) wanting to do disguise that it's nothing but a snuff-film.If you want to watch a good movie that deals with reverse chronology, watch Memento. If you want to see a good movie about cause and effect, watch Run Lola Run. If you want to feel bad and somewhat guilty for even staying with it to the end, watch this one I guess.Some might say that the acting in this one is excellent. That's debatable. If the quality of acting is only measured in authenticity, then yes, the entire cast does their job incredibly well.But is it a sign of integrity to agree to portray the role of a rapist, doing a several minute long, no-cut-scene rape that is so shockingly realistic that it's hard to watch? Is it a sign of integrity to agree to the role of the rape victim? I'm not sure, I'm not even sure what i'd do if I was offered the role. Probably hard to turn down, because after all, it's money lost if you turn it down.Nevertheless, this is far from a must-see. If you wanna see some authentic violence and an example of how horribly wrong things can go in just one night, sit down and "enjoy". In any other case, I suggest you stay away from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if you want to see pointless sequences of shocking sexual violence, you will love this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously. Just to be clear, I'm a fan of dark, depressing, disturbing, and shocking when it comes to films.Someone may find a little bit of redeeming value in this film, but it would have to be people who don't mind spending an hour and a half watching gore for gore's sake. I think the last straw for me was the rape scene in the tunnel. What woman with half a brain would take seriously a random hooker's advice that it is safer to walk around in an dark, dirty, secluded underground tunnel than to hail a taxi from a busy, well lit street?! Come on, this is such a crucial part of the movie, all the other gore, violence, visual and verbal filth are supposed to be justified because of this rape scene, so make it meaningful, not just gory. The entire movie revolves around this rape, and you get there and you are just like.... WTF. Everything, including this scene was acted out very well, there's no doubt about that. But why? Why is any of this happening? Why would any of this happen? I don't expect them to cover every possible plot hole, but if you want me to take this display of obscene reverse perversion seriously, at least TRY to make it believable, TRY to give it some meaning. And without that, the end(or should I say the beginning) is worthless and feels like it should belong to another movie. Another thing, as was touched on by other reviewers, is the whole depiction of gays. Apparently gays are all ravenous sex addicts whose sole objective at all times is to shove things in either their own anuses or any other anus they happen upon. Maybe we were just supposed to be exposed to a shockingly unique underground culture, but most of the dialogue and scenes outside of the "Rectum" club make this doubtful.The movie had the potential to be more than just a pointless gory orgy sick fest, but it didn't even bother to try. Don't see it. Especially if you are sick enough to enjoy it, please please don't see it... we don't need dangerously perverse people feeding their perversion and then running around in our society. Please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4:00AM on a weeknight. Just finished watching this fantastic french film. Philosophical with an outlook on time passage, destiny, the future and the past, this films is a series of relatively and seemingly long shots that tell a violent story in reverse order. Gaspar Noe is a revelation with flawless directing and fine flawed characters. His writing includes good dialogue, substance and many nuances and subtleties. The morning bedroom --&gt; kitchen --&gt; bedroom --&gt; bathroom --&gt; washroom --&gt; living room scene with Bellucci and Cassel is full of little things that enhance the experience with realism, flair and freshness.The film uses a lot of spiraling camera motion, as well as some pulsating light (and sound) and can be pretty dizzying. The one thing that is easy on the eyes is Monica Bellucci. As beautiful as she is however, it is difficult to watch the vicious rape scene that takes place.Nore plays with our emotions, with our minds, with our senses. A great filmmaker and a great film. Expect a demanding film, but do yourself a favour and don't miss out.What is time? What is time to us humans? These are the main questions this film asks. The only answer I have right now is : this movie is time well spent.</fullReview>

I believe it serves though to show people there is nothing sexy or attractive about rape. It is truly disgusting that there are people out there that think that. Do not watch this film if graphic violence,murder,and abuse bother you. This movie WILL make you think though.It shows that there is nothing to be solved through revenge. Who's to say what a person would or would not do if placed in this position though. I do not believe it anyone's place to judge unless they have been placed in that kind of situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will The Beauty Save The World?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of the film is simple: a woman (Monica Belucci) is brutally raped by a stranger; and her boyfriend (Vincent Cassel) and ex-boyfriend (Albert Dupontel) who are best friends set out for revenge. What is crucial, the story is told backward. The most obvious success for this film is the directing by Noe. He has crafted a nightmare that is both original and horrifying. If the inferno exists somewhere, one of its circles definitely looks like the "The Rectum" bar, and the other - like the underpass where Alex (Monica Belucci) was brutally sodomized and beaten for long nine minutes that seemed as an eternity. The pulsing score that accompanies the film contains, for the first sixty minutes, a constant 27-hertz tone specifically designed by Noé to cause nausea in the audience. It felt like someone was constantly drilling the holes in my head. The director creates the scenes of such pain and violence that makes "Natural Born Killers" look and feel like a puppet show. One of these is a scene where a man gets his head bashed in with a fire extinguisher with the camera never turned away and the sound is amplified. The movie shocks you, and then it goes and shocks you even more when there is no violence on the screen. I broke in tears during the bedroom scene - so much love, tenderness and desire Monica and Vincent had for each other. They did not know what was ahead; I did. In the end, one cannot help questioning the very fragile, illusory nature of happiness, how easy it is to destroy everything. Is it a blessing or curse not to know what lies ahead and not be able to change the future? Dostoevsky said almost hundred and fifty years ago that the Beauty will save the world. I don't know. Not this world. Not during my time.'Irreversible' is a shocking anti-violence film; one has to decide whether he or she wants to see it. I personally think it is a must see but I would not be surprised if a lot of viewers refuse. It took me a very long time to see it. I am glad I did.</fullReview>

It was disturbing because I couldn't help but get the feeling the director was objectifying Alex and the 'she deserved it' vibe was a bit too much.

		<shortDescription>A question to the positive reviewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To each and every reviewer who has used words like "invigorating," "genius," "breathtaking." To each reviewer who has said that the movie leaves you "breathless," or "feeling affirmed." To each reviewer who describes Noé's effort with Irreversible as "brilliant," "important," or "brave," I'd like those folks to honestly consider the following question: is there a part of you that gets off, as Noé so clearly does, on the sex and violence of this movie? Why is there an air of exhilaration in so many of these reviews? Noé wanted to get this rape scene on film and inflict it upon his audience. He threw in a depiction of what crushing a human skull with a fire extinguisher looks like. He didn't bother with a script or a thoughtful plot because that was less interesting to him. He wanted to get off, and get his audience off, on staging male sexual power and violence. How 'edgy', how 'dangerous' - how childish and dim. For those of us who don't get off on that, he wanted to give a clear and resounding "f#ck you." Here's what you need to know about this movie: Noé came up with idea of filming a nine minute rape scene, and thought he'd like to end that scene with the rapist stomping on the woman's face. He then filmed a movie around that *inspiration*. He must have decided at some point that he'd like to put a philosophical sheen on his work, so he planted these trite ideas: "time destroys everything," and "time is irreversible." Good grief.Exploitative, gratuitous, pretentious, hollow, and dehumanizing, in my very subjective opinion.PS: F#ck you too, Noé.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a fair shake. I knew the basic premise without reading many reviews. If you're looking for a pseudo graphic rape scene, it's in there. There are parts of the film that are even slightly touching. There were unresolved questions about the fate of the baby (unless I missed something, though I assumed) and the fate of the mother. The cinematography made me nauseated early on and it was unnecessary for it to be that choppy. It could have been a decent film, but the writing didn't support a plot told in reverse, and neither did the actors. Overall, I think the film Would have been more compelling with a well thought out plot - whether in reverse or in chronological order. Also, I personally like all ends of a story tied up - that includes the fate of Alex and her baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why this film went over your head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****If you haven't seen the film, watch it, you'll learn something. You'll gain something from within yourself, maybe previously untouched. And then come back and read this review. But form your own opinion before reading the jacking of some other nit-wit's opinion****The juxtaposition of our two main "protagonists"; Pierre's intellect and studious refinement versus the brash, hyper-masculinity of Marcus reacting as two polarizing entities thinly tethered to one another by their feminine interest, but ensues complete anarchy when that binding is snapped.This is important as you recall the beginning of the film, the way which Pierre bashes the "fag's" head in while in defense of Marcus and for resisting his commands to stop jerking himself off. At the time, it is perceived as meaninglessly, excessive violence, but later on- while you develop a clearer sense of the character- you realize the act of Pierre's violence after declarations of pacifism, remorse, and grief was his transition into the exhibit which he studied from behind the philosophical glass for so many years - which is a quality of his as being foretold by Alex detailing their sexual experiences. The impulsiveness of the action seems uncharacteristic to his general complex, but given the circumstances, it occurred, and thus he was carried away guilty, in handcuffs, while Marcus was in a stretcher. You see this transition as witnessed over time, bringing us back to the quote of "Time destroys everything". In this film, through extraordinarily graphic and foul events, you witness the destruction of a marriage, relationship, beauty, life, and it causes you to reflect on the possibilities and potentials pertaining to you and all of human life.You can exact so much from this film, socioeconomically, morally, it just requires some thought and grasping subject matter that is rather raw and generally abstract to the average person. For those who call this "trash", well, art is subjective and you're really only proving the point. These characters are not unrealistic, these events are not unusual, and it has a point. Bear witness to the world in which you live.8/10</fullReview>

I watched it because of the IMDb rating, I knew nothing about the movie other than it was foreign (and very often they're very good:sadly this one wasn't). The producers and directors have experimented with an approach that has failed miserably. Dizzying/unstable camera-work that makes you nauseous (so I fast- forwarded it to 40 mins) and a story told backwards for no apparent reason other than to appeal to the arty farty and entice people to go and see it. Of course this isn't really the case, because when they show a scene it actually runs forwards, a bit like writing an essay with 10 paragraphs and then ordering them in descending sequence, thus: paragraph 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, however the words and sentences of each paragraph are not reversed otherwise they'd be playing the movie in reverse, though I guess if they did that it wouldn't make any difference for this movie. Unlike the 'Benjamin Button' movie, this approach in Ireversible is a miserable failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately for my tastes it lies much closer to perversion than to art. To some viewers they will try to mask the gratuitous amounts of violence and sexual perversions contained in this movie as a sort of 'tool'. Yes it will leave you desolate, alone, the director practically rapes your eyes and mind, however as for me, I did NOT think it was necessary to see Monica Belucci get anally pounded for 12 minutes on screen. Also the homosexual club was truly hellish, and the guy who they kill (wrong guy OOPS) death scene was not "awesome" it was hellish, I actually half turned my face in horror it was so well done, and that's saying something since there's very few scenes in movies that scare me.However when the whole movie unwinds, there is no momentous twist, or grand revelation, or big understanding or underlying themes that come together. The movie is very straightforward, 3 people obsessed with sex go to a party, where one of them does cocaine, the other obviously still has feelings for the girl. She's pregnant. The two walk out of the party to cool off (mainly Vincent) at this time Monica Belucci is raped and beaten for 12 minutes in an under passage. When Vincent hears of this he goes on a rampage through France's seedy underbelly of hookers, she-males, and gay S&amp;M clubs until they reach the wrong guy and kill him. That's it. It's this momentous let down that I score this movie a 5. It felt like low grade porn with some mild action at the end. The interesting lighting and camera work elevate this movie beyond porn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost A Masterpiece?.But Not Quite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is of the violent vigilantism genre. I think to elaborate on the storyline further would spoil the film, because it is not knowing what is happening that makes the film what it is.It is a very good film, but not quite a great one. Why not? Firstly, because the film is effectively played in reverse, you spend parts of the viewing time wondering what on earth is going on - and in a frustrating "lost" way rather than a captivated "held in suspense" way. It is not until near the end that you realise why the characters have been behaving as they have. Also, characters pop up out of nowhere - this has the effect of, at times, going beyond curiosity to create sheer frustration. (Personally, I thought Tarantino's concept of starting the movie in the middle (Reservoir Dogs) was more effective - it created two intriguing questions: what happened before and what happened after? You then got to see the beginning, followed by the end. THAT worked perfectly.) Secondly, rather like I Stand Alone (another Gaspar Noe effort) the violence is gratuitous and excessive. I am not easily shocked or prudish but was it really necessary for the graphic rape scene to last several minutes? There are other violent scenes that also go on for an unrealistically long time - the beatings dished out would, in reality, kill people long before they die in this film. What is the purpose of this? However, I am emphasising the negatives. Don't let this put you off. While frustrating at times, the film being played in reverse is what makes it so brilliantly thought-provoking and thrilling - it's a real brain teaser working it out. Overall, this is a riveting, brilliantly acted and original production. It's a worthy additional to anyone's collection. It's also a great display of how we can jump to the wrong conclusions about people by making snap judgements. The victims aren't victims, and the bad guys aren't bad at all!

Although Ms Bellucci does get to act a little bit, mostly she is little more than a prop. I don't shy away from gore, violence or emotional terror for that matter; it's all ACTING and it drives many great films. This is not one of them.The word "gratuitous" is terribly overused, but here it applies. Even if one tries to watch this as "art for art's sake", there is little redemption for the movie. The shots alternately leave people out of frame who should be in, and then go wide enough to make me ask myself if the director was drunk or just bad, or both.Why this film exists is a mystery. It is set in reverse order, but if it was rearranged normally it would still be a vacuous waste of the viewer's time. I want my 93 minutes back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the director is talented and imaginative: telling a story backwards and only with 1 single shot is great, but it needs a story: when he says that the script is only 4 pages (and he doesn't tell how big the letters are written), you see the result on screen.It's only gratuitous violence and nudity! I'm not prude or censor but what's the point filming such difficult moments for anything and with such care? It ranks with "5 x 2" for the sexual contents and "Silent Hill" for the "planned" pain in my list of useless movies.It's a pity because the director (who really mumbles on his commentary!) has something to say: going from hell (a sad end) to paradise (a happy beginning) in reverse is a strong experience for the audience: imagine "Titanic" or "World Trade Center" like this! I agree with him with the blindness and deafness of injustice: sometimes, whatever you do, you choose, you are doomed! And that's because we have limited time here, that we should act for the "Good".His camera-work is imaginative and artistic (see the poster of 2001 and the birth of colors).And with all that plus a fine cast (Bellucci, Cassel, Dupontel), he only delivers this?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Irreversible Movie Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Noé's 'Irreversible is a backward-moving story, a little on the lines of Nolan's 'Memento' but the story is told in the form of an account that is traced back, in steps, to the start. The hand-held camera-work, minimal use of background score, the excellent screenplay and naked portrayal of the events creates a chill and it tackles some very adult themes with explicit rawness. In the beginning one might feel disoriented due to the seemingly out-of-control camera-work but a few moments in, we can understand that it is the characters who are out of control. First Marcus and then Pierre who commits the brutal murder.The violent scenes are pretty graphic. I didn't find the infamous 'fire-extinguisher scene' very disturbing. It was the rape scene that really bothered me. In my opinion, rape is one of the most disgusting and degrading things a human being can commit. Filmed in one single shot (without the use of music), this scene is horrifying and looks eerily real and it gets more frustrating when a passer-by witnesses the horror but chooses to walk away. While many have complained that 'Irreversible' shows homosexual men in a negative light, I don't think Noé's intention was to show that gay people are 'bad' and with 'loose morals'. I think it was to imply that rape is more about power than sex. The rapist was gay but he kept mentioning how 'high class' she was, thinking she was 'better' than the rest. The club scene in the beginning was to show that the rapist was deranged and sadistic. There is also a lot of racism and homophobia especially displayed through Marcel.Performances are solid and very natural. Dupontel's Pierre seems like the laidback person we might know in our circle of friends but his internal rage is explicitly brought forth in the 'fire-extinguisher' scene. While Cassel's Marcel seems more like the one with violence tendencies, it is Pierre who commits the ultimate act of revenge (and defense). Both actors do an excellent job. One might recognize shades of 'La Haine's Vinz in Cassel's Marcel but I doubt that any other actor would have done a better job. Monica Bellucci delivers one of her finest works as she is outstanding as Alex. I think her strong Italian accent in American films may have prevented her performances from being appreciated but here she speaks French quite well and plays a strong, mature, very feminine and intelligent woman of an Italian background. Her cries in 'the scene' haunts the viewer long after the film's end.But 'Irreversible' is Noé's achievement as he wonderfully puts it all together. There's plenty of shock value but this isn't some mondo film as there's a humanity to it that makes it more frightening. The scenes that follow after the 'rape' e.g. in the party, in the metro, and so forth, makes the experience more heartbreaking. It tackles a lot of relevant themes like the human condition, how one seemingly simple decision can change one's life, the 'bottomless pit'. He also brings forth a lot of stereotype and prejudice that exist in society. Example: when the medics shout that a prostitute had been attacked. It certainly is not a movie that I'd recommend to everyone, certainly not to those in search of popcorn entertainment but it's a superb film that should be watched by those who appreciate cinema. While one feels a sadness for the fate of the characters as the film ends, the final flicking screen is like 'a hard blow to the stomach'. It isn't merely a film, it's an experience and not a pleasant one. Once the film starts, it's difficult to watch and hard to not watch. The tag-line states: Le temps détruit tout...yes, time does have the power of destruction. Don't miss it if you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is pretty infamous by now because of its content, it would always be one of the first to come up whenever I read about disturbing films on the internet, and three words: fire, extinguisher, and rape, are always mentioned in the same sentence as the film's title.It pains me to say it, but beyond the controversial and shocking scenes, this film really doesn't have much to offer. The film is not in chronological order, it goes backwards, but I'm not sure this was such a good idea. A similar thing was done in "Memento". In that film it was done for two main reasons: to make us see it from the main character's perspective, and also to emphasise the twists and turns in the plot. Irreversible does neither of these things. The reason for it is to make us see how their lives were ruined, before these things actually happen to them, but I think it's there more for style reasons and to make the film stand out.Once you strip away the style, there is very little substance to this film. The all-over-the-place camera along with the strange noise in the background during the "Rectum" scene, was genuinely unsettling. Add in one of the most brutally violent attacks I've seen in a film and you have a disturbing scene. The rape scene is also disturbing, but overall this is a very thin idea stretched out over 90 minutes. This can be seen in the final 40 or so minutes. Once the rape scene is over, that seems to be almost all the film has to offer, and the rest of the film is just a lot of improvised acting from the actors, which must have been fun to make, but is not terribly exciting or compelling.Every scene in this film goes on way too long, the rape scene is too long, and every single scene after it also goes on too long. One of the few things I did like was the end scene, but that couldn't redeem the whole film.The whole concept behind the film is that this girl is raped, and her boyfriend takes revenge on the attacker. This isn't enough to make a 90 minute film out of, and while it's well acted by everyone, it amounts to little more than its controversial scenes overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most homophobic film in every way - barely a spoiler - just gay bashing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a hatred of gay men in virtually every frame of this film. Some of it is on the top layer, but the majority of it lies just underneath. It's clearly written by a heterosexual bully, and deals with outdated film stereotypes, but creates new ones, disgusting ones. The movie plot is also full of sh*t regarding gay men, and none of it is even close to reality. Not only would the centerpiece of the film (a rape) hinge on a machismo guy trading one hooker for our whore heroine, we are supposed to believe he is primarily a gay anal rapist. This makes the entire plot point simply a lazy excuse to start the film off (end up) in a gay S&amp;M sex club to make it as shocking as possible.I have been to every type of sex club there is, first hand, and although I do not partake in S&amp;M I believe everyone has a right to their sexual freedom as long as no one gets hurt. There is a constant barrage of false imagery as they go through this club, gay men do not even remotely ever behave in this way, regarding real violence, although sex club behavior and general piggishness would still be shocking to most people. It's not the sex or the dress, it's the brazen witnessing of real true violence and no one even appearing the least bit phased by it, and even masturbating to it. Stereotypes of the "gay man bottom" running around screaming for anyone to please put their fist or anything into their "rectum" in exchange for information is an insult. Yes Virginia, gay S&amp;M clubs exist, but readers please understand, this is not simply an exaggerated look - this is complete and utter nonsense meant only to shock you and to use the mock-depravity of gay male sodomy to disgust you down to the last thought. Rape wasn't enough. Bisexual psychopaths who anal rape both sexes equally? It's barely evident in real crime.And to add the final insult - the director himself was afraid of being accused of being homophobic - he is - he returned to the S&amp;M club to film HIMSELF as the masturbating man witnessing one of the most violent deaths (discussion point) filmed.It's lighting is too dark to often see important information, and the opening soundtrack is deliberately culled from vibration sounds meant to trigger nausea and vertigo in the viewer. So he arrogantly wanted to insure people would walk out of the theater, so he basically "drugs" the audience into getting sick with the soundtrack, Between that and himself masturbating in his own film, it isn't worth it. Full disclosure: I am a film fan of controversial films and I seek them out to see when the intersection of story, cinematography, and shock make for a truly adrenaline experience. Salo, A Serbian Film, Audition - these are disturbing stories you watch at your own risk. Skip this homophobic garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure if this contains spoilers but I ticked the box in case...This is my first review - I signed up specifically to review this film after skimming it on video. There is not much that hasn't been covered in the other reviews so I will just share my thoughts.So glad that I didn't watch this on the BIG screen. Well done, to the director for prompting this reaction. They say that art should provoke and sometimes make you feel uncomfortable and... and there you have it. This did, but for what point? I don't believe that the director was trying to illustrate the depths of depravity and cruelty that certain members of society resort to, which he did to full effect.Of course, "any publicity is good publicity", so I have merely fanned the flames by condemning this movie.Do we really have to endure the full duration of the prolonged rape scene? We get the picture... Couldn't the camera have faded out and faded back in again to create the illusion of longevity? He could have faded in and out 10 times and made it seem even longer...Enough has been said about the fire extinguisher scene. It's just graphically gratuitous but for what purpose? I have to say that I found the whole movie very realistic and believable but I can go to a gay bar myself if all I need is realism for realism's sake.I watched this movie to see 2 of my favourite actors - Bellucci and Cassel. I am somewhat bemused and disappointed that they have condoned this movie by actually starring in it. I only hope it was because they wanted to try something different and extend their repertoires because they both put in great performances.I recommend this movie for shock value only. If the director was trying to achieve anything else as claimed elsewhere, he failed. There is no real point to this movie. It is not entertaining and perpetrates 'evil' without a good reason. It is a very realistic, well acted, real life horror movie. You can read the newspapers if you want that. Don't watch this... but now you probably will. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The is no changing time, and their is no justifying violent actions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I totally agree with the comment from Embalmer. This is a great movie and while disturbing, the only people that say its crap are those that do not understand it. It captures the brutality of humanity and shows us that there is no justification for violence.***************SPOILER******************** "An eye for eye" as the old saying goes, but this movie illustrates quiet well, that there is no justifying this. The film is intentionally shown backwards, because if the rape scene was at the beginning of the film, and the brutal bashing was at the end of the film, people would have almost felt justified in seeing that. The purpose of the film is to show us that two wrongs don't make a right, especially when taken out on the wrong people. Not a total spoiler so to speak, but when you watch this film, pay particular attention at the beginning to who is getting bashed.Top film, although I have only watched it once, and it was some time ago, I still remember it as if it were yesterday. Definitely not for the faint hearted, but in my opinion, anyone with a brain can watch this appreciate it for what it tells us about people, and how in the right or wrong situation, we do exactly what we think is necessary, even if we are not aware of the consequences. After all, once an action is done, there is no reversing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible begins with an old man sat in a room (Philippe Nahon of Seul Contre Tous) telling another man that "time destroys all things" and that he slept with his daughter, while outside we can hear a commotion. This is the start of the back-to-front story, which goes from frenzy, chaos, violence, then finally concludes with peace and tranquillity. The main three characters are Marcus (Vincent Cassel), his partner, Alex (Monica Bellucci), and her ex, Pierre (Albert Dupontel). The first time we see Marcus and Pierre they are frantically searching a gay club called The Rectum for a man called Le Tenia, who they believe raped and badly beat Alex. They come across two men in a doorway in the club, one of whom Marcus thinks is Le Tenia. He fights one of the men, who then breaks Marcus' arm and is about to rape him. The next sequence is an amazing attack, and one of the most realistic killings I have ever seen in a film. Pierre intervenes with a fire-extinguisher and proceeds to the ram the butt of the object into the man's face no less than twenty-three times. It is very effective. What is also ironic is the man who is killed isn't the man who raped Alex - it was the other man in the doorway.&nbsp; But the most controversial scene is the vicious rape and assault of Alex. She is trying to cross the road and is ironically told by a woman to use the underpass because it's safer. It is a distressing scene and it is more traumatic for the spectator than the ones in Straw Dogs and I Spit on Your Grave because the camera never moves. It is perched very low on a tripod and stays there. We can't escape the ordeal on screen. After this we witness the events leading up to a party, sexual talk between the trio, and the love between Marcus and Alex. It is a skillfully made film. I also liked the music. I'm glad I watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Appalling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm shocked to read the reviews of this movie. Most people have missed a very simple point. That the rape scene, which is the central scene, sexualises rape. And its very simple how it does this. It uses Monica Bellucci. As most of you must know, a star brings all their former work to a film, they carry an aura about them. Bellucci has made her name as 'worlds most beautiful woman' etc. She is a sexual icon. She has made her living from being so. When she appears on a screen, the meme she brings is sex. By her very presence she sexualises the rape scene. If the film makers had really wanted to make the point that rape is a violent act, and 'show it as it is' they should have shown it as it is. Not with some icon of the screen, who is in fact a fantasy person. It should have been an unknown, and not some beauty queen either. Just a normal looking woman would have been best if that was what they wanted to impress upon us. Meanwhile, the tapeworm is taking immense pleasure in the act and we see him very clearly as doing so. The message is that there is pleasure for some people in that act.In this regard the film actually fantasises rape, rather than, as most people are saying, shows the reality.But rape is not a sexual act. It is an act of debasement and control and violence. It debases both the victim and the perpetrator. It actually reminds me of porno more than anything. As we know, porno films use a lot of rape fantasy, this just seems an extreme version of the same. Horrible, ignorant film. I am totally unimpressed with the film makers. They must be experienced enough to know that using MB would cause the effect I'm talking about, or perhaps in some twisted kind of reverse psychology they actually thought that using her would have the opposite effect. Or perhaps, and this would be pretty typical french film philosophy. They are actually trying to point out what I have just said! And its actually an inditement of violence against women on screen. But that's just getting too self referential and clever and hardly anyone will get it. Though its a great fall back position if called out for making a snuff film. wish I hadn't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Concept, Horrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the plot synopsis, I was excited about the great concept, and waited in anticipation to see this film.The DVD menu popped up with the options written backwards ? witty, I must say. It's too bad that a clever little menu format doesn't make up for poor film-making. After hitting "Play", I was then subjected to the most annoying opening credits in the history of cinema. The credits were in multiple colors, scrolling in reverse order, and swinging back and forth as well as up and down. Only 3 minutes into the film, and the filmmakers have already succeeded in pissing me off.The first 30 minutes have some of the worst camera work I've ever seen. It's way too chaotic and nearly impossible to tell what's happening most of the time. The director would twirl and spin the camera around in dimly lit hallways so the viewer only actually sees a few seconds of discernible action for every minute of actual film time. This is exactly the kind of cheap trick a filmmaker would pull in the absence of a good storyline.The apologists for this tripe will undoubtedly claim that the confusing camera work was meant to intentionally confuse and disorient the viewer, and that anyone who says otherwise simply doesn't understand the filmmaker's intentions. Well, if the intent of the filmmaker was to waste celluloid by crafting incomprehensible action, then he has succeeded. I'm apparently in the wrong business. I should have become a filmmaker. I could do an American remake of Irreversible. This time, however, I would black out the entire sequence in "The Rectum", showing only a black screen with lots of yelling and ambient sounds. I could then defend this nonsense as a perfect exposition of the lead character's "blind" rage, and explain away all criticisms by simply saying something like, "You critics don't understand my intentions." Of course, this is completely ridiculous position to hold. But that's essentially what we're doing here ? rationalizing horrible camera work by having it act as a reflection of "confusion." Congratulations, fans of Irreversible. You have just lowered the standards of film-making to an almost indiscernible level.One of the worst parts of this film is the dialogue, which is particularly atrocious. First of all, the same short phrases are repeated over and over and over and over again. The entire revenge sequence is mostly nothing more than the male lead asking dozens of different people the same exact questions. Secondly, the narrative sounds like it was written by an immature, potty-mouthed, neo-Nazi. I challenge anyone to find me a film that uses more racial/discriminatory slurs than Irreversible. Thirdly, the dialogue used to supposedly build character development was almost exclusively explicit sex talk. All of these characteristics are exactly the kind of cheap tricks a filmmaker would pull in the absence of high quality narrative. Why bother putting some actual effort into writing a good script, when it's so much easier to insert garbage dialogue? With all the hoopla regarding the violence in this film, I did not think it was very graphic. The fire extinguisher scene was kinda cool, albeit obviously fake. The 10 minute rape scene was pretty brutal in a generic way, but it is not as devastating as it could have been, especially considering that it occurs in the complete absence of character development.And speaking of character development, it's pretty pathetic in Irreversible. As mentioned above, the dialogue doesn't help much at all. In addition, the lead male character was a real scumbag. He's a racist druggy who cheats on his girlfriend at every opportunity. I actually re-watched an earlier scene just to see his arm get broken again. If this is the best protagonist this film can offer, the writers deserve to be blacklisted from the movie industry forever. Bellucci is nothing more than an incredibly stupid, scantily clad whore. Seriously, anyone who would intentionally avoid the busy streets and taxis to take the "safer" route of a dimly-lit, nearly abandoned tunnel system should be a sure winner of the Idiot of the Year award. Then, a blatant ad hoc invocation is added. Faced with the sheer superficiality of their characters, it's as if the writers got together and said, "Hey, let's take the easy way out and simply infer that Bellucci's character is pregnant." Bravissimo fellas. It's too bad that developing a character takes much more effort than that.Needless to say, all of this mishandling of the characters really mitigated much of the rape and violence. This panoramic failure is what drives Irreversible down to trash film-making, plain and simple. Such an extended rape scene should have enraged me to no end, siding immediately with the boyfriend to help me understand the rage behind his acts of vengeance. Irreversible provides the exact opposite ? no emotion whatsoever. I saw a generic dude beat another generic dude with an extinguisher, only to then see some generic woman get raped by another generic dude, only to then see our generic characters become slightly less generic in their culmination to unlikeability.I also need to mention the frequent shots of testicles and penises ? one of which was attached to a transsexual. What on earth provoked the director to shoot this nonsense is beyond me, but it does put the icing on the cake. This film is classless, empty trash.Finally, some of the defenders of this film have actually claimed that Irreversible is intentionally confusing. They claim that Irreversible has repetitive dialogue, without a need for a script or even character development. When statements like this are being made in DEFENSE of a movie, they act as unintentional confessions that this film is truly horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strip away the fancy / annoying spinning camera and the reverse-time telling, and "Irreversible" is a mediocre revenge movie with a predictable twist ending. Problem with the "twist" is, when the story is told "backwards," you know what it is half-way through.That's the problem with "Irreversible" altogether: Somebody forgot the fundamentals of storytelling. Unlike "Memento," which is well-crafted to deliver its climax and a twist whether viewed "forward" or "backward," "Irreversible" simply puts everything in reverse order.The climax ? the "fire extinguisher" scene with all the raw energy and emotional release ? happens in the first minutes. The set-up ? the very long and brutal rape ? takes place in the very middle.Watching "backwards," we wonder just what will be revealed to make the story any clearer; it never happens. In forward time, "Irreversible" has little to redeem its overly graphic violence and largely unlikable characters.That is probably the best reason for reverse-chronology and dizzying camera. Without either, "Irreversible" would jut be another annoying French flick trying to be more than it is. With both, it's just more of the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the purpose of film? There is a type of film/film maker who merely wants to disturb and disgust us. These are your average horror and "slice 'n' dice" movies that may scare us or make us laugh for their incompetence. But should a competent film maker show us the worse just because they can? There are four films that go beyond what movies should do. They are "I Spit On Your Grave", "SAL? o le 120 giornate di Sodoma", "The Last House On The Left" and "Irreversible". Each depicts torture and rape in an all too realistic manner. The question is not why we would watch such films as why they would make them. They may simply want to test the limits of the art of film making. Perhaps they foster serious discussions of difficult subject. In my opinion, they are simply not worth the price of the film stock they are printed on. Arty crap is still crap. Don't waste your time on this.</fullReview>

Possibly there was something at the end of the movie, chronologically the beginning of the story, made it worth suffering through the rest but I never got there.You would have to be pretty depraved to enjoy this, the worst of euro-perversion I have seen. What is it with those Europeans and their fascination for degrading behavior?I repeat. No redeeming value whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I live in brazil and i do not speak English very well, but i'll try to show you my point of view the best way i can. This movie is probably the worst thing that i ever saw in my life. Terrible actors, stupid story (even worst screenplay) and the director must be blind, because i can imagine someone watching this trash and at the same time liking it. Actually, this movie (if the producers wanted that kind of result) did not need a director, but just a monkey to carry the camera across the set while the actors and the retarded cinematographer walk on his side pointing the light to make us think that they really knew what they were doing. If The passion of the Christ didn't exist, this movie will become the worst movie of the history. In the future, when i learn to speak English correctly, i will give you a hundred more reasons why.

		<shortDescription>Another stinking piece of crap for the artsy-fartsy crowd to worship. What makes those Frenchmen so enraged anyway?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of sick, nausea--inducing garbage that the said crowd, especially European, adores and usually showers with praise, honors and prizes at every Festival where it has any influence. I see in the DVD that such thing has happened in Stockholm (can you say "Bergman?); in Toronto (which is still struggling to be recognized amongst the big in the festival circuit, so it's bound to acquiesce to every whim of the hierarchy); in Cannes (of course, any artsy piece of French trash got it made there) and also in the U.S.; in....where else, in Sundance, the place in that country where all the toxic crap from every place in the world comes to rest under the compliant eyes of the local artsy-fartsy aristocracy.Irreversible is so revolting in its extreme, unmitigated violence, it may even induce you vomit if you are the least sensitive or if it takes you by surprise. At the least it will leave you a feeling of profound sadness and emptiness--so, if you still insist in seeing it don't say I didn't warn you. Now, if something good I got to say about clunkers like Little Miss Sunshine and Being John Malkovich is that, bad as they are, they have no serious effect in your mood, as they are inoffensive precisely because of their shallowness and meaningless. But you can't say the same about this atrocity. To give you the goods: there's a 10 min. scene where a man brutally rapes a woman and then smashes her head against the concrete floor, leaving it just a bloody mess. But, as the title says, this is a movie going backward, so the revenge exacted by the victim's boyfriend comes first, almost at the beginning, and it's also as horrible: he--or one of his friends--smashes the offender's mug with a fire extinguisher, over and over again, until leaving nothing of it but a deformed piece of butchered meat. After seeing all this you may be tempted to ask: for what; for what artistic, ethic, aesthetic, philosophical purpose? Well, for none whatsoever, just for the sake of showing extreme violence. For the sake of appealing to the most savage, basic, primal, human instincts. And that is the kind of cinema crap that leaves the artsy-fartsy crowd brimming with excitement, jumping in joy on their Gucci shoes and wetting their designer pants: pure art! pure art!.The real issue here is RAGE. Forget about sex--which is never an issue when it comes to rape anyway--neither friendship, even if the boyfriend's comrades offer their help in locating the offender. It isn't about love either, as they guy is more interested in revenge than in following the loved one to the hospital, to see it she makes it, acting as if the real wound would have been to his manly pride. In fact the tragedy seems to have blown his fuse rather than devastated him--as generally occurs--bringing out a long repressed and devastating rage in him so we may even say the rape is a detonating event rather than a motive or justification. And I'm even more inclined to this idea as when watching the first scenes it seemed to me that violence comes naturally to this man--the character or the actor, who cares--without the need for a provocation; so rape or not rape you can easily picture him acting the maniacal way he does. Anyway the turkey is about maniacal rage and nothing else so don't get fooled by the sexy DVD cover. It happened to me and now I regret it.I didn't feel like reading reviews but I caught glimpse of one where something interesting is said: that the victim doesn't do anything to avoid the rape, which makes you wonder what was really the filmmakers' intentions (a question: would this turkey have been such a hit in France had the woman defended herself and injured, or killed, her attacker? Just wondering.) See, she could have kicked the man in the groin, she could have even told him she had AIDS, which in real life has proved in some cases to be a deterrent. But you wouldn't see that here. The martyred (female) victim is way too much appealing to the misogynist French and such a crucial part of their most cherished traditions way back to Jean d'Arc--or even before--to the German occupation of 1940-45, to let the opportunity pass. (also, Bellucci had still a career to be made as the new European bombshell and being raped and beaten to death on screen would go much farther in winning the hearts of the French than, say, reacting to the attack and making instead of the rapist's manly parts a bloody mess. SVP, Thelma/Louise ne sont pas bienvenues ici). Still, why such monstrous rage? I have one possible answer for that.The French used to be big 200 years ago when Napoleon went to make a complimentary visit to the Mameluks of North Africa (which little Nicholas Sarkozy feels now the urge to visit again, to commemorate the 200th anniversary). But ever since WWII they are just a petite nation lost in the shuffle, which makes them very angry, and even more when their intellectual class has all but disappeared, not letting behind but some cheap purveyors of junk philosophies and worshipers of the established elites. We are far from from a Sartre, a Camus, a Malraux et al. Until the 60s they could still claim an intellectual hegemony?specially over the hated yanks?presenting themselves as the leaders of civilized behavior &amp; diplomacy, the alternative in moral leadership with their tier-mondiste positions in world politics. But all that's gone now. With such a big decline in every possible field, what's left to them but the rage...? It is in this kind of moral and intellectual emptiness where cinematographic vermin like this one appear and dwell, like scorpions and snakes in a desert. Anyway, stay away from this turd and, even more, from anyone praising it. --100/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay...So...bad things happen in life. That's what the filmmaker is trying to tell us.Well duh, i never thought that tragedy could befall innocent people. I did not really need to watch this stinker to get enlightened on this point.I guess there could be an interesting way to explore the meaning and implications of fate. Not for the deconstructionists though, whose mantra "Life is crap" blinds them from any meaningful artistic endeavour. This movie only delivers gratuitous gore and violence and an endless rape scene to..well..to drive home the point that life can be very bad indeed.Remember, art tells us more about the artist than at what is being depicted...Frankly, IMDb must be visited by a lot of sour souls for this piece of trash to receive such high marks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever felt truly sea-sick? It's the only condition where you long for death, but which doesn't kill you. The only difference between that state and watching this film is that when you reach land and recover from the sea-sickness, you feel great. After finishing with this film, you feel even worse because it pollutes you permanently. You disgust yourself for having watched it. Actually, I watched it twice, in a desperate attempt to find out why it had been made. There was no answer. I managed to partially erase it from memory after a couple of years, and only now write these comments because a friend of mine said she wanted to see it. So I'm sending it off to her, and glad to be rid of it. No doubt there will be others who want to see it for the reason it's so horrible. Prepare to feel a sense of mental and emotional damage for the rest of your life. It's not bad, like Saving Private Ryan; it's not good, like Alfredo Garcia. It just is, and I wish it wasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is intense. No doubt about it. The performances are not only great, but it's the brutality of everything that's so unsettling. Although there are scenes that linger and others that simply cause a headache, this was certainly a bizarre and reflective sequence of events. Irreversible is certainly quite different--whether that's good or bad is undecided, but it's still welcome nonetheless. Beyond the particularly strong scenes of power abuse, it's the thought of vulnerability in any capacity being targeted that strike's one's heart. Whether it's yourself or a loved one, we've all been in those dark places. We hope it will just be fine. And it usually is. This film represents the rare (yet duly noted) case of when things don't go so smoothly.To say this movie is revolutionary would be contentious. Regardless, it was hard to watch. With that being said, blissful ignorance never solved a problem, it only ignored it. To some that may be equivalent, but to others, it's an important lesson to never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irresponsible? Maybe...It's quite possible that director Gaspar Noe' may have been attempting to make a point, not just about blind rage over one horrific act of violence leading to another act of violence, but that bigoted attitudes against homosexuals and trans-gendered persons may also play a role when one is out for revenge, seemingly, at all cost. Unfortunately, there isn't ONE LGTB character in this film that is portrayed in a positive light. All are involved in scenes of graphic sexual escapades, most of which take place at a "gay sex club", the name of which seems to have been chosen for the HIGHEST SHOCK VALUE possible! The number of gay slurs uttered by numerous characters is appalling (during the infamous scene in "the tunnel" where Monica Bellucci's "Alex" is attacked, even her attacker had to use the word "F-ggot" or "F-g" multiple times!). At the end of the film I (as a gay man) was left feeling insulted and confused. This is obviously not a movie that you watch for "entertainment". The director appears to be trying to teach his audience some kind of lesson. For me, that lesson seems to have gotten lost in translation...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Main Emotion Here is Anger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The camera spins as if out of control, but that's exactly where we are in the story. It has lost almost all control. Almost.Most likely inspired by "Memento," the story is told in backwards chronology. The end credits are at the beginning of the film, the death of the villain is at the beginning of the film, but no worries, as this is not really a spoiler, it is merely what you are initially told. This is also a selling point, as horror fanatics will appreciate the brutality. The setting of this scene is meant to be, surely, upsetting as well.As the film progresses, the characters become less and less anxious, and the camera becomes stiller. Time moves on, the climax has already happened. The arch of the film is what everybody would talk about. We are already introduced to the idea of what is about to happen, and we are told these things, not so much. We discover, as an audience.Moments...prolonged takes (no cuts in the editing room)...puts us in the hyper-realism of the story.Your worst fears are realized...and one of the most amazing actresses in one of her best scenes comes into play...and it's no play. It's not fun. It's not "everything" you wanted, because it's hardly acting.This may be the scene that has me writing about the film. However, it is only because it really angered me. I've read that many audience members react in different ways. At the Cannes festival, 200 people walked out. I imagine people becoming sick over this. I was just angry.I was expecting a similar feel in "The Human Centipede," however the badguy is quite the performer in that one, and its the idea that gets all the attention. That one was more Hitchcock, a psychologically demanding movie. This one was more Kubrick. A psychologically demanding emotional film. The main emotion here is anger.Due to the subject matter, I gave this a 7. As upsetting as it was, due to the prolonged rape scene, it is one of the few films...in fact, the only movie I can remember repeating to myself "It's only a movie, it's only a movie..." A phrase you could see on the original "Last House on the Left" poster...quite an effective tagline for a film, however, I hated "Last House on the Left," and I hate the remake without even seeing it."Irreversible," however, is beautiful. Monica Bellucci is beautiful. Vincent Cassel is just as powerful. This can be classified under "art horror," as the director really tells the story as much as the events do...especially for a film with 10/15 minute scenes without editing, its hard for a director to do so much. He does, he does.Gaspar Noe may be one of the greatest directors. I'm basing this on one film of his I have seen. An awfully predictable film, I imagined the story once the story got going. Here's the spoiler...a happy ending.Satisfying? We'll get to that...The meaning of the ending is as important as where the characters go after this one awful night. The commentary on rape and revenge is strong, and watching this with someone (it may be hard to find someone who wants to watch this, and it should be difficult) may surely spark some conversation. That's the draw of the film. The obsession.People may watch again and again, looking for the similarities in the rape scene and the intimate love scene later in the movie. It's all predictable, but as I've always said: movies are especially predictable the second viewing.The polarizing effect this film has had on audiences is where satisfaction. It's all about what you're telling yourself. This is the psychological effect that creates something to obsess over. Let me spoil the ending for you, because if you interpret it yourself, you might ruin it for yourself. The film is about what time does to us, and perhaps how memories should last a lifetime. What happens to everyone after this tragic night? Perhaps it is the last two moments of the film, but in the last moment of all, it's meant to make you sick...when it's really just a blank white screen becoming a strobe effect with a terrible sound effect. This is art......and it's only a movie...it's only a movie.Hard to say I enjoyed it, though it calms down in the "end," and becomes enjoyable, and an intimate love story. Hard to say I'm going to watch it again. So does that merit a 10? 9? 8? 7 sounds good to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Wish With Pretensions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off this is a very well shot and presented film, Noe has genuine cinematic gifts - camera movement being used for once to disturb and disorientate not just show how clever the director is. Like "Memento" the story is presented backwards and the question of why this is so has to be asked. Christopher Nolan's film used the technique to gradually reveal the full horror of the protagonists fate - despite seeing the film several times the ending is still devastating. By extreme contrast Noe seems to have realised how trite and banal the story actually presented here is. Yes folks this is a bog standard revenge story as per "Death Wish" and a hundred others. Noe though thinks he is very clever and his story has a great philosophical point to make. It is that time destroys everything! Truly a life changing insight. In order to hammer the point home we have to watch an extended face bashing and a nice long rape scene. Why do these have to be shown? Well for one thing, and a point not often commented on, Noe is a professional filmmaker in the commercial film industry, not as some seem to think a struggling avant-garde artist. He knows, and the attention paid to this film proves, that people will pay to watch this stuff. I believe another reason may be down to Noe's adulation of Stanley Kubrick - a filmmaker of similar cinematic flair and simplicity of mind. Why did Kubrick have a rape scene set to music in "Clockwork Orange" - I suspect because he thought it looked good and was funny. Similarly I think Noe is amused by his own conceits, and possibly he thinks rape makes good viewing. Watching this film made me long for the honesty of real exploitation cinema, Wes Craven's "Last House On The Left" covers much the same ground, it is amateurish in the extreme but has an energy and a sense that what is happening is real entirely missing in "Irreversible".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, as a jury, am still out. The rape and beating scene of Alex and the brutal scene in the Rectum notwithstanding, it just made me so sad.As an exercise in film-making it's jarring, nauseating and confusing and I had to frequently fast forward just to not get sick, but that's due to Noe's swirly camera-work and the soundtrack.As an acting piece, it's phenomenal, from Jo Prestia's Tenia's glee in causing someone pain to Vincent Cassel's blind rage in his quest for revenge and Albert Dupontel's seemingly helpless desperation to help somehow -- it's all first rate. I don't care what anyone says -- Monica Bellucci's Alex is brave and heartbreaking.When the story is examined, I can't help but think how sad it is that they got the wrong guy and how the boyfriend won't be there when (if) she wakes up and how the baby most certainly is lost.It just made me so sad, ultimately, at how fragile life is and how fleeting happiness can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A conventional movie, masked by blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So we begin with the end; with a climactic scene in which Marcus (Vincent Cassell) strides through a gay S&amp;M club looking for the guy who raped his girlfriend. We know that's who he's looking for because Irreversible is now irreversibly associated with the sexual assault endured by Monica Bellucci's Alex. These represent the film's two scenes of almost unimaginable cruelty. And it really is unflinching. Literally ? Noe's camera, otherwise caterwauling, settles to an eerie stillness as the violence erupts before our eyes. The film's reverse structure puts our assumptions through the mangler, whilst removing the potential for the build-'em-up, knock-'em-down schadenfreude of the Saw sequels. We're denied the hope of a happy ending. Instead, we get a phony ending: some giggling, softcore flirtation and a revelation designed to finish off our turning stomachs. Gaspar Noe's film is essentially a dozen single, long takes. This works occasionally. For instance, the rape scene is brutally relentless; fear and fearsomeness played with fearlessness for a full ten minutes. But the nightclub revenge sequence, in which Marcus descends the Circles of Hell, through increasingly exaggerated excesses of depravity, drags the film into near-farcical territory. It's like an Hieronymous Bosch exhibit with a Daft Punk soundtrack. So Irreversible is manipulative, nasty and contrived. It batters the senses, but doesn't run any deeper than that. With its dashing, spinning camera, we're a bewildered bystander. We see terrible things being inflicted on people, without ever stopping to see through their eyes. Elem Klimov's Come and See ? a superior piece of manipulative celluloid mind-battering ? achieved this very simply: by focusing the camera square on the victim's face. Klimov made us afraid of Man. Noe makes us afraid of what men might do, like an ill-tempered Daily Mail editor. Crucially, and cripplingly, it doesn't dare examine rape from a female perspective. (There's even a slightly dubious moment on a subway train when Alex seems to suggest that the key to her sexual pleasure is in the knowledge that the man feels pleasure ? a tasteless piece of narrative irony.) This is a film about male rage. And there are truck-loads of such films around ? so for all its boundary-breaking, Irreversible is deeply conventional, and not very deep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cripples you, mocks you and doesn't even do it well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irréversible is the notorious French indie film which came from the mind of Gasper Noé. Its notoriety comes primarily from the sadistic, harrowing and realistic anal rape scene in an underpass, add this with other frequent distressing scenes throughout and you have one very disturbing film. This film is not for the faint hearted, with two horrific scenes, viewer discretion is definitely advised.Its non-chronological order is very unique and executed well enough to make sense. Disorientated camera movements symbolise a cut back in time and are accompanied with the incessant, gradually intensifying sounds, which suits the films gritty aesthetics very well. These sounds are used incredibly well throughout and are definitely a highlight of the film, especially in the underground gay bar "Rectum" where an already intimidating atmosphere is enhanced to an astounding level, increasing your anguish. Its use of no sound is also used in all the right places as well; it adds masses of suspense and unease, particularly when Alex walks down to the underpass.The actual rape scene is far too long; it achieves what it sets out to do within the first minute, when it reached the second minute I wanted to stop watching but when it began pushing the ten minute mark it just got ridiculous. I understand why it is so graphic as it does give you a real sense of a rape, but why would a film want to portray such a scene? It just seems to use rape as a novelty purely to add shock value as there are no educational factors in the film. Because of this, it ends up giving off the essence that it's only included to get more views. At the end of the day it just angered me as there seems to be no reason behind the film, it's just pointless. If I'm honest, the film wouldn't be so well known, watched and rated if it didn't have the rape scene as it doesn't really do anything well. The characters are very unlikeable and have almost no development, there is no satisfying conclusion and the worst part is that it insults you after the scene.You're expected to continue watching the film forty minutes after the rape scene which is a gruesome task due to the mediocrity and frankly, boringness, of the film. Alex even states "the future is decided already, everything is fixed" which blatantly suggests that she was destined to get raped. Marcus, Alex's boyfriend, makes references towards the scene further on in the film. What no one seems to notice is that the man whose skulled gets bashed in at the start of the film isn't even the rapist, who it seems, gets off scot-free. What really tops it off is the fact that Alex is actually pregnant during the rape which we find out right at the end. I'm livid just writing this, is this what Irréversible really wants to achieve?Irréversible is as insulting as it is infuriating for what appears to be, no reason. The only thing it pulls off is the use of sound which is done to a tee. It cripples you, kicks you on the floor and doesn't even do it well, or gracefully. The fact that it is dependent on the rape scene gives the feeling that it uses rape as a novelty to get views. The film is simplistic and straight forward; because of this it lacks depth. Ignore the 10/10 reviews, ignore the 5+/10 reviews as they obviously haven't taken the film apart and examined its every detail. Don't waste your time on Irréversible as its disturbing, harrowing contents will make you suffer and will give you nothing in return.</fullReview>

After a while the continuously shifting camera angles loose their excitement and with this any artistic message that there might have been. Telling the story back to front is a nice idea but compared to Tarrantino's Pulp Fiction this approach doesn't work anywhere near as well. Belucci and Cassel are excellent but Dupontel fails to convince; maybe because his character seems inconsistent. I'm not sure what all the fuss about violence and the rape is about. Yes it is ugly, but then how many people are maimed and killed in the average Rambo movie. I suppose it's too close to real life. In the end the whole thing didn't quite work for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IRREVERSIBLE (2002) *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't agree with all the gushing praise being heaped on this film. I had been reading and hearing about it for months and just yesterday I came upon the R2 Tartan DVD in my local video store and, naturally, I rented it immediately.While I was not surprised by all the strobing effects, I didn't expect this 'artistic flourish' (yeah, right!) to go on for an overbearing and nauseating 35 minutes! I can understand that the director wanted to emphasize that the character of Marcus (Vincent Cassel) had been unceremoniously dragged into hitherto unexplored facets of his character as well as into a maelstrom of depravity peopled with seedy low-lifes and crafty opportunists. But did he really have to hammer this out for us for over half-an-hour? Sure, it's a uniquely bold touch to start the film in this way but rather than induce the viewer into compulsively watching what is happening on the screen, however horrible and stomach-churning it might be, it ends up feeling grossly self-indulgent, irritatingly obtuse and condescending to boot. The only saving grace I could see in utilizing this effect for so long was that it enabled me to look away impatiently from the screen over to my watch and not concern myself with missing out on any of the strenuous activities a bunch of horny faggots and transsexuals feel the need to indulge themselves in daily to kill their time or make a living.This may be one of the reasons why I didn't even notice that the wrong guy had gotten his face smashed in after all. Now that scene would, in the words of one patron of 'The Rectum', score an 'awesome' in a cinematic bravura contest but again, while not actually coming off as gratuitous, it just seems to go on forever. I can see that this sequence was mandatory and it was a clever touch to have the intellectual Pierre (Albert Dupontel) giving the beating rather than the more macho and aggravated Marcus. But surely some of the other patrons of the club could have tried to intervene or something rather than simply looking on and acting like a bunch of apathetic zombies.Which brings us to the other much-discussed sequence of the film: the grueling and interminable rape scene in the tunnel. I have watched STRAW DOGS (1971), THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972) and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978) all fairly recently. Obviously, as it has set itself out to be from the start, IRREVERSIBLE's rape scene is the most realistic of them all but I think that filming it in such a detached way robs us of really living the experience through the main character. Not that we really need to do so; everyone knows that rape is despicable and we don't need to watch it in close up on the screen to come to that conclusion. But, to me, the rape sequence in STRAW DOGS is all the more effective ? both cinematic ally and emotionally ? since we do not just watch a re-enactment of a rape by two actors (however well-rendered, spontaneous or realistic that may have been) but we also enter inside the victim's mind as she is going through that horrible ordeal. She screams and cries just as the character of Alex (Monica Bellucci) does in IRREVERSIBLE, but STRAW DOGS' Amy (Susan George), having been an unwitting accomplice in the rape herself (by letting her ex-boyfriend into the house while her husband was away), tries to survive through it all (and in a way purge herself of her own guilt) by thinking of better times with her husband (with whom, as in IRREVERSIBLE, she had also had an argument). To tell you the truth, I found Noe's choice of filming the scene in one static shot rather uninvolving, so much so that I didn't even notice that, as has been mentioned by other members here, there was an eyewitness lurking about on the scene of the crime!Luckily, the film improved a lot for me after this point. Not only because the camera assumed a more conventional view-point but also because, finally, the director decided to infuse his film with some much-needed humanity: the camaraderie between Alex, Marcus and Pierre (even if their long drawn-out conversations on what turns them on and what doesn't is at times laughably pretentious and, alas, typical of much of French cinema these days) brings out the individual characteristics of each one of them; the palpable and tangible love which exists between Alex and Marcus (aided immeasurably by having a real-life married couple playing these roles) is shown via an explicit if not particularly graphic scene of love-making (although I couldn't help feeling somewhat like an unwarranted voyeur intruding on an intimate moment which should have been shared exclusively by the couple); Alex's eventual pregnancy, while predictable, has all the more resonance now that we know how the events will turn out and her leisurely moments reading in the garden as she is surrounded by kids tries to end the film on a note of transcendence, of innocence that will soon be lost, possibly never to be regained. Actually, apart from all the legitimate significance that can be gleaned from it, I am grateful that Noe elected to cut his film backwards because at least it gets done with the less digestible aspects of the film first. However, coming as they do so early in the film, it runs the risk of losing its hold on the audience since there is not much else to attract their jaded attentions (expect the afore-mentioned sex scene). It's like having a three-hour epic with all the battle sequences crammed into the first half-hour. Of course, one may argue that had he cut the film chronologically, the reverse would be true. But then the viewer would have by now come to care about the fate of its protagonists and he would have been sucked into following the subsequent vertiginous descent into Marcus' darkest recesses. As it stands, the film feels, on the most basic of levels, like a series of disjointed vignettes one less interesting than the other.One thing that didn't quite ring true for me in the film was the party sequence. Why on earth should Marcus be fooling around with other (by necessity, less attractive) girls and doing drugs and indulging in vacuous conversations with his miserable teacher friend when he has a gorgeous girlfriend like Alex a few feet away from him (thus giving her enough reason to become annoyed by his behavior and therefore decide to leave the party and go home ahead of them)? And you all know what happens after that! I don't know ? maybe it's because I've never done drugs (although I've been known for imbibing excessive amounts of alcohol in my time!) and never been much of a party animal myself but, to me, in those scenes the character of Marcus seems to be playing the prick for its own sake rather than from any inherent character motivation!The saddest aspects of IRREVERSIBLE for me are two-fold: it's a shame that Monica Bellucci, blessed (or perhaps cursed) as she is by incredibly good looks and an impossibly perfect body, can only realize her acting abilities by degrading herself on camera playing such 'significant' roles (but then, who knows what bland parts she'll be offered to play when her burgeoning Hollywood career eventually takes flight?); also, I kind of suspect that with each new film he'll be offering us, Gaspar Noe will be at pains to top his latest work in the sensation stakes and I for one don't care to make that journey with him. While some of you may applaud a film which (or a film-maker who) does not refrain from making you feel uncomfortable by unflinchingly showing us life as it most truly is in all its brutal detail, I think it's just a case of artistic superficiality. Art is the celebration of the creative forces of an artist, be he a writer, a painter, a musician or a film director. What's so creative or artistic about pointing a camera at something and just let it roll for minutes on end? Even more incomprehensible is why anyone would want to waste thirty minutes of celluloid (not to mention our time) by deliberately obfuscating what we ought to be looking at in the first place with a distressingly distracting strobing effect? Beats me.This somewhat regrettable tendency to show life as it is, with all the usual cinematic decorousness thrown out, actually started with the Italian neo-realist movement of the 40s but eventually crystallized itself with the arrival of the French 'Nouvelle Vague' in the late 50s. Rejecting as they did the overly theatrical style of such respected directors as Marcel Carne', Rene' Clair, Rene' Clement and Claude Autant-Lara, these new 'enfants terribles' took to the streets of Paris and filmed their stories 'off-the-cuff' but they still imbued them with overt references to the Hollywood peers which came before them, in such a way as to make their films intelligent but no less enjoyable for all that. Take Jean-Luc Godard, for example. He may have been the first to reject the trappings of the 'Nouvelle Vague' and deliberately confine himself to filming pseudo-intellectual political diatribes for the best part of a decade (and, in doing so, perhaps unwittingly, laying the seeds for the horrendous Dogme'95 movement) but, in his prime, he could film an ostensible parody of international film co-productions, LE MEPRIS aka CONTEMPT (1963) based on Alberto Moravia's novel no less, and turn it into one of the most profound and scathing studies of disintegrating marital relationships in film history. Even so, Leonard Maltin ? not the most patient film critic when it comes to art-house bollocks ? calls this very same film 'perversely funny' and 'highly amusing'! It comes as no surprise that Gaspar Noe has no sense of humor whatsoever and his film, although admittedly required viewing for all true cineastes, joins the ranks of other 'films maudits' I've watched out of curiosity but which I don't intend to ever do so again, like Pier Paolo Pasolini's SALO' O LE 120 GIORNATE DI SODOMA (1975), Ruggero Deodato's CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST (1979) and Kinji Fukasaku's BATTLE ROYALE (2000). And good riddance, too! Yesterday, a few hours after watching IRREVERSIBLE, I decided to try out another 'sacred cow' of a film I've been wanting to see for some time ? Alexandro Jodorowsky's THE HOLY MOUNTAIN (1973)! Big mistake! And then one of my favorite actors Gregory Peck goes on and dies out on me! One of the worst days of my life, I tell you! I guess I should've seen THE BRAVADOS (1958) instead, a good revenge Western in which Peck's wife is raped and murdered and he goes after the four men responsible, only to find out after killing the very last one, that they were innocent after all!! Sounds familiar?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreverent unnecessary gratuitous violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like going to see a movie without knowing anything about it beforehand.I thought I was going to see a thriller when I went to see "Irreversible". Should I had known I was going to see the most shocking "nothingness" I had ever seen, I would have never stepped into the cinema in the first place. "Irreversible" is pure violence. Both moral and physical violence. Unmotivated. An offence to anybody's taste. By the end of the movie, my eyes were aching, I could no longer bear to watch any more painful scenes. Even though the movie proved not to be a thriller, I left the cinema with many unanswered questions, such as "how on earth did this movie make it to Cannes?" and "why would any decent actor accept to play a part in such a terrible 'show'?". There is nothing original about "Irreversible", both on a semantic and stylistic level. The story line is banal: the random rape and murder of a young, middle class woman is the core event in the movie. Her lover and her former fianceé, who are best friends, spend all night trying to find the assassin, helped by two uncanny individuals, ending up in the creepiest, most squalid places, mixing up with transvestites, prostitutes and gay people. On a formal level, the movie reminds me of Memento: the story is told in reverse, starting form the most recent going to the least recent event. The director over uses handheld-Blair Witch-like footage to scare the spectators and extra loud noise to traumatise them. The key concept behind the film is that destiny is written, that you cannot change your future, that every step you take, every choice you make, every second you spend are 'irreversibly' leading you somewhere you can't help going to. Regardless of how deep the message of the film was, I believe it was not necessary for the film to be so fierce. The spectators are forced to watch a woman being sodomized for as long as 12 minutes (no interruptions, long shot). Then for about 15 minutes the audience is shown filthy men having sex in a dirty nightclub. For the remaining 1 hour and a half we see three insignificant, boring characters, with nothing interesting to say. This movie will certainly win the Award for the most gratuitous, unjustified, unnecessary and unreasonable violence that has ever been screened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homophobic Torture Porn Thinly Disguised as an "Art Film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is possibly the most blatantly homophobic and pretentious wad of straight male torture porn disguised as an art film I've ever made myself endure. Thesis of the story? Sodomy destroys everything! Even innocent, beautiful women in wonderfully fertile relationships are raped by those evil, drug sniffing homos (of course! Gay men are always anally raping beautiful, braless heterosexual women, those immoral swine!) before they go off to their depraved sodomy underworld to have random, animalistic S&amp;M sex before getting their heads righteously bashed in (while all those evil fags just idly stare on in lurid/detached fascination) by a fire extinguisher (put out those destructive, flaming queens!) wielded by a righteous straight man whose beautifully idealized, biologically reproductive relationship was ruined ruined ruined by the anal-obsessed fag demons who crawl around a raunchy club called The Rectum! Pump your fists in the air, straight men, your directionless and testosterone-poisoned anger now has a focus!The director didn't even try to veil his vehement and bigoted chauvinism and then attempted to make the film envelope-pushing simply by resorting to banal shock-value intensity (just bash his head in again and again! Just keep the camera still for 10 minutes while this evil fag tortures this poor screaming woman so all the sadistic straight men can covertly get their kinky kicks while pretending to really contemplate the raw experience of a real rape. Wow! Gritty!) and attempted to make it arty by reversing what is actually a very conventional and hackneyed narrative (You killed my beautiful girlfriend and now I must GET REVENGE! Just like in The Crow! Wasn't that a time-tested work of art?) and also by simply spinning the camera to disorient the viewer in a manner that never ceases to be cinematographically ostentatious and annoying. Conventional narrative? Just reverse it (even though this lets all the steam out of it in the beginning, making the second half even more dull and predictable)! Need art-film innovation? Just swing the camera around! How arty! And of course, it will be easy to gain empathetic investment from the audience by morally indicting the feces-covered rectum rapers that are the bane of all reputable societies- those haters of the holy life-affirming vagina: the male gays! "We hate them too!" the audience all chants in cathartic, mind-blown unison.Cheers all around. What an innovative, intense, emotionally gripping cinematic tour-de-force for Nazi Republicans with a penchant for sadistic violence, pseudo-complicated pretense, and the much needed hyper-glorification of the moral superiority of heterosexual intercourse. Easy A for a talent-starved director with no real or decent convictions. Fin.</fullReview>

I think that with this film, the director caused the most pain to the biggest number of people that you can, while staying within the bounds of law. Maybe 1 million saw it. And if it impacted them the way it did me... I suggest that having made this film is equivalent to killing 10 people (in terms of karma or what have you). I strongly caution anyone against seeing it. I knew there was an extremely brutal rape scene in it and I thought that I've got to see it because my mind will imagine worse things.

		<shortDescription>No scandal. Just a bad film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little "Eyes Wide Shut", a little "Last House on the Left", an extremely tough rape scene, an extremely ugly head-splitting-scene. And a big dose of arthouse pretentiousness. Voil? "Irréversible", a movie with the ability to shock you three times: In the amazingly raw head splicing scene, in the equally raw anal rape scene - and in all the emptiness in between.This is no more than an arthouse-shocker. All the messages Noé wants to bring across are lost on the exhausting way to the boring ending. Man is an animal? Well, yeah, how insightful. And it's not even brought across convincingly. There would be so much to deconstruct in this nihilist film, but I won't waste too much energy. I too have to say, that there is a technical interest in the film, that I admired the rawness, that I was fascinated by the length of the scenes (for example the one-take-rape. Really tough) - but the showing off amounts to a big nothing. It's an empty film, it's arthouse exploitation. And a dishonest, actually uptight film for intellectual revenge freaks.One might think that there's something interesting behind all the technical wizardry, behind the atrocities ... but no. There's not. Just watch closely and you might see it too. Rating 1/10PS: I was reminded of "Trouble Every Day", another film that tries to take a geekish shock-genre (Vampire-Horror with lots of blood) and give it an artsy fartsy touch. And it also fails miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At times brilliant and at times sophomoric but always depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film and its plot have been described and extolled by other readers. Most of what is said is true, but I would attach a different view to many of the things this director does. The director is obviously trying to be innovative, and in many ways what he does works. Probably his best innovation (well, it has been done before, but not often)is to tell the story backwards. This has the effect of making you think about the things that led up to the rather horrible ending (which you see in the beginning). If he had told it in the usual way you would have been shocked by the ending and walked out wondering why it is such a downer but not considered the causes. There are other effects, such as moving the camera around in a very jerky way. This does give a disorienting and confused effect which is probably what the director wanted, but it also makes you feel a bit sea sick and there are times it is very difficult to follow what is happening on the screen, which is not what the director wanted.All and all, the theme of the movie is a depressing one. It is on a par with "life sucks and then you die" or more like "life may be good for a bit but eventually the evil comes out in all of us and it destroys us." Some people like depressing things and if you are one of those people, then I recommend this movie. I am not one of those people and I sincerely disagree with this view of life, so I didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible movie. Hated it. You have to be very good at repressing your emotions (outrage, disgust, horror, etc) to "enjoy" a movie such as this useless, exploitative piece of human excrement. Nihilistic, cynical, sadistic, it depicts prolonged sexual violence, perverse sexual behavior, and brutal physical violence. It is "artfully" told in reverse chronological order, which only serves to hide the banality of the story. This French movie is typical of the Hollywood-envying hypocritical style of European films, who pretend to condemn Hollywood, while exploiting it. This film has no redeeming value whatsoever, except perhaps as a warning to women how NOT to dress when walking home alone from a party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obscene, sadistic junk.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? The movie is garbage. I cannot imagine anyone with a well adjusted, healthy mind wanting to watch this movie as a form of entertainment. The violence is presented as so realistic that it makes you cringe and wonder why you're exposing yourself to these images. I would think, perhaps it might be useful in law enforcement to show police and military what a brutal rape looks like or what it looks like to see a man's head bashed in by a fire extinguisher but other than that I can't imagine why one would sit through this this film. If you're mind is so devoid of imagination that you need to see this film to understand what real life violence can be, than I truly feel sorry for that viewer. I cannot stress enough that this film is not entertainment in any meaning of the word. It is almost akin to a snuff film and to try to imply that simply because the film says that violence is bad is nowhere near enough to justify this as a piece of drama. 99% of the people who see this movie will walk out on it. Unfortunately, there will be that 1% who will get some vicarious thrill from it, though they will cloak their enjoyment in intellectual babble. After sitting thorough some horrific violence and soulless sex, I fast forwarded to other scenes on the DVD, just too see what the director's idea of dramatic set-up was. It was uninspired, trite, and amateurish.There have been plenty of movies that have dealt with both violence and sex that manage to do it in creative and truly inspiring and profound ways. Simply showing a woman being raped in hyper-realistic fashion or again, filming a man getting being murdered by having his head bashed over and over again by a fire extinguisher is not daring. It is pathologically immature, crude and the antithesis of what art is.I feel sorry for the director because something must have happened in the director's life that the director is trying to expunge by making this in affect a reanactment. At least I can only hope that was the reason this movie was made. Otherwise it truly is a disturbed fetish being enacted.</fullReview>

Understand this, I have nothing against powerful images, but it has to be used for a purpose (I wasn't too surprised when I found out Mr Noe was involved in Baise-moi) Time destroys everything, is that supposed to be deep?

		<shortDescription>Irreversible: Noe's Cosmic Determinism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Irreversible....very difficult to watch. On the surface, the movie is very exploitive. It simultaneously arouses the two worst feelings possible: anger and helplessness. Below the surface, the movie may be more depressing than the rape of Monica Bellucci and the mistaken vengeance that it inspires. I think there's a deeper philosophical idea underlying this movie and it's not a happy one. At one point we see a poster of 2001: A Space Odyssey as the movie keeps segueing into the past. How is Irreversible related to 2001? Recall how Kubrick showed a very brief glimpse into the prehistory of humans at the beginning of 2001, before leaping far into the future Space Age? And in both time periods, Kubrick's work is imbued with a chronic pessimism about humanity. During the prehistoric era, our capacity to evolve and survive depended on the ability to create crude tools which we promptly used to exterminate rival gangs of pre-humans. In the Space Age our ability to break the bonds of Earth and explore Space depends on our ability to create more sophisticated tools: building and programming supercomputers, like HAL. But eventually that also winds up biting us in the ass. Noe, does the opposite, sort of. He shows segments of three individuals' lives but he starts in the Present and keeps going back further to the past. Noe seems intent on showing how what happens to humans is not just dependent on the past but, in fact, strictly determined by the past. At the end of the movie he has apparently gone all the way back to the Big Bang (Really intense flashing white light and sonic rumbling from the audio track). What is Noe getting at? Is it something more deeply pessimistic than even Kubrick dared imagine? What does Noe mean by the title "Irreversible" ? Is it that conditions for the subsequent evolution of our universe were fixed by the initial conditions of the Big Bang and nothing can change what happens later; and the really radical idea that this strict determinism applies to human actions just as much as it does to, for example, star formation in some far-flung corner of the universe??? That humans do not in fact possess Free Will but are just part of the universe undergoing changes by responding to forces and psychological pressures which all follow precisely from what has happened in the past?? If this is what Noe is conveying, it is very very DARK in a way that goes beyond Kubrick: we're not just violent and hedonistic, we really don't have any choice in the matter. For Noe, being "One With The Universe" isn't a pop slogan from the 60's accompanied by warm feelings of emotional wellbeing; it's a stark physical fact involving a collapse to nihilism. As Time destroys everything, maybe there are no good or bad deeds, just simply "deeds", or as a physicist would call them, "events". Noe = Nietzsche ??: Psychologically, intelligent beings can't evolve in any other direction: the struggle for existence forces us to conceive of ourselves as Free. One of necessary preconditions in the struggle for survival may be intellectual Error. Our perception of ourselves as free sentient inner-directed Agents: just a little joke played on us by the universe as it bends us over and we take it in the Rectum.  "Irreversible": the universe as one big Process that, once set in motion, will evolve according to it's own laws and cannot be changed even by human awareness of this Process since our awareness is just one aspect that's been set in motion. Anyway, I hope this isn't what Noe intended because it's very depressing. And even if Noe didn't intend this, maybe it's true nonetheless. Scary thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreversible gets more and more disturbing as it gets more and more pleasant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a couple of reasons why this movies plays backwards. First, it keeps you ignorant about what had happened to provoke all the mayhem. Second, it puts you in the position of knowing what is eventually going to happen. That way viewer always remains a step ahead of protagonists. We see them weighing ways they might go with, knowing what way they're eventually going to choose. Third, you can't initially sympathize with characters since you don't know them. Fourth, as you continue to delve more into past, you become more and more horrified at the fate protagonists are ignorant about which you just know to well.Look at the notorious rape scene. I didn't watch it completely - it was to obnoxious. What makes Irreversible so great is that it somehow makes the rape scene even more obnoxious as it comes to past (from viewers standpoint). It's initially disgusting and violent but it later becomes more frightening; it keeps carving deeper into your heart and memory as you get to know Alex.A substantial amount of the movie we watch Alex' boyfriend, Marcus, going for a revenge. He goes through a very disturbing milieu where sex is enjoyed more than anything else. Very soon we get to know that revenge plan didn't go as planned. Marcus shouldn't have gone with it in the first place. But nevertheless, movie keeps playing backwards and we keep seeing Marcus desperately taking all the necessary action to find rapist and take revenge. It's very hard to watch someone's life going down the spiral as he takes wrong road which we doubtlessly know is wrong. That night in Paris everything went wrong.In conclusion, this is not a movie I could recommend. If you can take dark and very depressing tone with some extremely brutal violence you might be able to go under the surface and think more deeply about the lesson Irreversible delivers. If not, you'll probably be stuck with burdensome feelings as you see time destroying even the most beautiful things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the start of this movie hits hard and its ugly, if i had of walked away or turned off, i would have missed out, i must admit the length of rape scene is extremely hard to sit through. but the most amazing thing in the film, is that we as the viewer know what is going to happen, and have to make the decision if we are going to go to the rape, and i found that was done brilliant... before the rape scene even happens..... i was watching just going no no no, don't go down there. maybe because it was subtitled i thought the language that was used in the scene so disturbing(to be honest i might have made a cup of tea about 3 mins in)the scene is unrelenting and goes for an eternity....but for me the second half is what makes irreversible a winner. it is really beautiful, some people mention clockwork orange, but to me it is almost a love letter to 2001 a space odyssey. i don't like graphic violent films...but this film, it has context and works... I've heard cassell &amp; bellucci say this film will be talked about in film schools for years to come. i agree. its also one of those frustrating films in that i would hate for it to be put with exploitation &amp; genre films because of the first half. i will leave my review at that, i'm waiting for gasper noe to make another great film..... as ENTER THE VOID.....was a movie i had been hanging out to see. and i rate it a 1.....one of the most boring movies i have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand what Noe goes for in the dizzying shots representative of chaos but it's a bit too lofty here. I wasn't even sick during the first 20 or so minutes that the camera goes ape but more annoyed as I was trying to determine the location/setting and was getting nowhere. The entire backwards filming fell short to me as everything pretty much lost relevance after the rape scene. The entire goal for me as an audience was to find out who indeed raped Alex and if she was avenged. The film moving backwards was entirely counterproductive as we find out "The Tenia" WAS NOT the drugged up individual who Pierre ruthlessly murdered. The whole scene happened in the same night and both the real and fake Tenia wore different clothing AND seemed to look different. The only thing that could link them as far as I could tell was that the rapist chose her anus, seeming like a weak link to homosexuality which would have served to place him at The Rectum BUT even so, that place was such a madhouse, the fact that they determined the fake Tenia was Tenia from virtually complete silence was just ridiculous. This lead me to believe an innocent person was killed.Skipping past that however, the rest of the film after she got raped was simply Pierre whining about coulda-shoulda-woulda's concerning his past relationship with Alex (which was 3 years ago) sounding like a sad loser and his constant insulting of Marcus - who I honestly thought was going to beat the snot out of him because he took it WAY too far. The film then fizzles out to their mundane sleep scene showcasing a normal life. Granted, this was to show anything can happen but it could have done so without trying to be avant-garde and just show the movie in a forward setting. The final shots were just lazy in my opinion. The pregnancy to add the typical emotions to the viewer followed by her holding her stomach assumedly in a flashback... farther back? The film then finally flashes back to her reading a book on grass which symbolizes nothing at all. We are then finally subjected to a torturous minute or so of grating noise accompanies by seizure-inducing flashes that apparently are supposed to symbolize chaos but really just symbolize Noe subjecting us to torture. We then see text about time destroying all things, a broad philosophy that is actually too broad to have any direct correlation to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Time destroys everything". So begins and ends Gaspar Noe's scandalous film Irreversible, a film so dark and cruel that most people will find themselves either in tears, rage, or their own vomit when they watch it. Not only is it dark and cruel, it's traumatize, tragic, and shattering all at the same time, not to mention nauseating. And when I say nauseating, I'm referring to the cinematography, particularly in the beginning of the film. The camera swoops around all sorts of Paris streets and buildings in an incoherent and gratuitous manner, as if it were on a roller coaster. Add to that brutal violence, which includes a scene of someone's head getting obliterated with a fire extinguisher and top it all off with a scene in which a women gets pinned down, raped, and beaten for ten minutes while the stationary camera looks on, unflinching. That is the most unwatchable part of the movie. Nobody deserves to suffer like that. It was Monica Bellucci's screaming that made the scene unwatchable. But take away all the unnecessary violence and camera work, and you have a well-crafted, thought-provoking piece of art. I don't think there is any other film that captures the true horror of rape so well. I mentioned in a post before that I cannot recommend this film to most people, especially the faint of heart, due to its extreme content. I would give this film a very high rating if it weren't for its gratuitous violence and nauseating camera work. Because of that, I have to cut it down to an 8/10 RATING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irrevrsible is about human's powerlessness to stop or alter the events set in motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some may say that it is a well told story about seeking revenge and the implications that it has, but to me Irreversible is more than that. It is about the inevitability of things and human's powerlessness to stop or alter the events set in motion. It's about the theory that whatever will happen will happen and that humans are left with the option of observing as things occur in their lives, as it is out of their control to change these events. In the film the female protagonist has a dream that in a way predicts what is about to happen to her later on that day (same goes for the guy who wakes up with his hand feeling numb). The director tells the story in reverse order, in a way not justifying the act of vengeance, and begins the movie with the camera completely spiraling out of control with the subjects rarely being in frame or filmed in a coherent viewpoint. As the film continues to go back in time from scene to scene the camera becomes steadier and steadier with the frame view being more and more centered on the character's profiles. Using this, the director wants to show the unraveling of the fury and madness of the human mind that increases towards the end of the story and the beginning of the movie, with even the most rational character in the film descending into actions of extreme violence after being affected by previous events. This craziness disappears in the happier lighter parts of the characters' day and the spinning returns at the very end of the film, in a way emphasizing again our fate; to be completely helpless and option-less in a world that keeps spinning madly around us. Time ruins everything ? the director proclaims. Indeed as seen through the characters of this story, time brings with it a realisation of the many things that will occur in a person's life that will destroy his psyche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Way beyond three years, when I started my journey into the films my all time urge was to see a film that disturbs me. I have seen pretty decent films which create chaotic, heart breaking, and brain tearing thoughts in our minds. But I was always in search of a film which returns a terrific message as a gift. Irreversible, as the name stares in front of us, it really becomes gloomy and more soul wrenching while it helps us dissolve into it. Gaspar Noe, is a director who can capture the moments which stays with a viewer even after a long time of finishing of the film. The cinematography, camera work, frame settling and each other technical aspect handled by director are well driven. All these moments help the patrons build up their nervous veins more tense and more shivering to welcome each delivered scene. This was the film where with all naked mind, I couldn't find any flaws or technical mistakes. The characters are well equipped with their techniques and an art to act. Their chemistry is too strong and the relation they maintain is top notch. The greatest viewpoint of the film is how much can a moviegoer accept whatever the director attempts to display. The film tries to show all of the raw materials around from which any spectator tries to learn deep message it delivers. But certainly, the message rests still with soul, while this is a film not to enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the New French Extremity movement with films like Martyrs and Frontiers I thought id give Irreversible a viewing. I wasn't disappointed and Gasper Noe did an amazing job.As a pre warning I can see how this movie at times can be difficult to watch, a 10 minute rape scene involving lead Monica Bellucci was very horrific one of the worst in film history, but this scene is what the film is based around.The movie is great cinematography with the events being told in reverse chronological order So the film begins with a man named Pierre being arrested after he and friend Marcus are seen bashing a 'Le Tenia' head in with a fire extinguisher. With great lighting and intense filming we see these men show erratic behaviour for a while until we hit that scene... The brutal 10 minute rape scene that will shock everyone. From that moment we realise the movie is a bout Marcus wanting revenge for his partner Alex brutal assault and her Ex Pierre citing revenge. From that moment on we see the events leading up to that night including a part scene and regular young group of friend scenes...The ending has a moving scene when we realise Alex that morning had found out she was pregnant.Gasper Noe cleverly showed how time can change a whole lifetime, Alex woke up a happy free young woman with love all around and how over the course of that night everything changed Defiantly hard to watch but great directing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible is a puzzle for the mind. Told in backwards chronology it tells the story of a young, beautiful woman who becomes the victim of a terrible crime. While walking home from a night out, Alex is attacked and raped by a homosexual man in a tunnel, which leads her boyfriend to look for revenge on a bloody rampage through the dark underworld of Paris. The cinematography is stunning although it could make some people dizzy because of the use of spinning cameras and the extensive use of the color red. After the premiere, the movies reception pulverized the critics and audience and alike. The film is well told and thought provoking, beautifully composed and well acted but the long and very graphic scene showing the extreme violence and cruelty of the assault and rape made a lot of people sick.Its hard to sit through but in the end, the film does make sense in a wonderful and weird way that only Caspar Noe can seem to achieve. Not the ultimate masterpiece but a truly special and philosophical film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is one of those hard jab on the stomach for viewers as it presents a very graphic and convincing imagery of brutality up close. It also presents us with a sublime sense of cinematography as the filmmakers take us in and out through the movie with the swirling camera trick, and executes the scenes in long sequences. The story flow may be a double edge for the movie, though. In one side, it helps to tone down the brutal scene through the careful placing of the scene ordering. But in one side, without any markers, this can also confuse less experienced viewers as to how the real chronology of the story takes place. The acting overall is quite good. Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel did great jobs in portraying their characters, especially for Bellucci.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike most films, Irreversible leaves a pretty strong impression on you. The film is pretty graphic and the style of filming is experimentally effective, putting you in a mind bending, sick sensation. The story of revenge is clichéd, but freshly imagined in this film by adding the backwards telling of the story and the extremity of its climaxes. But after you experience the first half of the film, the intensity lessens ten fold into a more romantic bore fest with maybe too much metaphor than substance. But nonetheless, the film has more than enough redeeming qualities for you to forget the second act and focus on the disturbing themes of the first act. Truly a great, slightly flawed, film that will leave you feeling effectively empty and questioning your own values.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a horror film, but a jarring punch in the face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a horror film, but a jarring punch in the face and is rightfully credited as the "most walked out of movie of 2002&#x2033; by Newsweek. This one's not for everyone, to say the least, but those that can appreciate such exploitation tend to love it.Bellucci's Alex character is sublime in her vulnerability and the primary sequence that is the film's focal point is acted more realistically than any other dramatization I've seen before. (Even if the ahem "tool" used was entirely C.G.I.!)There are fringe conversations and scenes that seem almost normal at first until you really pay attention and then you step back and wonder "Did that old man really just utter ?" or "Did that guy at the club really just ??!!" Disturbing! (By the way- the club's called "The Rectum" and the name pretty much says it all.)There's plenty of action to say the least and the story is told entirely in reverse, which of course plays on the title. It makes you want to solve the mystery of sorts as the viewer, so it was an interesting way to present the film. It also gave more of a sense of urgency and ultimately disappointment toward the whole revenge aspect. Of course, other films have used the sequencing trick or something similar, but it doesn't ever give an air of being cliché. In fact, I would go so far as to call it innovative in certain ways.I didn't care for lighting in the club. Yes, I realize clubs are dark, but I wonder if Noé's transfer of 16mm to 35mm diminished any of the picture quality to the extent that the lighting was affected. The soundtrack is bizarre and uncomfortable, yet fitting to the movie. Movement is continuous and kept my attention completely. To be blunt, the CAT III version of this movie is tamer than the French release. You've been warned. Of course- all subs and no dubs if you watch it. This is one of my favorite films, but then again my tastes are not generally that of the average girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Irreversible" is a brilliant creation of brilliant mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Irreversible" is a film that you will find unwatchable. Even if you do manage to stay in the theater seat till the end of it while you see others walk away, it's a film that will make you cringe to the bone and one that you will desperately wish you could forget. Cruelty of the most repugnant kind around which the story revolves will try your patience and in all probability, make you want to throw up, not once, not twice but several times. In the beginning, the camera sinisterly pans across the "inverse" opening credits employing flipping letters and words that strike the viewer with a sense of suspense, urgency, and fear. You just know that something profound is going to happen. The events of the story span across a single, harrowing night &amp; the narrative, fashioned in a striking, reverse-chronological order (the story is told backward). If the film was made in the customary chronological order, we would meet a couple Alex (Monica Bellucci) and Marcus (Vincent Cassel) very much in love, relaxing and having sex. They are at perfect ease with each other. Alex has missed her period and is uneasy with the feeling that she might be pregnant. She shares the possibility with her lover who looks excited at the prospect of having a baby. The couple have a friends' party to attend later in the day and Marcus's best friend &amp; Alex's ex-lover, Pierre (Albert Dupontel) would attend it, too. Marcus wants to be kind to him and goes out to fetch wine while Alex takes a pregnancy test and discovers she is pregnant. She is elated. We would then see them at the party. Marcus tries to get Pierre to hump one of his girlfriends while he himself tries to get a kick out of smack. Alex is wildly dancing with her girlfriends, wearing a dress that doesn't leave much to the viewer's imagination. A man also happens to ask how his lover could let her go about in public dressed in that, hinting that he could very well be a voyeur. Alex is upset with Marcus and his reckless activity and leaves early for home. Pierre requests her to stay back but she doesn't, promising she'd call him the next day. Alex doesn't get a taxi. So, she walks alone in the subway tunnel that has garish red-lights and witnesses a transvestite whore getting beaten up by the pimp, Le Tenia (Jo Prestia). She tries to flee but is aggressively accosted by the man and brutally raped in the desolate tunnel. When he sees Alex crouching helplessly, he makes it clear that he isn't done with her yet and mercilessly beats her up for seemingly, an eternity. The camera shamelessly refuses to cut away. The horror and the traumatic, suppressed moans of the victim go on and on, giving the viewer goosebumps that refuse to go. Marcus &amp; Pierre hear a chaos on the street after they come out of the party. Both are devastated to see the bloodied face of Alex. The cops make an empty promise that they will very soon nab the culprit. A burly man randomly walks up to Marcus and urges him to be a man and revenge his lover's death since he knows the cops would do nothing about it. Marcus goes mad in rage and they go about frantically searching for Le Tenia and their quest leads them to a gay-club, named "Rectum", where they get hold of the wrong guy and beats him and batters his face with a fire-extinguisher. This scene goes on unrelentingly, too, as the rape scene. The camera seems to have a hammering effect, too. The effect precedes the cause. The director must have deliberately employed the reverse-chronological narrative because he knew that there is no better way to pound the audience down with the film's unflinching honesty. The rape scene almost makes you feel ashamed of calling yourself a "human being". It reveals the monstrous side of us that is ghastly to the point of being unbearable. The morbidity will tear apart the insides of you and make you cover your face in shame and cower in your seat in fear. The film breaks structure, no doubt, but I haven't seen a more well- structured film as this before. The rape deliberately happens before the couple's lovemaking scene, firstly, so the director can compel us to sit and endure the torture that the victim endures, and, secondly, because he wants to make us realize that our happiness rests on a thin, fragile thread. We cannot, in any way, whatsoever, predict our future and sometimes, that is a blessing and not a curse. What will drive you to insane fury is the manner in which Alex fights till the very end. She is not just the heroine who can kiss and make passionate love. She is a fighter, too, who exhibits fierce survival instinct. She loses but doesn't surrender. You will be so deeply empathizing with Alex that you will almost find yourself praying for her safety when she decides to leave for home all by herself in the late hours of the night. You'll wish she didn't wear that revealing dress and risk her safety. It's true women are free to wear whatever they want and however they please &amp; Alex does look stunning in that dress she's wearing to the party but it, sometimes, isn't a safe and wise thing to do. "Irreversible" is a brutally honest film made with a lot of courage. It demands an equal amount of courage from the audience. "Irreversible" is a far cry from entertainment and does nothing to amuse and pander. It, however, lingers on in your head forever for its emotional complexity and deeply humanist outlook. Yes, it is disturbingly unforgettable. You may call Gasper Noé a misogynist, a homophobic or a provocateur but you can't be indifferent to his film. It is certainly a brilliant creation of a brilliant mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit that if someone said that this film was amazing and that this film was crap I would agree with both of them. This is my first review on IMDb, and it's because of the intense feelings I have towards this film and why I believe I need to explain the 6/10. First, the beginning of the film is awful. Yes, it is supposed to portray the mindset of the characters, increase the violence, and possibly nauseate the audience. And it is effective. But the camera movement is absolutely awful. It gets to the point where one cannot understand anything that is going on and it distracts from the movie. The film is pretty awful until the rape scene. Before that, everything (besides the actual plot and acting) feels like standard Gaspar Noe techniques. The rest of the film isn't actually interesting, but the events that have come before them gives them additional meaning and actual creates interest for the viewer. The backwards story-telling allowed for me to make decisions about the characters and their actions during the scene, since I knew what would happen. The acting was also incredible and the complexity of the characters is not seen often enough. At times, the film felt too indulgent (not the rape scene) or just unimportant. Noe had to take long shots and I applaud him for that and I would hate it if he cut out the ends of scenes to make it quicker, so it was really a catch 22 for him. If not for the well executed middle to end of the film, I would have given it a 4/10. If not for the awful beginning, unimportant, or lengthy parts I would have given it an 8/10 most likely.</fullReview>

Starting with the latest scene, and then moving backwards in time, it is incredibly effective. Like Memento, the plot would have been superb in normal forward order, yet in backward order it is even better. Excellent direction from Gaspar Noe helps too. Very gritty action scenes, and good build up of tension, backwards. Monica Bellucci is stunningly beautiful and brilliant.

I personally rated it 5/10 stars, but would have rated it higher if not for the camera work in the first 25 minutes.The story is told in reverse-chronological order. It starts at the very end of the story. The first 16 minutes are almost unbearable. Not only do you not know what's going on, but it's made worse by the camera turning and twisting every which way, making the viewer nauseous at times.Once you make it through that part, you'll have to hang on just a little bit longer. Each scene gets better, both with comprehension and a steadier camera. At about 41 minutes, you get to the heart of the story. From there, the camera is pretty much steady until the end of the movie.But be warned, at the 44 minute mark, you'll be witness to a gut-wrenching scene that lasts a horrifying 12 minutes. This is not for the faint of heart.The rest of movie is pretty mellow in comparison. The movie ends (begins) on a positive note ... until your brain catches up and you remember the beginning (end) of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of Gaspar Noe's work, this movie didn't disappoint! The beginning (end?) of the movie is a dizzying and nauseating ride- which I later read in the trivia was exactly his point. As my friend's around me began to drop like flies from the sound and visuals- I was drawn closer, completely intrigued that Noe always manages to make his films a whole body experience. I had recently seen "A Serbian Film" and saw many comparisons between the two- mostly arguing which was more EXTREME. Well, I can safely say that Irreversible made me more uncomfortable and I found to be much more thought provoking than A Serbian Film. However, again (and this may just be a fault with my own movie viewing), but I found the ending (beginning?) to be quite predictable. I guess there may have been nowhere else to go with it that would really hit where it hurt, but I sort of saw it coming. Great film nevertheless and I would definitely recommend. It felt more REAL to me than most movies, and that makes it truly horrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, grim, disorienting, and unflinching filmmaking. Will surely scare away most, but will reward the brave with a challenging experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brutal, realistic, and disorienting. "Irreversible" is told via the effective reverse expository method of Memento. When the viewer finally figures out exactly what is going on, he/she will feel a sense of vertigo as the previous events fall into place, and the brutality committed at the films beginning/end becomes something that the viewer can sympathize with. The film does not shy away from showing just how inhuman and terrifying the act of rape can be. The extraordinarily beautiful Monica Bellucci is the ideal actress to portray a woman who is unfortunately caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and falls victim to a depraved pervert who lacks empathy and morality. Her character makes a poor decision, and unfortunately thats all it takes in this world. Director Gaspar Noe has a brave unflinching artistic yet realistic directorial style, and this movie is his best since "Mysterious Skin". He creates effective visual tension and mood. The acting is all top notch. This film is a low-budget french film, so don't go in expecting glossy Hollywood style filmmaking. Rape is a subject that is usually shied away from as the central idea for a movie, and for good reason. Nobody likes to see such a terrible thing being done to women(aside from rapists themselves), so don't expect to enjoy this film. What the film does offer is a journey into the very heart of those whose lives are destroyed by this kind of horror. The films ending/beginning is as brutal and unflinching as the rape itself, so be prepared for lots of explicit violence, language, and nudity. Watch this film, and allow yourself to feel the rage of Cassells character, as his whole world is destroyed. His character is quickly overcome by his desire for revenge and becomes more and more unhinged as the film progresses/regresses so too does the camera-work and visual style of the film. All in all "Irreversible" is a dark and grim film of love, terror, tragedy and revenge. Not for the faint of heart, but rewarding for viewers looking for something challenging.</fullReview>

I actually hadn't bothered to see what the films storyline was before watching it, yes I'd heard it was controversial, but that's really all. But then... I like controversial.I find it a little laughable really, all the big, deep, meanings being drawn from the flick which seem to pervade every review before mine. Don't you all think that maybe, sometimes, you might be giving a film more credit than its due? I see this often on IMDb, maybe it gives the impression that the poster is more arty, and intellectual than the rest of us by declaring they saw all this depth herein, but to be honest, human life just ain't so multilayered.The story of the movie is, boy meets girl, they go out to a party, boy acts a bit of an arse while on drugs, girl leaves party, gets attacked and raped, and boy hunts down assailant to dish out revenge. Not really that original really then eh? But run it all in reverse, and it adds a slightly less obvious slant to things. There are two scenes which brought all the controversy, the rape, and the squishing of a head with a fire extinguisher. That's it. Now it's true the rape is pretty rough (although The Accused with Jody Foster many years ago left a worst taste for me to be honest) but the fire extinguisher head crush is obviously CGI and since 2003, when this was made, there have been much worse things put to celluloid. If this movie ran forwards, it would be said to be dumb and pointless, yet here we are with it getting all this art-house applause. Don't get me wrong, I thought the film was good, and I suppose quite memorable, but so many thin plot flicks could easily have done the same thing after this release and ran in reverse to gain some points. To end, I didn't think it was all that shocking. I would have liked the guy who actually did the rape to have come to a brutal end, rather than some mistaken identity. But that's just me. Guess it gave it a much darker vibe though with the assailant getting away unpunished. I must admit too, that the English subs on my copy were pretty bad. And I don't know if it was intentional or not, but there were a few places I laughed at the comedic dialogue around the name of the gay club. I don't think so many would be shocked at this now. Or maybe I've just seen too many violent flicks like Torched, Grotesque, A Serbian Film, Human Centipede 2 (although that was a comedy), and Martyrs etc. I wouldn't watch a movie like Cannibal Holocaust again though, due to the animal death scenes, but then that's real, and this isn't. So some old movies do still shock I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though he's only made three feature films, director Gaspar Noe has made a name for himself, especially as connected to the New French Extremity movement in cinema. His movies are dark, unsettling, and follow the theme that time destroys everything.That theme is explicitly stated in "Irreversible", Noe's second film. The plot of this movie is simple: a woman is raped and her boyfriend teams up with her ex-boyfriend to get revenge. What makes this movie unique is that the sequence of events is shown in reverse order. If you don't recognize that's what's going on, the movie will make absolutely no sense.We begin at the ending of the story (actually, the movie starts with the end credits), and the final scene is where the story starts. By doing this, the entire theme of the revenge genre is turned on it's head. What would normally be seen as a movie about consequences now becomes a movie more about predestination. You get the impression that the events in the movie had to happen that way - nobody had any choice in the matter. Events and conversations that don't make sense when you see them become all too clear later in the movie, when it's earlier in time. In addition, showing the revenge before the crime forces the audience to consider the morality of the situation from a different perspective - you literally see how revenge doesn't change anything.The movie is quite controversial for its two violent scenes - the rape and the revenge. Those two scenes are extremely hard to watch.Noe is also known for loopy camera work, strobe lighting, and low-frequency noises. This is a diabolically effective way to keep the viewer psychologically uncomfortable and disoriented, which makes the impact of the movie all the more intense."Irreversible" is a dark, violent, existentially depressing meditation on vulnerability, rage, and the impossibility of fixing things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good movie if you want to know how fragile and helpless girls are in the face of danger. Though, I have to warn you if your an aesthetics lover- STAY AWAY, movies has a lot of blood and female abuse. After watching it I look on females differently hence, with all this emancipation we forget that they're weak and they need protection no matter what. The movie also shows how despicable, oblivious and selfish the one should be to perform such an evil doing to a helpless girl. Another thing learned, is that it can be any one, no girl is protected unless there is a man nearby. The main character(Bellucci) was a rich girl that usually never get into a mess like that but this time she got unlucky, so it shows that abuse can happen to any women and the one should always be alert and ready</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty, raw depiction of vindictive violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoa! This is one film which I wouldn't watch another time, at all costs. I have watched it twice in a single go and it was an emotionally exhaustive and disturbing experience. I was deeply moved with the truth the film literally spats at the viewer's face. Hats off to Gaspar Noe for coming up with this innovative and far from entertaining tale that is so gritty and real that discomposing the viewer seems to the motive and the field where it scores, severely.The irreversible tale told in reverse order is a typical 'rape and revenge tale' but the reverse order itself is the unique thing in the film that tackles the story from a different perspective. The name "Irreversible" ('e' laterally inverted) refers to both the reverse nature of the chronology of events in the film as well as the irreversible nature of catastrophes that befall commoners' lives. The story first shows what happens to the protagonists in the end and then travels backwards to explore their day before the mishap. The story first shows the revenge, then the rape and then forces you to sit through for another forty five minutes wondering about the horrific events that are triggered by rape. The final scene is particularly most difficult to watch for we see the woman in her happiest moments much before the rape but fact that we see after the rape makes it even worse. Also, the last scene shows how calm and ordinary the woman, who was repulsive and resisting in the earlier scenes, could be.The violent scenes were not as horrific and disturbing as other reviewers claimed but the movie, as a whole, is. Two particular violent scenes tend to be never-ending but are done realistically. The camera, which never cuts between the scenes, is an icing on the cake and contributes to the relatability of the scenes. Words fail me to describe the cinematography of the film (no pun intended). It is the best I have ever witnessed. It is not visually stunning and doesn't capture extraneous landscapes of New Zealand or Amazon Rainforest but instead it is grueling and never shuns away from the atrocities happening. The camera never cuts between the thirteen scenes and the transition from one scene to another is also innovative; it slides all over the set to get to the next set before you make out the instant where the scene changes. In the party scene, I gloated at how the director and the cinematographer managed to get the scene arranged. It runs for fifteen minutes and the camera runs through the floors among the detestable, intoxicated people dancing, making out, snorting and partying. The dialogues in the next (or rather previous) scene where they are in the metro on the way to the club are ironic and witty. Case in point, the woman's pleasure being the man's pleasure according to the woman is a clear cut reference to the rape where the man's pleasure is in no way the woman's.The initial fifteen minutes at the gay club might put you completely off the film but dare to sit through the rest of the film if you can. The gay club scene is very graphic but the meager lighting and shaky hand- held camera conceals most of it in the darkness. If you pay attention, the scene might be most disturbing. The scene has strong BDSM themes with minimal dialog, be warned.Coming to the director, I am mesmerized by his abilities and have become a fan of Gaspar Noe. I am looking forward to see his next film "Enter the Void" sometime soon. He is a storyteller of an unrivalled caliber who does wonders in this film with his strong hold over the screenplay, chronology, dialogues and emotions. The film has many things to look out for, with the cinematography and the reality elements topping the list.Monica Bellucci is unarguably the star of the show. Making a late appearance at the fortieth minute, she dominates all the sequences that follow. She commands supremacy over her costars and is least apologetic of the excessive nudity (the film is very frank and casual about it) and torture involved. She is a strong female character that is calm and conventional otherwise, but rebels and resists when necessary. She is amazing in the last scene when the pregnancy test results positive. Vincent Cassel is superb and shares a sizzling chemistry with his real- life soul mate Bellucci. The other actors are effective in their minor parts.Now, why did I have to watch the film twice successively? The film has deep inner meanings which can't be envisaged in one go. Although, most will find the film difficult to watch even once, I suggest watching it twice to understand the deeper meaning which can't be put together in mere words.Concluding the review, I would like to state that do not miss the film if given a chance, and sit through the film despite its repulsive nature. Being a sheer masterpiece and a landmark in French as well as world cinema, the film enjoys a storyline that is preeminent and told in a novel way with brilliantly executed and never to be made again scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monica Bellucci is Alex and Vincent Cassell is Marcus in a movie that runs backwards. The sex and violence are explicit; so take warning of a vicious 97 minutes to come.Alex is reading An Experiment with Time in a park with children running all around her as Beethoven is heard playing in the background. The camera spins faster and faster and a sign is displayed stating, time destroys everything.Marcus and Alex are having a conversation in bed, post coitus. She mentions a dream where she is in a red tunnel and brings up the possibility of being pregnant. He leaves to pick up a bottle of wine, and she takes a shower and uses a home test to confirm that she is with child. On a Paris metro train, Alex, Marcus, and Pierre talk about sex and during the conversation, it turns out that Pierre had dated Alex and he accuses Al of stealing her from him. The three are at a party and Alex leaves; becoming upset at Marcus' use of drugs and alcohol.On her way home, Alex sees a man beating a transsexual prostitute, who stops and turns his attention to her, raping and beating her at knife point. Marcus and Pierre pass by the crime scene and discover that Alex is the victim, and that she is in a coma. The two meet a couple of street criminals who offer help in finding the attacker for money. They eventually track down the rapist at a club and the conclusion is very interesting. Bellucci and Cassell are both outstanding, and Irreversible is quite memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The violence seems a necessary part of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't view this film for a long time. I was curious about the sound and editing techniques, but didn't want to watch the scenes of violence.But the violence of this film seems necessary to its narrative. It's rape in its reality. There is nowhere to run. It's an act that destroys a woman, then ends up destroying the men who want to commit revenge. I feel the director must have known someone who went through this or something similar. When Alex is talking about her dream, where the tunnel splits in two, it is clear she has a premonition of how her life will never be the same. That there is a before and after to her now. Two parts. I don't think this film would have the same amount of impact if it wasn't as violent as it is. Or as pretty as it is at the end of it. It is the parts of Alex, being shown on the screen, before and after.The way this film is presented is complete genius. I didn't even think I would like a film like this, but the pure chaos of sound and intriguing dizzying camera work creates the world where the characters, who were once peaceful and happy people, become frenzied, frantically searching for the rapist in a labyrinth nightmare of a SM gay club. The fact it is presented backwards and since the name, Irreversible, is a bold move. It ends on a happy ending. Of the woman, Alex, reading a book in a park where happy children run around her and an almost painful bombardment of 2001 type white flashes. It makes it even the more sad, that she thought her life and family were just beginning. Then the viewer has to think now, even if she wakes up from a coma, what life will she have? Her boyfriend's in jail for killing someone that wasn't even her rapist, due to his taste of revenge. Yet the end of the film is beautiful. It's all classical music and lightness...and hope. But there is no hope. Their lives are ruined, yet the view delights in the prettiness of us, that the horror is far away. Yet it isn't. This is what makes it amazing to me. I am not sure why people walked out of this film. Rapes and murders happen in real life. People's lives get ruined in a matter of minutes everyday. This isn't a film for entertainment, though I have never thought torture type films were entertaining, but this is a film that makes you think and feel, even if it is disgust in the beginning. The parallels between what the characters say at the end of the film and what they say at the beginning is interesting too.I probably won't view this film a second time, but it is the best film I'll most likely never see again. It's very intense and creates a mood which is hard to stomach on so many levels. But that is what I feel true cinema is. It takes risks, it has people walk out on it, it says something. It isn't like a cheap horror film that uses violence to titillate, it's a landmark in filmmaking that tells it like it is and has no qualms about it and doesn't apologize. I wish more films were like this, even non-violent ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional and psychological torture device.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not giving this film any stars, because the stars have no reason to shine here. If you think after seeing Deliverance, A Clockwork Orange, Blue Velvet or Straw Dogs, you can take violence on screen easily, you're dead wrong about this one. It's malignant, repulsive and beyond shocking, to the point of traumatizing the viewer. Apart from the unforgivable violent acts such as the 10 minute graphic rape and beating of Monica Bellucci and the infamous face and head crushing of a man by a fire extinguisher, combined with explicit homophobic and misogynistic slurs, the film is told backwards, in the manner of Memento, and the more it goes further, the happier the story gets, and more the audience gets emotionally and mentally battered. And it doesn't stop there. In the beginning (or the end) there is a repetitive sound in the background combined with the wild behavior of the camera (akin to the scene in Fight Club where Brad Pitt's character talks to the audience and the screen's edges vibrate like crazy) that were put in to intentionally make the audience feel dizzy, nauseous and even more disturbed.This is a good film, well made with advanced technology and great acting but it will leave you feeling as though you had been beaten with a hammer over and over again, making you depressed for days, but feeling as though the experience was very important and educational. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I don't suggest you see it, but if you think you can handle it by staying through to the end, even though it's just a movie and it's not real, you'll feel relieved to have been able to have gone through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reverse is worse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Difficult viewing to say the least, those with a strong constitution will appreciate this brutal but compelling study of vigilante violence.Borrowing Memento's trick of playing in reverse we observe two friends, Marcus and Pierre, commit violent retribution against a (believed) rapist, and then watch as the story unfolds backward to uncover the real truth. Monica Belluchi is the girl who is raped and this film does not shy away from showing the horrific event in its entirety ? it's not a pleasant watch. As we travel adversely from darkness into light the film refuses to make judgements for us. The viewer is left to make up their own mind to whether the actions of the characters within are ever justifiable. It's hard uncompromising viewing, but at least it is cinema that gets a reaction from its audience - even it is one of shock and revulsion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This ain't no date movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot has been said about this controversial film, some people where shocked and offended, others did not know what to make of it. The bottom line is that it is an experimental film, it uses a basic plot of revenge told backwards, and if you can manage to watch it twice (which i did) it works. It's a raw brutal and challenging film to watch, some people will be put of by the very ugly rape scene, i think that scene upset a lot of viewers, and if people get upset by an extreme act of violence then they will dismiss the movie as trash,(don't listen to them) its a thought provoking film that will shake you to the core, and will linger in your mind, and thats what makes it a stand out from the other so called controversial films. The direction and performances are fine, although you may get a little dizzy with some of the camera work at the start of the movie, its all part of the chaos in which the main characters go through, a true descent of the depravity of human nature in which a random act of violence can change peoples lives and there behaviour forever. If your looking for something with a dark edge and if you can handle extreme cinema then look no further, a difficult film to watch YES but well worth the journey.</fullReview>

I don't know if all ten minute of rape were necessary for us to know that a character had been raped, but the brutality does alter the context of everything in the film. It's really disturbing, and manages to employ the backwards editing technique to great effect. The acting was amazing, the Godardesque discussion on the train was hilarious, and the 2001 wormhole ending was brilliant. I didn't get the part at the beginning with the old guys though, over all I was pretty blown away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile but too often tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did so many people have trouble following this movie? Once you realize that the scenes are in reverse order -- which should become apparent early in the film -- the narrative is quite simple. And this is actually one of the film's weaknesses.In "Memento," for example, the labyrinthine reversed narrative continually forces the viewer to reinterpret everything seen earlier (later) in the movie. "5x2" provides increasing psychological depth and poignance as the story of the two lovers moves towards its conclusion (beginning). But with "Irreversible," it's just ... well, backwards. The relatively peaceful scenes following the rape are, for the most part, tedious and dull and overlong. The big "surprise" near the end is a wet firecracker compared to several of the powerful scenes in the first part of the film.It is these earlier scenes from which "Irreversible" has surely gained its accolades, and much of this praise is well deserved. Both the rape and (especially) the attack with the fire extinguisher are truly horrifying -- and that's a good thing. Rarely has the repellence of brutal acts like these been caught so vividly on film.The spinning, meandering camera-work and monotonous thudding soundtrack are less successful, however. The techniques themselves are interesting and effective at first, but the viewer's initial sense of disorientation and unease soon turns to simple irritation as the sight and sound gimmicks overstay their welcome."Irreversible" contains a number of powerful scenes and is well worth seeing for those who can stomach the violence. Just don't come in expecting a brilliant narrative, depth of characterization, or psychological complexity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see this movie and could not relate to it. I could not find the basic point of the movie. First of all this is a movie that tries to show that only human can treat other humans like animal and in the process himself became an animal. The rape scene is designed to be repulsive and totally is. But the problem is that the rapist is an animal even before he begins his savage act. Another below to the movie and its message comes from unfolding of the story which is in reverse order. this is a major below because it puts the rape scene near the beginning of the movie . The revenge scene before the rape, so the viewer does not have any antipathy to the rapist and just watches a pointless act of violence(till that time in the movie) and the movie ends with a paradise like scene, which is contrary to the main point of the movie. But I think the rape scene is one of the most effective and hopeful of that kind and in this respect even surpass the similar scenes in Salo. Film has a good message but it is delivered by only one scene and not the whole movie, and because of this its effect has been diluted</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original idea, but lack of climax after the climax ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**1/2 *** Spoilers ahead ***Now this is a really intense drama. Great performances, great plot, great atmosphere. What's with the rating then? It's not because this is an intense drama, it's supposed to be good. Irreversible is a movie about a rape occasion that's starts a whole mess. The main message of the movie is to show us that sometimes that's nothing else than vengeance for a solution. But this movie is very uninteresting.Since the movie is told backwards, we feel really bothered by it after a couple of scenes. What was supposed to be a story told normally, developing the climax of the movie to the end, is actually a story which shows us the climax in the beginning and then shows us what really happened before that. There's simply nothing wrong with that at all, but the main problem with Irreversible is that there are not much interesting things to find out, after you realize what is it about.Examples: the only actually good information we can come up with is that Alex and Pierre were once together. Their sex wasn't really good, or at least not as it should be, Marcus taking drugs and at the very end of the movie, Alex's pregnancy. Not much else.This was really well directed. Performances by Belluci and Cassel are simply terrific. But if this movie really intended to keep us in the edge of our seat the whole duration of it, the rating would definitely be a little higher. Still, it's just my opinion. See it for yourself, you might enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a horrific slice of real life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film can be a powerful medium and here it uses these extremes to take us to a part of our world and our nature that not everyone wants to see. I had a long think after watching this film and tried to imagine what the outcome would have been like if it had not been told in the unconventional style that it was. I thought "would it not have made the rape scene more powerful and affecting if we had been allowed to know the character and maybe not just see her as some stranger. the conclusion i eventually reached was no mostly because i imagine this as being done in the style of a newspaper article, maybe you hear something of a woman being raped on the news and then you pick up a newspaper and read about her life or how many children she has who have been affected. Presenting it this way at the start you wonder why he wants revenge and then you have all the evidence for it laid out in front of you. This rape scene was hard to stomach purely because of the fixed camera and no cuts, it feel more like the rapist was filming his crime for his own gratification, I felt a huge stir of sadness and sympathy for this woman even though i knew nothing of her, I also felt anger at the man who appears in the distance and just walks away. when the camera did move it was a dizzying unnatural movement that moves in for a close up and should make any decent moral soul turn away in disgust. all too often rape like murder is presented in a stylised shortened way with angles and editing but this is a raw honest portrayal of what i imagine a woman goes through and makes you feel the way it does due to its brutality and length.The film begins with the end credits and presents two horrific scenes of violence to draw you in, the camera sways and moves frantically around, a decision, which i feel may have been made to show you the intensity being felt by the main character as he moves around trying to find the rapist, we move from the street to a gay club and we are shown dizzying scenes of explicit nudity and foul language followed by the much talked about violent scene that ends the opening. It horrifies and although at first i was off put by the complex narrative flow by the time the rest of the film showing scenes of their life and plans for a night out and Alex's earlier life in reverse. you realise it was a good choice to present it this way and allows to you feel more sympathy for these people even though at times Pierre and Marcus appear a bit annoying especially during the train scene and Marcus allowing Alex to leave the party alone.Either way as Alex did not deserve the fate handed to her you feel that Pierre's defence of his friend and the revenge carried out is justified as the Tenia is presented as a totally remorseless character Its style unlike the dizzying jumping around of Memento makes it uncompromising but a powerful effective piece of storytelling, seeing Alex revert to innocence at the end is a beautifully poetic moment and makes us realise just how tragic a tale this is.I was deeply affected by the violence and sex scenes in this film on an emotional level and as important as films like this undoubtedly are i would not watch it again for quite some time. I recommend it to anyone wishing to learn how horrible these hate crimes are and how they affect people, i came to it as i had heard talk of the style and was a fan of Memento but usually i prefer fantasy films as opposed to such realistic portrayals of our world as i like to escape from it when i visit the cinema so it's no surprise to me i have only seen this now but it has affected me a lot and has encouraged me to sit up and write my first IMDb review which i hope you have found helpful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gaspar Noe's Irreversible is a demanding, somewhat unskilled blend of wonderful assets that produce mixed reactions on an objective, unbiased viewer. From the story ingredients to camera techniques or the plot development, Irreverible shows many things both to like and dislike. There are some good ideas, some real good film craftsmanship, being selfishly pushed a bit too far, undermining what is a remarkable film as a whole. The film starts demanding way too much on the viewer. The first ten to twenty minutes are a chaotic maelstrom that will put the viewer's stomach to the test: camera usage is nothing short of nightmarish, and there is some hardly paralleled graphic depiction of extreme violence. While all this fits a purpose it's being overtly overdone. The ensuing sequence of a brutal rape, filmed non-stop from start to end, adds fuel to the fire forcing the viewer to wonder whether Noe is actually putting all this in tape to enrich the story or to add some shock value. Take another sequence. Belucci in the WC doing a pregnancy test. Well, I think everyone in the target audience knows how those tests work, there's no need to tape Monica pissing there. Noe seems to have a problem here. This sequence reminded me of the scene in Seul Contre Tous in which the main character was watching some porn movie and we could see what was going on in screen. Mr. Noe, we could have figured out that piece of the action all by ourselves, thank you. Same goes to Von Trier's idioterne spasser gang bang sequence, or Almodovar's La Mala Educación anal lubrication scene. It's bad taste on screen, but a very out of place bad taste, unlike, let's say, Pink Flamingos. In John Waters' own words, "there is good bad taste and bad bad taste". I personally enjoyed Pink Flamingos' bad taste. The upside-down storytelling, while somewhat enjoyable, left a similar aftertaste to that of Christopher Nolan's Memento: was the inverse storytelling really necessary, or is it just a long wrapping to a short story, a golden cover on a shallow book? There is an undeniable sense of selfishness in Noe's film-making. He benefits from being extreme and tries hard to be so. But extreme means relative, non-intrinsic value; it is valuable because it is aside from the rest. If twenty other filmmakers began shooting movies in Noe's fashion, Irreversible would grow old very fast. If Noe hadn't relied so hard on extremes, maybe his work would have left a more positive idea in my mind. As it is, all I can say is that Irreversible is a remarkable film that tries too hard to be even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure exploitation "entertainment"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I've been creeped out by a movie, but Irreversible made my skin crawl. I sat in numb silence for about ten minutes after the movie was finished. As far as exploitation movies go, this one was possibly the most extreme I've ever seen.That said, I was impressed with the way this flick made me feel completely uncomfortable throughout the entire running time. The sounds, music, and especially the camera-work gave it a very claustrophobic feel. If it weren't for the porno/head smash/anal rape scenes, I could almost consider this an art-house movie, but the level of predatory sex and violence that run throughout 'Irreversible' throw it directly into the same pot as 'I Spit On Your Grave' and 'Devil's Experiment'. The director obviously tried to make the subject matter less "mainstream" by using various techniques, but in the end it's just a showcase for aberrant human behavior.By the way, I didn't watch this movie to be entertained; anybody who gets off on this kind of material obviously has mental problems. And to those of you who complain that this flick is misogynistic are missing the point. These types of movies are supposed to make us uncomfortable with our little lives, and 'Irreversible' does just that! All in all, this is a very well done movie. If you're gonna watch exploitation movies, you might as well watch something that's going to make you think a little bit...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think the BBFC thought that a subtitled art film could be so successful so they just let it threw uncut. Which is something to be thankful for for a change.This film is great. Its not the most original idea to run the narrative in reverse. Even though some people think it is (even an episode of Seinfeld did it). But its how its pulled off. There's still a twist at the end or the beginning.This film is powerful and shocking and brilliant. With moments of sheer ultra violence. Hopefully Hollywood don't try and remake this.Absolutely brilliant. I do have to wonder though, would it be so great if it wasn't in reverse order...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a few films, such as MEMENTO and BETRAYED, the storyline is told backwards. IRREVERSIBLE pulls this off the best and challenges us to concentrate on what we feel about the outcome/start. While it may feel like a completely abrasive film, stick through it and you will have an understanding of what it could be trying to represent. After a bunch of weirdos murder a man, the viewers find out why these men did it and who they were. The film takes a complete U-turn after a graphic rape scene. The film starts out looking dark and gritty, with many claustrophobic environments surrounding the viewer but as the film continues it's able to bring us out of all that completely. Once the storyline is resolved, the viewer must concentrate, not on the narrative, but on the characters that we see first, meet later. IRREVERSIBLE is graphic, but the film achieves exactly what it wanted to achieve in its storytelling, and that is astonishing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing and repugnant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Irréversible" is a fascinating movie. It is not for all audiences. The camera is all over the place, swooping and swerving as if it was attached to the back of a fly. The soundtrack has this like 20 Hz rumble that irritates and some of the scenes are shocking and, I think this word is appropriate, repugnant. The rape scene is hard to take. It is detailed and lengthy and Monica Bellucci has to be praised for her performance. The movie has a David Lynchian feel to it, maybe David Lynch off his medication. It is shocking. The reverse chronology doesn't allow you to get involved with the characters before the action bits but jumps right into it and then backs off and allows you to get to know the characters. This approach draws you into the movie looking for some explanation for the violence you've seen. The movie is very intriguing and I enjoyed it but it is not, not, not for everyone. It is vile, violent, repugnant and disorienting. I can understand why many walked out on its screening at Cannes. Any movie that features an establishment called the "Rectum" has to be approached with some trepidation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking and graphic, but not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some minor spoilers in this review. But the power of this technique-heavy French film, wasted power if you ask me, is in the way it is shot, not in the story.We start with a murder, and proceed backwards in time. Got that? The first scene in the film shows you the end of the story, the next scene shows what happened just before the end, and so on, until the end of the film, when you reach the beginning of the story. Why this odd technique? Who knows.The murder is terrifically violent, brutal and graphic, accompanied by teeth-grating sound effects that truly put the viewer on edge. I guess being able to pull off this kind of emotional manipulation is an accomplishment of sorts, though not one I find especially valuable. In addition to the murder, there is an extraordinarily brutal, and completely unerotic, rape sequence. However politically incorrect it may be to say so, I have found some rapes I have scene in movies to be exciting and erotically charged; this one was just gruesome and cruel, and also way overlong.Underlying all of this is a prosaic tale of a romantic triangle, involving three rather uninteresting people. The girl has thrown over the intelligent, sensitive guy for the animalistic fellow with whom she has more satisfying sex. There is a little bit of exploration of this dynamic, but nothing noteworthy. The rape and murder, which are the film's centerpiece and reason for being, come upon these people strictly by chance, and have nothing at all to do with their interrelationships. The story, in short, lacks coherence. What we have here are segments of shocking violence grafted onto a really dull love story, for no apparent reason.A couple of entertaining touches -- the murder occurs at a gay bar hilariously called "The Rectum", for which our protagonists have feverishly searched by screaming out "Where is the Rectum? Take me to the Rectum!" to anyone passing by. In the same scene, there is a shamelessly racist but still-hysterical exchange between an Oriental cab driver and his passenger. See this film if you want to feel emotionally brutalized. Don't see much point in seeing it otherwise.</fullReview>

What makes it worse is that when you think back to when the rapist is killed you realize that they killed the wrong man!!! which adds to the film an extra downer when you realize no justice was done! But all this makes this film so original and the way it is shot and told back to front make irreversible a brilliant art house movie but should not be remembered just for that 'rape' scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Belief!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "Irreversible" last night and I have to admit that it is not my favorite foreign film. My sole reason for watching this was to view the ever so lovely, Monica Bellucci, who I admit puts in a very believable and natural performance. I was responding to all the other reviews on this board and heard all the muck about the shocking brutality, two scenes of which are quite unsettling. Along with everyone else, I believe the ten minute rape scene was upsetting and hard to take. The man getting his head bludgeoned with the fire extinguisher was equally as gruesome. But "Irreversible" is not about gratuitous sex and violence. It's a very symbolic work of art that is very daunting and electrifying. The plot is done retrospective which I did not find hard to follow at all. The artsy camera movements in the beginning along with the pulsating background score was quite effective for an opener. A bit dizzying as well, but it sure sets a mood. Marcus (Vincent Cassel) is understandably on a rampage to hunt down his girlfriend, Alex's (Monica Bellucci) assailant. With the aide of his friend and her ex-husband (Pierre) they scout the town vehemently. This town is beyond decadence, loaded with prostitution, drugs, gays and all types of dregs. They had just left a party where Alex left early and Marcus and Pierre find out later while roaming the boulevard. Marcus sees Alex's bloody body being hauled out in a gurney is all too real and heartbreaking. Thus, the frenzied hunt for retribution follows. The scenes where Alex, Marcus and Pierre are walking around and riding on the bus were very amusing as they shamelessly discuss Alex's sexual drives, libido and their inability to satisfy her. The casting is right on and this is where Bellucci and Cassel really shine as a couple and acting partners. The scenes of Alex and Marcus just lounging in bed and goofing around are cute and charming as well. The movie takes a beautiful turn as it symbolically shows their dreams of her being pregnant and the life they could have had. Unfortunately, the degenerate creep who raped Alex wasn't the man they killed and that is one major problem I had. I needed to see poetic justice.The violence is heavy to be sure and only the tough minded and emotionally stalwart should watch this. But, while you are watching, to keep yourself from fainting. Repeat this line to yourself, "IT'S ONLY A MOVIE, IT'S ONLY A MOVIE."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult but interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a sucker for films that make people walk out of the cinema because of a particular scene. I am drawn to this kind of hype like a moth to the flame. I just can't help it. I have had this film in on my "have to see list" for awhile now and recently grabbed it off of netflix. This film definitely lived up to the hype. It is the type of film that leaves you thinking about it for days after you see it. The violence is the kind of thing that makes you cringe. The scenes of violence are agonizingly long (do you really need to hit him with the extinguisher again? yep, I guess you do!) especially the rape scene. The thing that left me wondering after watching it was, would this be a good film if not for the violence and tricky camera work? The answer is no. It's a pretty lame story. But film is not about the story alone. That is what makes the medium great. It is immersive. It requires that pay attention to sight and sound. On this level the the film is amazing. It grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. The tricky camera work and music in the first 30 minutes of the film made me feel more ill at ease then I have ever felt watching a film. The bottom line is that this an interesting and original piece of cinema. Not every movie needs to make you feel good about life at the end. The good guys don't always need to win. This movie is a fine example of what can be done when someone tries to break out of the mold. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave step in film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do people bother to do such disturbing movies? Isn't movies made for the purpose of entertainment? I think that would be a stupid statement to make. Books aren't edited just for entertainment, paintings aren't done for the sole purpose of entertainment, then... why would movies be filmed looking for that goal? I think we can never get used to violence, but movies make it look cool and unrealistic-realistic ?if that makes sense. Even movie's fake blood will look real to us compared to real blood, which is more like red paint mixed with water. But we would be terrorized if someone would aim a gun at us. We're not getting used to it.Irreversible is a bold statement against rape, but also a great study on primal conduct in an age when things are so calculated and 'civilized'. The fact that the most brain-driven of the two guys (Pierre) is the one that smashes the 'killer's' head, is a clear example of the path that Noé wants to show us. We are violent, even when there's no need for it. Our world is violent, and that violence is not only waiting for us around the corner, but waiting for us from the inside, waiting to burst with all of it's hatred like we never even thought. A dream can be turned into a nightmare in a matter of seconds, due to the most stupid thing we can think of.La Tenia didn't attack Alex because she was so damn sexual and beautiful, but because he hated her and what she represented, and that's the reason behind most crimes. Not money, not sex, but pure hate and a feeling of superiority.Most movies will portray violence as a poetic thing, even the most intelligent ones. Think about Taxi Driver, one of the most crude films ever. It's violence has style and looks cool, although it's not, and it's very real. The same goes for American History X. In Irreversible, violence is not a camera looking for a cool angle in a fight, a la Fight Club, but a smell, a scream, a glimpse of something horrible that is still there when you're so stupid to dare to open your eyes. There's no escape once hell breaks loose, and you can't go to hide under your mother's skirt and wait until it's gone. Nooo, it will go after you like a rabid dog, and you will suffer.Yeah, Irreversible's got two of the most horrific scenes ever depicted in a film, but also one of the most beautiful love moments ?Alex and Marcus in the bed, sharing spit and words of love, as most of us do when we truly love someone. This movie, for all it's cruel and merciless punches, never makes you say: "Man, that was cool." It will leave you feeling ashamed of having the same nature inside you. It's a beautiful film for all the bravery it took to make it.</fullReview>

There's no point in telling the plot, but you'll notice that everything is under control, from the very concept of the story, to the font they used in the main title :) These are the most convincing artistic endeavours, where you can feel, that all details derive naturally from one single, very strong idea!

This is a brilliantly made film, heartbreaking to watch and I would have reservations in recommending it as it disturbing on many levels. All I can say to the people about whether there was blood and whether the scene was a turn on or not is... surely your missing the point. There was no enjoyment within Alex from being raped, orgasmic or otherwise. There are many parts of the film that cleverly refer to the actual events that take place in the tunnel, but I think the comment is about fate, destiny and how your future cannot be changed.

		<shortDescription>Great direction, cinematography, and style...but rape scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ha, wow...um, this movie was indeed a spectacle of directing and camera-work.I have never seen a movie (almost) completely in reverse order of occurrences and even though this plot might have been shallow or somewhat predictable, the originality of this movie beats all other modern pieces out by showing brutality in ways we (in the US) haven't really seen in most of the releases out right now.::PLOT SPOILER::The movie essentially is about a couple, whose female side is battling the truth of her pregnancy to her spouse and his unwillingness to quit partying nonstop. Meanwhile she's trying to keep a friendly hand out for her paranoid ex whose actions are not seen until her unspeakable, violent rape scene in a downtown tunnel as she is trying to get home. Vowing revenge, 2 men offer their information to the two men closest to her for a price, and they head on their way through the backroads through prostitute-land and gay clubs in search of the rapist/killer (?). The woman's ex violently snaps and bludgeons the (wrong) man into death as the real rapist looks on and chuckles. If that doesn't spoil it, I don't know what will...But even though I told the plot, the way that this director chooses to reveal what's going on is very creative and unique and deserves at least one viewing. Harsh as the beating and raping scenes might be (excessive, maybe), I think the movie was trying to show the grittiest points in the most drawn-out ways to get you to have a heart for these characters and their emotions behind their actions. The man/spouse of the woman, for example, is quite gentle in the beginning of the movie whereas his character slowly unravels throughout the film, starting with the beginning (violent, crass, racist) to the end (romantic, sweet, sensitive). A great way to see the world of this director.I gave it a 7/10 (it has a weighted score of 7.2 at this time of commenting) just like a lot of people. You can't rent this one at too many stores so anytime you have an extra $20, through it down on this DVD because the special features make an additional point or so on that 7 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no Revenge in Irreversible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Irreversible is brutally shocking. However, there is no possibility of shocking anybody into sensitivity. On the contrary. Shocking is to produce either of two effects, the first being numbness, retreat, the closing of one's mind for anything offered from the outside world during hours or even days to come after the shock occurred; the second being the uninhibited expression of one's always readily available, and mostly only dimly slumbering impulses for aggression and need to revenge for the exerted shock on whatever subject might be at hand. Both effects are unwanted, from different points of view, but if the shock is produced to just prove the occurrence of those effects, the shocker can only be called a reproducer of well known human possibilities, and therefore should not be considered an original artist at all, but a fraud. We cannot deny, though, that shocking brutality exists all over the place. As we cannot deny that civility and peace and love exist too. Here, then, may be one 'message' of the film, message between scare-quotes, because one must seriously doubt, as Jonathan Rosenbaum (http://www.chireader.com/movies/archives/2003/0303/030314.html) so neatly and wisely is arguing, that any such message was intended by the film makers: If you're to weak to interfere with brutality you come across, flee before the brutes turn around to hit you. Do not stand around, hypnotically staring at what is going on before your eyes. Be prepared to run, and not remain fixed in awe, only to become the next prey. Alex could have run out of the tunnel. She was so good, one imagines, as to want to help the beaten woman, but she could do nothing of effective interference. She was captured in the web of watching aggression, like you are day after day after day in the pictures of brutality on TV and in films. Stop yourself. Switch the TV set off. Walk out of the movies. Stop letting yourself be further hypnotized by brutality. Reverse the process. De-hypnotize yourself. If you cannot interfere, run out of the tunnel, shout, try to collect a crowd to help and stop the aggressors in their run. Let yourself not be made increasingly insensitive by shock after shock, or increasingly aggressive. Civilization comes at a price, yes: As many people as possibly can, must control themselves, and must help as many others as they possibly can, to learn and control themselves too. Not by shocks, but by sheer patience, empathic behavior, and by example, and openness to organize help for gradually and effectively changing weird circumstances. That, boy oh boy, would be one message! In addition, here is another 'message': Do not believe knowing what you have seen. From a slow motion analysis one can easily decide, (as is noted in http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/board/nest/9652292), that neither Marcus was killed in the fight, and one feels his survival to be only natural for a non-tragedy, nor, however, the rapist either, which is the more confusing part of this black comedy of errors. It is, in fact, a buddy of the rapist, the man in the black suit, who is being killed. He is the taller man standing before Marcus, at Marcus' left hand side, when Marcus, in his drugged rage, is addressing the smaller man, who, indeed, is the rapist, as can be seen from slow motion comparison with the rape scene. The man in black, takes the initiative to get Marcus out the club, and the rapist is standing by, watching, while slyly smiling, when Marcus and the man in black are getting into their physical fight. Marcus wins the first round. Luck for him turns round, the man breaks Marcus' arm, and is preparing to give him a treat in his behind, when Marcus' friend Pierre interferes, and hits the man in black with the back of a (fun, fun) fire extinguisher, beating his face into inverted shape, the nose gone and bones pointing inward. So, there is NO REVENGE after all, there's only senseless aggression from all sides, and the rapist survives unhurt and, I imagine off camera, loudly laughing with lust. If this 'message' would have been intended as a warning about what the American Presidency is trying to pursue, the film, obviously, appeared years to early, since anybody who would also have extracted such understanding, would have forgotten it by long, now, at election time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hate to say it, but most of you guys commenting on this movie don't seem to have been watching very carefully. Did anyone notice that the man killed with the fire extinguisher was NOT the rapist, but a bystander in the wrong place/wrong time? This adds quite a bit of tragic irony to the story, doesn't it?LE TENIA ("THE TAPEWORM") was the man with the bottle of poppers, standing NEXT to the victim. When the BYSTANDER makes the fatal mistake of moving away from the argument, he casts suspicion on himself. MARCUS ASSUMES he is LE TENIA. But he ain't. If you don't believe me, watch the RAPE SCENE. Only at the very end does LE TENIA clearly show his face. His distinguishing feature (probably why he was cast) is his over-sized NOSE. It's either broken or has a large bump on it. Compare this to the end of the GAY CLUB KILLING SCENE, where there's again a CLOSEUP of LE TENIA, looking on in shock (or wicked amusement, hard to say which). So, LE TENIA in fact gets away. To play another day at "THE RECTUM" club. C'est la vie, n'est pas?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lesson in Entropy, a Reverse Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply stated, the movie ends with a happy beginning and begins with a brutal end. The events that happen between the beginning and end [or in this case, they are reversed, so the end and the beginning] are a perfect lesson in entropy. The audience sees that which has already occurred - the brutal murder at the beginning, the even more brutal rape scene - and at every point, we question the movie and wonder...wait...what if they decided to stay in? What if his car had not broken down? What if she hadn't left the party? And yet, because we have already seen the shocking climaxes, we know that the events are indeed irreversible, as the title suggests.The characters are swiftly and very complexly acted; Monica Bellucci as a beautiful but concerned girlfriend, Vincent Cassel somewhat of a puppy dog turned rabid, and Albert Dupontel as placidly remarkable.The cinematography is gorgeous, accurately reflecting the level of entropy that has occurred, with dizzying film-noir-esque shots at the beginning, leaving you unsure as to just what has happened, to an idyllic paradise reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's Virgin Suicides, but without the creepiness. [I can almost hear Air's "Playground Love"]Indeed, the film is difficult to watch, especially when you know what has already happened. You want to tell the characters NO...this is the ultimate dramatic irony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gaspar Noé's "Irreversible" is a movie you either love or hate. I belong in the latter category.This is one of very few movies that I have promised myself to never watch again. For various reasons: it contains some of the most graphical violence I've seen, plus when it's not shocking it's mainly boring and unstructured. The violence is most definitively relevant, a movie about rape should in no way be pleasant, but Noé fails in making this work as a movie. It feels like a couple of scenes stacked upon each other instead of a film. The way the story is told (backwards), don't make this any better since you're left without feelings for the victims.The scenes that weren't designed to shock was mostly boring, mainly because of badly written dialog and tedious pacing.On the positive side, I can say that this movie is undeniably made in a fantastic way. The scenes are very long, I think I counted to just 12 scenes in this movie. The actors do a superb job in front of the camera and the way the film is shot should be seen to be believed.All in all I felt this movie was on one hand a great showcase of technicality but on the other hand a rather poor attempt at a movie.4/10</fullReview>

Beside the perfectly plotted and acted storyline, the reversing of which has as many meanings in as many layers as you like, Irreversible is a technical wonder. And my comment is aimed therefore primarily at those who think Irreversible contains poor photography.Let me ask those people one question (and this is beside the point that the moving camera is designed to raise the level of unease and discomfort in the viewer to match and enhance the scenes as they unfold): Have you noticed that every single scene is shot in one take? So, beside the philosophical foundations of the film, strengthened in every way by the photography, one can only sit back and marvel at the technological prowess of the director, who by no coincidence also handled the camera.Irreversible will have a major impact on many filmmakers, it's effects will be noticed for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusting &amp; Disturbing... Can't Wait To Watch It Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can compare this to many other films, but I'm sure that if you have found this review, then you too can compare. This is a great movie, and is definitely not for the kind hearted. It starts off with the credits, and ends at the beginning. Throughout the movie you slowly see what adds up to the very gruesome intro scene where the main characters friend smashes a man dubbed 'The Tapeworm's face into a brick wall with a fire extinguisher. I saw a glimpse of this in the preview, and couldn't wait to see the scene. After the first blow I was definitely sucked in. Then the second, and the third, and the forth, and after that it just was insane and goring, and amazingly well done. The infamous rape scene is another part to catch. Disturbingly about fifteen minutes long, it seems to never end. I refused to keep the volume for this scene high, because the constant screams of Alex's voice were to hard to handle. (I can be a wuss sometimes). Go see it, it's very powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not use spoilers in this comment, but I will say before you see this movie, you will have to buck up. The violence portrayed in this movie is so intense you will have to realize that is not a real guy getting hammered like that. You still may lose your lunch, however. This film features some dizzying camera effects, and the reverse/storytelling is unique as well. It is the rape scene, however, that will make or break you. If you are into savage rape fetish pornography, then this 10 minute scene is just for you. If not, then just picture someone doing this to the movie director's daughter or wife. Not a good thing- I cannot see the purpose of portraying this in such a realistic, sadistic manner except to get our blood boiling. There are those who will see this movie despite the warnings; but if you are 1. Female, 2. Involved in law enforcement, or 3. Unaware of our experiences of witnessing this scene you will be better off not seeing this movie at all. You have been warned.</fullReview>

The rape scene boils up the blood when you think that trash like the raper do exist in the real world.This is reality. Take a look at the world and it's darker sides. 'Cause life ain't just all bunnies and flowers.Great movie. Watch it if you think you have the stomach for it. It's not like gore-flicks-disturbing (which is quite funny)...

All of these words come to mind when describing the path Irreversible takes you on; a clever and truly unique look at lovers drawn into a seedy world that ultimately devastates their lives. There are many elements of this film to consider, style, plot, characters, violence, sex; but the overwhelming theme is love and the lengths man will go to revenge or satisfy his thirst.Irreversible is disturbingly violent and pornographic at times, no doubt shocking American audiences who have never seen such a raw unabashed peek into the acts so brutally depicted by both the protagonist and villain on screen. It seemed as if the director wanted to first de-synthesize you to the point of numbness, daring you to look away and then taking you on a personal journey through the lives of three individuals as they put their flaws aside and cope with each other and their environment the best they can. Like a trip to the dentist, the director dispenses with the Novocain and starting drilling! This film is nothing but original and takes a fairly simple story line and depicts in a very stylish way. I found myself wanting more at the end of the film but feeling satisfied that I had experienced what was intended. Recommending Memento as a comparison is not fair to this work Like Haute Tension, of the horror genre, the director has taken a common plot theme and added his version to include a few shocks and insight along the way.Emotionally draining and ultimately satisfying meal to be savored and discussed but probable seen only once for fear of giving into our own hidden weaknesses.Maddis 8/10.</fullReview>

The reason is simple, the deeds are so heart-shaking and difficult to look at, I was "lucky" to remember the faces of the protagonists.What I'll say might spoil a little part of the movie but it seems that knowing this made the disparagers revise their whole vision of the film: (so you can either read it before or JUST AFTER viewing the movie) "The man killed in the first minutes of the film is NOT the one his killers intended to kill."

I bought it without even seeing it first. let me tall you one thing. this movie is no let down. it is nothing short of a masterpiece. it is not easy to watch though, there are some incredibly disturbing and graphic scenes in there. i think that people that rated it any lower than a 8/10 were probably turned off by this.

I'm not going to say it 'should be' or 'shouldn't be' seen, that's up to the individual person. I don't think I'll ever go and voluntarily see this film again, but I can definatly appreciate the quality of the acting, directing and cinematography of it. I have read roger ebert's review of the film and it says a lot of what I think about the movie: it makes you think (if you choose to actually think rather than just spout off meaningless surprised s***) about rape in such a different way, and it makes you look at life in a different way: understanding how delicate the thread of time is, just by considering the possibilities of the future, good and bad.I appreciate the film, but I don't ever want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was really disturbing. I won't argue longer on this point, I just wanted to notify the fact that the story had a taste of déj? vu.This film reminded me some "Hitchcock presents" short-cut telling the story of a man leaving his wife in their mobile-home for his working day and who discovers her bullied and "folded" alive in the oven as he returns. Then comes to him an irrepressible wrath. He takes his wife in the car and drives her through the city hoping to identify the aggressor and, finally, the woman designs a man with the finger, "It's him". The husband follows him to his apartment then comes back to the car (the murder is only suggested). Satisfied, he drives back to the camping outside the city but as they leave it, the woman points another man... "It's him".The brutality of these deeds are magnified in Irreversible by the way the camera is moved, the sick ambiance of the film beginning and the coarseness of the violence. Out of all this horror, the rest of the movie just gets us closer to the characters trying to increase attachment to them, but the electroshocks of the first half makes it almost tasteless after such a bitter entrée and hardly succeeds in calming the spectator.Irreversible trades the Hitchcock film's moral for pure visual crash, and plays back the emotional crescendo of films like Requiem For A Dream. Edifying, mind-blowing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an exceptional and important movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being partly raised on horror movies, I thought I had seen it all. This is something comparable to Pasolinis SALO or the intense last half hour of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Irreversible is far better than SALO though. It´s interesting that one still can get really moved and affected by a movie efter all I´ve seen through the years. It kind of feels like i´m a "newborn" movie viewer, and makes me believe in the power of the medium again. While I didn´t really know what to think immediately after watching it, when a couple of days had gone by, I concluded that it really is an exceptional and important movie. When I watch violence in other movies now, it feels too slick, glamourizing and "movie-stylized", while in this film one gets a gut wrenching feeling of what violence is like for real. Thats due to Noe´s technical brilliance, the unflinching long takes, merciless sound design (during the opening sequence) and believable performances. Seeing the revenge before the crime is also a masterstroke, as it exposes the act of murder out of context and for what it ultimately is, sickening and ugly no matter what motive lies behind it. One can argue about the quite simplistic and exaggerated connection made between a gay nightclub as hell on earth, but it is more like an expressionistic nightmare than reality anyway. The incessant drone on the soundtrack also signals a kind of journey into dangerous and uncharted territory of the human mind. The effective use of digital techniques, invisible cuts and so forth, makes me think that it is now possible for someone to actually make the movies Anthony Burgess predicted in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, which are shown to Alex during his brainwashing. Scenes of ultra-violence filmed in long, sickening single takes, and one of the few passages in litterature which I find profoundly disturbing. Ultimately I must recommend this movie for everyone, but be prepared to be upset and shocked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Irreversible- is not a movie that likes to be watched; the director deliberately repulses the audience for 90 minutes, before capping it off with a beautiful avant-garde-style end to accentuate the contrast between "before" and "after." And so, it has an odd effect: it is repulsive to the sense, but more satisfying on a reflective level. That said, I don't intend on watching it again. As everyone knows, the technical style is as off-putting and hard to stomach as the content. If this is really as brilliant as all the supporters claim it is, maybe Gaspar can put his brilliance to work creating a work of an integrated beauty, that invites repeat viewings. With all the presumed hommages to Kubrick therein, maybe he can take some cues from -Barry Lyndon- (or Tarkovsky, if he wants to stick with a more avant-garde approach) . . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gaspar Noe does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the more real-than-real "Seul contre tous" about an unemployed butcher who bounces around in suburban Paris looking for work and trying to atone for the ultimate sin he committed years before, Noe gets in our face again to show a dimension to what being human means like noone has ever done. He also pushes the celluloid envelope to new and insane extremities with heart-pounding camera sweeps and utter chaos (in fact, this movie could also have been called "Chaos," which happens to be the name of another great recent French film) meant to throw you off of your comfortable balance.OK, enough Ebertian musings: this movie is one of my favorites of all times.The first few scenes are nothing short of grating: the camera works, the insane frantic pursuit of two men for some guy called Le Tenia, and soon you realize the movie goes backwards. Later on you realize why the two men are looking for Le Tenia. And it works out amazingly well, somehow, even though the last scene of the movie would be the first scene in a normal time sequence and you already how bad things are going to get. Here's one movie with a happy ending in a real twisted kind of way!Ali Naderzad</fullReview>

I saw it on DVD, but I really wish I had had the opportunity to view it in the cinema. The reactions of a typical audience would have been interesting. Hearing of people walking out of the theatre reminded me of when I viewed 'Natural Born Killers' - but it really is inappropriate to compare those films. Real auteurs will always prefer disgust for their films over indifference.

		<fullReview>Filming in an obscure and unilluminated environment, alongside a nauseatingly dizzying camera, did not help Gaspar Noe in his attempt to thoroughly manifest a wonderfully bleak outlook on life. What could have been.Obviously, the film is done in a reverse fodder, hence the title.We're opened up with a cheerful welcome to Club Rectum, the integral part of France's S&amp;M underworld while we watch Marcus (Vincent Cassell) get his faced turned to pulp amidst the homosexual intercourse and straight men vigorously shouting gay epithets.Noe is intent on violating you on every conceivable level, and leaving a lasting imprint in your mind.Although a bit weary and skeptical of the film already at this point, I chose to view on - cut to rape scene.This is, without doubt, the most sickening use of shameless self promotion (Noe claimed he was going to out-rape Peckinpah in 'Straw Dogs' and Kubrick in 'A Clockwork Orange') and gratuitous violence I've ever witnessed. Suddenly, the hyperactive camera stops so we can get a straight on ground view of Monica Bellucci being raped for 9 minutes straight, having her head repeatedly slammed into the concrete surroundings. He wanted to tell us a story by means of using graphic savagery. He blatantly did this to cause an uproar. To prevent you from leaving the theatre, he enthuses us in some blissful full-frontal at the end (or beginning) of the film, only to tell us that the future consumes everything it is...IRREVERSIBLE. Cliches and stereotypes are thrown in as well.Not only is it sick, unfocused, angry, hollow, repetitive, abrasive, incoherent, and disturbing but drudging and tedious. I consider it a high-budget brutalized pornography film, where women and gays are ultimately degraded and demoralized. I wasn't entertained, not even on a sheer visceral level.Don't you love when filmmakers produce filth and violence to manufacture controversy? Exploitation film at it's best. Noe is a sadist and an opportunist.Your initial and primary reaction may be that it's a brilliant, daring, defying piece from a remarkable and genius director...but no, it isn't. This film has no point, there was no point in making us endure all 90 minutes of it. There was no point in making it. It's not brilliant. It's not daring. It's not defying. It's utter excretement.Nobody should subject themselves to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the first caveat a person should have before seeing this film, is that you must have a strong stomach to watch it. i checked out this dvd from my public library, which seems rather amazing when you realize that the content is so graphic and painful to watch. however, the librarian was quite right to warn me that children should definitely not be watching this type of film. so anyway, if you're an adult who can handle gritty realism, you might be interested in this. it's a story told in chunks, with the last part of the story told first. the entire chronology is reversed. so, if you can get through the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, focus shifts, and you are shown what happened before. which is more interesting, i think, and that brings me to my second caveat about this movie. it's french. french filmmakers have a history of making films in a very unconventional, un-Hollywood way. if you're really into movie formulas, and get upset when they are not used, then stay away from this film. however, if you're OK with a filmmaker pushing a different idea, as far as he possibly can, this film will be among the most fascinating and shocking experiences of your life. french films tend to be character-based. in irreversible, the impact of what happens to the characters is immediate, and it draws you into their thoughts and emotions quite vividly. the technique is devastatingly effective. so, the dvd is out there, and i love dvds because they include production-type stuff for the cinema lover, and this one includes the behind-the scenes special effects. i was quite glad these extras were included because they helped show all the ways in which the graphic sex and violence were faked, digitally. it kind of makes you laugh at the same scenes which originally made you cringe in the film, knowing that the filmmaker has fooled you into having a deeply thought-provoking experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-SPOILERS-'Irreversible' is a totally unique film experience. It may not be totally enjoyable due to its content, yet a must see for any film enthusiast.Director/writer Gaspar Noe delivers this mind-bending, harrowing film in total reverse sequence. Thus we are given a view of the conclusion at the film's very start. It is immediately known that the principal characters (Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel) are engaged on a vicious search for an individual who has committed an extreme act against them. Whether directly or indirectly, we sit eyes affixed to the screen eager to know what has transpired. As the film unfolds, we view the principals in a wild dash around Paris to find this mystery individual. Stopping at nothing, these two characters will clearly not be denied and are willing to assault and harrass anyone who might hold the key. Eventually, we bear witness to an extremely unpleasant and repulsive rape scene of Cassel's girlfriend played by the lovely Monica Bellucci. This scene lasts at least 10 minutes and we now understand the reason for this vengence. The remainder of the film provides the set-up for this awful scene and allows the viewer to gain an understanding of these incredibly complex characters. This is a triumphant achievement for Mr.Noe. He is clearly a man with vision and one who knows no boundaries in terms of what to put on the screen. A big thumbs up to Thomas Bangalter of DAFT PUNK for putting together a musical score that flows so well with the story. This film will not appeal to everyone. If your idea of film is the latest Julia Roberts flick, steer clear of this movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pandora's Box revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Frank Wedekinds plays Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora (1904) or the Lulu plays, modern day fascination with the destructive power of sex was staged.These plays were regarded as highly provocative and shocking in the explicit depictions of feminine sexuality and the description of sexual ambiguity. Besides, they also reflected on the different social classes in modern German society. The 1929 film adaption of these plays by G. W. Pabst retained much of the story and is regarded as one of the classics from german Weimar cinema. In short, this young girl Lulu destroys every man that comes her way, seemingly innocently. It ends by her own destruction, she's being killed by Jack the Ripper (!!). The story suggests (to me) she is actually fantasizing all the time while her portrait is being painted.Irreversible appears to be Noe's comments on Pabst classic movie, or Wedekinds plays. Lulu replaced by Alex, the name possibly to remind us of Alice, who also dreamed or fantasized her 'Wonderland' and Jack the Ripperby La Tenia both as examples of the extreme ends of sexual fantasies and perversions. The similarities between the two stories are striking: in both cases the woman appear to be fantasizing the whole story, both equally passive and both 'dreaming' about their coming doom. Although only slightly touched upon, but on the key moment in the movie, also Irreversible commented on the different social background of Alex and La Tenia. (Which had shock value on its own, since in western Europe social differences are something of a taboo these days).The power of Irreversible is that it succeeds in shocking us at this day and age, maybe not unlike the plays and movie did in their time. This movie provides such a torment it actually creeps into your soul. Thus going back to much earlier horrors, religion and myths of Evil. Shock value was borrowed by using the scenery from medieval depictions of hell and the role of demon for the camera itself, as in the Blair Witch Project. And not to forget the nauseating sounds used for controlling crowds by the riot-police.Irreversible shows it is possible to 'translate' shocking plays/movies from 100 years ago to our time without losing its impact. It implies not much has changed, maybe even not in a 1000 years.This is a ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought "Irreversible" for the pure fact that I just had to see how truly awful it could be. I admit I found this film rather difficult to watch (though I WAS sick with an inflamed ribcage and sore throat at the time...I don't recommend viewing shocking material when you feel like c******a!). If you're reading this you probably want your question answered, that being: "Is it really that disturbing?" In two words, "Hell, yes." Everything you've heard is true. If, like me, your curiousity got the better of you and you have this film at your disposal, watch it but make sure that a)you aren't already feeling ill b)you aren't eating c)you aren't sitting with a human being you wouldn't want to share such an experience with (ie your folks, your sweet significant other, or your right-wing buddy). Preferably you should view "Irreversible" alone, in the dark, late at night with your&gt; remote handy (because you WILL want to pause it). That said, the shock ultimately paid off at only 70% for me. The acting was incredible, the writing was thought-provoking and realistic and the camera work (it's like a pinwheel so grab some pills) were amazing. But the ending was abrupt and ultimately too open-ended to contain the full power of Noe's tagline: "Time destroys everything." My props to Noe though for creating one thing it won't destroy: these pictures of Bellucci in my mind. Be forewarned. "Irreversible" is seriously f-ed up, but a work of art that should be watched by anyone who can bear it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's true what you've heard - this movie will disturb you.Is it sickness, tense imagery and repulsive artifice? Not completely, but that's certainly the launching point. Is this film, art? I don't know. Lots of people consider art to be lots of different things. Is it gratuitous violence, horror, and sex? There are plenty of other movies that can make that claim, but there's nothing gratuitous at all about this examination. This film is interested in engaging you. It's also not interested in apologizing for having the guts to be what it's exposing.The rape scene itself is not shown in a directly explicit manner (rather, it's graphically shocking in its suddenness and appalling empty regard). Following that scene, the true exploration begins. Like Memento, you learn the story and characters backwards, in a forward developing manner. Meaning - like recalling 'the night before', during an extreme hangover - the tale comes together in recessive steps (and certainly more pleasing and mentally intriguing than the initial shocking imagery). Here we learn the true concept ultimately deals with the deep chasm between desire and the gray area of its implications. That's an interesting concept. And it's explored here in a well-conceived and satisfying manner.Is Irreversible thrilling? No - it is agony. Agony has rarely been put upon the screen in a more telling, affecting manner. Don't claim malpractice on the filmmakers. They were true to the occurrence, and the mentality. Rape is the act of an unthinking, self-possessed animal. There is no glory in the act as they display it.If you can't handle intensity - avoid this movie. If you're tired of dishonest tripe? Consider it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I (50) saw this movie with a son of mine (26)who is a young fiction writer (noir genre, "a la" Auster, Bukowski) and a young script-writer for TV, radio progammes and motion pictures as well.Regarding the generation gap, we usually watch the same movies and almost concur with our evaluations. However, he saw in this one much further than I did. Afterwards, I acknowledged the movie had actually shocked me with a strong impression. At first, my point was: What is the director's point to show us this? Well, it does happen in real live, but we don't usually get to see it. We know about drugs or alcohol addiction, but until we actually *watch* a gruesome scene because of such condition, we may not really grasp and feel it wholly.My son clearly understood this and enlightened me on that fact. ON the other hand, the acting is great, and the Director poses a whole absolutely *new* visual and conceptual proposal of what a film could be: Story telling backwards in time, starts with the most gruesome/shocking/sad/terrible and goes down (?) to the most beautiful, soft, loving, etc. We first see a "no going backwards" most terrible instance in the life of the characters, going ahead to the normal and wonderful life the couple was having. The film starts with lurking music, almost difuse b&amp;w to sepia. with a dizzy camera waiving all the time and showing things from upside down to standing, with dizzy swinging in the midst...all this very gently moves to a more standard camera shooting, more colors, music goes calmer up to love theme. The idea is great, the showing is bold and terrible, but that's life, too... On the other hand, Monica Bellucci is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, actress or non-actress. And she is so good acting she convinces she does exist as a simple world citizen. Check her out in great "Under Suspicion", a first-rate film also with a very tricky and special visual and conceptual rendering of a police story`/psychological thriller (with great, great Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman).If you watch it on DVD (as I did) you may think of moving fastforward, especially the rape scene...however, even when shocked, I could not take my eyes off it, but watched it with pain, humid eyes prepared to burst into tears, and feeling all the offense, rage, impotence and humiliation Bellucci's character was feeling, adroitly portrayed by Monica. This may well be the first movie of the "00s" style or "millenium style".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen irreversible please do not read any more about it and watch it as soon as possible, the only way to see it is without any pre-conceived ideas or expectations. Without giving anything away, it is one of THE most powerful films I have seen. The violence is horrific and the hyper kinetic camera may induce feelings of sickness, but the subject matter is nauseous and should never be pleasant viewing. At a time when PG rated films show super slow motion deaths in bullet time to entertain us, this sobering film shows the harsh reality of a violent world and suggests it's not as much fun as Quentin Tarantino would like to suggest.I didn't enjoy this film. I will watch it again, but I won't enjoy it. It's just not entertaining, but it is brilliant. I'd advise everyone to see it at least once.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tells the truth about terrible things.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has inspired emotions in audiences ranging from indignation to outrage to near violence in film festivals around the world. It offers elements similiar to a recent Hollywood product -- "21 Grams"-- the annihilation of blameless victims by fate or a malevolent person, and the need for retribution and vengeance. These films represent to me the difference between Hollywood s*** and genuine art. Both offer superb leading actors. "21 Grams" is a ludicrous melodrama, confusing obfuscation and trickery with art. It's a ludicrous melodrama, gussied up with fancy cutting. Without it, the picture, by rights, would be laughed out of the theaters. On the other hand, "Irreversible," is to film as Goya and his representation of Napoleon's invasion of Spain is to great art. It tells the truth about terrible things, and the truth, it seems, is the last thing audiences want these days</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Disturbing - But Daringly Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irréversible has to be one of the most disturbing films I have ever viewed in my lifetime. It's the daring elements of it that make up for the inital overwhelming shock of the movie - not to mention the amazing and natural acting given by the entire cast. A movie that can give you this kind of emotion (even if it's emotions you do not wish to feel - that is what makes it amazing)The beginning (first 10-20 minutes maybe) start out slow -- the camera angles twisting and turning non-stop as if you were on a ride that wouldn't stop. Though it was interesting and different it becomes a bore I myself, wanting to just get on with it already -- but -- the amazingly long takes without a cut in the film were admirable. The absolute "in your face" realness, of the opening scene where a man's face is literally bashed in (without the camera panning away for one second - like most movies would) with a fire extinguisher, will shock you. Then the much talked about 9 minute long rape scene of Monica Belluchi - which was absolutely tragic to watch. She was absolutely amazing - watching that scene was horrific But the courage it takes to do a scene and take a role like this - alone is amazing of Monica.The story is told backwards finally leading up to the begining of the day - where you can't believe you just watched all this - and made it through.The utter sickness I felt after watching this movie for about a day made me feel mixed - but my love for this genre of movies which dare to go beyond and bring out the things we don't want to feel and do not wish to face, is what made my like for this movie - win out. ******** (8 / 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to watch, easy to hate, but in the "end".. brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**spoilers** The way the camera flows throughout the film, never a hard film cut, a metaphor for the flow of time, is hard to deal with. Having just watched this film yesterday after successfully battling a New Years Eve party's hangover all morning, the spinning revolving camerawork was making me feel as though a relapse had come on. Then again, had my vision of "The Rectum" been entirely lucid, I believe I actually would have been sick.I flinched each time the fire extinguisher made contact with the man's face yet stared in awe at the graphical effects, the raw realism of the violence, between each blow. I was impressed and disgusted at the same time, much as the onlookers in the film were. Had this film been shot 10 years ago, I would have surely just laughed, neither impressed or disgusted, as a rubber head exploded and gushed red glycerin all over the soundstage. This scene worked as intended, and if you were just shocked by the violence, and not moved by the sudden ferocity of the killer, than you obviously spent more time being mad at the director for being graphic than you did reading the subtitles and engaging yourself in the story.The rape scene was incredibly hard to watch.. and seemed much too long.. but wasn't that the point? I felt it.. I felt raped.. I cried. As one reviewer put it, "The rape just made me angry, but that was because I couldnt do anything about the rape... ". Indeed.. is that not what rape is? To be taken by force. It's hard to reccomend this film to anyone simply because I wouldn't wish that feeling on anyone.. yet I'm glad I watched it.Now, we've covered the bulk of the unnerving graphical violence, lets get down to what this movie was about:This movie's theme is doled to the audience in the very first scene.. 'Time destroy's everything'. There is no greater truth than this. Next we see men being led away by the police.. one physically broken and bound to a stretcher, and one emotionally broken and confined to the paddy wagon. Two men, destroyed. As we back up in time the dialog becomes more human,.. love flows slowly back into the picture and the swirling camerawork subsides. The first scenes are marked heavily with rage and hate.. emotions that breed destruction.The dialog is being overlooked by most of the reviewers who hated this film. I wish I knew French so that I wouldn't have to trust the subtitles, but considering the language used, I'm sure the translator knows both languages very intimately, because the words and images were so full of signifigance. I can't think of much dialog that was wasted... nearly all of it tied in with the story quite cleverly.Alex, in a hopeful manner, talks about the book she is reading that says everything is already decided.. that fate exists, that it rules. Well, the audience, having already seen the events that follow that comment, can't help but agree.. or at least snicker at the irony. In the end, we see her reading this book, her life is beautiful, and as she contemplates her fate, she sees beauty.. the essence of hope. Another of her comments, on the subway, is that when the man she is having sex with really lets go and concentrates on pleasuring himself, she derives more pleasure from his than when he concerns himself with her pleasure. The irony is thick enough and dark enough to choke on.Pierre, as we discover, is full of physical life, while Marcus is full of abstract, philosophical life, this doesn't change from beginning to end... even in destruction. It is Pierre who holds his broken arm, while Marcus is burdened with a broken will.I see Pierre and Marcus, not as two separate people, but as two traights in every man. Maybe I speak only for myself, but I have Pierre's primal instincts and Marcus's civil insightfullness fighting within myself at all times, much as those two fight throughout the film. Imagine these two characters as one and you just might see yourself in the story.. and you thought it was disturbing enough already...This is a story, a message, that could only have been portrayed in brutally graphic film. Imagine this story in a book... most people who read books could never work up this kind of imagery, and the sense of reversed time is something best accomplished with film. That's pretty significant for a movie in this day and age where most movies we see started out as far superior books.Of note: The "Star Baby" of Dave Bowman on the 2001: A Space Odyssey poster, and the final strobing images of a swirling universe can probably only be truly appreciated if you've already taken the time to understand 2001. I'm glad I've both loved the book and movie before viewing Irreversible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting, worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie interesting and worth viewing. The story is told in reverse sequence, which is a captivating technique; however a movie such as Memento generates much more effect using this technique. In this case I searched for motivation for using this technique (other than because it keeps the viewer intrigued) and found none. Furthermore, I felt like the climax of the story is out of place, however classic climax/denouement structure does not apply as usual when a story is told in reverse. One detail I appreciate is how Marcus pressed Alex for sex when they were together in bed (which occurs before the rape on a linear timeline) and is denied. In a linear timeline this foreshadows the rape (even if from another man).At one time I felt this movie was an excuse to show Monica Bellucci naked (which is greatly appreciated) and to dazzle the viewer with dizzying camera techniques and a non-linear timeline. Even if that is the case, it is still an interesting story, told in a captivating fashion, and the director's techniques are non-standard. Refreshing overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling, to put it mildly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not an easy movie to watch. It is as gritty as they come and will cause a gut reaction in most people. I felt ill and panicked watching the first twenty or so minutes, like I was trapped in another person's nightmare. The swirling camera. The low frequency thrumming. The red. As the story unfolds backwards, it becomes easier to watch physically, but harder to watch emotionally. As the film suggests, time destroys everything, and here it destroys something truly beautiful. This is an emotionally draining film, far from perfect (most of the dialog was improvised) and not completely original. This is a rape-revenge story, with a barebones philosophical statement, but emotionally and visually, it is worth multiple viewings. Life is horrible sometimes, this everyone knows, but maybe sometimes we need to see just how horrible things can get in order to appreciate the life and time we have. This film is also about the futility of revenge, as, if you watch closely in the beginning - Marcus never gets his man. I felt drained after watching this. I also feel this was one of the best movies of 2003. Some people criticize the portrayal of homosexuals in this movie, but I don't think it's some kind of anti-gay agenda. The men in the nightclub, and even the rapist, are gay, but their sex is not about love, it is about power. Rape is not sex, it is violence and a need for power over another living thing. These disgusting aspects of life can reside in anyone regardless of sexual preference, color, or gender. The film in no way suggests that all gay men are like this, just this group of gay men. I think it was an unusual choice of the director, but, there it is...</fullReview>

Though, the rape scene makes you want to beat the crap out of that (let us not forget it) human being with a baseball bat (it's long enough so that you get to that violent emotion). I don't know if there is another 'bottom line' in that movie, because there's not plot at all. It's very straight. Vengeance. Anyway that kind of things happens and that's intolerable. Not the movie itself. It starts horribly but the following scenes lets you cool down and understand what may lie beneath these "news items".

		<shortDescription>Riveting brutality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's distilled brutality is hard to take and yet, like pornography, stirs one at some level. In another review here a commentator notes that his copy of the DVD deletes the violence in the S&amp;M club. Too bad. One of the ironies of the story is contained in that scene: Vincent Cassel's character, mad for revenge, is quickly brought down and the vengeance taker becomes instead the victim's former lover who has been desparately trying to keep rein on his companion's rage and has followed Cassel's character to the pit to keep him from adding disaster to tragedy. The film follows the "backwards" chronology a la "Memento." Philospophical pretensions aside, this method of storytelling has it's limits and will become tiresome one day soon. But with the top-notch talent we have here one's interest is naturally engaged: Why, how, what caused what we just saw and we follow the string of the plot, back and back. But the subtleties of character and plot development are not possible as in traditional cinematic storytelling. The method keeps the story, however powerful, at the level of melodrama. Note: The opening scene with two old men on a bed must be racked up, I guess, to the French capacity for mystifying bits of business whose whose relevance to story is impenetrably obscure.

I am absolutely appalled by the scene where they beat the head in of that guy in the gay club, it's still giving me nightmares; at the same time I am wondering how they managed to make it look so realistic, so watch the DVD with the director's commentary it will explain how it was done.

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary violence, unnecessary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. During the rape/beating scene and the murder scene I had to mute the television and look away. I was so devastated and livid afterwards and those feelings have lingered for a week.I am a performing artist, and I can understand that the ideas that a writer or director presents in a film, play, or other medium do not necessarily represent his/her viewpoints. But the question that kept pounding in my head throughout and after watching this film was WHY?What can possibly be the point of the two obscenely graphic violent scenes in this movie? Why write this? Why shoot it? Why make actors portray it? To desensitize us to violence? Hardly. To de-glorify acts of violence? Well, these scenes are certainly less than glorious, but I am lost on any possible larger meaning. In a movie like Saving Private Ryan the creators show war in all its bloody realism in the hopes of de-glorifying what so many other films make look patriotic, noble, black and white. But did anyone think that rape or murder was glorious before watching this film?Perhaps they did it to drive the plot? That can't be, since due to the reverse order of the film we hear about the young woman being raped and attacked and see her after it happens BEFORE we see the actual rape. We can imagine the actual attack with one look at her coma-stricken body - we absolutely do not need to see it. The only reason I can imagine that the director decides to show us this scene is to make the audience empathetic with the men when they seek revenge. But THEY do not see the actual attack - so they are basing their actions solely on her appearance after the attack. That's all we, the audience, would have needed to see.The reverse plotline order is only interesting for the first few scenes and seems more tacked on rather than an intrinsic part of the movie. And is all of the explicit gay bashing language at the beginning of the film really necessary, not to mention all of the graphic and extreme gay club activities? They don't add anything to the film.As a woman watching this movie, I have no idea what the director intended for me to come away with. I ended up feeling extremely angry, scared to ever walk alone, and like getting my blackbelt in karate would be an excellent idea.Perhaps my biggest complaint it that the explanation of the film on the box was not more accurate. This is hardly a "sexy thriller."</fullReview>

During the infamous rape scene I even cried out at one point, I remember.All in all, I wouldn't call the film brilliant exactly, but it certainly does a good job of dropping you straight into hell, and then pulling backwards to show people who are at peace only a few hours before they will be dropped into that hell themselves.And let me just say that Monica Bellucci deserves 3 Oscars just for ATTEMPTING to do what she has to do in this movie.

		<shortDescription>Why this film is shot backwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS.I read here that one of the other IMDB users was unsure as to why Irreversible was shot backwards. 'It served no purpose', was the quote. I disagree. There is purpose, real purpose, in using this technique made famous by 'Memento'.Essentially if you are going to shoot a film with such disturbing sequences in chronological order you would leave the film on a real downer/very depressed/wondering what is the point in life etc. The director wants to show positive aspects of human life, and to finish a film with a brutal rape and then a just as brutal beating of a man to death, does not accomplish this.So why not shoot it backwards? Then you can end the film with the beginning and with the beautiful, touching scenes of a man and wife enjoying each others company - playfully, sexually, comically - in scenes of genuine human emotion and elation as she discovers she is pregnant. These are positive human emotions - and whilst you know that their lives are about to be turned upside down, the director has shown uplifting and joyful aspects of life to combat the ensuing depression and brutality. I think it is genius and really screws with your mind. Also the softer, gentler music, steadier camera-work and brighter colours are indicative of this change of mood and hope in human life.Make sense?Incidentally, shooting in reverse also allows for a pun on the title - irREVERSEible.Without the reverse technique this film would just be a sick portrayal of deprived human anger, rape, revenge and death. And I am not it would have been made - or watched and acclaimed at least. I think the only reason this film works is because it is shot in reverse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Irreversible" is the second most disturbing film in modern cinema. It is a brutal masterpiece that should be seen by everyone, an amazing film of twisted genius. Taking violence to dizzy heights Gasper Noe starts an assault on your senses straight from the beginning but it is the 9 minute rape and beating scene which could push some people over the edge. Watching Monica Belluci being violently raped is extremely disturbing to say the least... it is 9 minutes of pure hell for the victim and viewer making the film stand out as one of the most powerful and realistic rape scenes in cinematic history. During this 9 minutes Gasper Noe gives us a pure static camera with no flashy editing, it's just one long 9 minute shot at ground level where you feel as helpless as Monica Belluci. Cinematography is brilliant, sound is superb and the acting is top notch all the way. Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel are amazing and Albert Dupontel is truly inspired. So Yes it is disturbing... Yes it is shocking... Yes it is sickening... Yes it is incredibly violent,savage &amp; brutal... Yes it is amazing... Yes it is a masterpiece... and yes... it is ONLY the second most disturbing film in modern cinema because the Japanese film "Audition" is without doubt a million times more violent and savage than "Irreversible" could ever be. The bottom line is "Irreversible" is essential viewing and if you don't watch it you are missing out on one of cinemas most amazing works of art ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter how much of the movie I've heard before I saw it, nothing prepared me for the masterpiece slamming into my face. As an art form, the cinematography along with the playing with colors and blind spots was beautiful, boldly symbolic, and sealed the entire movie. Without it, the movie could have been a mundane horror story. This film was obviously directed at the most open-minded audience, as I heard many people found it horrifyingly disgusting and vulgar. But I can't help but think how the purpose of the film, to convey the brutality and cruelty, has been more fulfilled than any other film I had ever seen. When dealing with a subject such as this story, there is no way to sugar-coat such a monstrous event, and in fact the clearer it is the more the audience can learn from it. The pure brilliance came in that as the movie got happier, the audience became more and more anxious and depressed, because of the dramatic irony that lies ahead. On a personal level, it allowed me to appreciate everything I had in my life, and that the most painful mistakes are those when you take the treasures that you own for granted without realizing. Everyone can learn from this film regardless of their own life situation, regardless of their beliefs, regardless of their behavior towards the film itself. I consider it one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, perhaps the dark West Hollywood theater enhanced the mood, but it was one of the few dollars well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insightful--Yet Harrowing--Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it may strike some as exploitive (with some justification) and gimmicky (not only is it presented backwards in real time, each scene is shot in one take) and has perhaps the most astonishingly realistic portrayals of violence in cinema, Gaspar Noe's technically audacious film is, unexpectedly, also an insightful character study. The first half is a harrowing recreation of the lust for revenge after a brutal anal rape and beating that truly requires the viewer's ability to handle viewing these acts in remarkably explicit detail. But it's in the film's second half--where the events leading up to the tragedies devolve--that Noe's gifted direction of some very talented actors (including Monica Bellucci, from `The Matrix Reloaded', Vincent Cassel, the voice of Monsieur Hood in `Shrek' and Albert Dupontel in perhaps the film's most fascinating performance) is brought to the forefront and the superbly loose, semi-improvisational performances help define the characters in subtle ways that clarify the causes and effects of the events to follow. Noe has his flaws--he signifies a little too bluntly (Bellucci recounting a telling dream seems a little too prescient) and the opening scene takes so long a bit of the dread wears off--but he has far more affection for his main characters than his shock counterpart Michael Haneke does for his in `The Piano Teacher'. While Noe may have his aggressive, unpleasant side and mercilessly insists on pushing his audience's buttons, he also gives them an intimate portrayal of relationships constructed much more carefully than anticipated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that all the hype that I had heard about this movie going into it did not dampen the effect of actually seeing it with my own eyes. If you're reading this, then I'm sure you've already heard about the two scenes that make this movie a painful experience.The fire extinguisher scene and the rape scene. First off, the fire extinguisher scene may be the most brutal thing I have ever seen in a film. They literally beat this guy's head and face in with it to the point that his face resembles roadkill. It reminded me of a scene in a Japanese anime I had seen called Ninja Scroll, where the hero headbutts his archnemesis repeatedly in the face, until his face is entirely caved in. Thing is, this isn't a cartoon we're talking about. There's obvious CG trickery employed here but when you see it, you won't believe your eyes. The whole build up to the scene is really bad also. I don't mean bad as in it's unprofessional, I mean bad as in the tension and dread that it causes you to feel being almost unbearable. Gaspar Noe uses this technique at the beginning that I relate to stumbling around a dark and dingy nightclub, high on bad drugs and drink with your senses numbed by the pounding music and swaying of vision. I swear to God, it feels like being dragged along on a descent into Hell itself. The camera work looks like it was handled by a Steadicam operator on acid, someone excited by this new toy that can make the camera pretty much go anywhere and everywhere, spinning around the entire time like a Giger Alien hopped up on Pez. When you finally see this scene, don't say I didn't warn you. This is coming from someone who considers himself pretty desensitized to film violence.The other scene worth mentioning is the rape scene which to date, is more painful to watch than any other rape scene I have personally ever seen in a film. The scene goes on for so long, without any cuts that you almost want to look away. It is so tragic and even more unsettling when you stop and think that this is what it must be like for rape victims when trapped and attacked in this very manner. Monica Bellucci (Persephone in Matrix Reloaded) had a lot of guts to do this and I can only imagine what her real life husband Vincent Cassel, who plays her husband in the movie as well, must have thought upon seeing this. I'd imagine that this movie caused serious emotional stress to those two because of the sheer rawness of it.The rest of the movie itself is technically astounding. The camera work, while annoying sometimes with it's desire to move around a little bit too much, is still noteworthy. The beginning portion of the film reminded me of David Lynch if he decided to trade in his more subtle approach for a wilder, no holds barred technique. The sound employed in the movie was mixed very well and provides for a solid listening experience. The acting is great on all counts and even more impressive when you find out that it was almost entirely improvised.All in all, I thought it was very well done and I'm glad that the movie played out backwards because if this had played out normally, it would've been even more upsetting. Truth be told, I don't think too many people are gonna want to watch this more than once. Would I? I don't think so. I can say that now I understand why so many people walked out on this one. I think that this movie should be seen, at least so you can make your own decision on it and it's content.When it all ends, it will break your heart.Rating: ***1/2 out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie, 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i just came back from the cinema, and i've seen maybe the best intellectual movies of the last years. a great piece of art.why isn't the story told chronologically? because one of the main themes is the determination of things. there's a cause for every action. there's no chance to get away.why the gore scenes? reality bites. in the movie were some hints to help people think about it. f.e. when they talk about sex, pierre says "why can we do it but not talk about it?" why can we talk about violence (f.e. blowing up heads in rap videos) but not show how cruel it really is? showing that kind of violence doesn't play it down, it accentuates it. we can't close our eyes of certain parts of society. we have to know them, otherwise we can't deal with them.one thing i especially liked was another topic in the movie: the bipolarity (i hope that is the right english word) of the world. what's fun for one person hurts another person. there will never be fun without sorrow - the people at the parties (that's YOU as well) are looking for fun all the time...a senseless search. how closely fun and sorrow lie next to each other is obvious when we see people killed and raped, and 10 minutes later we're laughing out loud about some jokes during a conversation.people who don't give the movie more than 6 points are either prude or didn't get what it's all about. an intellectual movie for intellectual people. 10/10, definitely.oh, and of the 30 people in the cinema, some left during the first 20 minutes (money back guarantee when you leave this early...guess they found out it's a movie where you actually have to use your brain :D or they were afraid it would be a gay porn flick), three young women left during the rape scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been brilliant (MAJOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one of those people who thinks this film is pornographic. I get the movie. It's a good movie; especially for a young, relatively new filmmaker. But I couldn't agree more with everyone who argues that it would be infinitely better told chronologically. We would have gotten everything Noe had to say and so much more. The film would have built to a shattering, deeply emotional climax and the fact that it doesn't is one of the reasons that the movie misses greatness. The other films ("Memento", "Betrayal" etc.) which have so successfully been told in reverse still followed the pattern of having a climactic conclusion. Catharsis is essential to all great drama and has been ever since the ancient Greeks invented the artform of tragedy. A series of events create a rising action, a momentum of audience involvement that carries you through until it reaches a height near the end where all the tension that has been adding up must finally be expelled. It's the same principal as an orgasm which perhaps explains why the term "climax" is synonymous. Noe starts this film at a fever pitch that is undoubtably one of the most intense sequences in the history of storytelling. Since nothing can possibly top it (not even an unblinkingly graphic 10+ minute rape scene) the rest of the film becomes anti-climactic. Imagine having your orgasm a few minutes into sex without it adequately building but then being forced to continue grinding away progressively felling less and less for another hour and a half. That's the cumulative effect of "Irreversible". In fact, I should amend my earlier argument: catharsis is not only essential but even further, I propose that it is the true aim of dramatic tragedy and that story is just ultimately a way of helping to achieve that release for the audience. It's also crucial to note that a climax isn't necessarily the same as a payoff. I disagree with Ebert (who argued this particular point first) that told chronologically the violence would have been a payoff. There's two important reasons it wouldn't be: We would have clearly understood that not only did they kill the wrong guy but also that it was PIERRE who kills him, not Marcus as we are led to expect from his ever increasingly violent behavior.I'm willing to bet that because of the intentionally chaotic way the club scene is shot, the idea that many will turn their eyes away and because we probably don't know which guy is which yet; as few as 10% of the audience might realize that Pierre is the killer the first time they see the film. Even Ebert didn't. I freely admit that I didn't. Did any of you? I only found out about it here on the message boards and to me that fact drastically changes the entire film. The film would have been much more powerful to me had that been clear. If it ended as it should have with Pierre, who we see throughout to be a controlled, reasonable nonviolent man killing the wrong guy then I don't see how that can constitute satisfying any kind of vicarious vigilante payoff the audience might subconsciously want for Alex's rape. We would see a senseless act of violence made even more tragic than the act of violence it inspired. We would still have been left to figure out how and why such a gentle man could be capable of it.Yes, I noticed in the rape scene that they got the wrong guy. However, had I seen everything that happens before the party I would have had true empathy for "Alex" rather than just sympathy for "a woman" getting raped. I would have felt like I knew her. That's the distinction between empathy and sympathy for me: it's horrible and sad to read about a person being raped and for that person I have sympathy because they are a fellow member of the human race. If I find out though, that my best friend/wife/girlfriend/mother or sister(etc.) was raped now how do I feel? That, my friends, is empathy. There's absolutely no comparison to how much more affected you are when you personally know the victim. In fact, There's even a scene where Noe effectively makes my point about the immeasurable difference between general feelings and personal ones. Witness the scene where Marcus and Pierre walk out of the party. They hear someone was raped: no major reaction. Then they see who it was...That reaction when they see her is what I feel we, as audience members, were robbed of when Noe unwisely chose to tell the story backwards in favor of merely trying to make some kind of vague intellectual statement about the inevitability of time or fate or whatever it is he thinks he's saying.Telling it forwards would have done nothing to diminish retaining those philosophic ideas and the addition of the personal details would have, I feel, made for one of the most overwhelming and devastating emotional film experiences of all time.Then again, seeing it unfold as it happened with all of that character and story knowledge accumulating would unquestionably make this film even harder for the average person to watch than it already is now.Because then those infamous scenes would have wrung our hearts even more than our stomachs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I managed to sweat my way through this one, wincing more than once to my surprise. Frankly, I was baffled by my own visceral reaction to the 2 graphic scenes in this film, which were, in my opinion, the only noteworthy moments in the film. In fact, I confess that I watched both the rape scene and the brutal finale (at the beginning) several times, not to get a "thrill" but to try to get a grip on my paleo-cortex during those moments....that part of the brain responsible for primative reactions such as rage, lust, fear and flight. I couldn't do it. I found myself cringing and hyperventilating each time with revulsion and sheer anger. I've never been manhandled (pun intended) in this way while watching a film. That being said, the rest of the film becomes submerged beneath these two scenes. The philosophy of existentialism and the novelty of the reverse chronology become absurd notions, goofy cacatenations of the neo-cortex in the wake of all the primal sensations. The only element which seemed to work intermittently with the context was the reeling cinematography which was timed perfectly with the dizzying brutality of these scenes. So, I endured it. Congratulations, Noe. You've managed to help us experience, on some level, the mindless violence we are capable of. That done, I hope never to experience the reality of these events, and I'll not be watching this one again! 6 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing all the hype about this flick I bought the DVD and was not disappointed. The first 45 minutes of the film are very disturbing and the rape scene is pretty much unwatchable, it is so cruel. I found the DVD special feature on the special effects very cool. In fact, they showed how they bashed that guy's head in with the fire extinguisher and after seeing that I'm sure I won't have nightmares because that scene is the most disturbing violence I've ever seen on film and it looks extremely realistic. The last part of the film tailed off a bit, but overall it was worth watching this unique movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a solid film. Borderline fantastic. Once the hype has died down and future generations watch this movie, they will, hopefully, be able to see this film for what it is and not what it's become. Noe presents us with the idea that time destroys all things. Even though the word destroy is tossed casually around in conversation, the definition of the word is very powerful. If the phrase had been time humbly defeats all things, we would have had a different film. But time destroys all things, and it destroys these people. The graphic content was not the point of the film, and I did not find it pretentious. We watched two people who loved each other and found comfort with each other, and then we watched as they were destroyed, except in reverse. Watching the film in reverse was, I think, the only way this story could have been told. Witnessing their destruction before we got emotionally attached to them, and then becoming emotionally attached to them knowing what they did not had a powerful effect on the viewer. Look past the rape scene and you will see an amazing film by a relatively new director. The future couldn't be brighter for this young talent. Rating: 35/40</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERTThe reverse structure of this film is absolutely not a gimmick. The dream of being able to kill with impunity is still alive and kicking in our culture. Regardless of whether or not a rape had preceded the infamous head-bashing scene, the desire to kill that man was always there. Opening the film with it not only removes it from the context of the rest of the film, but demonstrates this in the most horrifying manner possible. Did that man die because of love for Alex? Not at all. Finally there was a reason. Nobody went to the hospital to stay with her. Is one kind of violence more justified than another? I don't think so, and Noe doesn't seem to either. Removing violence from society is about more than keeping racists off the streets; it's about removing the desire to inflict your own pain on others.Also, people, Noe is a Surrealist. His films run on currents of emotion. The incessant gay-bashing at the start of the film and the portrayal of the Rectum as a hellish place is not indicative of homophobia on Noe's part, but of an explosion of hostile feelings in the two main characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7 out of 10.Artful cinema or shocking trash.... this film is hard to watch and will leave its mark on you for quite a while. In my opinion, the film is very artistic in its approach to showing the gambit of emotions and reactions the characters experience before and after a violent sex crime. Unfortunately this film is probably a realistic portrayal of a crime that happens with far to much frequency in the world. Yes, the night club scene is brutal, and yes the rape scene is loathsome.... but what I think really bothers people is that they have to think about them andvalidate them, because they havn't seen what motivated the situation yet. This is what the director was going for, I think. If the film was instead shown front to back, instead of in reverse like Memento, I think I would have empathized with Marcus, and revealed in the beating at the nightclub.... never really stopping to acknowledge that, it was as brutal a crime.I also liked the cinematography....to a point.... After a while I started to feel ill, yet another real emotion that the directory pulled out of me. It does get a little bit old however. As a closing comment to the people that will watch this film: Great films are always great because the create an emotional reaction with in the audience... usually the 'Greats' bring out happiness or love, or and end to loneliness..... This film does the same, only it concentrates on negativeemotions.... Fear, hate, loathing, repulsion.... Everyone tries to hide these emotions.... just dont hide the fact that this film made you 'feel'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, the rape scene and nightclub beating aren't that shocking. There has been worse in movies before. Not much worse, but it's not like violence is a new thing to movies. My problem is with Noe's blatant shock tactics. I understand he uses it to present us with a clear message of how horrible rape is, but it is my opinion that shock tactics is the last resort of a filmmaker. A film's message shouldn't have to be shoved in our face. It should come from your characters and its effects on their life. Noe doesn't know how to transcend his message in such an artful matter, so he puts in some graphic violence instead. There is nothing wrong with ultra violence per say, but with it's use, and I think here it is a result of Noe not knowing how else to get his point across. Also, the novelty effect of doing it backwards is pointless. If anything, it makes the movie worse. It makes us hate Marcus instead of feel sorry for him, and it makes the rape scene much less powerful. Would have been better to just do it chronologically, so we might care that Alex gets raped. That said, the dramatic scenes were alright. Don't look for amazing dialogue, but the acting and directing are enough to make you feel sad, knowing what will happen to them (still think those emotions would have been amplified with events in sequence). Vincent Cassel was the performance that really impressed me. Just raw and uninhibited, but handles the more dramatic stuff nicely as well. As big of a fan as I am of Ms. Bellucci, so doesn't really have much to do here. The camerawork is solid in the second half. It goes the typical `indie' route, doing the hand held style to make it more realistic, and as cliché as that is, Noe does express talent with the camera. It does get annoying for the first 30 minutes when he can't keep it still for more than 2 seconds, but he thankfully rectifies this. Ultimately, Noe simply didn't have the talent to get his point across without resorting to gratuitous violence. It does make the movie interesting, and at the very least entertaining. Cassel gives a great performance, and there is some good cinematography in the second half, but it's just not written well enough to be the great movie some claim.6.5/10* * ? / * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie, the viewer should know that if they are squeamish or is they have a weak stomach, they should probably not watch this movie because of some of the brutal activities that take place in the movie. I have even heard tales of people throwing up in the theater while watching this. I didn't see the movie as disturbing enough to induce vomiting, but it was disturbing nevertheless. Some may find the graphic nature of the film to be over the top, but I did not see it as such that could not be looked around to discover an ultimately good movie. The progression of the movie is quite similar to that of Memento, that is, playing the scences in the opposite order of logical progression. This layout truly lends to the end of the movie which is the brightest part of the movie in terms of set and location shooting, but perhaps the darkest in the movie as realizations are made. The progression of the movie from light to dark is well done and reflects and enhances the overall mood of the movie. The simplistic yet dark score also enhances the feel of the movie. The camerawork is also well done, only using one camera in every scene that I can remember and not switching from five different cameras, each with a seperate viewpoint. The director did a good job of putting the movie together, as he emphasizes the fact that the end of the film makes the beginning that much more profound. In the end for those who can look past the graphic scenes in the movie, most should see an intriguing work that could reshape the way some films are made...and it is safe to say that there won't be anything similar to it this year or maybe for several to come.Rating: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would all the prudes and last Luddites (with a soft spot for gays and women, it seems!) like to answer one little question: Would there be as much slamming of this film (i.e. it is a pretentious, hollow, utterly bombastic effort devoid of any real insight into the tragic human condition which it claims to have 'revealed'; a banal tract serving only to highlight Noe's 'artful' obsession with wrangling in sicko's and putting everyone else off; a pretentious, violent pseudo-'meditation' on the intricacacies of the division between life and art, the worst film of the year etc etc etc etc.) See it is as easy, if not easier to slander a film that it is to moderate opinion.... the above took me under a minute to type out.My continued question: Would there be as much slamming of this film (by those wonderful little worms at 'Rotten Tomatoes') if it did not contain any 'nasty scenes'...... their shallow vitriol shows glaringly.Many of those same critics rate 'The Hours' as one of the best films of the year..... just a little 'insight' into the institutionalized view of all-things-cinematic 'art' and Caucasian 'reality' which they find acceptable to the delicate 'p.c.' palate. Talk about 'featured on Oprah' status quo tugging.All things critical considered, Noe probably gets the last laugh anyway---- on the way to the bank!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whoa...what a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt in my mind this presentation will evoke some strong feelings among many people. This was a completely sick and twisted film, but damn, the acting was exquisite.Without spoiling the key scenes, let's just say this is one helluva powerful movie, whether you like it or not. It contains extremely graphic violence and misogynistic scenes. Irreversible is not recommended for the squeamish. It is brutal, sadistic, and realistic.Irreversible is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As close to hell as possibleThis movie brings you back to the middle ages, staring in fear at the depictions of hell at the church's walls. This, I mean literally and not in a metaphorical sense. The second scene in the gay SM club reminded me of some murals in churches I have seen in Tuscany, Italy. The colors primarily black and red, with devils and demons popping up left and right and above and under, people screaming in anger and lust. When we see these images now in such churches we actually enjoy them a lot, regarding them more as comics then as something that horrifies us. In fact, what does horrify us these days? And more particularly, what horrifies us in cinema? There has been a trend in making more and more violent movies, as well as being unafraid of showing the tragic aspects of life. While our movies became more and more violent and tragic, at least in Western Europe, society itself is trying to secure itself from any violence and insure itself against any tragedy. Instead by fear, we are being held in line and control by ourselves now and our understanding that society is something that can always be improved. For sure we do not need any hell and Armageddon to scare us, or to keep our more 'bestial instincts' under control. This is all good, and we should file all these things as 'progression'. Still, do we really trust our fellow humans? Do we really feel secure? And protected? Or in a more mythical sense: where does Evil dwell these days?Seeing 'irreversible' brings you back to the dark ages, it releases every demon in your soul, it consumes all light around you and all you want to do after enduring it is go home and stay in and never watch a movie again.What is hell? Is it the SM club, where we are being dragged down into, by this modern day devil: the camera? Or is it knowing beforehand what will happen to somebody, something really bad, and then having to watch it? Again, because this devil camera doesn't stop filming, and suddenly, stops swirling around, but just stands there.forever. Is it hell to know that the most horrible scene you've ever seen isn't fully over yet because you know beforehand what the victim will look like after this?When we are finished with this mural, we all have to face the counsel where the movie preaches how this could happen. And only one conclusion is possible, you cannot avoid these things to happen. The whole second half shows you how beautiful the world and especially woman can be when evil is hidden and faceless and it all ends with a chorus. It leaves you with maybe some hope but mostly fear. And you have to control yourself not to kneel down and pray to the gods to spare you and your beloved ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers)Holy crap, I just rented this movie and was completely blown away. The simple revenge plot and somewhat banal dialogue aside, this movie hurt me. The two central sequences, the murder by extinguisher in the gay club, and the horrible, prolonged rape scene, are some of the most gruesome images I've ever seen. I like horror/gore movies, but these are simply more disturbing because they look extremely real, and you feel kind of voyeuristic and sick that you're actually watching them. Perhaps this was intended by the director, I don't know. Frontloading the movie with the most horrific parts means the movie kind of dwindles down by the end/beginning, but after the wringer the audience has gone through, they are not doubt relieved. A must-see, but be prepared, because this movie is not afraid to alienate the audience. Not really a crowd pleaser, to put it mildly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These comments spoil the story of 'Irreversible.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Noe's 'I Stand Alone, I knew his recent venture, 'Irreversible', would be just as shocking and challenging. I decided to gather as much information as possible about the film before actually screening it to give myself an advantage and not be completely surprised by it's graphic nature. I was aware of the 9 minute rape scene that had critics and viewers at the Cannes Film Festival running from the theater, throwing up and calling to boycott the film. Also, I was aware of the sudden act of horrific violence that occurs within the first 20 minutes. (Although I was unaware of the nature of the violent act in question). My advice to anyone that wants to see this film is to read as many reviews to prepare yourself. I guess that's not really enough because the violence is so graphic, but it's better to be aware of it than to be taken off guard. So many people do not want the story spolied for them, but we really don't start watching a film until the credits start rolling. We are so wrapped up in exposition that it is difficult to pay attention to camera work, editing, mise-en-scene, etc. Besides, the story of 'Irreversible' isn't anything ground breaking. The story revolves around the brutal rape and beating of Monica Belucci and how her boyfriend and friend decide to exact revenge on the assailant. Fairly simple stuff, if you ask me. But this film seems to pride itself on form rather than content. Just like any of Brian DePalma'a deliciously trashy films of the '70, 'Irreversible' is not dependent on the storyline. It's actually quite trite. But the true "star" of the film is the dizzying camera work and mise-en-scene. Everything that Noe puts(or doesn't put) in front of his camera means something. When Marcus and Pierre are looking for Le Tenia, I almost fast-forwarded the film to get to the action. Noe jerks us around, ala 'Blair Witch Project' style to the extreme, just to drop the bomb on us when Pierre destroys the guy's face with a fire extinguisher. And he's the wrong guy! Another IMDB reviewer discussed how Noe's film is a pastiche of Hollywood films like 'Memento', 'Fight Club', etc. And it's definitely true. But 'Irreversible' is something that Hollywood would never produce. So where those Hollywood films left off, Noe picks up and attempts to scare the living Hell out of us. There are holes in the film, it is defintely not flawless. Although I praised the camera work and mise-en-scene in the previous paragraph, some of it is pretentious. And the murder and rape scenes aren't entirely realistic. But I don't think realism is what Noe was attempting to acheive. There are great statements about male rage, primal instincts and so on. But I must indict the film on certain cop-outs. When Marcus tells Alex that he wants to f*#k her in the a**, it is supposed to indicate some sort of sad irony which we are supposed to feel because we already know what has happened to them. But really it seems a little too pat. A lot of the plot just seems a little too pat. No one would stop Pierre from visciously killing that guy in the beginning? And no one would, in the 9 minutes Le Tenia terrorizes and sodomizes Alex, happen upon the scene to break it up? I mean really. I am aware a lot of wicked things happen every second, but I just can't buy how nice and convienent certain elements of the plot came together. Overall it is a disturbing film, but I feel the disturbing images attempt to make up for a convienient plot and simplistic story line.Noe tries to compensate for his screenwriting shortcomings by exploiting violence and rape. I am no prude, but I feel that the audiences' imagination is the greatest part of viewing any visual art. What we bring to the movie theater or regular theatre, our own experiences, are going to be the greatest asset to the visual arts. Too many films don't make the audience work for it any more and 'Irreversible' is no exception. It is not judiciously edited, so everything is spelled out for us. But if you think of great shockers and horror films like 'Psycho', 'Halloween', or 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', not all the violence was shown and a lot was left up to our imaginations. Noe just throws the violence around like it's nothing. Yes, it's disturbing, but there is nothing to be desired. With him we've seen it all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant - but not for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*potential spoilers* (although I'm almost positive that everyone is already aware of the story)Brilliant! I rarely use that term to describe a film but Gaspar Noe is able to possess my brain for a long time after I have finished his films. The power behind these films can only be delicately described and most of the time escape words all together. I don't think I need to state that this film will have only a select few viewers who will enjoy it, (although the word 'enjoy' seems rather perverted for the subject matter) let alone understand it. IF YOU ARE UPSET BY BRUTAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. There, I've done my duty as an upstanding citizen and now I can move on. Irreversible is the best film of 2002 (unfortunately in 2002 I was unaware of this). This film is deeply upsetting and from the very start (which is in fact the end) you (hopefully) understand that this film is not simply about revenge or violence, its about life. Life does not have order, it does not have happy endings and horrible things occur every day. Having this film run in reverse only demonstrates how well Gaspar Noe understands both cinema and humanity. By seeing the events of the film unfold without knowing the history behind them makes us more aware of the horrors of violence and revenge because we don't understand the reasons for them to take place. Instead of the typical 'hero' in a revenge film getting sympathy from the audience (and as a result the audience condones this behavior, not matter how disgusting the act) we see a brutal killing without understanding the reasoning behind it. This is the reason many people believe this film is actually violent for the sake of being violent, when in fact Noe is showing just how disgusting violence is regardless of the motives behind it. Bravo! (too bad this point will not be understood by most of the audience-who is too focused on the violence itself, the irony is somehow appropriate) The camera work also creates an eerie, uncomfortable experience for the viewer. We are taken without consent to places most of us would never dare venture to. The 12 scenes, all done with a single shot, create a 'documentary' feel to the film. It's brutal because the camera does not cut away no matter what content is being shown. The violence is excessive (and in this case quite long) because violence doesn't come in a pretty package. We are almost given an endurance test during the underpass scene (at a staggering 10 minutes). We watch as a stranger comes down the stairwell, witnesses what is going on, and finally leaves without doing anything at all (while the camera stays perfectly still, unflinching). This demonstrates perfectly that unless you are the victim of a brutal crime you have the option of walking away and remaining unharmed (and people do choose to simply walk away). Noe takes away this option, we are forced to watch the entire act take place without a break and in this case with the knowledge that in the end the perpetrator walks away and will never be held accountable for this crime (for those of you that didn't notice, the man killed with the fire extinguisher was not the same person who raped Alex). Then to top it off we witness that before this horrible act, a simple argument is what caused Alex (Monica Bellucci) to leave the party alone in the first place. Then even further back we see Alex and Marcus (Vincent Cassel) laying around on a typical evening doing the (boring, I think I heard one reviewer say) typical tasks and saying the typical things (which only makes the things we have already experienced in the film even more effective). The very end of the film is perhaps the most upsetting, a seemingly "perfect moment" when the world feels like it might actually be all right after all. I'm not going to mention much about the directing, acting, etc. because they simply have to be witnessed rather than described. This film is near perfect and anyone that says otherwise I think just had a difficult time with the content (which is totally understandable) and brushed the film off as artistic, foreign crap (which is really unfair). I'd give this a 9.99999 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While films about life's direction and destiny are hardly new (Double Life of Veronique, etc) this film understands what its doing and is certainly worth watching.Beyond the much talked about violence is a simple tale of the entropy of life, and how time can destroy illusions. The technique used to show this works well - of the many films to date that use a gimmick (such as Memento, and Donnie Darkko) this one is the most direct and successful. You do not have to watch it twice to 'get it'. You effectively get to judge scenes with more information than normal, not less. For that reason, the film is moving and powerful, even if it is neither original or easy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult but worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is a difficult film to watch. It's difficult to even like. However, it cannot be ignored and should never be underestimated.The film runs in reverse, so the climax and credits roll at the start of the film. A spinning camera gradually pans down to a gay S&amp;M club where two men are being dragged out by the Police, one on a stretcher with a broken arm. The film then cuts back to a murder. We are shocked and repulsed by what we see. The murder is horrific and as violent as the BBFC could allow - it is painful to watch. The film cuts back further and we see the same two men desperately hunting their victim. Even further still and finally we see the reason. One of the men has an argument with his girlfriend who promptly leaves their party. In a subway she is attacked by a stranger, who proceeds to anally rape and batter her almost to death. Again the scene is in one take and the camera catches it all - for nine sickening minutes. The film ends where the story actually begins, the couple of happy and blissfully unaware of the horrific events that are about to beset them.There is no doubt that the rape scene in Irreversible is controversial. It is probably one of the most harrowing moments in cinema and it lasts for nine full minutes. The murder scene is also brutal; but what makes the film so shocking is its uncompromising look at violence and causality. We get to see and are repulsed by the effect before we understand the cause. This skilfully avoids the usual Hollywood clichés of revenge fantasies since as the audience we are genuinely disgusted by the murder, which of course we should be.Whether you admire or detest Irreversible, you cannot deny its power and craft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still don't know what to make of this film. I have seen it last night and still can't get over how violent and weird this film is. Intriguing concept , innovative editing techniques, and great camera work. Good acting performance but to what end?? extreme violence! Is that art or what?. The film takes you in a roller coaster of emotions as scenes are played backward, just like Memento. it is very cleaver cinematic tricks to reveal the doomed fate of the heroes right from the start and then try to explain the events that lead to the ultimate acts of violence. the unexplained , explained but can not be altered. Irreversible is a good film to watch or to watch out for, I am still undecided . But then again, Art is meant to question your preconceived ideas and challenge the establishment. In that respect, the film more than succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film boo in CANNES? maybe because it had a bad audience who goes in this kind of event only to do that?.Irréversible also had a bad reputation because of its 8 minute rape scene of the vulnerable female protagonist(the scene got more attention than the film itself)FOR ME ,the only reason to walk out the theater would be when the film attempt against my intelligence. FOR THAT REASON I try to avoid dull `car -chasing films' and I don't usually walk out from a cinema.I was more surprised when I learned that THE EUROPEAN AUDIENCE were `offended' and `leave' the cinema.I agree with a journalist who said:'One can't allow a hypocritical indignation,out of focus,of a certain professional critics who confused the fictitious rape scene with a real rape,and they suggested,the DIRECTOR as a perpetrator.IRREVERSIBLE give us-precisely a critical view and THAT VIEW certain critics(and audience) `overlook'.GASPAR NOÉ is an original Film-maker who are not afraid in taking risks,he recently visited BUENOS AIRES(ARGENTINA) to promote `Irreversible' and surprisely his film got good reviews.NOÉ first film, SEUL CONTRE TOUS(1998) is almost an `antechamber' of Irreversible because BEFORE one particular violent scene ,Gaspar give us A WARNING in the screen:That we should stop watching it right now or tho leave the place-This shows what kind of Director he is- A visionary-.HE also chose what kind of audience he wants for his films(obviously the kind who don't leave the theater)In the universe of GASPAR NOÉ(in his films)we find parental love who become aberrant even incestuous,of pregnancies transformed into abortion,of innocent people who pay the price of their bad choices.This film also ask us: are you ready to face a tragedy? Are the society so obsessed with comfort and happiness that when a tragic horrible event occurs the self destruction begins?SPOILER AHEAD: WHEN MARCUS seeks revenge.he is totally out of control.he beats,insults,he find a guy,marcus thinks this is the rapist-they fight-Marcus lose.beaten on the floor.he is saved by his friend(who ended up the violent scene by killing the other guy). In the corner of the frame we see a man watching all this macabre spectacle( almost with joy)This is the real rapist.he stays there without punishment and we hope that fate will finish its job But now we leave this great film thinking of all the events we have watched.No matter how good a film is.there's always a IMDB user who will hate it!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technical Triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor SpoilersIrreversible is a cross between 'Memento' and 'Straw Dogs' and both of them films were brilliant so it makes this film brilliant.Due to all the hype and controversy surrounding this film I wanted to see it but because I am only 16 I was unable to see it in the cinema. I now own the DVD and I was blown away by the film, it is a technical triumph. The filming may put some viewers off the film but I thought it was a change to the plain boring standard filming of films. This film is very well made and the backwards order of the film makes the film stand out even more. I am not easily shocked by violence but the rape and beating of Alex was shocking and the fact that the camera was still throughout the entire rape makes it more unbearable. The scene with the fire extinguisher is also very brutal and realistic but all these factors make the film more well known, making more people want to see it. Ever since I had seen 'La Haine' I knew Vincent Cassel was an exceptional actor and he pulls the role of Marcus off easily, he is great as is Monica Bellucci who is Cassel's real life wife. I thought the film was different but nonetheless brilliant, but people affected by strobe lighting should stay away or not watch the very last scene. Anyone who is a fan of world cinema or something different should watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible is, quite simply, a work of genius. Although relatively short at 90 minutes, the whirlwind of emotions you are subjected to are incredible.Incredible seems too nice a word to use. Of course, i'm talking about the sickening level of violence in this film.Sitting down to watch this will be an experience you won't soon forget. It elects to portray the story it tells backwards, that is you see the final scene and then view the precursor to that scene, and so on. Some people may think that this removes the whole point of a film: You don't ask the question 'What happens next?'. However, while watching this film, you find that the stronger question is 'What happened before?'.Excellent acting and fantastic imagery top it off to leave you with an hour and a half you won't soon forget.Just a final note: Don't watch this if you have epilepsy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ugly but yet beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Irreversible premiered at Cannes, viewers stormed out and declared the film unwatchable. At that point I knew this was a film made for an audience of me. When it came to the Belcourt, thanks to the Nashville Cinema Underground, I was there opening day. This review is filled with so-called spoilers but this information will actually a person understand the movie better and to not be frightened by this celluloid vortex. Irreversible, a cross between A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey with touches of Memento and Rope, is not easy to watch. The movie literally starts backwards with end credits rolling upward and "begins" just after the climax. Like most acts of violence people see, hear or read about, they learn about it afterward, when someone has been arrested or hospitalized. People don't have the benefit of seeing the actual events unfold before them, if so they could probably step in and prevent the ugly climax from happening (especially since they have hindsight). The climax is ugly and it happens next. Two men storm into a gay fuc &lt; bar, searching for one guy. The bar is under lit and the camera is anything but steady. The shaky camera work of Blair Witch Project doesn't induce the cinematic vertigo of Irreversible. When people are recognizable, they are upsidedown or sideways. When one of the men finds the guy, they fight and the man (played by Vincent Cassel, whom you may remember from Brotherhood of the Wolf if the camera ever stays steady enough) loses the bout. The guy graphically breaks his arm and is about to anal rape him when the second man (played by Albert Dupontel) rushes toward the guy and bashes his head repeated with fire extinguisher until it is literally pulverized. Only later does the audience learn the savage murder was an act of revenge. The guy brutally sodomized man #1's girlfriend (played by Monica Bellucci, who recently appeared in Matrix: Reloaded) after she left a party. Irreversible is definitely an ugly film but as the plot flows backwards it becomes beautiful and tranquil. Oddly enough this movie is in praise of women. While men rape and murder, women bring life and beauty. Men objective women: When the girlfriend is "first" mentioned we know her only by name and when the audience first see her she is a victim and sex object; her face is hardly shown. Only later as the audience see her face and hear her speak do we not see her as a future victim but as a person. The movie "ends" in timelessness. She is reading a book on a blanket, surrounded by giddy children. The "ending" is timeless because the director (Gasper Noe), plays with the viewer's perception once more. They are adjusted to his unorthordox cinematography and are responding to his cues like Pavlov's Dogs but the events before the camera don't follow accordingly to his logic anymore. The events are not going backwards as they had beforehand. Is the "final moment" an event in the pre-rape past or is the audience seeing her as a survivor of man's brutality, someone capable of continuing to live her life?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Noe's bleak study of the events leading up to a revenge killing and a brutal rape makes for a harrowing but compelling 90 mins. Much has been made of the horrifying rape and murder scenes but it is the tragic feeling of the inescapable pre-ordained nature of fate that permeates every frame of the film. Noe brilliantly creates an atmosphere of dread whether it be in the hellish oranges and sickening yellows of the beginning of the film or through the brilliant performances which capture the despair seeping through into daily life. Not to all tastes but, like Baise Moi, it demonstrates French cinemas willingness to unflinchingly look at the dark side of human nature and evil. Grimly fascinating, quite depressing but essential viewing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning,but not flawless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film with the knowledge of what to expect,but was still surprised.As cited by various other reviewers,it is violent in the extreme,but then so is the subject matter.The two main horrific pieces (which are horrendous and were somewhat difficult to watch) provide an equilibrium of sorts,the crime committed,the revenge executed,under which there are several tableaux running, depicting the bond of love shared between the three main characters..I found it almost as upsetting to see the moments shared by Alex and Marcel prior to the rape,as the incident itself.The closeness,and ease with which they shared their lives.The subject matter is bad enough to start with,but but to assign real feelings,and historical background to the main characters,has obviously made the film much more difficult to watch,and although you dont particularly feel great warmth for the principal characters,you know something about them,they are not unnamed cannon fodder on a battlefield losing limbs in glorious technicolour,or drive by victims dying in a hail of 9mm rounds.. these are real, ORDINARY people,dimensional,fallable.It really saddens me to hear people saying "this is as bad as Faces Of Death",I mean who are these people? I suspect they have missed the point ( I could really use some expletives here....but i wont) As a cinematic piece i thought it was excellent,though I found the spinning camerawork alluding to Marcels downward spiral into primal violence a bit irritating and unneccesary,although in other areas it worked very well.In contrast,the static voyeuristic shot of the rape scene...horrible,an ordeal but compelling and emotionally wrenching. In summary,its fair to say this film will not be for everyone, I found it hard to watch myself in parts,but personally I hope that it will provide enlightenment to the real horror of a very commonplace,and often undetected crime,and highlight the emotional as well as physical carnage that can result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the faint hearted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is defiantly not a film for the faint hearted! I openly brag that I can watch anything, but twice during this film I found myself looking away and covering my ears. The film is amazing though and if you can cope with the brutal murder and rape that has made this film so controversial you will be wowed by the acting, camera work and pure poetry that this unique film. The brutality of this film is something that cannot be ignored. Despite the beauty wavered within the closing (chronological start) of the film in the love story of Alex and Marcus and the discovery of Alex's pregnancy, the opening of the film, it's chronological end is one that takes a stomach of lead. The Murder of the rapist and the build up to the murder creates a vast amount of tension that continues till the end of the rape scene and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. This film is a cinematic landmark that should be considered to be one of the best films in a long time. If can look at this film as say that it doesn't effect you then your a liar. As I watched the start of this film I couldn't help but watch, I found it hard to not be completely submerged within the film of the film even though it was a brutal film at the start.See the film and enjoy the new way in which director Gasper Noe has used the camera and played with the narrative, but don't get so caught up in the poetry of the camera that you ignore the messages and important issues dealt with in the film, and believe me when I say that you will never want to walk alone down a subway again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best and the worst thing to happen to film in a while.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the unfortunate, and fortunate, opportunity to see Irreversible with my girlfriend recently.While we can talk all we want about Noe's use of color and abstract plot structure, what is really controversial about this film are 2 scenes. The opening scenes that are the epitome of violence and the much-discussed rape scene.It rattles my nerves and tells me just how powerful this medium of film truly is that it can evoke emotions of love, longing, desire, passion, pain, introspection, hate, and just about every emotion quantifiable. And when it wants to it can grab you by the hair and make you see something that you never wanted to see, feel things that you never were comfortable feeling. What this film did was an example of film flexing its muscle. The medium itself standing up and saying "I will make you sick. I will make you revolted in your seat. I have that power"The rape scene was important because there has never been a depiction of this crime on film like it. It happens thousands of times a day all over the country, all over the world and we've become desensitized to it. You see that a girl has been raped on the evening news and in between sips of coffee or turning to Sportscenter, you go "awww, that's a shame".Irreversible holds your hands to the fire and shows you, doesn't 'tell' you or 'leave it to your imagination', but SHOWS YOU how brutal, demoralizing, demeaning, and barbaric this act truly is and does not let you file it away aimlessly in the back of your mind so that the very next time you hear about someone being raped or a woman saying how this is the most horrible thing a human being can experience, you KNOW what she is talking about...you feel it...you don't file it away...It almost makes us all rape victims for a while because that scene is so invasive that most people have nightmares afterward. I know I did and I know that I called almost every woman in my family the next day and just talked to her. Not about rape or about this film, but just talked to her and made sure everything was fine.I gave this film a 10 based on its power and thought-provoking nature alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have never seen anything like IRREVERSIBLE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a profoundly unique and disturbing film, a cinematic experience in the truest sense of the word. The cinematography alone is a jarring experience equivalent to a seizure or a "bad trip", and the subject matter only increases the viewer's discomfort. Monica Belluci's fearless performance should be especially commended; her soon-to-be-infamous rape scene will never be cleansed from my mind's eye, and neither will the matter of fact murder of her rapist, two of the most unflinchingly brutal scenes to which I have ever been witness. These are not spoilers, because they are the beginning of the actual film, though the end, chronologically, of the story. And anyway, there is no way to "spoil" this film. It must be seen, but only by those with strong nerves and stronger stomachs, as evidenced by the many walkouts nationwide. The backwards temporal structure of MEMENTO is used to far more powerful effect here; unfortunately, it is a relative certainty that fewer people will see and appreciate IRREVERSIBLE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifically beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING: This review contains plot spoilers necessary for a thorough and even analysis, although given the structure of the film, what a spoiler is defined as becomes murky.)A shocking, bewildering and horrifically beautiful movie, Gaspar Noe's "Irreversible" is a meditation on humanity, evil, and the all-consuming forces of time and primal desire. While the film has received much publicity for its depiction of sex and violence, it overshadows a brave and profound film headed by some of France's most potent actors.After having a fight with her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent Cassel), the beautiful Alex (Monica Bellucci) leaves a party, taking a short cut through an underground tunnel. In the tunnel she is brutally raped and beaten into a coma by a man called Le Tenia (Jo Prestia). Marcus and Alex's ex-lover Pierre (Albert Dupontel) track down her assailant to punish him, eventually coming across a gay sex club, where they beat a man's face into a smashed and bloody pulp.The film is told in reverse. We first see Marcus and Pierre's revenge, Marcus overtaken with violent rage and Pierre resisting the feeling. The film goes backwards in time, showing more pleasant scenes that give a grave foreshadowing and a deep inevitablity to events that will take place, events the audience has already been privy to. Even the camera calms down as the film goes backwards. In the sex club, the camera refuses to focus on any scene for more than a few seconds, spinning chaotically. By the last scenes, the camera is languid and calm.Bellucci gives an amazingly brave performance as Alex, a woman unaware of the depths of human nature until she is faced with them head-on. Cassel is also wonderful as a man who is equally unaware but all too eager to descend into bestial urge. The dialogue seems almost entirely improvised, and it lends the film a realistic quality that it may otherwise have lacked. Music and set are used judiciously, with neither aspect distracting us from the performances of the actors or adding unnecessary flourishes.This film is not for everyone. Rape and its aftermath, including revenge fantasies that accompany it, have become stylized and glorified in cinema, especially in America. Alex's assault and the retaliation in the club are not something out of a made-for-TV movie: they are brutally honest, shockingly real depictions not for the feint of heart. Those with delicate sensibilities will find little to enjoy there. However, anyone brave enough to attend this film (and to sit through the minute of strobe light that accompanies the end), will be rewarded with a searingly visionary depiction of the darkness found in the human soul and the destructive power of the base forces that govern the world. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing I say here hasn´t been said before. Suffice it to say, I found watching this movie a harrowing and disturbing experience. There´s no doubt it´s a display of subtle technical wizardy. But the question that plagues is: is it art...Everyone will have their own opinion. It is certainly a very distasteful movie. Or some may say thought-provoking.It´s great to see a movie wrench so many vastly different emotions and opinions from an audience. However, all its deepness can´t disguise a lack of plot and a fairly poor script.Without being told in reverse, without the fine filming, and the disturbing anal rape sequence and violent scenes, I imagine "Irreversible" would be little more than your average made-for-TV American (albeit in French) movie.1 - 10 / 10 Who knows.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film About the Choices People Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. It's thought provoking, but not because of extended head-bashing or rape scenes. The thinking comes after the ending sequence, which is anything but violent and casts the rest of the film into context. The end makes the film fascinating and worthy of debate.The violence is presented as violence should be, harrowing, chaotic and difficult to watch, just like the real thing. The only thing sickening about this film is the almost experimental and interesting initial camera work and some of the transitional camera work. The spinning effect is disorienting and therefore appropriate for the film, especially in light of the ending. The documentary quality of the extended shots that comprise the narrative sucks you into the story and gives it a veracity that editing wouldn't have accomplished. The single camera following one character or situation to the next also plays into the whole stream of consciousness aspect that is part of the overall feel and theme of the film.The story being told in reverse adds depth and meaning and subtleness and once again, considering where you end up, very appropriate and part of the film's overall vision. As other people have said, this film starts in violence and works it's way back to innocence, not as a gimmick or to simply make the plot comprehensible, but to build the theme and emotional context of the whole movie. Something that Memento didn't have, it being a clever film for the sake of cleverness and lacking any emotional depth.If you're squeamish, rent the film and fast forward through the parts that you just can't watch. You will miss some of the overall context by not seeing the film as the director intended, but you can at least get the overall affect.I believe, but I'm not sure, that the man sitting on the bed at the beginning is the Butcher from some of Noe's earlier films. This really had nothing to do with the movie or the story, but it was an interesting thing I stumbled upon on the database here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough to watch but successful film experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the controversial French film some critics are calling "unwatchable" because of the extreme violence and sex. It's definitely an experimental film, but it worked for me. The story is a simple one: a girl is raped and her boyfriend kills the rapist. But Noe tells the story in reverse, which makes the entire movie far more complicated. We watch as this guy tracks down another in a gay sex nightclub. When he finds him, he smashes his head with a fire extinguisher again and again until it's flattened into a bloody mess. The camera does not break away from this violent scene and it's quite brutal, though not that long. Then we jump back in time to see how the guy found out about the nightclub, then how he found out about the rape (he sees his girlfriend being dragged away on a stretcher, her face covered in blood, and he's told she's in a coma). Then we see the rape itself -- an amazingly frank piece of cinema. It's long, ten or fifteen minutes, and the camera doesn't move. It just goes on and on, and when it's finally over, the guy totally beats the girl's face into a bloody pulpy mess. This is definitely not an enjoyable film up to this point. As the "narrative" continues, we move to the party where the girlfriend and boyfriend are before she leaves early, and then before that on the way to the party. The final scene is the two alone at home, in bed, showing the playful and loving sides of their relationships, and making sex seem delightfully innocent.As I said, a simple tale, but told in reverse. Here's the effect of that reversal, however. First, when we see the guy seeking revenge against the rapist, we have no idea what he is doing or why. He seems like an insane person. Later, of course, we understand, but by showing his revenge first, we're far more shocked and horrified by his violence than we would be otherwise. Second, when we experience the rape (and I do mean experience), we haven't yet met the girl. She's faceless at that point (emphasized by Noe by not showing us her face until later). This has the effect of both dehumanizing her (she's faceless) and making her an everywoman (she could be anyone). Those are important because we don't form judgements about her. Later, when we "meet" her for the first time, our perceptions of her change. We get to know her after the rape instead of before, and while you might think that knowing her first would make the rape more powerful, it works even better in reverse, since we have no opinion of her at all before the rape. That enhances the trauma of the rape, making it seem even more barbaric and unfair. For example, once we meet the girl we might see how provocatively she dresses and judge her, saying she asked for the rape. But Noe avoids us thinking that way by having the movie in reverse.The other thing about the reverse gimmick that makes it so powerful is that we go from brutal, cruel, and ugly images to beautiful and innocent images (the reverse of real life which tends toward destruction not creation). The final shots of laughing children running through a lawn sprinkler is all the more heart-breaking because we know that that innocence is already (or will be) lost. The tragedy of lost innocence is expressed far more powerfully in this technique. The whole film is an exercise to show us this, as Noe emphasizes with two techniques: color and camera movement. The first fifteen minutes of the film is positively headache inducing as the camera is never still and never at any normal angle. It's as though they mounted the camera on the back of a dog chasing his tail: the image spins and whirls and rarely do we see anything recognizable (which, while they're in the gay nightclub, is a good thing ;-). But gradually, as the film continues, the camera becomes more and more passive, leading to total stillness during the rape. The colors at the beginning of the film (the end of the story) are all dark, bleak, and there's a lot of red. By the time we get to the end (the beginning) there's brightness, sunlight, happiness, and wonderfully green grass. While this makes the beginning of the film tougher to endure (wild camera and dark, ugly images), it makes sense storywise. As the boyfriend seeks revenge, he gets more and more angry and agitated, and so does the camera. Logically, the landscape gets bleaker as well.Noe's script uses what we might call reverse foreshadowing: in the normal direction there are hints of the dire future so that when it comes it subconsciously feels expected. But foreshadowing is such a subtle thing that few notice it. In reverse, however, foreshadowing is far more powerful. For instance, after we've seen the rape, we hear (before that) someone say, "Be safe" to the girl, and that takes on a terrible irony since we know she won't be. In another scene, the girl talks about a book she's reading where people dream of their future, and later (at the end of the film) we see that happen to her. Since we already know her future, her premonition is even more dramatic and there's no suspense of "Is she crazy or do we believe her?" We know she's right and that's scary. The reverse technique is fascinating when used properly.As many have said, this film is tough to watch. The violence is brutal and shown in an unflinching fashion. While difficult, that's real life. I personally prefer this kind of realistic violence than Hollywoodized versions that glorify it. This absolutely does not glorify violence or rape at all: it presents it in horrible reality. Other films have tried to show realistic violence, especially rape (think Jodie Foster in The Accused), but this film, by getting rid of camera tricks and just showing us the brutal reality straight on without blinking, does a more credible job of expressing the horror and obscenity of such acts. Some critics have said that this film is obscene itself, but that's not true: the rape and violence it shows is obscene, but not the film itself. The film is the messenger, not the message; the vehicle, not the passenger. The film makes an incredibly powerful statement about destiny, reality, violence, and sex, and provokes us to think about our attitudes toward those things. If you can bear it, it's worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average, sad story, told in an extraordinary way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This much talked about film deserves its notoriety, but it is not a shockingly original story. It is a simple story of revenge, except the film rolls in reverse. We start with the revenge scene, an infinitely paranoid scene; leading to a gruesome climax. Then tracking back to the event that serves as the precursor to the revenge, followed by the build up to that. The story, if told in a conventional way, is not all that remarkable. The violence, depicted so vividly will make you feel uncomfortable; when we first witness this, as there is no pre-story we are left with a cold void. As the story pans out, the void is filled satisfactorily, perhaps even making the violence even more tragic.Gaspar Noe's cinematography keeps the viewer disorientated and on-edge. His willingness to refuse to hold back will perhaps shock those who rarely venture far from their local multi-plex, but 'authenticity' is the reward for Noe's endeavours.If you are of a 'squeamish' disposition, go and see this film and get over it. If you wish to see a story full of originality and cutting-edge subject matter, look elsewhere. But those who wish to see a brutal story of revenge, depicted in a suitably brutal way, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart-Stopping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie at a local art house theater here in Seattle. Noe's talent is undeniable. Yes, the film's rape scene is unspeakably ghastly and gruesome, but it's the most honest and heart-stopping enactment of such a dehumanizing act. That scene is so flawlessly acted, and the fact that the camera doesn't turn away, leaves you nowhere to turn to, it literally assaults you for 8+ relentless minutes.By approaching the scene so mercilessly, Noe forces you to have empathy for the victim, rather than simply feeling pity for her. To me, that is ballsy--to demand the viewers to take it in our seats, and we do--it plays out like a slow cigarette burn to your forehead. Tasteless? Hardly. Damn the filmmakers that turn scenes of this violent nature into neat, digestible packages for mass consumption. Rape is ugly, violence is ugly, and it should be portrayed as such. It should be unwatchable, and it should leave you sick to your stomach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good: The movie was cathartic, thanks to Monica Belluci who was in a brave role, Vincent Cassel who transforms well from lover to pothead to victim to avenger, and Albert Dupontel whose whimpering yet unstopping violence is the sad conclusion of his friends' advice to "let go." Furthermore, the rapist has a demonic face reminiscent of the vampire make-up in the Buffy series, and I'm wondering if his face has been altered of if he's really got a face that pisses you off just looking at it smirk.The special effects are gruesomely convincing, and much more appreciated for their unglamorous depiction of violence. The camera work is fascinating, I was expecting hand-held video from the descriptions of nausea. The movie is rightfully unglamorous in violence, but gorgeous in fluid cinematography.This movie came packaged with so many layers of warnings that even if those were ultimately what made me want to see the movie, I was nervous myself of getting physically sick at least during the first ten minutes of the film. Then I forgot and immersed myself in the world of Gaspar Noe. Memento is often referred to when speaking of this movie's narrative order, but the movie starring Guy Pearce had a certain level of redundancy by always ending with a previously seen shot, and some scenes just drew yawns. Whether it's because this film establishes itself upon the groundwork of the previous film, or because of the consistency in the character's change in this story, each scene back in time didn't need to establish a dead obvious link to the one before to convey it was further back in time. It's a better editorial choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing and Profoundly Disturbing Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gaspar Noé's Irreversible is an amazing and profoundly disturbing experience, not just because it depicts a landscape of sick and lurid and evil things, but because it has the audacity -- and demonic skill -- to make you feel as if those things were happening, live, right in front of your eyes. Early on, the camera whips around in a disorienting frenzy, descending into the lavalike inferno of a gay sex club, where the somber orgiastic assault climaxes with a head-bashing murder that may be the most gruesomely terrifying event I've ever witnessed in a movie. What creeps under your skin is the ghastly suggestion that we're watching the ultimate act of sadomasochism -- i.e., that the murder victim enjoyed it.Noé is like Kubrick crossed with de Sade in the age of underground vérité porn; he wants to scare the living hell out of us. Yet is he a moralist as well? ''Irreversible'' turns out to be a tale of rape and revenge told in reverse order, and the sexual violation, staged in a single, excruciating nine-minute take (Monica Bellucci's performance is, quite simply, heroic), is a catharsis of ugly truth that blots away the grimy memory of every exploitation film you've ever seen. After a while, a didactic overdeliberateness seeps into Noé's design, but there's no doubt that he's a new kind of dark film wizard: a poet of apocalyptic shock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that will make you want to die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers Ahead*** Going to see this movie will probably be the most disturbing cinematic experiences of your life. Quite frankly, it makes movies like Requiem for a Dream and Dancer in the Dark look like fuzzy kittens frolicking in a meadow of posies. So be warned: you will not enjoy watching this movie. You may cry or vomit (seriously), and you may wish that you had never mustered the energy to wake up that morning, but whatever you do, do not leave in the middle of this film. It must be experienced in full. Constructed in Christopher Nolan's time-in-reverse pattern, Irreversible is the story of a man whose blood thirsty desire for revenge on the monster who brutally raped the woman he loves consumes his total being. Unlike the majority of contemporary filmmakers, Noe refuses to let us see a sugar-coated version of reality. Instead he holds his camera on images of unspeakable acts, and forces us to watch them; after all, in real life you can't turn away from the rapist who is violently sodomizing you. There is beauty in this film, but unfortunately it make take a few days to understand it. Irreversible depicts both tranquility and complete anarchy of emotion. From the second scene of the film we are thrown into a frenzy of disorienting rage and malicious wrath, but by the end our experience has been converted to almost pure bliss. We are haunted by demons, but received into the arms of benevolent angels. This film juxtaposes hate and love more vividly than anything you will ever see. Granted you will see a man gradually get his head smashed into pieces, and a continous shot of a woman being raped for an excrutiating 9 minutes. But, though this movie may be the hardest thing you will have endured in a long time, the end result more than justifies the means.</fullReview>

And then some.DO NOT SEE THIS FILM if you are the least bit sensitive.

		<shortDescription>Haunting and beautiful as a memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a mind turning through the mists of its own memory, the camera in Irreversible turns through shadowy places that from time to time collect in the light. We see random details, we see nothing, we see ambiguous surfaces that sometimes clarify themselves and sometimes don't, we see moments of clear and unforgettable horror, and we see distant visions of serene happiness and youthful play set in no clear place or context because the place and context are irrelevant. And like so many of the images that haunt our memories, the images in Irreversible haunt us too. What exquisitely rendered imagery! And what an extraordinarily original and moving film! Shame on the thoughtless critics who think this film is nothing more than a graphic depiction of rape and murder shot by some good cameramen. Irreversible doesn't need a complex plot. It doesn't need to soften the brutality that many human beings do in fact suffer or the mistakes they do in fact make. The film only needs viewers who open their hearts to the tragedies of contemporary life; the good-bad power of time; and the beautiful, sad flights of the mind as it moves forward and looks back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gaspar Noé recounts a simple story in a cinematically complex and emotionaly harrowing manner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the end of Irreversible, a title forewarns that `Time destroys everything,' the screen turns white and climaxes in furious flickering. It would be an understatement to describe as 'unconventional' what happened up to that point. Writer/director Gaspar Noé recounts a simple story in a cinematically complex and emotionaly harrowing manner. He lays out his story backwards, in ten minute long shots, dizzying at first, peaceful at the end.We meet Marcus (Vincent Cassel) at an underground S&amp;M club, rabidly seeking revenge from his girlfriend Alex's rapist. An über violent skull bashing scene will only test your stomach for what ensues. We meet Alex (Monica Bellucci) in an underground passage, as she is brutally raped and assaulted during an unbearably uncomfortable nine minute steady shot. The film progresses in reverse, while the audience familiarizes with the characters, pieces together the storyline, and ends up feeling emotionally paralyzed after already knowing the final outcome.There will be walkouts during the violent scenes and some will accuse Noé of sensationalism, but when the film's effect flickers furiously in your mind and under your skin for days to come, you'll be thankful you endured it.Stephan Paschalides</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misunderstood masterpiece - contains Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really understand all the people who are condemning this movie as violent exploitation. The violence isn't graphic for the sake of shock value at all. It is graphic to mourn the peace that is destroyed, not to glorify its destruction. The basic point of the movie is that the actions you take in life cannot be taken back. That is why the final scenes of the movie show the two lovers in such a calm way, because it makes the beginning (the end) all the more disturbing, because you already know the actions they will take and you cant help them because their fates are already sealed. "Time destroys everything" means exactly that. The film is told backwards to resemble a memory, and the camera is so schizophrenic in the opening scenes to show the husband's desperate and mostly unfocused lust for revenge. The characters aren't thinking rationally, they are operating on pure, uncontrolled instinct and the camera shows that visually. It creates a nightmare that is in direct opposition to the beautiful dream at the end of the movie (the beginning). The movie shows violence in such a graphic way to make the ending all the more tragic. If the director had cut away from the rape or not shot the death of the man in the club in such uncomfortable way, the impact of the main theme wouldn't have such resonance. And the fact that it is an innocent (relatively, since he does try to rape him) man and not the rapist who gets killed, adds to the impact of the film. I don't think it is fair that people compare this movie to other recent controversial films like "Baise Moi" (which IS cheap exploitation and deserves all the critism it gets), because Irreversible does have a point and is breaking important new ground in film making. The ironic thing about the violence in Irreversible is that it is honest, yet people don't want to see violence as it really happens, because it makes them uncomfortable. We want to be lied to, because it makes us feel safer. We are so used to seeing violence as cartoonish action movie fluff, that we have lost touch with reality. It is important to see the world as it truly is, and not as we think it is or how we hope it is because it halts any efforts to change its ill because we aren't that moved to change them, because we don't think they are really "that bad". Films that don't lie about reality like "Irreversible" are important for people to watch as a way to formulate answers to problems through opening people's eyes to the real world. This movie SHOULD make you uncomfortable. Violence should make you uncomfortable. And I applaud director Gaspar Noe for having the guts to show people something they don't necessarily want to see, but something they NEED to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transcendent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers*I've never before been moved to write a comment about a film, but after seeing Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, I felt compelled to do so.I was intrigued by this film due to the sensationalism surrounding it's subject matter and the polarized opinions that it tends to garnish. I consider myself to be a hardened movie-goer--I've seen a lot, and it takes quite a bit to shock or surprise me. This film succeeded in doing both--no amount of press had prepared me for the visceral odyssey that I endured. Watching this film transcended simply attending a movie--it was a singular experience. Can I recommend this movie? I'm not sure. This is not to say that it was a bad film, rather, it was superbly crafted, technically awesome. Noe possesses a masterful hand at manipulation, immediately evoking to my mind the spirit of Hitchcock. His entire film is designed to provoke the viewer both intellectually and physically, to challenge the audience's motivations for viewing such a work and cause them to question their complicity in the events depicted (the inherent voyeurism of the cinematic experience and the responsibility of the audience as a silent character in the movie). Noe was at the screening I attended, and his post-viewing discussion supported my hypothesis--Noe even utilized technology implemented by Riot Police in dispersing crowds to disturb the viewer on a subconscious, physical level. Apparently, certain low frequency tones discombobulate human physiology, leaving the victim with a confused, unidentifiable nausea. These tones were heavily employed during the grueling murder scene, and the technique was horribly effective (I'm not sure how well this all would translate to home theaters). I'm sure many people are curious about the violence, as I was, and those seeking a cheap thrill might be surprised to find themselves penetrated by the work and forced into introspection about their own psychology and relationships to art and cinema. A completely worthwhile experience, but one I'll not likely ever repeat. Not recommended unless one wants to test themselves and anticipate a highly personal, exceptional and brutal journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary and powerful film (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is certainly one of the most powerful and moving films of its kind in recent years. The effort required by the viewer to get past the gore and the often dizzying (and, admittedly, sometimes irritating) camera-work is substantial but you'll be ultimately rewarded with a highly intelligent, very moving and superbly acted film.Criticism of the extinguisher scene is ridiculous. It is the climax to an incredible opening sequence which is (intentionally) disturbing and unsettling. To have cut it would have lessened the impact of the rest of the film. The lighting of the scene and the minimal camera-movement mean that there is no 'glorifying' or 'exploitation' - it simply and incredibly effectively shows the horrific consequences of male hormones and revenge. The fact that it's the wrong man makes it all the more powerful.And the rape scene has been criticised by many for its length. The length is surely there to pummel our senses and try to give some idea of what such an ordeal might be like. The total detachment with which the scene is filmed (minimal camera-movement again) serves to show the stark reality of what is happening. After the best part of ten minutes everyone is thinking "God - this is never gonna end.....", and surely that's the point? I think it puts us as near as we are ever going to get to feeling like the victim.And these two scenes put the rest of the film, with its wonderful and touching moments of humour and love, into context.The acting is fantastic throughout. To do any of the scenes, even lighter stuff like the lovely tube scene, without cuts is impressive, but for Prestia and Bellucci to do that 9 minute rape scene in a single take is truly amazing. Bellucci deserves nominating for every acting award going.This film will stay with you for a long time. It has many memorable images (both horrific and beautiful) that will burn into your movie subconscious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of Irreversible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like Irreversible are only meant to be seen by the 'true' cinemagoer. This is the second time I can remember people walking out of a film, the other was for an equally powerful film, Bad Leutenant by Abel Ferrara starring Harvey Keitel. This film however, caused a quarter of the cinema to walk out. And its that proof that this should only be viewed by the real cinema-lover. If they only knew that there was a meaningful, serious, exploratory film behind the first 20 or so minutes they would have probably been writing this review too! They would have also realised that Gaspar Noe actually presented the film backwards for viewers' comfort. Had all the viewers sat thru the film and then experienced such graphic sex &amp; violence at the end of the film, they would have left the cinema numb with shock, they also would not have asked so many questions about the film whilst they were watching it.The title also tells you a bit about what the film's meaning is. As it suggests, what will be, will be. Almost fate or destiny, something you dont really have control over. A small scene where 2 of the characters almost feel something will happen is deja-vu like, but they dont know it yet.The club sequences are an insight into the seedy underworld that exists beyond the reality and sanity, the journey to 'Le Rectum' almost comical, and the 2 scenes of sex &amp; violence grossly exaggerated-for a reason. Had the senseless rape of Alex been more subtle, you kind of believe that the following reaction would never have taken place. But this scene is necessary to show everyone how despicable rape is.The initial picture you get of the main characters, Marcus &amp; Pierre are raving lunatics, then you continue asking yourself what are they up to, and why. Then when you see their seemingly mindless fury, you really are disturbed. Then, the film rolls back, and back, and you start to get the jigsaw puzzles coming together, and you slowly see what causes them to lash out so violently and insanely. The only thing I can honestly say that affected me was the camerawork, spinning around all over the place, at times irritating &amp; annoying, but this too was intentional, giving the audience the feeling of confusion, and a sense of disorientation-for a reason.Irreversible is a well made film and deserves a view...IF you can handle a savage rape and stomach turning violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perfect idea, bad realization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[contains a few spoilers...] The first thing that came to my mind when the movie ended was, "Much ado about nothing." I loved certain visual effects (e.g. the red lamp one.) I found the idea of the movie (at least the one I found) awesome. However... First: the movie was not what I expected and I don't understand why it should be called brutal. Second, there was too much "crap" next to the good parts. What I could not really understand was the end. After the "Natal Test" I unintentionally caught a glimpse of several people in the theatre. They were watching the screen as though they were about to swallow it, waiting impatiently. I felt like laughing outloud (which was the case even before I saw those around me.) And I wondered, did the director want to make fun of people's susceptibility to movies influence or was this simply the effect of a failure? Anyway. In fact I could say I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gasper the friendly...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a tiny scene in this movie that is more chilling than the rape or the murder. During the rape, in the background at the end of the subway, a silhouetted figure appears - an ordinary Pierre on his way from A to B. He pauses, momentarily mesmerised by the scene unfolding before him, then slopes off into the shadows.He'll take the Overpass.This is your choice with this movie. Avoid it but all means (most will), walk out if you must, but consider your options because this is film that forces you to confront your reaction to on-screen violence like no other I have seen. Bar one: At the end of Noe's "I Stand Alone", shortly before a scene of shocking violence between father and daughter, a flashing caption appears warning the audience that time is counting down to the impending violence and they really should leave the theatre if they can't handle it. In other words time is about to destroy everything but, if you know the score, you have the choice. You can turn away and take the overpass or you can confront "it". It won't be pretty but life is not pretty. At the beginning of "Irreversible" an old man confesses to a stranger that he slept with his daughter: "I can't stop thinking about it...she was so cute...". The stranger muses on this and attempts to comfort the old man: "There are no bad deeds, only deeds".That's right, this film will take you to a very dark place indeed.Gasper Noe is a great film maker and "Irreversible" could be his defining work. Outside of all the hype over his confrontational style, the man clearly wants us to walk out of the cinema (at the end of the film, if at all possible) and have an intelligent debate about real violence and our response to it. This is the polar opposite to "gratuitous". These are Big Ideas folks! Stick that "2001" poster right slap bang in shot one more time Gasper - you and I are on the same wavelength.Yes it's true, the gritty nightmare of the opening scenes are darker and more sweat-inducing than any I have witnessed in contemporary cinema. Really, they are. The breakneck chaos of the mens' search for the Rectum club, the (inky) black humour of the "she-male" scene in the alley, the shattering of the (wrong!) head in the gay club (not a big fan of those establishments I gather, Gasper?) and of course the rape of Belluchi - all contrive to nail you to your seat. Unless your're my friend Ben, of course, who shot the hell out of his seat about six minutes into the rape never to be seen again.Yes, these sequences may shock even the most jaded and disensitised 21st Century film-jock out of his torpor. The acting is superb and the camerawork typically (for Noe) unhinged. The ending, like that of "I Stand Alone" leaves the audience in some doubt as to whether the nastiness all happened at all. Sometimes we need a mental get-out clause, Gasper obviously does as he's done this ending two films in a row. The final flourish of strobing cuts the movie dead without end credits (we had those at the beginning, of course) and you may, as I did, find yourself stunned, exhausted and rather impressed. Now, whatever your response, try discussing your immediate reaction with your fellow shell-shocked audience member - it often helps to share the experience of being run over by a train.Before he disappeared into his own personal Rectum Club, David Cronenberg had the potential to make a movie like this. Ah, no matter...I wouldn't compel anyone to see this movie but I'd certainly remind them of their choice. I've pitched my flag - I think it's a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bambi, this ain't. But it's very good anyway.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a little surprised Irreversible has drawn such damning criticism. Gaspar Noe always provokes his audience with extreme violence - and expects, no doubt coverts, the predictable outrage - but this film has also been attacked for naivety and failing to top the scenes which characterise the first half.I think this is unfair for a number of reasons. Storytelling in reverse has certainly been done before, but here it is an effective device. One of Noe's goals is to show how quickly the veil of human sensibilities can drop. The stomach-churning murder scene, which defines the beginning of the film, is so strong that it is still a vivid memory by the end, when you see the perpetrators in their sickly sweet normal lives. The other way around, and this would lose impact. It's easy to overlook, during the course of a film, the contrasts involved on the characters' journey into darkness. Here, their normality is important, and brought home by the final sequences juxtapposed to the earlier violence.There are two scenes for which this film is well known: the fire-extinguisher murder mentioned previously, and a prolonged rape scene. Both are intensely uncomfortable viewing, but Noe's depiction of violence should be applauded. He paints a mercilessly accurate picture with an unflinching eye, challenging the audience to confront reality. Noe's work, here and in the equally good 'I Stand Alone', is the antidote to cinematic glamorisation of brutality.I read one critic who accused Noe of delivering the two major scenes too early in the film, leaving him nowhere to go at the climax. But I believe this is a misunderstanding. The violence doesn't exist for its own sake, as in Hollywood-style horror flicks. The action isn't bound to build to an ever more violent climax.There are many more features that make this an outstanding film, not least the great acting. But above all, I believe Noe should be feted for his courage and not attacked for showing the world as he sees it, bleak and fatalistic as it is.</fullReview>

On the other hand, I will have nightmares of the horror... The film shown in reverse order is in first instance annoying, because you don't know the characters. But with the horror scenes already in mind, you get to know the characters, which make the scenes in the beginning of the film even worse. That's the strength.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, when I first heard about this movie I was sure that I wouldn't go see it. I recently rent it on DVD and thought "what the hell, I'll see it". First of all, this movie is like Memento, it starts from the end and goes to the start to finish. Thank God I had watched Memento before this film, I was prepared for the whole end-to-start thing! The movie started with an old man and another one talking.. -Boring! And what the hell was wrong with the camera? Well, after that scene with the 2 men talking the movie started really good. The camera was running up and down and doing circles all the time and I felt dizzy at first. Later on I was really sick and ready to throw up!!! The revenge scene was excellent. The guy got what he deserved (Before you see the rape scene you may feel pity for him, that's what happened with me, but when the film ends you realize why his death was so brutal and why he deserved it) After the revenge scene we see what happened and drove those 2 men to do what they did. The rape scene was gross and obscene. If anyone actually LIKED the scene and found it cool, well, what can I say, he/she really needs a psychiatrist! :) The scene had nothing sexual or something to arouse someone. After the rape the girl gets beaten off really bad. After those 2 really shocking moments we see what happened and let those 2 events take place. Actually after those scenes the camera gets steady and the purpose of the remaining film is to calm you down... For me the film was magnificent, a true and shocking film.Time really destructs everything</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, shocking and badly understood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most provocative and original movies in 2002 (for me though). Not the best but definitely one to watch. Why? 1) It arouses lots of emotions 2) Good acting and directing 3) It shows the fragility of life, of the very very small difference between white and light on the one hand (referring to the final scene in the movie) and black and darkness on the other hand (referring to the first scenes and the nightlife). This juxtaposition of light and darkness epitomises in the final shot in which we see only a flashing strobo light. This light shows the fragility of life for me. Time can destroy some lives in less than a second. 4) It is about human nature indeed: the positive and the negative combined. It is about normal human beings getting lost in their pain and anger. Shown in a disturbed camera style like in the movie Sombre. 5) It also shows the delicate and subtle between love and hate as Marcus says and does almost the same things to his girl Alex as does the rapist. This is what is so striking in this movie. 5) The role of fate and (profetic) dreams.OK, the story is quite simple but the details and the effects of the storystelling are convincing for me. Indeed, I would rate it a 9/10.By the way, time destroys everything might refer to the second law of thermodynamics in physics :-) Entropy increases with time, this is certainly the case in this movie. </fullReview>

Let me point out that through it's portrayal of the graphic and disgusting nine minute rape scene and the stuff going on in the gay bar, this movie has learned me two things: One - never let your girlfriend walk home alone (never!)Two - I'm not going to a gay bar(never ever!)The movie is well made (you get used to the weird camera techniques after a while) and it presents a hellish nightmare that I have never ever experienced in any other film. The only thing I don't understand is why did the movie start at the end? I mean it's original (sort of) but it totally destroys the plot which would have been great if the story were told in a linear way.Verdict: High impact film that could have been much better if the plot was linear.

		<shortDescription>Shocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to think of it, but a movie that makes me think about it so long after seeing it, usually holds something special.This French movie, which was written, directed, edited and co-photographed by Gaspar Noe, obviously tries to be shocking, daring and provoking. Reports claim that in its screening, people walked out of the theatre in disgust or got physically ill.At the top stand 2 scenes that you're not going to forget easily (minor spoilers next): The first one, which involves a man getting beaten to death, is probably the most shocking, violent and disgusting scene I've seen (and believe me, I'm not getting shocked easily) and could easily be described as "snuff". The second scene, although not nearly as shocking as the first one, involves a painfully-long brutal rape.The style of the movie is mesmerizing: It's almost entirely built of extremely long (up to 14 minute) and continuous shots and the scenes are partially improvised. For instance, one scene begins in an elevator, continues in a subway station and then in the moving subway itself, while people are coming in and out. This style gives a great deal of realism to the film and also contributes to the shock effect described above.In addition to being long and continuous, the photography itself tries to be unique. In the first third of the movie the camera continuously moves, jiggles and flips up to the point that you might get a headache.(Minor spoilers next) The plot itself is told backwards. The movie starts at the end credits, which go backwards, and ends at the beginning (if you've seen "Memento (2000)" or "Following (1998)" by Christopher Nolan, you won't find this to be very original). The purpose of it is two-fold: To give suspense to the plot, and to serve the main theme of the movie: "Time destroys everything". You get the full impact of this pessimistic (and very simple) theme by the end of the movie, when you run the scenes in your head in chronological order.(Minor spoilers next) The movie starts as hell-on-earth, both in terms of plot and technically (photography, music, lighting) and it ends very delicately, in a beautifully long love scene (between Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci, a couple in real life) and an innocent, almost surreal, scene of children playing and an obvious reference to Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)", all to the sounds of Beethoven's 7th symphony.A Kubrick-Beethoven connection intuitively connects to "A Clockwork Orange (1971)", another movie that definitely had a great effect on the maker of this film, mainly in terms of ultra-violence in-your-face. I also felt an influence by Darrn Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream (2000)", a fantastic movie that itself was obviously influenced by Kubrick's "Clockwork Orange".Whether this movie is special or just non-original, pretentious and meant to be shocking, provoking and controversial - you'll have to see to judge by yourself. The pessimistic theme/moral of the movie, "Time destroys everything" (and future events are already set), although extremely simple in concept and plot, turns out to be quite horrifying by the end of this movie. Great directors learn, in time, that hardcore sex and violence are sometimes more effective if left for the viewer's imagination, out of the camera. This movie takes the "in-your-face" method and doesn't hide anything from the viewer.Hate it or like it, from a "technical" point of view, Gaspar Noe seems to be a promising movie-maker. I'm certain it won't be long before we'll see him follow Luc Besson, making films in Hollywood. It will be interesting.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it at San Sebastian film festival. The film is absolutely brilliant, a work of a genius. I confess I like the work of Gaspar Noe ever since his first short film "Carne". The story is told as in "Memento", that is, backwards, but it has nothing else to do with that one. The camera is just too perfect, the acting superb. The scenes are too long, and for the feeling it is intended to transmit, perfect! They just had to be that long. We see them (any of them) and think, ok, that's ok, I got it! I said ok. Now stop it! Stop!! I can't watch it anymore!!.. You get what I'm saying? It had to be like that to be effective. It sticks on us and just don't go.. We take the whole thing home, can't sleep thinking about it, get disturbed. It's perfect because when you want to talk about something (and if you don't really have anything to say why bother making a film?... unless you're making a Hollywood film.. ha) you must go deep.. The film has violence (really hard and cruel)... but it is not about violence; the film has a rape (extremely cruel and disturbing)... but it is not about a rape... Those were means of transmitting the feeling the film wanted to say: how time destroys everything. And it achieves in transmitting it! Absolutely no doubts about that!.. Now, we may not think times destroys everything, but we must admit that in certain moments in our lives, we all experience that agony and that pain, of having lost everything and how time raised everything good we had and left us with nothing.. Nothing is gratuitous in this film, it's a poem, a really sad, painful and desperate poem, about life (or part of it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made an impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented the film on video yesterday and watched it together with my wife. The film had an impact on us both, that's for sure. When i popped it in the vcr though I had to restrain myself from pressing the eject button. Not because of the movie itself but of the way it was filmed. Very annoying camerawork! As was the soundtrack in the beginning. Later during the movie it became clear to me what the director wanted to express with the camerawork and the soundtrack, but it took me effort not to take it out of the vcr the first 20 minutes. So for all of you who haven't seen it yet...hang in there! It's worth the ride. If you have a weak stomach or are shocked by extreme realistic violence, don't watch it! I had to tell myself it was only a movie during the violent scenes. That's something I don't do easily as I'm not easily shocked by violence or horror scenes. Which only goes to say that the director and actors delivered an excellent piece of work. One particular scene during the rape sequence made me ask myself: "What would you have done in a situation like that?" The people who have seen this film will know what I'm talking about. Like another viewer already said in his comments; this movie is filmed backwards, didn't take me long to find that out. My wife could not look at the revenge scene and turned away. When she saw the rape scene, which of course is the reason for the revenge scene, she could totally justify the violence in the revenge scene. I will not spoil too much for those who are yet to see this film, but no matter what your views on the acting, directorship or any other aspect of this film, one thing is for certain...You will not feel indifferent about this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brutal, true look at violence which exists everywhere....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard the reports that people walked out of the films screening in disgust and/or got physically ill, I knew I had to see it for myself. I finally viewed "Irréversible" and I am shocked. Shocked that people could possibly possess the vanity which allowed them to turn their faces from the truth of daily life. That although we read about violent acts or see bits and pieces on the evening news, rarely are we ever a first hand witnesses to an entire rape or a murder from start to finish. Gaspar Noe gives us a voyeuristic chance to see brutal acts of violence which are carried out everyday by experienced psychopaths, seasoned criminals, or ordinary people like you and I caught up in a passion or a place at the wrong time with the wrong people. It's all true, and it's all disturbing, and the film gives us a bird's eye view into the real world and all of its horrors. Man's inhumanity toward man is played out everyday, but Noe just gives us two instances in one night. The camera work made me nervous, I suppose a rightful feeling to have under the circumstances. I thought the actors presented their characters well, I always enjoy Monica Bellucci, not only for her beauty, but for her talent and honesty on the screen. I would recommend this film to those would have an open mind ( and a good stomach). Noe presents violent truths which we need to come to terms with as they are events which unfold everyday.</fullReview>

The film is not about a rape or about a revenge... It's about... time.. destructing everything. The rape and the violence are merely means to achieve the goal: to make us feel this... that time ruins everything. And the way it is done is simply perfect. Nicholas</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie you will not forget for a long time !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IRREVERSIBLE is something completely unexpected and surprising. The story could be resume in very few words: a woman is raped and wildly beaten. Her boyfriend and ex-boyfriend try to avenge her. Everything happens during very few hours. Directed by Gaspar Noe, whose previous works were about psychopaths, this movie, you can absolutely HATE it or LIKE it (I don't think anybody could love this) but you could not be indifferent. Noe tells the story backwards (like MEMENTO; but the effect is better used here) and with a distance similar to a documentary. The movie could be divided in 9 chapters plus an epilogue and a prologue; two of them the vengeance and rape chapters are so horrifying that most 50 % of the public left the theatre (women during the second but most men during the firstThere are several lectures from this movie. The main one seems to be that destiny is something we write ourselves, but I feel that consequences of fury and vengeance without thinking (and under influence) is also a main points. In these two aspects, the message is quite clear and effective. However, I feel an anti-gay subtext in the movie. All gay characters (the rapist is one of them) are depicted as disturbed people. Considering that BASIC INSTINCT made some gay organizations to complain, probably they will burn the theatre with this movie. Probably this was one of the reasons, critics condemned the film and it was not a commercial success in Cannes or even in France. It was really a pity because aside for a couple of things (the excess of camera movements in the gay club), the movie is visually stunning. The story is told with an economy of resources and situations rarely seen out of art house films.The acting range from an excellent Vincent Cassel as a bully but absolutely normal guy, a very good Dupontel as an intellectual and a good but not always convincing Monica Bellucci (I did not feel his fear and despair during the rape, but that could be also a director decision).See this movie, like it or not, is worth trying; but be brave, is not easy. There are lots of gay sex, frontal nudity (men mostly) and the violence (if only two scenes) makes STRAW DOGS looks like a Disney movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is full-on in every way imaginable. Without a doubt, this is first and foremost a work of art--not without its failings--that takes the viewer on a sensory journey most will not have thought possible in the medium of film.Irreversible is made up of only twelve scenes that play in reverse chronological order--beginning with an almost incomprehensible scene in an underground gay sex club where the boyfriend of a rape victim (and their mutual friend) seek revenge on the rapist. As the director Gaspar Noe admitted during the Q&amp;A after a screening I attended at London's NFT this evening (where Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel were also in attendance), the style of this opening sequence is such that he could've shown a kitten drinking from a bowl of milk and the viewer would've been equally disturbed.It is, perhaps, the most disorienting sequence I've ever seen in a film and I can only laugh at friends who said the shaky camera work in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives made them nauseous--most audiences will be very put off by this but it will be their loss.From there the film recounts the previous events of that night and backwards into the day--Noe stated that he made the film in reverse order because it's boring that the majority of films are edited in a linear fashion. He also implied that he felt employing a linear narrative with this subject matter would've been exploitative and overtly manipulative and he's certainly right about that. The first sequence is so harrowing that the viewer dreads the thought of the controversial rape scene. The first shot of Bellucci--bloodied on a stretcher--made my jaw drop to my chest. And still, more dread.Noe is to be admired for his unflinching depiction of rape--as he said, it was the major reason he wanted to make the film, so that people could see. It's clear from the first few minutes of Irreversible that he's not going to pull his punches so at least the viewers can prepare themselves somewhat. I've never had the guts to see Pasolini's Salo but I find it hard to imagine it being more difficult than this.And yet what amazes about Irreversible is Noe's ability to take this very personal narrative and expand it in very subtle ways to take in our larger, equally inhumane society. There are moments in this film, aside from the obvious, that will chill you to the bone. As the film says, "There are no good or bad deeds. There are just deeds," in effect acknowledging that our propensity for both good and evil is what makes us human.Though the rape scene has been written about the most, all of the scenes hold their surprises; my personal favourite was the one on the Metro where Bellucci holds forth on the nature of sex and gender. All of the players in Irreversible risk everything, all the time--in this scene, perhaps, Bellucci risks even more.Though Noe claims that it was not his intention to make a life-affirming film, it seems to be what he was aiming for with the mild contrivances of his conclusion. Given the blister of the opening sequence, it's somewhat unsatisfying that we don't see more of the two men in Alex's (Bellucci) life. I would say it was a minor quibble but it feels very much like a place this film needed to go.Cassel said that he had seen the film twice and that was enough for him, for at least the next ten years. Bellucci said, "This film...this film...it is about life--and ecstasy! I hope you enjoy it." I say it's a must see--at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>don't be afraid, this film speaks on understandment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the critics go poo-poo because it's not the typical "fight for love story", as "Casablanca" is. This love story speaks of how love is strong, how brutality and nonsense leads to more violence. It's so strong at the beginning, but the whole film is a reflection on how far normal people can go to fight for their beloved... It's astonishing when it shows somebody hit in the head to death with a fire extinguisher, but it's true too when it tells the strong personal links between the main characters. It's a true film, it's real life, it's aesthetics as a tool to suggest, it's just magic. Go to the theater open minded, let the film explain itself. Children must be protected from this film, just because they cannot understand it. This is not entertainment. This is the amusement of life, not recommended for those who haven't lived, for those who feel ok eating popcorn and watching the telly. Raw but true. Beautiful, strong. I'd say one of the best films ever. I just saw it in the Sitges film fest, I can't say anymore. i'm just offended how silly the critic has been. Let the film guide you, take your own conclusions, accept violence as a part of our lives and understand why.(peace, anyway. The violence I reject is the unjustified. If you are in the US you my understand what I'm speaking about. Let's invite him to some more pretzels... let's recognize violence as a rotten part of society through understanding)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most shocking film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS)Having heard all these rumors about the enormously explicit and graphic scenes of sex/violence, I decided to rush in theaters to view a film quite unique, that caused either extreme disgustion or intense enthusiasm. Well, the film did contain some scenes that were purely unbearable to watch-the insufferable rape scene, the murder of the pimp which was remarkably realistic, thus horrific and a few others. But I strongly disagree that life shouldn't be portrayed the way it is-unless, there is a reason for that, that is. Cinema should offer us images based upon life and realistic circumstances and this is a story that could happen-actually, it has probably happened. I am not always standing for artists who shock just to impress and generally provoke pointlessly-but Noe is not one of them. There is a story here, reversed of course, but a story that has things to say. Well, generally I don't count this as a masterpiece but it remains one high-quality movie and pretty inspired, too. I also have to note that perhaps one of the users that noted this may have all been a "dream-like" thing, was correct. We indeed get to see some final scenes with a Bellucci being pregnant, she seems to be already in the first months of her pregnancy when sitting in the grass in the wonderful final scene. But when Monica is raped, her slender body implies no trace of pregancy. Also, the fact that Bellucci in the final scenes occupies herself with the pregancy and the fact the film generally follows another path, makes us suspect that perhaps the nightmare within the red tunnell was indeed tunnell. Anyway, it was a sensational movie that will nonetheless remain forever in your mind-for good or ill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most haunting nightmare you will ever see on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going to this film, everybody seems anxious to warn you: there's a terrible rape-scene in it (that lasts nine minutes) and you get to see a persons face smashed to pieces. So, it's up to you if you want to waste your money on that. What a lot of people seem to forget is that Noé has chosen to tell a nightmare. And if you want to approach reality and make an audience feel the pain the main characters are going through, you can't leave out the nasty bits (at least if you want to be convincing). So forget about the hype and don't walk out until the end. Because Irreversible is a haunting story that leaves you shocked, but also challenges you to take a stand and have an own opinion. And yes, you will feel uncomfortable watching the explicit scenes. But then again: who said nightmares would be fun. 8/10</fullReview>

Edit it in short, edible sized clips and throw a song in there, don't make us squirm. It's only good ole, in every action movie from the eighties, exploitative rape. And what's with the camera? Does it symbolize time? SYMBOLISM SCHMIMBOLISM! Don't affect us emotionally!A masterpiece! 10/10OK seriously though, it's too bad about the controversysurrounding this film. I can understand a critic not liking it (it's a harrowing experience) but to just write it off as trash isunproffesional and wrong. See it for yourself if you want to journey into the depths of what man is capable of. And yes, the film is nihilistic, but since when has every friggin film had to have apositive message. Life does suck a lot of the time and no matter what we go through it just may amount to nothing in the end. For the world anyway. Noe impressed me when I saw I Stand Alone at the TIFF a few years ago and with this follow up he has shot up my list of directors to look out for. I look forward to seeing his next film. A true, innovative film-maker. And hats off to Lion's Gate for having the courage to pick up this film and release it NC-17 (R here in Canada anyway).

		<fullReview>I sat down to watch this movie, expecting it to be a thought-provoking and simultaneously shocking experience. Unfortunately it has only partially succeeded.There are two things that set this movie apart from a technical point of view. It features uninterrupted, long, uncut, shots and the sequence of shots is shown in reverse cronological order. However, the uncut shots results in perhaps a bit too much camera movement (which is supposed to portray the psychology of the characters, I imagine) - also, the uncut nature of the shots means that you have to watch prolonged sequence of either inane or disturbing action. As for the reverse chronological order... interesting, but it does not serve as a plot device. It is merely a gimmick. In Memento, a movie there was a purpose behind showing the shots in reverse.. here... it is pointless, as is much of the violence and wandering around..What this movie does succeed in, however, is to portray the psychological state of its characters, quite vividly. And in the end, this is what makes the movie shocking and not any graphic violence that is being displayed. (Although the violence itself is spicing things up quite a bit).All in all, a flawed movie, but one that succeeds brilliantly in bringing out the characters' feelings and causing a reaction to the audience, despite the inanity of the plot itself. Prepare to be horrified, amazed and feeling light-headed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the story is very simple and not so original: a man wants to take revenge on who raped his woman, but the movie is very interesting for several reasons. The first question could be: what is "Irréversible"? After my point of view the flow of time is something not reversible in this life; the elliptic way of telling the facts of the movie in a continuous flash back is something not new either. We have a perfect example of it in "Memento", but I was very fascinated by how everything had a previous cause in this story. I would say this is a Zen movie, everything is very simple, everything is very understandable and at the same time surprising. The technique of filmmaking is very peculiar: all the facts happen in less than one day time, the night has a prominent role, as it was the real protagonist of this story. At night everything is different and this is a different night. A hard night filmed on very sensitive emulsion without beautiful unrealistic lights. At the beginning also the camera moves in a very disturbing way, but there are very good reasons because this has been done. I admit the actors are also very good and well looking, but my opinion is that all the success of this movie has to be recognized at the great ability of the director G. Noé What it happens in this movie is very strong and violent, I saw a man leaving the room during the projection and a girl praying the boyfriend outside the cinema for not taking her to see such a film, everybody is advised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not a masterpiece, this movie comes close to being brilliant. The simplicity of the story makes it all the more difficult to bear, which might explain why so many people misunderstood its purpose.This movie isn't for everyone. It is troubling, disturbing and demands a lot of emotional commitment from its viewers. But "Irreversible" is not pure violence. True, it is violent both morally and physically but none of it is gratuitous or unmotivated.Anyone saying that "By the end of the movie, my eyes were aching, I could no longer bear to watch any more painful scenes" obviously hasn't watched it until the end and probably left after 30 minutes or so. The beauty of Irreversible resides in the equilibrium between violence and beauty. The fact that Belluci plays the victim isn't innocent. The impact wouldn't be the same with a less godly looking actress. But to understand the whole project you have to see it all. By the time the movie is over, the last half hour is what I remembered most. All the hope, the beautiful people in love, the nice home etc. Then the memory of what I had just seen an hour before started to come back.With a simple story, which could easily have been cliche and conventional, Noé manages to make a film as horrible and as beautiful as life itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irréversible is not an easy movie to recommend. Let's just say I do not regret seeing it. It's not much "fun", but it is remarkably filmed (the elegant opening credits alone are worth the trip) and the experience stays with you.You know how seeing a movie is a little bit like living it? So here the question is: do you want to experience ever so slightly what it's like for someone near and dear to you to be raped and nearly killed? The very question is near-obscene (why would anyone ever want to do that?) and yet I believe it is at the heart of the movie-going (and indeed, aesthetic) experience.Of course an accessory question is: do I trust this director enough to go through something like that under his guidance and is he truthful and competent enough? I would say yes. Gaspard Noé appears to be a serious, talented and sincere filmmaker, and Irréversible is a deep movie of great artistry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not about the rape of a girl, not really. It's about the violence in general and the absurdity and vulgarity of its logic. And it shows that it's just when you're shocked and can't realize what's happening around, that you succumb to the blind power of violence and revenge.Another point, which makes the movie particularly interesting. It's filmed backwards: from the final scene of revenge to the "happy-end". With the only difference that the beginning of the story, that is the end of the movie, doesn't look so happy in the light of what would happen afterwards, in the light of what you've just seen. And the real shock comes not from the scenes of violence, but from the fact of knowing what is going to happen. Maybe it's one of the most important messages of the movie: DON'T DARE TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN FUTURE, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOCKED!!!</fullReview>

They go to a gay club to find him but they kill the wrong man.Watching it as intended is almost a waste of time. The first half is so chaotic with extremely violent hand-held camera moves. It is almost incomprehensible. In the middle section, there is a long uncut rape scene. The last section clarifies the movie but it doesn't really have any drama. Even the reveal can't fully save this. It's an experiment that doesn't work. As for the main controversy, the rape scene is quite vicious. It's shock cinema but I don't dismiss the movie for that. My main problems are the reverse chronology and the chaotic camera moves at the beginning.</fullReview>

I have never seen a more faithful cinematic depiction of something in any other movie. The bad thing is that the movie is about rape. How really a rape looks and feels like. And it looks awful. It feels awful. After the credits you don't feel good. But you are glad you saw this. Many said that this movie promotes violence and abuse against women. They couldn't be further from the truth. If I was 99.99% certain that I would never do something like this to a woman, I am now 100% certain that I won't.It's a shame that this thing happens everyday, and in a way, I felt "lucky" I could take a peak at this everyday nightmare thanks to Noé's masterpiece.There's no other director that ever came close in doing something that feels so realistic to the viewer. There's no other movie that will make you feel worse than this one. There's no other movie that will be engraved in your mind like this one.Watch it, but you won't feel good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny how people who are so vocal about this film being homophobic don't give a squat if a film is anti-Christian, or anti anything else. Hypocrites!It's a movie.Plus, it's a FRENCH movie! Get over your own biases and metal issues and see it as what it is -- a film. It's not homophobic like like the Exorcist (or the Bad Lieutenant) is not anti catholic.And anyone who doesn't think these kind of places exist, is either naive or lying.Now, is it a good movie? Yes and no. It's an interesting and powerful story that has some of it's effect minimized by horrible camera work that is so shaky and upside down, it makes you want to throw up.This may have been the intention, but I wanted less of it.Still a really good flick that will leave you disturbed and it will linger in your memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interestingly sequenced but undisciplined, condescending and over-cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two opening scenes are tense and dramatic. The flaws in the story leading to these scenes erode the value of the movie.Acting is acting, and Cassel and Bellucci put a great deal of effort into their performances, but neither is believable due to how they are directed.Vincent Cassel--even seduced into a madness for revenge--is playing far too against type in the cab scene--even an emotionally throttled Marcus wouldn't irrationally assault an immigrant cab driver and steal the cab. This scene isn't Cassel's fault, it's Noe's: Cassel exudes confidence and control, not mania. The preceding confrontational scenes suit Cassel fine. But this one breaks the spell.Casting Bellucci as Alex is a critical mistake. Bellucci, at the time of casting, was internationally recognized as a beautiful actress and model. She is capable, intelligent, and in control of her desirability. As Alex, she's not believable in the linchpin for the story--the rape. Even though she is shown from the back of her head when the audience first sees her pre-assault, she is not sufficiently anonymous to not be an attractive, self-aware woman: in Paris, in the 21st century, it's unlikely that such a woman would not have either pepper spray to fight off Tenia or a phone to call the police when she witnesses him beat (what the audience assumes to be) a whore. Perhaps using amateurs may have made the film more engaging.Those reservations aside, the rape/beating scene is highly flawed. The rape is eroticized into a dominant male/submissive female relationship, as Alex does not fight the rape under threat of violence and makes only empty screams that do not epitomize the violence of the act. Had she been beaten first, this would be more logical, and, ironically, less disturbing, as a physically injured person is far less able to fight back. The order as given will The rape scene is also eroticized by its suggestiveness--Alex is never shown even partially naked, and Bellucci--not Alex--moves a scarf deliberately early in the scene to obscure her breasts. This is obviously a function of the actor and not the character, and, while it spares Bellucci, it damages the violence of the scene by failing to show a devastating portrait of sexual violation.The characterization of the rapist is troubling because of what it declaims about perceptions of beauty and wealth. While raping Alex, the insecure and stupid Tapeworm repeatedly makes reference to her beauty and wealth as his reasons for raping her--or else why would he risk imprisonment for assaulting someone in a public place? It is narcissistic to argue that even monstrous people would be unable to prevent themselves from trying to destroy and violate a woman because of lust for beauty and envy for wealth.This marginalizes rape victims who don't resemble cover models and who aren't wealthy. It also effectually argues that men who admire beautiful women or respect their status are unconsciously drawn to rape them.In the end, by sensationalizing and glamorizing rape and violence, Irreversible is exploiting problems rather than addressing them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not easy to watch, but a good reflection on violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is a very confronting raw and violent French movie that tells the story, in reverse order, of a serious of violent events related to the rape of a woman when going back home from a party, and what his boyfriend and best friend do afterwards.Telling the story backwards makes the story not only more interesting and mentally engaging, but also the best way to explore the themes presented in the same. The viewer feels immediately repulsed by the behavior and actions of the two characters, firstly because we don't know anything about those people and they look mad, and secondly because their actions are repulsive. However, when the viewer sees the horrific and violent 9-minute rape scene, and compares it to those initial actions (which are at the end of the story), the viewer feels that the level of violence and brutality is similar, even though the events related to the initial scenes could be morally justified. The question posed is, does a moral back-up justifies any violence? The answer is no. And the reverse order of the scenes just makes that clearer to the viewer, who rejects that violence immediately, from an emotional point of view, from his/her guts, judging the acts for what they are, not for what motivated them. Violence is always repulsive no matter the reasons (or lack of them) behind.At another level, the movie is an exploration of Sexuality - Sex as mean of human communication and love, versus love as a mean of hatred and subjugation. Sex as pleasure versus sex as damage. The intimate scenes of Alex and Marcus are all sensuality, playfulness, joy and love. The conversations about sex between Alex, Marcus and Pierre explore the matter of pleasure and human connection, of what makes humans click in sex. The rape scene is an antithesis to all of that.Did the rape scene need to be so long and so brutal? Despite how hard was watching it, I think the answer is yes. Because many people out there consider rape a second-rate crime and somewhat blames the victim or excuses the perpetrator. There are judges around the world saying that the victim somewhat provoked the rapist with her sexy clothing or just for being sexy. There are brutal men raping women for more than 9 minutes. Because the effects of rape are very damaging, emotionally and mentally, not only physically. Because the porn and erotic industry somewhat glamorizes women being raped. Rape is always a brutal act, even if the rapist does not beat you, but there are rapists doing nasty things to women, degrading women in any possible way. If you think about it, the rape scene, despite how hard it is, is nothing compared to what happens every minute in any of our cities - every day.The messages embedded in the story are important and offer a glimpse of what is living a normal life full of hopes and joy, to found it completely ruined by violence in a matter of hours . It also shows how normal people can be as violent as violent people are in certain circumstances, and how violence is never justified. Most importantly, the movie reminds the viewer that there is nothing to forget or forgive about rape.The atmosphere of the movie is excellent, as well as the hues and music. The use of strobist images is sickening, but it helps to unsettle the viewer since the beginning. However, there wasn't any need to use so many strobist images and for so long as, by doing so, the movie becomes a little bit hallucinogen and the viewer loses focus; to be honest, I would used strobist images quite differently and with a different timing.I found Monica Belluci great as Alex both in the sweet and playful scenes, and it the harsh ones; she demonstrates here that she's not just a pretty face. Jo Prestia is superb as the disturbing disgusting rapist Le Tenia. Vincent Cassel is just OK as Alex's boyfriend Marcus, while Albert Dupontel is good as Alex's best friend Pierre.Among the downs of the movie, beyond the overuse of strobist effects, I'd mention the opening scene, which is irrelevant and doesn't add anything to the story. Moreover, the title of the gay pub is gross and also the depiction of gays as depraved perverted human beings. I mean, there are heterosexuals who would have similar sort of pubs. Certainly, there are gays who are like that and go to places like that, but there are too many stereotypes about them in the movie, especially because the story of the movie has nothing to do with gays. All the gay thing was really unnecessary as does not add anything to the story and is very negative.This is not an easy film to watch, and it really gets you upset. In that regard, it achieves what aimed, as it makes you think and react to violence through violence... if you can stand the whole ordeal and reach the last minutes of the movie when a relaxing bright day was full of promises.</fullReview>

Irreversible is no exception and I don't understand why he always feels the need to show the most shocking disgusting scenes. It would be a lot more watchable if he left the horrible stuff to the imagination because when you show a film where a man gets his head crushed with a fire extinguisher it is only going to be remembered for that and all people are going to say is how disgusting it is. I have never met a person who liked or enjoyed this film. One thing is certain I will never watch this film again and would never recommend anyone watch it!

Um, nope. 30 minutes worth of plot is stretched over a painstaking 100, one particularly uncalled for sex scene, and nothing clever happens in the storyline. The "spinning camera" and the "backwards-to-forwards" gimmick just isn't cool enough to save the film. I'm not sure why a lot of folks rate this movie so high. Perhaps it's something to do with aesthetics or shock value? Hard to say. The acting is good and some of the leads are attractive. If you're just into evil cinema then you might have a good time with it. Prepare for a ton of scenes that just drag on and on...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes I think we've all seen enough. I know there are these things in world, e.g, babies gang-raped in the Congo, "etc", but I don't think I want to see them graphically portrayed anymore. I'd heard about this movie and resisted watching it--now I know I was right to avoid it. In the asset and liability balance, I believe the liabilities far outweigh what is positive that we can take away from this movie. I'm tired of having my brain visually assaulted--I just read the paper for the information now. The ideas of violence, revenge and the tenuousness of our happy lives that are developed during the movie could easily have been developed minus the 8 minute long rape scene. The writer/director knew that all that would talked about in the press was this scene and whether or not it has a place in cinema. EIGHT MINUTES! Really, how is this justified? Shouldn't this movie be called "Anatomy of a Rape"? I've read one review of this movie that said this movie is not pornography, true, more specifically it approaches a snuff film or a documentary. Not impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as awful as I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the reviews on this film, and so I was apprehensive about watching it, but I am a fan of Cassel and Bellucci so I decided to just buy the DVD. I was prepared for the shocking scenes, maybe too prepared. The gay club scenes were a little too vivid for my taste, and I probably experienced the reaction that was expected by the director. Maybe because I am a Sci Fi fanatic, and I tolerate pretty graphic horror films, I was not horrified by the fire extinguisher scene ? actually, it was nothing special, it obviously had some great digital work to appear to have such exact violence, but I was not horrified ? and certainly not the worst I've ever seen. Now, the rape scene was a bit annoying. The director I assume, had the character (Bellucci) just lay there, crawling or trying to recover, but in the same spot on the cement floor after being raped, all the while, the man is sprawled next to her recuperating from all the energy spent raping her for some 9 minutes, casually glancing over at her while he pulls himself together. I thought that was ridiculous. I was literally screaming at the TV for her to get up and run! So, I was very disappointed in the direction of the scene, and it was absolutely too long ? an obvious attempt to generate great emotion, shock, pain for the victim, disgust for the rapist, and any other emotion you could think of. The best part of the movie was the end, where you saw the affection between Cassel and Bellucci and that was too short. I should have rented the DVD, I was hoping for a bit more of a story line.</fullReview>

Now give me a good reason why he shouldn't. We never question art that is just made to be beautiful. So why should we question art that is made to be thought-provoking? A lot is already said about 'Irreversible' so I especially wanted to mention the soundtrack of the film, composed by Daft Punk mastermind Thomas Bangalter. This soundtrack still makes a huge impact on me, every time I play it; the dark monotony of the electro songs, highly original mixed with classical pieces (Beethoven) and French chansons (Etienne Daho).Serious, moody and broody!

		<shortDescription>Evokes a reaction. That should be enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, you decided to watch this movie. Unless you accidentally stumbled on it (and shame on you for not doing your homework) you know that it contains some brutal scenes, notably the rape scene and the extinguisher scene. I truly wish I had seen it without knowing what was coming, because it's hard to be objective when you're prepared for the worst.Let's start with the controversial stuff. The rape scene was awful to watch. So was the murder. But I was prepared, so it wasn't as bad. I was more disturbed by the (Pan's Labyrinth spoiler coming) crushing of the skull in Pan's Labyrinth with a bottle - mostly because I went into that movie with the idea it was going to be a lighter fantasy. I had not done my homework, but I often do that so I won't be prepared. So I will genuinely react.My point is, you won't hear about this movie without the controversy, so can you really objectively separate the controversy from the movie? I don't think you can.I think that it was easier to watch this movie when I knew what was in it before I watched it and therefore could watch the movie as a whole without focusing on the controversy. As a result, it's a movie that evokes a reaction. Whether it's disgust or loss, that's the whole point. Make your audience react. So in that, it succeeds.The theme is strong - there are things you do in life you wish you could take back, irreversible things. Once done, they can't be undone. Killing a man is one of them. In the end, Pierre loses his morality and can never get it back. That's the point the two men at the beginning are trying to make. The tragedy is that Pierre is trying to stop Marcus from doing what he ends up doing. Those who condemn this movie for making them react in a negative way need to ask themselves why they decided to watch this in the first place. Except for a small percentage of people who accidentally rented or watched it, you knew what you were getting into. You watched it to see if it was as bad as they say. To say it's bad after that is like drinking milk that has lumps in it just to see if it's really spoiled, being upset when you taste sour milk, and then telling your friends how awful the "milk incident" was.As for the style of the movie, I didn't need the low-frequency nausea-producing sound nor the hand-held camera style to get the feeling of sickness. It's a bit of sledgehammer symbolism that isn't needed (hence 8 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I have to say is difficult to classify as a great film or as a horrible film. It surely can not be classified as run of the mill or middle ground at all. Its hard to find words to classify it because while it evokes an emotional response for sure, you feel guilty for having viewed it. Its borderline snuff porn with A+ actors and Director. I like films that elicit some sort of emotional response. Irreversible definitely did that. One of the most disturbing things about the movie besides the obvious 2 most violent scenes in it was the actual wet sound effect of each time The Tapeworm penetrated Alex. To top it off when he roles off of her, the actor actually had an erection. People talk about this being an unflinching look at reality, that may be true. I ask who's reality is it? It seems to me Irreversible used the backwards story telling to give two different morals to the story. Watching it from end to beginning gives us the impression that this movie is about revenge and consequences for bad actions. However, it the scenes were played in reverse and it went from beginning to end you would see that there is an underlying implication of misogyny beneath the obvious view of a misogynist act of violence.Played backwards it can be seen that the director and writer may harbor some misogynistic views of females as inferior objects for men to manipulate as they desire. That the rape scene seemed to me to be a punishment of independent female sexuality rather then showing the rapist as a despicable person. If the film were in typical chronological order we would see that "The Tapeworm" never has any sort of consequence for his crime against Alex and that the only people who suffered were people around the situation, besides Alex.What really sealed the deal for my opinion was when I re-watched it recently and was able to put everything in order for myself. The end shows 2 men talking about their lives. One man says he went to jail for having sex with his daughter. The second man says to him, "There are no crimes just actions." Now if that's not an indicator of someone who does not view rape and child molestation as criminal then I don't know what else would be.Irreversible has to be studied for sure. So this is why I can't bring myself to say its an excellent film. I will say that all matters of opinion and situations should have the chance to be explored on film. I like an emotional challenge and I was surely given that here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing much to this film. Towards the ending scene where the couple were cuddling in bed I came to feel that the display of human flesh and private parts in this film had gone on the excessive side of things (not that they were not aesthetically appealing or attractive, but you know......). Looks more like a mild porno film to me, with conspicuous efforts to flash out human genitals (Think we saw those of about 10 people throughout the 1.5 hour?). Telling the story in a complacent effort of a reversed chronology does not help at all. Instead, this has led to one very major anti-climax in movie history and as the story unfolded itself to tell what happened before and before, I got more and more bored and less and less eager to know, thanks to the prior confession of it all right in the beginning and the middle of the movie that has sucked up pretty much all the mystery and hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only seen this film once, when it premiered many years ago. However, I have not forgotten a single frame. Irréversible is the ultimate act of cinematic masochism. Gaspar Noé acting as both provocateur, and calculating sadist. Running the sequence of events backwards is far from novelty, as the first half of the film is uncompromisingly brutal, and the latter half melancholic.The camera-work is tailored to induce seasickness, on a cinema screen it can give you a migraine. The one scene in which the camera is static will make you wish that it wasn't. A incredibly brutal, prolonged rape. The graphic way both the rape, and the misguided revenge, are shown is immeasurably painful to witness. The undulating noise on the soundtrack and constant motion of the camera simply will not let you become comfortable, or ponder. Once the fate of the protagonists is sealed, we are introduced to them as characters, and discover all which is lost.The overall theme of wretched destruction will stay with you. A simple misunderstanding can lead to an irreversible turn of events. What's done can not be undone. What is seen can not be unseen. Once seen, never forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched this film several years ago, I have found that I still feel queasy at the thought of it. The sound track and spinning still cause nausea and still haunt me.I don't think I will ever get over this film.Yes, as others have commented, the violence is extreme and very hard to watch, but that's the point of the film. Bad things happen.The violence has been amped to show the contrast of human behaviour. What could be more different than getting your face staved in with a fire extinguisher, than sitting in the park reading a book!? This film provoked the intended reactions from me. I was completely disorientated; confused and very sick at the start and by the end I was in tears. I felt real pain for the characters loss.The other films that people have mentioned, like Momento, are not in the same league as this. This film, although shown in reverse order, is not the usual Hollywood pap, that sugar coats everything. It wants to shock you, it wants to disturb you, it wants to distort your perceptions and emotionally scar you.It's not a film to watch alone, purely because you will need to hold someone and talk about it with the lights on for a very long time afterwards, probably while rocking back and forth.Would I recommend this film to anyone? Probably not. Mainly because of the "2girls, 1cup" stigma (how did you know about this sick depravity, and why are you showing me this?) However it is a brilliant film that will change your perceptions of horror as entertainment forever.If there are films that are "worse" than this, I never want to see them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING!! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!! When I first put this movie in, I watched for about 5 minutes and nearly turned it off. It starts off confusing, wildly hard to understand, and the camera work looks like someone was tap-dancing while filming. Believe me, it takes more than a few minutes to figure out whats going ON in this film. Trying to keep up with the action on-screen, and reading the subtitles was giving me a headache. But, it GRABS you in a death grip and doesn't let go. As cliché'd as that sounds, trust me, you WANT to finish this film!!! I consider myself an AVID, die-hard horror movie fan, and I THOUGHT that's what I was getting into. Oh, my my noooo. Horror would have been easier to swallow. This film plays scenes in REVERSE, hence the confusion. The brilliant camera work, choppy and erratic, is done for a reason here. The director GRABS you like a rag doll, and forces you on this insane carnival ride of a flick. The first scene alone had me asking my best friend, "did that just happen? was that REAL?? that HAD to be real! THAT WAS SO NIGHTMARISHLY REAL!!!" There is STILL a little wicked devil in the back of my sick mind that says the guy killed with the fire extinguisher WAS REAL. Alas, he was NOT real. I think. Anyway, after your mind and stomach calm some from THAT fiasco, you're sent spiraling into the life of Marcus and his friend. Know now, that you WILL be confused. You'll get lost. STAY WITH IT. It stabs you repeatedly with very real, very fast-paced action from there, then dumps you unceremoniously into Marcus' love life. Finally, a break it seems, things are a bit calmer... You can relax a bit. Even smile at the interaction of these two lovebirds. Right?? OMG noooooooo, because the END scene in this, which I'm NOT going to ruin for you, is the MOST brutal, realistic, horrific, MIND SHATTERING scene I have ever seen on film. And believe me, I'm hard to SHOCK. I'm the type who saw "I Spit on Your Grave" and kinda made FUN of it, even though its a cult classic. I was SO disturbed after this movie that I FORCED my best friend to stay with me. Not out of FEAR, but simply out of sheer shock. You'll talk about this for months. Horror movie? Yes. But NOT the Jason/Michael Myers type. THIS movie will horrify you for a very long time. Give it a chance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SOME SPOILERSToday there is a "movement" of filmmakers with incredible skills on filming and editing, but with nothing to say. Perhaps Gaspar Noé is one of those filmmakers. His ability to visually tells a story is clear ? but would be better if he was less pretentious and more conscious of his limitations. His claim that "we are savages, more than civilized beings" sounds like the statement of a naive and angry teenager, what he probably is in his essence (and perhaps he doesn't know that). In "Irreversible", he shows us the fate of three people that, in a tragic night, "looses everything". The woman, Alex, is raped in a subterranean passage ? and her boyfriend and a couple's close friend hunt down the rapist and find themselves in trouble with all freaks available in Paris, reunited in a hellish gay night club on the city. The story is told backwards, because, you see, this is an art movie ? at least is what they say. Is this film disturbing and incredibly well made? Oh, yeah ? it is. Is the rape scene so disgusting and hard to see that you'll be sick in it's first five minutes (it plays during 10 minutes)? For sure. In resume, is this film worth seeing? Absolutely ? from a technical point of view. But there is no sociological or humanistic message in this well-disguised horror movie, that is even ironic on it's irresponsible approach of sensitive themes. It's a myth that all men have a secret pleasure watching rape scenes ? only the crazy ones have it. But I would watch it with no complains if I could learn anything really valid about human condition, or discover why this kind of thing happens. Or even if the film could help me to deal with this terrible situation, if a person that I love would hurt as Alex was in the movie. I didn't learn nothing. I just watched a woman suffering ? and sometimes I had the impression that the movie was mocking her and the whole situation. For example: the name of the rapist is "La Tenia" (english translation: "the worm") and he conveniently rapes Alex from behind, doing comments about her tight "ring" (her anus), or how anal sex is "goooood" and so on. Later, when Alex' boyfriend finds the rapist, we see "the worm" in a nightclub called "The Rectum" (did you notice the subtle irony?). It looks more a film about Noe's fixation on anus than a movie about rape, and more important: about the consequences of rape. Noe concludes his "important" film with a message: "Time Destroys Everything" ? in the sense that the rape and the events of that night destroyed the happiness of Alex and the happiness of her friends, completely. You see, there's no hope ? there's no tomorrow. Noe tells us that there's no point on falling in love, have children, make a family and dreams about better days,because your girlfriend can be raped, beaten and humiliated for a jerk, and no one can survive that. Is that, really? I never had a chance to check it out. You see, after torture me with the rape scene and make me watch a graphic murder occurred in the "Rectum", Noe just gave up the story ? he doesn't have anything more to say. Did Alex survive to the attack? We'll never know. Did the child that she was carrying died, as a consequence of the rape? Who cares? After all, the "point" was the rape, the murder, the blood, the head in peaces... In real life women are raped and mistreated since the beginning of time ? and a lot of them survived, had their children and were able to find happiness again, in spite of the trauma and the horrific memories. But Gaspar Noé doesn't know that. He only wants to express his pessimistic (and simple minded) point of view of life ? that's is much more complex than this well-made (and pointless) exploitation art movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too real for me. I didn't care for it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a fateful night when a man an his friend seek revenge on the man who rapes his lover. The friend turns out to be a former lover of the woman who still has feelings for her. The events unfold in a less than 24 hour period from afternoon to evening and the scenes are played in reverse order (night to previous afternoon). The Idea to play the scenes this way has potential cinematically and artistically. But after seeing the subject matter and the graphic realism in which it is portrayed, I don't see this film as artistic or cinematic. But I'm not supposed to take pleasure from watching violence and rape and I feel I shouldn't be watching this, but it's like when you come across the scene of eg. a fire or a car crash, something drives your curiosity and you cannot help but look. Maybe the film works on this level. But I can question why the actors do what the script asks of them so realistically and why would they do such a film in the first place. The almost never ending rape scene is a perfect example of this. Why does an actress allow people put her in this situation for the sake of a paycheck? There are roles out there that offer different and more acceptable challenges. Something I noticed about the man while catching his breath between raping and beating her into a coma made this scene all too real to me. The love scene earlier in the day(or later in the film, if you like) failed to make up for this. The subject matter is supposed to provoke the reaction that it does. I'm not supposed to accept or be entertained by violence or sexual violence. So maybe the film works by the fact that I don't like it, if you know what I mean. So does this make it a good film? For some, I can understand why it does make it a good film. But the fact that I'm still questioning why the film was made in the first place and why a censor would pass it uncut makes it a bad film for me. That's why I'm giving it low marks, but I do understand why some give it high marks. If you're easily offended by the subject matter, avoid. If you can cope with a film that makes for difficult viewing and want to know if this film will provoke a reaction (and it almost certainly will), then this might be for you. I only got it out on DVD because I'm a fan of Monica Bellucci, not one hundred per cent sure then what it would be about. After seeing it, I won't be watching it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw the film last night and couldn't get it out of my mind. Actually, I think I will remember every scene for some time to come. Yes, the two scenes of violence are absolutely shocking, as well as the first 20 minutes or so of the film being very hard to watch due to the camera work. It wasn't until the film ended that I really saw how powerful these images and techniques were in telling this story. I know many members here have commented that the film was homophobic or misogynistic, but I have to disagree. It's really a strong statement against violence and on how events move forward in time to create situations in which the horrible parts of human nature are called out. Don't see this one if you are not strong of stomach. Do see it if you want to witness some highly unusual film and sound techniques and can relate to the director's use of extreme imagery to make a lasting message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much does a movie depend on *how* it's told?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoa, and I thought a creative story was essential in a good movie. Gaspar Noé arrives and proves me wrong, by building this heck of a movie around a simple story we've all heard many times before, in one way or another, but not in the way Irréversible tells us. The most important aspect of the movie is that the camera work that's like the point-of-view of a dizzy insect and the reversed storytelling are not there just to turn a movie into "arthouse" with simple gimmicks.Noé puts the movie in a completely inside-out perspective, which is really what makes this movie stand out so much. It's not all about the murder scene or the rape scene: they definitely strike the viewer with full force, but are they REALLY all this movie has to offer? In my humble opinion, judging this movie by how graphic its two highly uncomfortable scenes are doesn't make sense. There's so much more behind it. Of course, there might be nothing, as some reviewers have implied by calling the movie "pointless". But just the fact that it has polarised opinions so heavily already shows that, maybe, just maybe, there *is* a point after all, and whatever it is, the movie hit the nail on the head.Technically, the movie is also impressive. With basically no cuts at all (as far as the human eye can see), the movie sucks you into its own world. But the point isn't "realism", as you can see how the low-frequency noise was used to manipulate its viewers. The movie proudly proclaims how its there to turn you into its toy, so whether you shut off the movie in disgust or let yourself go depends on you, and no one else. But if you do let go, you ought to give Noé kudos for achieving such a direct, brutal effect by not "assembling" the movie out of little pieces, but putting the whole thing right there, before your eyes, so that if you reach out your hand, you might even touch it.I'm highly impressed by the movie, so go ahead: call me an elitist, or a futile snob. Praise the movie, bash the movie, any day I'd rather hear you talk than read the opinions of those who quote the magnificent "philosophy" of John Kramer, from the Saw series, that "those who don't appreciate life don't deserve life". I tell you, no matter what your opinion is, Irréversible could be a powerful tool in smacking some sense into people like that. It's a necessary movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has some very effective scenes and masterful cinematography. The graphic violence is purposeful, stylistic, and utterly realistic. Other reviewers tend to focus on the films strengths (or they hate it for its violence). What I find to be just as interesting is the film's structure. Like Memento, it is filmed backwards. The climax (and the most powerful scene) is at the beginning. Towards the end of the film, new things are revealed, but the dialog seems to be mediocre, and the film seems to drag. It is obvious why Memento was filmed in reverse chronological order, but the structure in this film seems to weaken the film. The structure is interesting because it is rare, but it is also seemingly arbitrary. The reverse order seems like it is for its own sake, rather than for the sake of the story. Also, the previous comparison to "I Spit on Your Grave" is misguided. That film really is exploitative trash. This film is art--but has structural weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awesome movie that hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some time now, I tend to think of violent - or ultra-violent - movies as modern fairy-tales. Most of all fairy-tales are ultra-violent stories: A stepmother who wants to eat heart and liver of her gorgeous stepdaughter because she goes green with ivy due to her beauty. Another stepmother who tells her daughters to cut toes or heel in order to get the foot into a much too small shoe (this mother loses both eyes to a pair of picking doves). Shock and goriness of these horrible deeds build the anchor for the moral of the story. Stuck in Remembrance. A Jolt. I think Irreversible is somehow such a fairy-tale, a very hidden one because of the films time structure (backwards, like others before me said already). It can be seen as a fairy-tale about flush, inebriation, intoxication. And also about illusion becoming delusion. The dizzy, swimming, spinning camera appears all the time, when someone's stuck into one of these states. These were my thoughts some time after the movie (I watched it yesterday). Funny thing is, I own the film's soundtrack for about two years now and I like it a lot. Having been given (with this movie) the pictures "belonging" to the sound, i couldn't get rid of the pictures... And suddenly it occurred to me, hey, so, why then - when all delusional scenes have a spinning camera - is this rape scene so steadily filmed? Because it's the scene to set the ball rolling? Because it's no illusion? On no side? Let's see... He seems to be a regular rapist. He is in deed intoxicated and he is definitely not a womanizer (he's gay). But lady-killer is definitely a proper word for him. And she? Princess Bellucci (Alex) in this unbelievable dress? Alex has an illusion. But not at the time of the rape. Watchers are voyeurs. But Noe gives full blast, all the pain, the vilification, being degraded to an object dominated by a very brutal and evil subject, the sickness, it seems to be never-ending... I think it's a brilliant movie, although I know i will probably never watch it again. As a movie. As I love the soundtrack, I will otherwise see it again and again and again. Reminds me a bit of Romper Stomper, where powerless people try to get a grip on their lives. Get some power. Same thing here. Irreversible is full of people flushing through live one way or another. And want to get grip on it. It's a wicked film, maybe. But an awesome work of art which arouses uncountable questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is truly an unfortunate thing that our society is so blatantly ignorant to true cinematic visionaries like Gasper Noe. Americans are notorious for being devoid of depth in their films and it resonates with the commercialized likes of spielberg, lucas, and many others. They feel dependent upon the idea that it's okay to be pushed emotionally through a film, please insert tears here or laughter here. Even filmmakers climbing over each other in prestigious film schools need to "lay in a theme" or figure out their character's chakra color...With that in mind, Irreversible takes on a whole new meaning. This film is about beauty in life and the irreversible force of time that will ultimately devour us all. I am saddened by those that simply didn't understand the nature of this film. Their ignorance and uneducated minds will consume them over time as they continue plunking down their dollars and pounds for $%^* films like "Crash" and "Munich". I applaud Gasper for his unrelentless pursuit of showing the darkest parts of existence and life at its most brutal force. The space between Monica and real life husband Vincent is a truly beautiful moment in cinema. The overall architecture of this piece is a masterwork and no one will ever be able to replicate it. I have never been a part of a film where people were horrified beyond belief and clapping enthusiastically at the end of this film. The epileptic seizure inducing final frame was a nice touch as we all staggered from the movie-house with a nauseas feeling and our popcorn crawling up the backs of our throats. I rate this film a ten for its poignant message. Carpe diem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An undiluted look at humans out for revenge. An unsparing look into what atrocities humans are capable of. An unflinching sick and perverse insight into the horrors of rape, assault, murder and love as we follow three people on a downward spiral, that is twisting and writhing in all directions... Alex (Monica Belucci) is sadistically raped on the way home from a party. Marcus (Vincent Cassel) her boyfriend tormented by this horrid event has sworn to find the one responsible. Pierre (Albert Dupontel) is the witness watching over his uncontrollable friend as he walks a path of destruction to the perpetrator... With Gaspar Noe directing with eye-aching camera twists, vibrant colours and shocking imagery this film tells it's story in unhinged ways. Proceeding backwards like 'Memento' but not in the same clear cut manner. With parts seeming to be in places where you didn't think they should be, this film makes you seriously consider what processes were undertaken to make it, as it moves in an unpredictable way, towards it's end/or is it the beginning? It is unlike anything you will ever see, and it is certainly not for those with weak dispositions. It surely is a masterful film for those strong enough to see it. But beware its intrigue, beware its anguish, beware its lure for it is certain that you will think about it. And once you've thought about it, it cannot be unthought, it will stay with you in mind, possibly haunting you on some lonely occasions, as the title suggests it is a film of events and effects that are truly - IRREVERSIBLE...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time cannot be reversed, time cannot be changed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Time destroys everything." This is the second line spoken in the film Irreversible, and it sets the theme, and the tone, for this disturbing, harrowing journey into the dark reaches of humanity.Irreversible begins with twisting camera work reminiscent of a roller-coaster ride from hell. The vomit-inducing cinematography matches well with the mind-set of the main character Marcus, who is obsessed with finding the man who brutally raped his girlfriend. Since the film is told in a backwards chronological order, we are thrown into the climax of the film, which includes the ferocious murder of a man with a fire extinguisher; however, the man who is killed is not the one who raped Marcus's girlfriend, Alex.This begins the next theme of the film: revenge is not the best course of action. From the scene where Marcus searches vehemently in the gay club, the Rectum, the story is then whisked back in time to an earlier scene. Here the protagonist, and his friend Pierre, ask around for the location of the club, where the rapist, called Le Tenia, is bound to be.During each consecutive scene, the spinning camera slows down, as to reflect the falling action. Eventually when the pivotal rape scene occurs, the camera no longer moves, but is stationary for most of the ten-minute long scene. The scene, which is notorious and infamous now, is disturbing and one of the most gut-wrenching scenes I've witnessed; yet, I was not injected with nightmares, but that is because I've become so desensitized to violence (quite sad right?). If you are sensitive to violence, however, then be extremely cautious when viewing Irreversible.After, or before, the rape scene the story almost completely halts and show us the lives of Marcus, Alex, and Pierre before tragedy decided to inflict itself upon their lives. The movie does suffer some because of this as the scenes can become tedious at times, especially one of the last scenes where Alex and Marcus lie in bed for an extended period of time. Much of the film's dialogue was ad-libbed, which shows as the scenes meander, along with the camera, which provides long takes in the scenes. I can say I am a fan of long shots, yet because of these shots the movie can not be edited, for each scene must be shot in one take to keep with the precedent previous scenes have set.If you are still wondering whether or not you should subject yourself to this agonizing visual experience, I suggest you do. The film will be imprinted into your cerebrum for a long time to come, and will actually make you think. As watching the film, I wondered whether the story was being told in reverse as a gimmick, or whether there was a deeper meaning to it all. Was time actually reversing, amending what had happened and returning the lives to the broken souls of the film? If this is the case, then the title itself presents another sense of irony, one that springs from the audiences desire that all of this could be changed, and everything could be returned back to normal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutality personified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is simply put a revenge tale, after the brutal rape of his girlfriend Alex{Monica Bellucci), Marcus(Vincent Cassel) sets out to find the culprit and deal out his own dose of vengeance. The structure of the film is that it is told in reverse, so we begin the tale, in a Gay Club, the appropriately named "Rectum" where Marcus and his friend Pierre are seeking out a man named Le Tenia who they believe is the Rapist, the film then flashes back in apportioned time frames which takes us through the brutal rape of Alex and beyond to the beginning of the tale. Well?This is indeed a film full of brutality that is told in a very unusual way, added to that the Director, Gaspar Noe inflicts on us,dizzying dancing camera-work and droning noise for the first 20 minutes or so of the film when we are in the Rectum gay club where pretty disgusting things go on ,so if you are in any way Homphobic the camera-work is probably a blessing in disguise as it somewhat hides some disturbing scenes of erect penises, fisting, buggery etc?..,but the camera-work along with the droning noise was meant to make the viewer feel nauseous, and in that respect it succeeds?.The revenge scene here is very brutal as Marcus and Pierre kill their prey with a fire extinguisher to the face ,the mans face disintegrating a little after each repeated blow( and believe me there are quite a number of blows) until the head just collapses?a truly sickening scene that leaves you somewhat thankful that it was only special effects and not a real killing. The other most effective scene in the film is the rape scene, Alex struggling to cross a very busy high street takes a short cut through a dimly lit underpass where she encounters a man La Tenia fighting with what seems to be a prostitute, The man stops Alex who is wearing a revealing party dress and holds a knife to her throat before forcing her to the ground where he inflicts on her the most savage anal rape that one could imagine?.gone is the dancing lunging camera of before and in its place a fixed vision of Alex's plight...this scene is interminably long but there is no release for either Alex or the viewer as the camera holds its place forcing us to watch?.her muffled squeals of pain are relentless,until finally Le Tenia finishes what he started and roles over in delight smirking like the cat that got the cream?juxtaposed against the animal cries of Alex, a bruised battered and bleeding wreck,Alex struggling to get to her feet grabs whats left of her party dress in a desperate but futile effort to cover whats left of her dignity? La Tenia grabs her again smirking "I'm not done with you yet"?knocking Alex to the ground and beating and kicking her face to a pulp. On the subject of the format of the film its hard to tell if the film would be as powerful if it were told in its proper linear way,but if I were to hazard a guess I would say NO?.Such things have been asked of Pulp Fiction and Memento and again I would have to say the power of these films too would also be somewhat diminished. So did I enjoy this film?...NO?.its not a film to be enjoyed, but it certainly gave me a notion of how brutal humanity can be and its savageness will live long in my memory .I must admit to having a serious crush on Monica Bellucci ,she is extraordinarily beautiful almost doll-like, and I must say I was just a little intrigued to see her in a state of undress and perhaps in some sexually deviant scenes just for my own titilation you know,but as soon as I saw her characters plight in the film, I was filled with guilt and not a little embarrassment for having such thoughts,even though I watched the film on my own, there was absolutely nothing titilatling about the scene and at no time is nudity used to exploit the story and this is why Noe should be praised as it could so easily have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what cinema is supposed to do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion the best movies do not focus on the story itself, but on the sphere. Thing like settings, camera-work music, style and acting are of much more importance then the story itself. These things make a movie fun to watch, over and over again, whereas a movie that focuses mainly on the story (with the common "big surprise" or plot twist at the end), will only play in my DVD player ones. Another important issue of cinema (in my humble opinion anyway) is that she should bring strong emotions of happiness, hate, regret, anger, loss, compassion, etc, to safe environments like a movie theatre or my own nice and cozy living room.Irreversible succeeds in doing this in all aspects. The camera-work in the first scenes is really disorientating, confusing and shaky, and it really makes you think that you were there. The brutal violence in the first half of the movie becomes almost a bit too much. However, in the second half of the movie there are some very nice scenes with nice dialogs and you really get sympathy for the main characters. They become human. At the end of the movie the sphere is very happy, the camera-work becomes much less disorientating, the characters seem much nicer and the settings become less and less "darker". In summary: there is a huge contrast between the beginning and ending of the movie, not only by regarding the plot, but especially(!) when you are concerned with the audio/visual effects, sphere and emotions you experience as a viewer.If you then ? at the end ? realize again that the movie is told backwards and you become aware again of the brutality still to come, you get a unique feeling of mixed emotions! After you get to know the characters, the dark half of the movie becomes even darker then it already was (and believe me, it already was). The story itself may be very simple and uninteresting (a woman gets raped and some people want to take revenge? nothing fancy), but it is the way in which the story is told that makes Irreversible unique. The explicit violence is hard to cope with and the backwards storytelling may seem pointless, but those things are absolutely necessary to bring this really unique feeling of opposite emotions to the viewers.If a movie is not "plot-driven" like most other movies and leaves me shaking, trembling and laughing on the couch in my own nice, safe and cozy living room (like Irreversible does), then all criteria's for great cinema are met! This movie is not like "just watching a story", and not everyone will appreciate it (or want to appreciate it). It hits you with a sledgehammer with its realistic violence and lingers in your head for days because of its ironic ending. People who get bored of all the standard Hollywood clichés and standard story lines, go watch elbisreverrI and you will experience what great cinema is meant to do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will play with your mind then snap it in two. The film commences in gay bar called 'the rectum' with two guys searching for 'tapeworm'. The camera work plays with your mind leaving your vulnerable for the following scenes, not to mention the low frequency sound for the first thirty minutes making you feel sick and literally wanting to turn it off, only you can't because you're so intrigued by such a mad creation. For the first half of the film the camera work is awful, permanently rotating making it virtually impossible to focus on anything for long. I think this was done to recreate the madness in the characters mind. I'd say this is a very sick revenge film, Quite a basic storyline but very well made. The film is completely reversed (Credits at the beginning, Equilibrium at the end). Before watching this I presumed it would be quite difficult to keep track of time because of this but in fact it's very clear. It simply shows a scene then shows the scene previous to that. Very original. Two main scenes imprinted in my mind with this film; The initial 'rectum' scene with the extinguisher caving tapeworms skull in and the twenty minute, realistic, detailed, violent, rape scene, with the stunning Monica Bellicci and the horrible 'tapeworm'. The acting is truly amazing, the camera work is a total thrash (which works perfectly with this film) and the layout is truly unique. I thoroughly enjoyed this film but don't advise it for the Gib-hearted out there.</fullReview>

Beautifully intertwined, Noé portrays two opposing elements of the human soul. Caught in the middle is Alex (Monica Bellucci), who experiences both, horrific, unrelenting, psychopathic violence, and tender-hearted, euphoric love. Any true lover of cinema would have to agree that the backward-structured narrative is smartly edited and a visual marvel full of disorienting and breath-taking imagery. The film questions the limits of human morality, grasps your attention with a cast-iron grip -forcefully peeling your eyes open, and effectively forces the viewer to both squirm in terror and rejoice in love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanna rate this movie lower, but I have to give it formal props for the acting, the directing, and the real life gut wrenching reality of it all... It is very sickening, and so is life. I read all about the movie, the head bashing scene, the rape scene, but I promise that nothing I read about it could have described this movie. It is utterly disgusting... The way the people are portrayed just like average, day to day people... It really shows you how life, people's lives, can all change so drastically over the course of one night. And the opening scene in the gay club where he asks like 50 people if they know Tenia... He literally goes to each and every person and asks them, just like real life. The "fist me" person needs to be put out of his misery... And the broken arm, the face smashed in, then the transvestite prostitute... Everything about this movie is disturbing. I read it was one of the most disturbing films ever made, it was the "most walked out on" of 2003... and I just had to see it to see what it was all about. To be honest, I will never watch it again. The rape scene is awful, but not as awful as what he does to her after he is done. You know, in American films, they show a man approach a woman, or a man on top for a few seconds, then they change the angle or the scene. This is a true to life - brutal portrayal of rape. Which makes me feel more compassionate for the women who have had to go thru this, or anything even close. The way he was talking to her, degrading her... And then he beats her to a pulp... It truly is sick. The fire extinguisher part, I honestly had to turn my head after the third or fourth time he smashes him with it, but then he keeps going and going and going... You see pieces of his skull fly... It may be computer generated, but boy does it make you sick! My advice, read about it... Don't see it unless you have to for yourself. But be warned.. This movie has THE MOST SHOCKING SCENES I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! And I go for the sick and twisted films...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IRREVERSIBLE is a decent movie. I didn't find it to be as wonderful as many other people did, but still worth a look. As anyone who knows anything about this film knows, the concept is that the film starts at the end and works it's way back to the beginning, MEMENTO-style. The story is basically about 2 guys who seek revenge for the rape of one of their girlfriends. I initially sought this movie out because I had heard how "shocking" and "controversial" it was...I have to honestly say I was disappointed. The face-crushing-via-fire-extinguisher scene IS pretty cool and graphic, and the extended rape scene IS pretty brutal, but I just didn't feel that those two things alone create a "shocking" or "controversial" film. Those two scenes happen relatively early in the film, and everything sort of slows down after that. The ending has a decent added surprise that made the whole film come together a little more, but I have to admit I was just kind of bored with the whole film. It's worth a look, and the rape and head-crush scenes may be a little much for the casual film-goer, but if you're looking for hard-core exploitation or gore, it's not in this one... 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A case of revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though most viewers and critics found the graphic violence in this film to be (not only) excessive but the main source for their disliking this effort but I'm one of those who can understand the reason for it and my complaint comes at the overly used "backward style" that has become nearly cliché. Story starts with the last scene where we see two men in a gay S&amp;M club called "Rectum" where they are frantically searching for Le Tenia (tapeworm) who has raped the girlfriend of one of the two but when they find him things go horribly wrong.*****SPOILER ALERT***** When Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel) think they have found Le Tenia (Jo Prestia) in the bowels of that nightmarish club Marcus ends up with a broken arm while Pierre saves him (from rape) by bludgeoning the man with a fire extinguisher. While all this goes on the real Le Tenia is off to the side laughing at the events that have taken place! The story continues in reverse where we see how everything ended up so horribly from getting information from a she-male hooker to a couple of vigilante thugs who help in their search. Alex (Monica Bellucci) is the girlfriend of Marcus and the ex-wife of Pierre but the three of them get along and are at a party when she leaves suddenly and is attacked and anally raped. Before the party Marcus and Alex were in their apartment in bed but when he leaves to pick something up at the store Alex finds out that she is indeed pregnant.This is only the second film for director Gaspar Noe but even if your part of the demographic that hated this effort I think Noe makes it clear that he's a young filmmaker to watch. His first film was "I stand Alone" and if you look at both of his choices in directing than one might say that Noe's attracted to characters that have a difficult time controlling themselves. The graphic nature in which this story is told is easily going to put off certain portions of the audience but for those with stronger stomaches the skill in which this was made is clearly evident. I was one who at first wasn't sure if the wrong man was killed at the beginning of the film and I had to look on this website to be sure but for those of you who are still confused the wrong guy was killed. This is arguably the most important part of the story in which it shows the futility of revenge and a second rape was only seconds away from occurring! Still, I'm with most of the critics who are tired of the "Memento" style of storytelling and it's become passé in the world of cinema and you have to wonder just how effective this film would have been otherwise. I'm not saying that this is a terrific film because I really don't think it is but I did find it visually and audibly interesting and gives notice that Noe is a talent to watch in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once something horrible has been done, there is no going back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French director Casper Noe's "Irreversible" may be one of the most unsettling rape revenge films ever made. The story is told backwards like the film "Momento". The film may cause viewers to get motion sickness from the crazy non stop movement of the camera. The main characters Alex, Marcus and Pierre are 3 friends whose story is told over the period of one day. Her ex boyfriend Pierre is sort of the voice of reason, although violent if put in the right situation. The brutal revenge takes place at a gay S&amp;M club. After Marcus is in danger, shy Pierre steps in beating the wrong man to death with a fire extinguisher. This scene is disgusting and realistic showing every detail of the skull crush. Before this happened 2 gang members offer Marcus a chance for revenge, saying they can track down the guy who raped his girlfriend Alex. Then the film continues to work its way back to the beginning. The most unsettling part of "Irreversible" is when Alex (Monica Belluci) gets brutally anal raped. This seen goes on for about 8 minutes. She goes out alone after a party wearing a sexy outfit, not knowing what fate awaits her. During the rape scene the camera stays in one place and focuses mostly on Alex's face and screams. It's sad, brutal and hard to watch. You want to look away, but you can't. It seems Casper Noe wanted the viewer to feel the Traumatic pain that Belluici's character felt. After that, the film becomes normal going back in time to the beginning of a peaceful day. The only other 2 films that I can think of with rape scenes as horrific are the cult classics "I Spit on your Grave" and the Hong Kong film "Red to Kill". The only problem is that these 2 films are too exploitative so the message is lost in the execution. What I like about "Irreversible" is it shows how ugly violence and rape are. It doesn't exploit women or glamorize brutality. If the film were to be told in a regular order, it might of made revenge a justifiable act. But by Noe showing the revenge first, it shows the animal like rage of the human condition. If put in the right situation who knows what horrible things we're capable of? "Irreversible" is very graphic in its sexual and violent content. It is very challenging to get through the whole film. It's very sad and devastating as it grabs your emotions and beats you relentlessly in the back of the skull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough, Brutal Revenge Story Told Backwards!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IRREVERSIBLE is th "backwards" story of 3 people and their dramatic fates. Shades of MEMENTO will obviously come to mind as IRREVERSIBLE unfolds in "reverse", with the first scene of the movie being the dark, dramatic end and the last scene being almost a love story. I have my doubts if the "spoiler" warning works for a movie like this, since we know right away what the ending is. Instead of focusing my review on the moral implications of revenge, sex and so forth, I'll tell you I what I thought of this movie at face value. For starters, IRREVERSIBLE can be a very tough movie to watch during the first 30 minutes or so. Not so much for its sheer brutal murder scene, but more because of its camera movements. This almost looks like some home-made video, with the camera shaking and panning left and right violently as we see the 2 main characters, Marcus and Pierre, desperately seeking low life pimp Le Ténie, who apparently beat the hell out of Alex, Marcus' girlfriend and former girlfriend of Pierre. Marcus and Pierre go inside a gay S&amp;M club looking for this low life dirt bag and when they do find him, the way they dispatch him will go down in the annals of Cinema as one of the most hyper violent/gruesome deaths ever, as we see a man's head literally pounded to shreds. The scenes move backwards and we begin to know why are Marcus and Pierre so desperately looking for this guys. Alex (played by Monica Bellucci)was violently raped by this Le Tenie guy after she storms off a party. Through out the whole movie the viewer is subjected with shaky camera jolts and exaggerated colors, namely the color red. As the film progresses (or regresses???), the camera shots become more steady until we reach the very beginning of the story. There are some very hard sex scenes, without being too explicit. I've read other users comparing this to BAISE MOI, but IRREVERSIBLE does not have explicit sex. The Acting by Vincent Cassel as Marcus is formidable as well as Bellucci's. This is not the kind of movie made for family viewing but I think it shows what a man is capable of when someone destroys a close, loved one. A very good movie that's a bit tough to watch due to the unconventional camera style.</fullReview>

The way the movie was filmed and edited stabs the viewer in the most painful way just to give the meaning of the movie! The music added a special feeling to what is the most shocking film for the last 10 years! Well done Gaspar for a unique and shocking 12 minutes! Monica i think is an amazing actress only she can play a part like that just like Malena...showing us what can happen to an ordinary woman and what the consequences do!Lets see what other shocking film Gaspar can think of and maybe this time it can actually win a award at the Canne Festival instead of shocking the audience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing but Rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first quarter or Third of this film, I was finding it very difficult to continue watching. Its no exaggeration that I felt physically sick watching it, I really considered this film to be violent and sick for the sake of it(especially with the over the top camera movements). However, if you can stomach the powerful, brain damaging opening scenes you are in for one of the most artistic, thought provoking, well rounded masterpieces of film out there.The films scenes play in reverse, which at first I wasn't too keen on. I get a little bored of these sort of time-structure stylised films. 'Memento' pulls it off (with purpose cos it is a film about memory), Tarantino and Innaritu pull it off but rarely do others. I figured it was employed just to make this pointless violent onslaught seem artistic. However, what I will say is that it works a treat. This structure emphasises the feelings on the mourning of the destruction of a beautiful thing, rather than building up or glorifying its destruction. Plus that shell shocked feeling from the opening stays throughout the film and makes you care intensely for what the characters have to say there on.The dialogue is fantastic, acting is fantastic. Bellucci is perfect as the epitome of beauty, seeing that beauty destroyed is heart breaking. (Don't know his name, but)Beluccis boyfriend is a brilliant character; over-testoroned yet likable and admirable. He is particularly good in the party scene. Cinematography is very good as well, dynamic and artistic yet very real feeling. I wont give anything away about the film so I'll stop here. But my advice to you is stick through the opening scenes. Don't make the mistake I almost made of quitting. A very good film.</fullReview>

Firstly let me start with the intense noises and sounds that have a massive impact. the sounds are dark and industrial, perfectly complementing the shockingness of the film, which leads me on to the shock factor. This is the most shocking film i have ever seen. I like gruesome films but this film had me looking away from the screen on a number of occasions. the sheer brutality of the film is what did it for me. It does not hold back at all. The film is as it called. It is in reverse which due to the story line leads it to have a very happy ending and a brutal start. For me an excellent film well worth watching or indeed owning especially on DVD so you can slow down the best bits...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i heard about this movie because of the rape scene and since i heard it starred one of my fav actresses and was unavailable at blockbuster, i just had to see this movie. the 10 minute rape scene is the most hard-to-watch sequence of any movie id ever seen. it looks so real and because its apparently done in one take, u forget that this a movie ur watching. what makes this even more disturbing is the beating at the end of the rape. how one human can do this to another is beyond me. my blood boiled even more so seeing the stranger in the background who sees whats going on and decides to walk away. while this scene is the most-talked about in the whole movie, the first 20 minutes are also sick. the combination of the camera work, lighting, music, and content make it hard to watch as well. as a whole, this movie is not trash as some would say, it is very artistic and bold. it tackles subjects so vividly the way all other movies try to avoid. if u liked the way "memento" played out, u should like this too. i recommend it to anyone who would like to see a real, unforgiving story which is sure to bring out a variety of different emotions from the viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gaspar Noe's IRREVERSIBLE is not super-violent all the time, as one might get the feeling when reading some comments on it. Only two scenes are disturbing, but the length of them, the graphic and the theme makes them intense and a bit tough for those who are not used to these kinds of pictures.But what makes this movie most hard to watch is the fact that it is told backwards and that the ending is such an extreme contrast to the beginning. This makes the movie so very sad, bleak and cynical.The film itself is technically perfectly made. I can't compare it to anything - it is just such an awesome accomplishment. The scenes are very very long with no cuts, and the actors (and actress!) are very good.It is a disturbing film to see. It might not be an important film to watch, but at least it gives some very good insights in modern life and shows how fragile things around us really are.I was very impressed by this movie. Salut to Noe! Belucci and Cassel were a perfect choice. Extremely well done, very moving and very good.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick and wrong, slowing down to look at a car wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most wrong film ever, but also it is one of the most interesting films stylistically and thematically to be born in the new century.The camera technique used although Gonzo to look at is amazing and probably contrived although in a good way. It is almost like watching a piece of documentary because of the way you feel you are there watching something really messed up like a war zone on TV either Iraq or Vietnam or something like that.The soundtrack used in the initial sequence is horrendous in the way that it disorientates, that combines with the camera tumbling around truly makes the viewer feel sick, but this is also perfect in the way that it captures the mental state of the main character Vincent in his state of extremme disorientation and anger.This film scares the hell out of me, and is a dark journey into revenge and madness. The rape scene is a horrific portrayal of anger and hatred personified in one man the rapist. While on some levels the necessity of depicting so graphically the rape of the central female character may be questionable, Antonin Artuads 'Theatre of Cruelty' is evoked, the scene is like a bomb be thrown at the audience, and the viewer can either leave and escape the bomb or stay and face the consequences.I never saw this film in the cinema, and on some levels i am grateful because it allows some distance from the film viewing on video, I can imagine in the cinema that this would be an experience that would haunt you worst than watching on video.This is a great film, but it is also a film which is sick and wrong, it is like slowing down to see the people all mashed up in a car wreck, it is also very interesting and artistic. Watch this film bearing in mind you probably will have nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After witnessing the nightmare of Gaspar Noe's "I Stand Alone," a movie that left me in open-mouthed awe for days afterwards, I just knew I had to see "Irreversible." I am not a big foreign film aficionado, not by a long shot, but Noe's films are worth watching simply because they are deeply disturbing jaunts into the darkest recesses of the human psyche. He's not above showing life as it really is, and he does it in ways that make you laugh at the cleverness of the presentation even as you cringe in disgust at the subject matter. In other words, his pictures are right up my alley. I always love to watch cinema that challenges the viewer on some level, something rare indeed in an age of the American special effects laden summer blockbusters. That doesn't necessarily mean I always like these types of films; oftentimes I don't when the fine line between challenging and pretentiousness is crossed, but Noe's stuff is great because it is premium grade weirdness. "Irreversible" will remind many viewers of the American film "Memento," except Noe's film is darker, oh so much darker, than that movie."Irreversible" flows backwards, with the closing credits opening the film and each scene shown from the end towards the beginning. Right from the start, you know you're going to see something different. Boy, are you ever! A sex club with fleeting sounds and images of pornographic behaviors, a sickening scene of a human head being bashed in with a fire extinguisher, and an arrest quickly start you wondering about what it all means. As the film progresses (regresses?), we learn why one man killed another in that seedy bar. Alex (Monica Bellucci), a rather carefree soul, was brutally raped and beaten by a thuggish French pimp in a subway tunnel. Her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent Cassel) promptly had an emotional meltdown when he discovered what happened to his lovely woman. Full of seething rage, he goes on a rampage through the city looking for the man who maimed Alex. Along for the ride is Pierre (Albert Dupontel), Alex's former boyfriend who desperately attempts to rein in Marcus's reckless quest for vengeance.Surprises abound in "Irreversible," surprises that will leave you thinking about the film long after it ends. I was a little amazed I figured out how the film concludes (begins, actually) long before I got there. You just knew there had to be some big, explosive revelation that would give Alex's victimization even more pathos. Well, there is and it's quite shocking. In fact, it would have worked almost as well had the film been shown in chronological order. Since Noe chose to reverse the sequence of the scenes, he not only retains the film's shock value but also imbues it with a frequently recurring sense of "what if." If only Marcus had paid more attention to his wife at that party. If only Alex had listened to Pierre and not gone out alone in a dangerous neighborhood. If only, if only, if only. You get the idea. This sense of identification gives the movie its edge. We've all done the same thing, asked the same questions, after a personal tragedy. I know I have.What shocks even more are the things Gaspar Noe can get away with showing in a French film. The French have little problem with overt pornography, morally repugnant violence, and lengthy discussions on the most intimate details of sexual relationships. Sure, American films are violent and sometimes crass in their discussions of sex, but not like the French films I have seen lately. I can't imagine any mainstream film made here that would show a rape sequence that runs for nearly ten minutes, or the weird goings on in a club. If you have a serious problem with any of these issues, stay far, FAR away from "Irreversible." For that matter, stay just as far away from Noe's "I Stand Alone," a movie that shows in gruesome detail a murder/suicide. I will say that the filmmaker does not in anyway attempt to glorify the vicious acts of cruelty and barbarism he depicts in his movies. That doesn't mean it makes these incidents any easier to watch, however."Irreversible" is a shocker on many levels, a film not suited to a majority of the movie going public. It's not the sort of movie you would take a date to, or watch with members of your family unless you're a member of the Manson family. It should go without saying that Noe's picture is not suitable for young children. I recommend watching "Irreversible" alone so that it becomes a personal experience. I don't know what Gaspar Noe will come out with next, or if he'll ever make another film again, but I want to see it whatever it ends up being. If you haven't seen "I Stand Alone" before watching this one, make sure you see it soon. Fans of this type of cinema should also check out "Baise-Moi," another French film filled with even greater amounts of nihilism and despair than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking through these reviews, chances are that you've heard something about Irreversible, otherwise you wouldn't be here. Gasper Noe's vision is gut-wrenching, dizzying, sickening and disturbing. Time destroys everything - so the tagline goes. The first line of dialogue in the movie also states it: Time destroys all things. Irreversible narrative is told in reverse, so time cannot destroy everything, since it begins with destruction and shows you what was destroyed.***SPOILERS&gt;&gt;&gt; The opening twenty minutes are the most disturbing I have ever seen, with swirling, dizzying camera movements through a seedy gay club where all sorts are going on, the music is pounding as our protagonist searches the hallways and dance floors for the man he is looking for, a man we only know as The Tenia... If you can hold onto your lunch when this man is found, you're a better man than I am... If you couldn't watch anymore, you should have disciplined yourself to sit through it further. With a beginning so violent and sickening, it can only get better can't it?? On my initial viewing, I had to stop watching during the "fire extinguisher" scene, I knew it was gonna be powerful stuff that followed and prepared myself for the worst...But the following scenes were nowhere near as violent, just a mad hunt through the streets of Paris, trying to find the man responsible...for what? Only time will tell what this man did.We find out soon enough, when Alex (Monica Bellucci) leaves a party early and enters a subway to get to the other side of the street. When will women learn?? Did she deserve to get raped? Of course not! But this kind of crime happens EVERY SINGLE DAY somewhere in the world, and it sickens me. Gasper Noe forces us to watch the most brutal rape and the unflinching camera captures every moment of Alex's pain. Why does this happen? Why? Why? Why?The movie ends with Alex's relationship with Pierre, romantic scenes of love, intimate conversations, the creation of a life. Why can't the world be like this?I implore all women to watch Irreversible... If only so they know (repeat: KNOW) the dangers that lurk around the corners of our life. Such perils cannot be erased, but we can prepare for them..."Hindsight is always 20/20"Time destroys everything, but should it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously disturbing movie. At some points I got the feeling that it was disturbing for the sake of being disturbing, but then I remembered it was a French film, and their films seem to know no bounds when it comes to how disturbing they are. This film depicts the rape of a woman and her boyfriend's quest to avenge her rape by hiring two thugs to assist him. I was able to figure this out by the movie's end. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to follow throughout as it is told in reverse - Memento style. I understand the point of telling this story in reverse, but it could've been fleshed out better. The rape scene is so real and so graphic that it makes me wonder how both Monica Belluci and the actor playing the rapist were ever mentally the same again afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just shock value.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people who seek out this movie do so for its legendary nine-minute, brutal, graphic rape scene. They're either drawn to it by some need to see this infamous scene, or repulsed by the fact that it even exists. If that's all you see here, you're missing a finely crafted, very challenging film that has a lot to say about fate, destiny, and the course of our everyday lives.Irreversible is a story told backwards, using this gimmick as a path to its ultimate theme: if you knew the future was bleak and horrible, would you still want to see it? After a brief prologue that sets up this theme ("Les temps detoured tout" - Time destroys everything), we see nothing but chaos. The camera-work is dizzying and disorienting, the dialogue is shouted and overlapping, the cuts quick and blinding. Ten minutes later, a vicious act of retribution on a rapist occurs. Shortly after that, the actual crime is seen - the rape of Alex (Monica Bellucci) at the hands of a total stranger. Both of these heinous acts are filmed without the jump-cuts and off-kilter perspectives - we see them with sickening clarity.That's the future (or the present). The rest of the film establishes the three main characters - Alex, her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and her ex-lover Pierre (Albert Dupontel) in happier times as they head to town for a party. Each scene takes a step back - not only in chronological time, but in thematic distance from the chaos and violence of the early part of the film. We see these three tease and joke about sex and relationships, even with that dark shadow of the known future echoing behind every simple touch or every spoken word.But the film is brightening as it goes backwards, reinforcing the theme that time does destroy everything (as the future becomes the past), but also that even the worst horrors can never truly overshadow a happy past. Bellucci and Cassell (real life husband and wife) have a perfect on-screen chemistry, one that's shown with more than dialogue or action; it's evident in their comfort with one another.By the time the film ends, director Gaspar Noe has shown you the depths of human depravity, but he's also rewarded you with a sense of optimism that you may never have guessed was coming. He carefully constructs a film built on horrible realities and open-ended possibilities. He's clever enough to unfold his story in such a way that we know the ending, but still can feel good about the beginnings.For those who think this is a film intended for shock alone, they might be surprised at its depth. It's definitely not for everyone - not by a longshot - but there's more here than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good. Disturbing. But good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is, without a doubt, the most brutal, realistically violent and cruel movie I have ever seen. Hands down. I don't buy it when people say that The Passion of the Christ is the most violent film they've seen. They obviously have not seen this. But thats the problem with this film, the ONE PROBLEM: the controversy and shock value becomes the star of the show, not the brilliant direction and narrative and acting (most of which, I believe, was something like 75% was improv.'d). When shock value overtakes a film, it feels almost like that was WHY it was made, but I am willing to give this film and Gasper Noe more credit than that. Technically speaking, this film is genius, continuing the trend of films being shot hand-held, giving a more realistic look. I appreciate the eclectic style towards the beginning (aka the end) of the film because of how representative it is of the tone. Not only that, my favorite touch of this film is the technical detail in which Gasper Noe, when editing it, put in the background of the club scene where the man's face is crushed by the fire extinguisher, a constant tone at a very low frequency; at about 27 Hz. This tone creates a feeling of nausea and your stomach WILL tighten, making you feel quite ill and even nervous and scared. I think this action taken upon by Noe further distances this film from being labeled as exploitive (unfortunately, most people don't seem to think so). Ironically, to do this almost MAKES the film exploitive, but I don't think that was the intention. The fact that the movie is told in reverse actually does serve purpose and isn't just gimmicky like Memento (as much as I like that movie). Roger Ebert made a point in his review stating that if the film were told in natural order, it WOULD be exploitive, building up to the rape and beating scenes. Also, it makes the revelation at the end (being the beginning) much more sad and apparent, making this film extremely effective overall, at least in terms of story and narrative.The acting, while mostly improv (favorite moment: in the club when Vincent Cassel is asked his name and he, by mistake, says, "Vincent..." and he realizes his blunder right away and says, "Just kidding"), is quite top-notch. The fact that Vincent Cassel and Monica Belucci were also together in real life really helped their performances. Overall, this film is quite amazing on many levels. It needed to be as shocking as it was to be noticed and to make its point, and thats too bad, because it does indeed detract from the film's overall quality. However, that does not stop this film from being possibly the most effective drama in the last few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This truly a rare gem of a movie. It is absolutely brilliant in every aspect. Story,direction,acting and it touches every emotion. Told backwards it tells the tale of a couple Marcus(Vincent Cassell)and Alex(Monica Bellucci)who's lives are torn apart in the most brutal way possible.I could talk about the plot but that would take something away,you really do have to see it to believe it. Noe doesn't hold back and its this refreshing no holds barred attitude in his direction makes you very uncomfortable but intrigued throughout. The reason why there was so much controversy when released is because it gives you a look at how raw life is and doesn't play it down. In a word its truthful.There is no happy ending,there is no hero, but what there is is a film that will stay with you for a long time after you've seen it and believe me it is not a bad thing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young woman leaves a party without her drugged up boyfriend and is brutally attacked and raped in a pedestrian underpass. The boyfriend and his friend decide to seek revenge that evening and pursue the rapist to a gay club fondly named 'The Rectum'.The film story is cleverly presented in narrative reverse so we see the end of the film at the beginning and the beginning at the end. The end of each scene is followed by the beginning of the scene before till we reach what would normally be the first scene.This film is disturbing there is no doubt about it, two scenes are shocking and highly uneasy to watch and I admit I fast forwarded the rape scene when she started getting beaten up and I was slightly disturbed by the scene in the gay club.Despite the shocking scenes this films was very well shot and used interesting cinematic techniques. The actors were top notch and there was a suitably fitting sound track.Not a bad film, even though it disturbs it does not seem to be doing it for the sake of it. But be warned its sure to make uneasy viewing for 'ordinary' viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something we are all capable of!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is brutal. There is no other way to describe it. Yet at the same time it filled me with more emotion than any Hollywood blockbuster has for a long, long time. Noe really does an amazing job of transferring the emotions his characters are feeling into the viewer. After the rape has occurred (or before the rape, depends how you look at it) the camera is very chaotic, representing the way the characters are feeling - angry, upset, confused, etc. Yet before the rape (or after) it moves around smoothly, again, very good use of using the camera to reflect the characters emotions/lives - calm, happy, regular people.The rape scene is very, very disturbing. Not only are you put through the ordeal of watching this, but you really feel like you have no control. Yet, you feel you have to watch it. I was appalled by this scene, yet it really was essential to show it this detailed to get the emotional link I mentioned earlier. After watching the movie for the second time, I realised that when you thought about Alex' character, you really feel detached from her, due to the fact that you know what happened/is going to happen to her, so I think this is to reflect how Marcus would feel about her after the ordeal (although you never find out what happens afterwards). What's worse is that La Tenia gets away with it! The scariest thing in this movie for me, was the fact that most people have the ability to hurt/kill someone, it just takes a certain trigger. In this case, it was the rape of Alex. As I mentioned earlier, the camera work reflects this anger by constantly moving around.To sum up, this is a real emotional ride of a movie with some of the most disturbing scenes I've ever seen, but at the same time, so well made that I feel I could watch it over and over. Definitely one of my favorites. I'll give it a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not rated this film at all as I don't know how to rate it.I have noted that many reviews of this film (on IMDb) are spoiler laden. Since I saw this movie knowing nothing about it other than what was on the back of the DVD cover and that it was rated R (Aus. restriction - 18+) I will try and keep this review as spoiler free as possible. I don't know if knowing what happens would make a lesser impact. This movie had/has a huge impact that has left me needing to exorcise my demons about it, so to speak.The movie is run backwards starting with a crime having been committed and a man being wheeled off to hospital. It is disturbing right from these first scenes, not from a sense of what is going on (because the audience has no idea) but that the camera work will not allow your eye to settle anywhere, leaving you with a feeling of disconnectedness and (at least in my case) annoyance. If you can sit through this you will find that each scene will get progressively calmer camera-wise as we regress through each chapter of the story. Each 'chapter' is a direct lead-on explaining how we got to the previous one. This does not play like "Memento" as many have suggested as we know there is no mystery; the story is simply being played backwards. This backwards trek has a power to it that might otherwise be lacking. We know that *this* happened because *something bad* happened at some point and we know we will get to this place eventually. This lends even more force to the quite simple story.Now, without spoiling, I will have to say that there are two distinctly disturbing scenes that are directly related to each other. These scenes are extreme and uncompromising and some have suggested 'unnecessary' but I'm not so sure. I think that most of the time we are presented with these kinds of scene quite often in movies but for the most part they are glossed over - in some cases so much that we might even say "cool! that looked so cool" or whatever. So I'm not sure that this 'disturbance' doesn't have it's merit.These two scenes aside I would still say this movie made me feel uncomfortable with it's claustrophobic sensibilities. I believe that this movie was very well made with some very fine acting from all involved but I would be hard pressed to recommend it to a casual viewer. This film is not for the weak of heart nor the judgmental. This is a brutally honest account of how quickly everything in your life can be destroyed. By making one wrong turn here or there or even just by 'being'. The issue of 'fate' or 'destiny is also under scrutiny here.While I absolutely do not regret hiring this DVD I will probably never watch it again. I don't need to. It's left an indelible mark on me.Be Prepared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is a thoroughly unpleasant cinematic experience. It clearly knows this, and is keen to revel in it as the disorientating camera angles and monotonous tones of the soundtrack in the early moments of the film show. In fact, Irreversible appears to be on a mission to be as horrible and as nasty as it can possibly be and the result is a truly powerful film experience. After a lovely little epilogue to Gaspar Noé's earlier film, I Stand Alone, we are taken on a thriller ride through gay clubs and the underworld of France as our hero sets out for retribution after his girlfriend was raped and beaten by an unknown assailant. This isn't all, however, as the film professes that "time destroys everything" and to portray that, the events are shown in reverse order. This is clearly a result of Memento's influence on modern cinema, and it bodes really well in this film as the fact that the events are 'irreversible' would not have been able to be shown so destructively if the film followed the usual storytelling methods.Some people will come out of Irreversible asking themselves what it is that they've seen, why they watched it and why they feel guilty about watching it - and this is why Irreversible is so powerful. Cinema can have a profound effect on it's viewer, and Irreversible is one of the most adept films at showing this. During the film, we witness a man having his head caved in (literally) with a fire extinguisher, various perverted acts and, of course, the infamous rape scene involving Monica Bellucci. This scene is not a scene to be enjoyed, but at the same time it's utterly captivating ? and despite the fact that it lasts over ten minutes and is thoroughly unpleasant, we don't notice and what Gaspar Noé has created is, in essence a train wreck - it's horrible, but at the same time we cant take our eyes away from it. This shows what a visual talent Noé is, as, for one, few filmmakers would dare to implement a sequence such as this in their film, and many wouldn't have the talent to portray it as horribly and intriguingly as he does here. Make no mistake, this film is not one for the faint hearted - but at the same time, it stays with you and it's not an experience you are likely to forget. Which makes it must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the reversible concept for the presentation. It is engaging. But by definition the beginning is the climax, so I was left wondering "is that all?" at the end. Alex and Marcus are the typical urban youth busy consuming life. I wish more effort had been spent on developing the character of Pierre. The director seems anal-obsessed, literally speaking.Too much of the reel is consumed in sexual display. I don't speak the language so had to rely on the subtitles. The mystery and thrill of the climax begin to fade within 4-5 flashbacks. But anyway, it is compelling enough to encourage me to watch other works by the same director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking and difficult to endure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked forward to watching this movie since its theatrical release, but it's been today when I've finally been able to experience it. Yes, I mean 'experience'. Because the vast majority of the film is an experience, not just a story.I was attracted to it by the hugely polarized critical reactions arisen. Nobody showed a mild response to the flick: that's always exciting to me and, sometimes, the sign of a great movie. But even though I was prepared for some sickening stuff, I admit this one caught me off the guard. And this comes from someone who loves gore and stands violence almost impassively (I remark I'm talking about movies, just in case).'Irreversible' is a movie that feeds on all those aspects of life we shun even talking about, and it's just that, and nothing else (I mean it's not the infamous fire extinguisher / rape scenes, although they are two of the most horrifying images I've seen on a screen) what make the film so incredibly disturbing.To be quick and to the point: 'Irreversible' is telling you 'this is life, this is tragedy, it could strike you anytime, and there is NOTHING you can do about it, just pray it will never be your turn'. 'Irreversible' triggers feelings of loss, sadness, anger, hate, fear... plain depression, and all multiplied by 100 via camera-work. If an event makes you angry, Mr. Noe will get the camera moving in order to make you angrier; if an event is tragic, the director will make it insufferable. Believe me, this movie goes for the gut, and succeeds.But that's not the only trick: throughout the movie, we get to see a lot of moments where everything could have been avoided. As spectators, we can do nothing but feel sorry for the characters, and for ourselves too, wondering how much little decisions may affect our fate.On the technical level, this movie is nothing short of wonderful. The actors are superb, the camera work is sublime (ignore the critics: it may seem gratuitous at first, but once the movie goes on, you definitely see a purpose, and a very justified one), and the script, despite of endless cursing, works fantastically, making it all feel very real. Some scenes are clockwork of calculated chaos: four people arguing aloud at the same time, but giving their lines at the very right moment, adding it all up to the most realistic scenes of confusion I've seen in a long time.In regards to violence, I've tried to avoid any commentary in order to focus on what I feel it's important about this movie, but it's nearly impossible, so here are my two cents: I find hilarious the accusations of exploitation. As I understand, exploitation is the inclusion of gratuitous scenes of sex / violence in a movie for the enjoyment of the audience. Well, what we see in 'Irreversible' might be considered gratuitous to some (not at all for me, but I understand the debate), but what it isn't definitely is enjoyable. Anyone accusing 'Irreversible' of being exploitative is saying that scenes of rape and brutal murder are enjoyable, when they are devoid of all humor or satire. Well, I think that speaks for itself...So, if your stomach is strong and your emotional endurance is high, I recommend you this movie without any reservation. You will have an awful time, but it will be worth it from a cinematographic point of view.RATING: 8.9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Different Way Of Seeing Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Folks, there are two ways of seeing movies, one is from your own perspective &amp; viewpoint &amp; the other is with the eyes &amp; mind of the director. usually the ones who see movies from their own perspective tend to dislike most of the movies. but the rest love almost every sort of movie. "IRREVERSIBLE" is typically one of those movies which never gain much popularity. Because of its abstract nature of sound &amp; vision, it seems distracting. but DISTRACTION is the only beauty of this film. the rape scene in the underpass is so real that i have never seen such original (&amp; long too) shot ever in any movie. In my view, the reason of playing the film in reverse order is to show the hard fact of "Cause &amp; Effect" &amp; also the philosophy of "Time &amp; Space" that a certain action at a certain time creates an irreversible chain reaction that no one can resist. remember the last scene of the movie (actually the first) where there's beautiful green grass, the birds chirping, everything's so calm. but as the time passes, u can see the results yourself. i loved the movie, loved the idea and loved everything about it including camera work, acting, lighting, digital effects......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling, shocking, beautiful film about love (not violence)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came out of this film feeling anger towards only one thing - the criticism that this film should never have been given a certificate due to its infamous rape scene. There may be some valid arguments against the length of that scene, but not for its broad inclusion in the first instance. And it is shot with care. Without it, we would never understand the depth and intensity of the love between two people, a love explained and depicted so magnificently and beautifully in the last scene of the movie, which is, of course, the starting point of the whole story. This is a story about love, not rape. About a man's desperate pursuit for retribution, fearless of outcome and consequence. Of how a moment of mild insouciance and 'neglect' in a moment of an otherwise complete relationship leads a lover to almost extravagant feelings of guilt, both unfair and undeserving. How hard can you love someone? How hard can you hate someone? This hard, and yes, it does hurt. Is it possible to condone such violence? Of course not, but then again what would you do, how would you feel? AT the every least, it is worth an exploration.This is genuinely innovative film-making and story-telling. The rape scene is pivotal, but it's not why you should see the film. Everything that happens before and after (or should that be after and before?) is why you should see this movie. Allow plenty of discussion time after wards - I can't remember a film getting me thinking so much.(Note: I would suggest that sub-titles even for French natives are a pre-requisite as too much of the dialog is drowned in the sound of violence, especially at the beginning of the film, You need to get what's being said at every point.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible is a very stylish and well conceived film directly from the outset, conventional in the sense that there is a linear narrative however conventional cinema is defied by the fact that the story is told in reverse order.Personally I had preconceptions about this film before actually seeing it, the subject matter for example is not aimed at audiences with weak stomachs, although I was intrigued to see what all the controversy was about and I have to say this is possibly one of the most sickening films I have seen...ever. I'll never look at a fire extinguisher in the same way again.Unlike other viewers I have to say that this is not at all senseless violence, Noe wanted to portray the outcome of rape in a very realistic way which I believe he has achieved, rape is not something which should be glamorised in cinema, it is an experience which ruins peoples lives and this film is a perfect example of how normality can be turned on it's head and rationality goes out the window, with particular emphasis to Pierre's character (no spoilers here but the notion of violence breeding violence sits well)At the beginning of the story (or the end of the film) Alex makes small allusions to her later fate in the story, this ties into the title 'Irreversible' suggesting that fate has long been cast and we can do nothing to change it - 'Time Destroys Everything'**** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible is a BEAUTIFUL film. Beautiful may not be the wordyou would use to describe one of the most brutal attacks on thesenses ever put on film, but it's a disturbing journey inside humancondition as few films this days are. You all know what this is about, but I'd like to add a personal view: This made me think about the time when filmmakers did landmarkfilms they actually wanted to make, and not what the moronic suitsat Fox or Columbia want them to. Remember when Scorsese did Taxi Driver? Or Sam P. did StrawDogs? Even though violence is mentioned in most entertainmentforums, the violence of modern movies is just tame compared towhat Fellini did on Saló or Scorsese did on Driver. And it's notviolence for the sake of it, but for the purpose to explore our soul. Irreversible does that with a hammer, and I love Noé and hismovie for being so human and honest and not pulling the plug.Best regards from Mexico City</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film last night with a couple of friends and still have large chunks infused on my memory some nearly 24 hours later.Irreversible is an apt title for the film. Once you've watched it, you can't unwatch it.Without giving away spoilers (you can read those in any of the other reviews), Gaspar Noe's artistic vision contains the two most shocking scenes I've ever seen in a film. Such scenes have been attempted before, but it's the camera-work here that forces to dwell on the darkness of what's going on, and deal with it as you see fit.It's a difficult film to watch, and to recommend to someone, but if you're into artistic films and are prepared to see things that will make you deeply uncomfortable shot in a startlingly realistic way, then this film is well worth your time, and proves itself to be far more than just a shocking film.Possibly the most powerful movie I've ever seen, absolutely unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Denmark this movie gave the critics quite a problem; Almost everyone thought the movie was great, however they just couldn't recommend it to anyone, because of it's violence. - After seeing I couldn't agree more with this viewpoint.The major point that critics has argued about regarding this move is of course the violence, or rather; is the violence just a plain gimmick, to give the movie more public attention? I would say "No". The violence is perfectly integrated into the story. Some critics says the violence is too much. I would say; how in the world would anyway be able to describe a violent rape, without making it extremely painfully to look at? Not many movies (especially Hollywood movies) would have the guts to show the ugly nature of a rape (with exceptions such as Monster and Straw Dogs).Irreversible is the kind of movie that one has to decide whether he or she wants to see. Luckily one will know about 15 minutes from the beginning of the movie whether one has the stomach for this violent and ugly masterpiece. Consider it a relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people hate this movie. I suppose that's understandable on a knee jerk reaction kind of level for it is intensely disturbing and horrifically violent. However this is merely one level to the film, arguably the most superficial one. And it's a shame that people close the book and pass judgment on Irreversible based solely on that stuff. For it is a truly amazing artistic work. Gaspar Noe has created a film that the world has so desperately needed for a very long time. It accomplishes the rare feat of actually, successfully redefining the parameters of what a movie is. This is where the majority of so called "independent" or "art house" cinema seems to fail, the result being forced stylism and pretentious pointless new conventions. As director, writer, producer, cinematographer and occasional steady cam operator Noe is an artist who is truly realising his vision. Through courageously genius camera work, a successfully manipulative storytelling style and above all wicked directing he takes the audience on an emotional ride. In 5 words: Frantic, terrifying, depressing, melancholic, defeatist. In one word:human. I urge everyone to give this movie a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but with real impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The structure of "Irreversible" reminded me of the infamous Seinfeld Backward Episode, and at the time I watched that I deduced that probably the only reason they did it was because the script didn't play funny forward. Irreversible is actually helped and hurt by its structure, and after much thought, I think Gaspar Noe did right by telling this story in reverse; it has the net effect of being poignant rather than exploitative, which it would have been if played forward (it would have had all the depth of Walking Tall, or thereabouts). The rape of Alex and subsequent revenge killing (or vice versa) instead drive home the point of the movie, which is that each moment of our lives is so fragile, each incident so fraught with significance, that the consequences are truly irreversible. In the (more or less) final sequence, where Alex realizes she is pregnant, that moment has as much impact as the violence because we know what's going to happen to her later. On the negative side, I have to admit to a real sense of dislocation in the sequence of events, then, after watching it, I had to re-watch certain bits of it to get it clearer in my mind what took place after what, and then I couldn't find the scenes on my DVD skip button because I didn't have even a fuzzy picture of where certain scenes had come in. And, finally, the way it was photographed in the rollicking camera style that Noe imposes on the audience, is in the tradition of this cutesy MTV-generation visual style that some people seem to think is So Cutting Edge, but I just find it annoying (although it works rather well in the scene where the guys ride in the taxi while heckling the Chinese driver). Fortunately, the camera is stock-still for the extended rape scene and the fire-extinguisher head-bashing affair, and the freeze of camera motion really adds to the intensity of both scenes tremendously (not for the leery, by the way). I think "Irreversible" is a good movie, but not a great one. I probably wouldn't seek it out again, but I'm glad I saw it once. Well worth watching. 3*** out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Irreversible Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title sequence shouts the pretense of 'Irreversible' right in my face: This is new, this is brutal, this is art. Expect an experience. Then the camera-work picks up, and up until the closing sequence (history of the universe traced back to the big bang), this movie sticks to its pretense. It definitely IS an irreversible experience. Time destroys everything because it is irreversible. We cannot make a horrible event undone. A single act can destroy a whole life. The epilogue (which breaks the narrative frame of time-reverse scene order) however shows that horrible events can, if not undone, at least be redeemed by time (i.e. by following events, in this case birth). ***SPOILER AHAD*** Story summary: Alex and Marcus are a happy couple. Alex learns that she is pregnant. They go to a party with their friend Pierre, who used to be Alex' boyfriend. Marcus is doing drugs. Alex is p***ed off by Marcus and leaves the party. On her way home, she gets brutally raped and beaten up by a pimp. Marcus and Pierre see her when she is taken away by an ambulance. They are offered help in finding the rapist by two local gangsters. They lead them to a gay club and tell them the name of the guy who raped Alex: Le Tenia (The Tapeworm). At the club, Pierre ends up killing another man, with The Tapeworm standing by watching. Marcus and Pierre are arrested by the police.Later Alex is shown at home highly pregnant and in a park playing with children. The very simple story deals entails the whole scope of human drama: Love; Hate; Evil; Senseless Sadism; Innocence Lost; Helplessness; Revenge; Fury; Death; Resumption of Life (Resurrection, Birth). ***END SPOILER***Avantgarde movie in the truest sense. Very fine, innovative camera-work. Highly Recommended.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most powerful and important films that I have ever seen. It's a shame, that along with A Clockwork Orange, that this film cannot be viewed in most film courses because of the controversial rape scenes.Don't get me wrong, I am as liberal as they come, but this film does not turn me off. It should never be censored. It is art, and it is actually I think, as anti-rape and violence as you can ever get.The movie shocks you, and then it goes and shocks you even more. The end of the film only makes you re-suffer the the horror from the beginning.The reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey is important because in Kubrick's film, there is the juxtaposition of early man(apes) and the intelligent man of the future. The jump cut that turns the bone into the space ship serves to remind the spectator that even though hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, we are still animals inside. The bone, the pen and the space ships are the same tool inside.Irreversible depicts humans in the most realistic -- we are nothing but animals and violence is a reflex. It becomes a shocking anti-violence film, which is ironic in a way.All I can say is, wow.</fullReview>

I sat down to watch it with my heart in my mouth, as i'd heard about the particularly long rape scene and I wasn't sure if i'd be able to watch it, but from a female perspective, its incredibly realistic, pulls no punches and i believe that it doesn't sensationalize the act of rape atall, like some other films have done.

It's a revelation simply for the controversial opinions audiences tend to have after seeing it. At the very least, this picture makes you take a long hard look at how things can change from minute to minute, and that most of us are lucky enough to not have minutes change to hours when confronted with unspeakably bad luck! Gaspar Noe is the most refreshing, audacious filmmaker since Cronenberg really came into his own with DEAD RINGERS and CRASH. Stunning and mesmerizing filmmaking!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quick Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French film with subtitles. I saw it last night and loved it, it would easily be in my top 20.It was so dark, and very very disturbing. If I hear somebody tell me that Taxi Driver or something like that is violent, I will scream. This film was so graphic, about everything. The graphic nature of the entire film held me right from the start, it seems really weird and the swaying camera angle almost makes you feel seasick.It contains the most sickening rape scene I have ever witnessed, exactly how traumatic I have always imagined rape would be on a woman. Monica Bellucci (Matrix Revolutions) acted that scene with tremendously grim realism. Anyone who says the rape scenes in 'I Spit on your Grave' are disturbing needs to see this film, it makes 'I Spit on your Grave' look like a 'Carry on....' film. There is also a fight scene at the beginning which would make even the most ardent fan of violence feel sick.The film runs in chronological reverse order (The start is the end, then the scenes are run End to Beginning, making the end the beginning), which makes the film even more powerful because you are fully aware of the fate of the characters before they are.There is also very graphic sexual acts shown in full view on the camera shots; close ups of oral sex, and erect penis, even a guy fisting himself. You can buy this film in HMV or Virgin Megastore. Exactly how a film should be, if you want censorship, don't watch the film, when you get the realism, you feel you can relate to the film more because it is not sanitised.Anyone seen this film and would like to share their opinions with me? If you haven't seen it, I would recommend it to anyone, but don't watch it with your Nan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not another so called "french" film (spoilers Included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What bothers me the most is not the violence at all, its the purpose in which the director (this noe gaspar character), uses it. I felt I was watching another 11 o clock news program. Is There a need actually to promote this kind of movies?? I mean let´s face it, without the violence this flick would be as boring as the next b-movie, this film only can relay in the violence to make people throw up or leave the movie theater, there is only perhaps two good scenes for me to consider SPOILERS the way it´s develop (Memento anyone?), towards the end.I simply hate when movies feel important enough to use two old people to say some artsy quotes likes "time destroys everything" so what´s the big deal about it, do we have to watch another french movie to learn that; I guess not. For me a good movie you need a GOOD IDEA that´s the secret no CGI, no sex scenes, not really anything, I have seen movies from Iran more deeply and truly original that this one overrated flick. Of course the pseudo intellectual crowd needs something to talk about at dinners, coffee stores and bars, you have to feed them movies like this, make them look all smart and have them quote this and that.In the end the characters felt somewhat flat, does this flick pretend to teach us some kind of lesson???? I guess that the average viewer not only would feel sick but shortage in a message. Revenge, regrets, craziness. It´s all in a human being that´s as old as the Old Testament, I don´t consider myself a critic, just a guy who happens to watch movies for free, to anyone else that felt that without the violence this movie is nothing to call home about. I think I have seen too many stupid flick using/promoting violence, that I will try to stay close to movies with more than your average two cent philosophy, well that´s just me anyway (and please I´m not religious or anything else do not think the wrong way)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, by far, one of the most disturbing films ever made. The main reason for this is due to the way it is shot, that is, it is like you are a fly that never blinks and follows everything and everyone unoticed. There are no conventional cuts or edits or even conventional camara movement. The camara will twirl, go sideways, go upside, go diagnal, remain in one place, immobile for long periods of time, anhy type of camara movent you can think of, happens and happens like it is one long continous shot. What this does is make everything seem more real and raw while at the sametime gives it a surreal feel to the film since many camara movements are physically impossible. To make things even a little bit wierder, the events occur in reverse (like Momento) instead of chronoligcally. So what is this, reverse story about? Well, again, the story is not really conventional either since it is more about characters then any real encompassing story. The film focuses on three main characters: Marcus, Pierre, and Alex (played by the hypnotic Monica Bellucci). All three of them give very realistic performances, which is probably due to the fact that most of the movie was improvised and adlibbed, including the two most brutal scenes in the movie, as well as, cinema history possibly. SPeaking of which, the movie almost begins with one of the most graphically realistic scenes of violence ever created. Thje scene starts with Marcus going through a homosexual nightclub to find a man called El Tenia. At this time, we dont know why he is looking for him butthere are a few hints as to why. However, once the fight scene starts, you are treated with a seemingly single take of Marcus having his arm broken and Marcu's friend Pierre, smashing in Marcus' opponent's face with a fire extinguisher again and again. The second incerdibly vilent scene actualy supports the reason for Marcus's rampage which is Alex's, Marcus's wife, rape. What realy makes it hard to watch is the diolgue spoken by El Tenia then after he is finished raping her, he visiously beats her. I would try to describe them but they have to be seen to believed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people will think of this movie as gratuitously explicit, using horror to shock its audiences. Many people will hate it, and will say that it is provokative and manipulative. I am not one of those people. Movies have a very specific art, a very specific way of doing things. And Gaspard Noé is very conscious of what mechanisms movies can offer, he is very aware that there are buttons you can push to inspire disconfort, as well as there are nervous centers that do the exact opposite. Edited backwards, this is no "Memento". It's a raw, visceral masterpiece, a monument to the tragic truth about our times, like a poem of violence and the way it can touch everyone who doesn't think their lives are at stake. It makes us think about our own times. Too lost for words to continue. Just one advice: see it in the dark, alone, with the stereo on full volume.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try watching this without subtitles!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DVD I purchased unfortunately had no English subtitles so I was stuck trying to interpret the annoying flip floping camera work in the gay club (which was effective but extremely overdone) and the rapid fire dialog in a language I do not understand. I knew the basic premise of this film in advance and some if not most of what is witnessed is self explanatory.... and admittedly gruesome to watch. Much has already been said about the extended rape scene and the skull bashing scene in the gay club so there's no point in me adding to that... and anyone who reads the 200+ reviews prior to mine is not going to discover any spoilers not already leaked... but like so many other things... we all have to see them for ourselves....  Regarding the so called 'titilation factor' others have suggested about what valid purpose the 10 minute rape scene could have... I just don't see it... I felt nothing but rage and pity for what the character was experiencing.. and only after watching the fire- extinguisher scene again did I realize she was not avenged. The film definitely dredges up similar feelings as "I spit on your grave" due to the subject matter... and obviously it borrows the backwards time line concept from other films like Following and Memento but so what???? Not all original ideas are good and not all 'borrowed' ideas are bad.... I for one appreciated what I was seeing for the power it portrayed and that was enhanced due to not knowing what precisely they boyfriend and his friend were saying/yelling throughout the search of 'the rectum'. It was obvious they were looking for the rapist.... what wasn't obvious to me is how they tracked him to the club? (would someone who say this with English S/T please explain how these two outraged civilians could solve a crime while the police were still conducting investigations back at the crime scene? Did the 'tape worm' tell his victim his name before she passed out??? Somehow I doubt he said "tell the police this was the work of 'the tape worm'...." In closing... The crazy camera work, red lights... maddening sound effects and lack of subtitles in a language I knew added to the surreal, helplessness I felt while watching it... It definately made me feel a sense of unease.. and that is effective film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's irreversible, my friend. Time destroys everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gaspar Noé's Irréversible (2002), a French film, has just recently been released on DVD here in America after a short, limited theatrical release earlier in the year. I had read much about the allegedly strong, disturbing content of the film and thought to myself, 'sounds like another modern exploitation film with a few shocking scenes, like Baise Moi (also French). I'll have to check it out sometime to see for myself.' Well, no theaters around me screened it and I just happened on the DVD when looking for some movies to buy. I said what the hay and threw it in my cart. Not only did it truly fulfill its notorious reputation but it was also one of the best films I've seen so far this year!(*Basic Plot Spoilers*)Irréversible tells the rather simple story of a few people whose lives change drastically with the choices they make, the basic plot of many films, really. The main characters are Alex (played by the beautiful Monica Bellucci), her boyfriend Marcus, and her ex-boyfriend Pierre. Alex still cares about Pierre (and vice-versa) and since Marcus doesn't mind too much, they all decide to go to an evening party together. During the party, Alex gets upset with Marcus's immature behavior and decides to just go home. On the way to the subway, she gets severely raped and beaten. Soon after, Pierre convinces Marcus to go home as well and on the way, they find out what just happened. A mad chase starts, ending up in a very depraved gay bar, to find the man who did this and serve up a very cold dish of graphic revenge. Twenty three ironic times...whew! Like I said though, this is just the basic plot.(*End Basic Plot Spoilers*)There is a big catch to the structure of Irréversible. Similar to Memento, Irréversible plays the last scene first, with each following scene showing the events that took place immediately before the one you just watched. This format works extremely well here (much better than Memento in my opinion) and turns this simple story into a harrowing nightmare of cinematic emotion. In essence, you know the fate of these characters before you know why they are in their current situation. So, while you may not initially 'care' about the characters and the horrible positions they are put in, when you do, it will be all too late. Since the climaxes of the film are shown during the first half hour or so, it would be fair to ask if the rest holds the viewer's interest. It does. Many points, both important and not, occur throughout the remainder of the film which relate back to the opening tragedies and therefore, in a sense, you end up reliving the terrible events several times over. Noé's direction is upsetting, both physically and mentally. The camera spins and turns wildly as it floats from place to place and scene to scene, so much so that many viewers will feel a bit ill, which I believe was partially the intent. This shows a world of dark chaos but as we go on, Noé turns it into a feeling of light peace. It would be impossible to not mention the visuals he creates. Many are actually subtle yet full of meaning but two in particular are incredibly potent. One of them is undoubtedly one of the most realistically brutal and disturbing scenes of violence ever captured on film! The other is a truly painful and distressing rape. Both scenes greatly add to the cogency of this film, especially when you put all the pieces together. The ending is also of note, as it assaults the viewer with a final moment of reflection on what they have just been witness to for the last 97 minutes of their life. Anyway, another interesting thing Noé does (or doesn't do, as it would be) involves the cutting of the film. Each section of the story is seemingly one long take. There are no cuts in them (or very few), making for a realistic, effective presentation. The acting is quite good too, especially considering that most of it was improvised. In a few scenes, it is downright powerful.Irréversible is really a two part story, with the first half exploring the dark natures of human beings and the second showing common, everyday life. Together, they cast a light upon the tragedies that occur daily in this world and how suddenly they can happen. Some choices we make are irreversible. Some events are irreversible. What will tomorrow bring? You will find out, all too soon.Bonus: While the initial DVD release was missing The Making of the SFX featurette, I believe you can now send it to Lion's Gate for replacement. However, this featurette can also be downloaded for free from their site!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art Nouveau that is a bit passe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I rented this film I thought it was going to be another average thriller with a slight psychological, pseudo-intellectual slant. I didn't even know the film was French!However, despite the annoying, pretentious camera angles, slow pace and ambiguous dialogue (in the first 5 minutes) I thought I'd give our Froggie friends a chance - and I watched the whole film. I should have listened to my original instincts!Why the director couldn't just film the picture properly instead of making me throw up my dinner with his swaying camera in a bid to become the next pioneering Hitchcock is beyond me. I think the point would have been made better as I couldn't see or hear who was saying/doing what! I know he was trying to convey a certain state of mind or mood, but to be honest I just felt sick!By the time I got to the S&amp;M joint and the "rape" scene, my dinner had no chance of staying down. I understand all the "depiction of gritty realism is a necessary warning" arguments and the "artistic licence" arguments, and I am one of the Freddy Krueger generation who yearns for a bit of satisfying gory nostalgia, but these scenes were just gratuitous and downright sick!Why did the rape scene have to go on so long??? As a woman - I GOT THE MESSAGE IN THE FIRST 30 SECONDS and I think even that made me constipated for a week! The intelligent viewer (which this film is supposed to be aimed at) doesn't need to be exposed to this kind of thing so explicitly. While this scene is undoubtedly an eye-opening shocker for ignorant people who think "women ask for it" simply because they breathe in a man's direction, it still reeked of unadulterated titallation for the sadisticly minded. Ditto for the over-long aimless panning around the homosexual S&amp;M parlour and the all-too-real extinguisher scene. Whilst I understand the director's motives and that he wanted to capture the decadence of this underworld into which such middle-class people have been dragged and the dichotomies of human pain (emotional as well as physical) and pleasure, the director became too self-indulgent.Also, the use of irony and "premonitions" to expand the themes were so glaring they were insulting. For example, the homosexual overtones at the party; her dream; his arm; the red tunnel and the red lighting in the hallway; her joy at being pregnant etc. This has been done to death in much cleverer ways than dragging a film out so much we even have to watch Belluci pee!I can't even agree that the subtle feminist undertones were thought through properly. Belluci says that it is a woman's choice whether women should have sex - but of course that isn't true and she looks like a joke for saying that in the first place. Because Belluci chose a real man, as opposed to some boring drip, it is suggested that maybe she fantasised about rape - and got more than she bargained for (meaning she should have appreciated the boring drip). Of course we sympathise with Belluci - as a victim - but only because the rape was SO brutal and because it was the stereotypical "stranger in a dark alley" rape. Ask yourself, if the rape hadn't included any of those things, would you still feel sorry for her? Or would she "have asked for it"?For me, I endured 137 minutes of "revolutionary art" which was ultimately making a rather cliched, obvious, reactionary point, and which only served to inspire the next Ted Bundy. Noe - a little less passion - a little more restraint please!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific, powerful, disturbing and exhilarating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Gaspar Noe's IRREVERSIBLE is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. I don't know if I "liked" it or not, but it definitely packs a punch, and it may be far too much for the average viewer to endure.As most people who have heard of this movie know, the story is told in reverse chronology.We open with two men sitting in a hotel room. It's implied they are lovers, but not affirmed. One tells the other, "Time destroys all things." However, he is still constantly disturbed by the memory of having molested his daughter. We then move down to the street, where two men, one on a stretcher and one in handcuffs, are led to an ambulance and a paddywagon respectively, from a gay S&amp;M club called "Rectum." They are taunted by a pair of unseen men, who shout homophobic obscenities at them, and demand payment for some service.The two men are Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel), and in the next sequence we see them entering Rectum, where Marcus is searching for a man called La Tenia, as Pierre desperately tries to calm him down. We have no idea why they are looking for this man. Eventually, after accosting several patrons, they encounter a man they believe to be La Tenia. Marcus begins yelling at the guy, who does not take kindly to his behavior. The man breaks Marcus's arm and is about to rape him, when Pierre, moments earlier the voice of reason, bursts into the room with an enormous fire extinguisher and bashes the man's head to a pulp. Amazingly, someone cheers him on, and we get a quick glimpse of this fan, who looks at Pierre with almost awe-struck admiration.We then see a series of events which led Marcus and Pierre to Rectum. We see them walking down an alley with two thugs (who are the unseen men heard shouting at them earlier/later), questioning hookers, until they finally come upon a transexual who knows who they are looking for. Cut to a few minutes earlier, when Marcus steals a cab from an unfortunate taxi driver. We then watch as Pierre is interrogated by police, and then approached by the two thugs who offer to help them find the man they want, for a price.And then we see why all this horror is happening. Marcus and Pierre exit the party they were attending, and hear that a woman was raped. They scarcely bat an eye, until they see Marcus's girlfriend Alex (Monica Bellucci) being taken away on a stretcher after having been beaten and raped severely.In the movie's most infamous sequence, we watch as Alex leaves the party early for reasons unknown, and makes the fateful decision to use the underpass that goes beneath a busy street to the subway station. There, she encounters La Tenia, who is man handling the transexual prostitute we saw earlier/later. We also see that La Tenia is not only NOT the man who Pierre killed, but is, in fact, the man who was cheering Pierre on.La Tenia is disgusted by Alex's fancy clothes and upper class look, seeing her as a representation of everything that has kept him in the gutter. He first accosts, then brutally sodomizes Alex, who, despite a valiant struggle, cannot get away from him. Rather than just let that be it, he then beats her viciously and leaves her for dead.We are then shown why Alex left the party. Marus gets drunk and stoned and begins flirting with other women. This barely seems to bother Alex, but he becomes increasingly mean-spirited, making deragatory remarks about Pierre (a former lover of Alex), and behaving like a horse's ass. Even here, before anything else has happened, Marcus is not a likeable character. Alex gets fed up and leaves, unaware that she will soon encounter a fate worse than death.The last few scenes show the three friends blissfully unaware of the horrors to come. We see as they ride the subway and have some frank, but innocent sexual discussion, then move back to early in the evening, as Marcus and Alex lay in bed after making love. Each appears to have had their own premonition of the night in store for them (Marcus's arm is asleep, Alex has had a dream about a tunnel). They then get a message from Pierre that his car broke down, and they will have to take the subway to the party.Marcus then goes out to the liquor store, while Alex takes a pregnancy test, and discovers that she is pregnant. We then briefly see her earlier in the day, reading a book in the park, as children play and laugh all around her.While I cannot say with any degree of confidence that IRREVERSIBLE is more than a shocking exploitation movie, it is a superbly crafted, clever and powerful movie regardless. The reverse chronology is not used simply as a gimmick, but as a way to tell the story so that the true tragedy of the events that take place is riveted into our mind, instead of leading up to the outrageous scenes of brutality and violence as a cathartic pay off. The serenity of the final scenes is haunting and permeated by a heart-breaking sadness, as we know that these innocent people's lives will be shattered within a few hours.The rape scene is no more brutal or violent than anything seen in CLOCKWORK ORANGE or I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, but Noe's camera simply sits there, in one of the only moments in the movie that it does not move, and forces us to watch this sickening, inhuman act take place in real time. Rape is something which has long been accepted as an unfortunate fact of life, something which many people turn a blind eye to (indeed, at one point we see a man enter the tunnel, but turn and walk back out when he sees the commotion), but anyone who feels that a woman who dresses in sexy clothes or makes an unwise decision to walk down a dark alley somehow DESERVES to be raped should watch at least this scene, and decide if their self-righteous, puritanical beliefs still hold true. It is also interesting that her attacker is a homosexual, who commits this crime because Alex represents the upper class lifestyle he could never attain, toward which he feels severe animosity. This drives home the point that rape is a crime of violence, not sex, as sex is simply the weapon used to brutalize the victim.Marcus and Pierre's search through Rectum is one of the more nightmarish sequences I can recall in a movie. Not because of the activities of it's patrons (anyone who has seen more than one episode of QUEER AS FOLK will find nothing these men are doing particularly shocking), but because of the surreal and unrelenting atmosphere of insanity and rage that surrounds Marcus's character, which seemingly transfers itself into Pierre as soon as he sees before him the man whom he believes raped Alex. Noe permeates the entire sequence with an unfailingly creepy synthesizer drone, which instills a sense of dread and terror that I have not experienced in an horror film since THE SHINING. The special effect used when Pierre bashes the not-so-innocent man's head in is at least as amazing as it is horrific. While I can understand why some viewers might find this sequence homophobic, I don't think it is. Marcus and Pierre are in a world that is alien to them. It is a tough, dangerous place, not because it is a gay establishment, but because it's a place where pimps, gangsters and hustlers hang out, most of whom, incidentally, are homosexual. Marcus's homophobic and racist remarks, while not politically correct, are driven by rage. It does not excuse them, but remember--we're seeing this scene BEFORE we see Alex's rape. Had the movie been in normal chronological order, and we understood the degree of his rage, it's quite possible his remarks would have barely even been noticed.IRREVERSIBLE is a tough, bitter, angry movie. It makes no apologies for itself. It's as ugly as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, but is far better crafted. It's as sickening and cruel as CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, but is true to itself, and never hypocritical. Noe's motives are dark and sinister, but ultimately positive. He doesn't sensationalize or cheapen his subject matter. This is a cautionary tale. An exercise in nihilism that uses that most hopeless of philosophies to remind us that we live in a dangerous world, where our lives can be turned upside down in an instant. Is Noe saying it's all chaotic and out of control, that life is ultimately meaningless, and people in general are depraved? Or is he saying life is a precious, but delicate thing, and we should all take care to not allow things to spiral out of control? Perhaps Alex's dream and Marcus's numbness are warnings, as opposed to premonitions of an unavoidable fate.Noe does not give us any answers. He keeps us disoriented emotionally through the use of reverse chronology, and visually, as his camera twirls and swoops throughout many scenes, distorting reality to the point that we cannot be sure just what is happening to the characters--or ourselves. He trusts his audience enough to interpret the movie in their own way, and it's certainly open to interpretation. It's a truly horrifying movie, but it's original, intelligent and exhilarating as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT When i first heard about this movie, i was immediately intrigued. It was a movie that supposedly had people throwing up in theaters and walking out because of its horrific images and truthfull portrayal of rape and revenge... it sounded right up my ally. Now, i was expecting a pretty bad movie with some pretty gruesome scenes. the plot seemed generic enough; woman gets raped, friends of rape victim go for revenge. the movie is told backwards like memento.. sounded kinda lame, but any movie that had an impact on audiences like this movie did needed to be seen as far as im concerned. When i finally got a chance to see the movie, i was absolutely astonished by the assualt on the senses that this movie is... and whether you are intrigued by this movie as i was, or whether it sounds like a piece of garbage to you, i guarantee that this movie, no matter who you are or what you've seen, will haunt you unrelentlessly for days, and will stay inbedded in your mind for years to come.The movie as i said, is about a woman who gets raped and beaten to the point of being put into a coma. The friends of the woman then go out for revenge, but the twist is its told in reverse, so we actually begin with the vengeful act, and work out way bacwards to the rape scene that occurs at about the halfway point...then after we witness the rape scene, we see the hours leading up to it. now you may be asking why the movie is told in reverse. Definately a credible question, since at first thought it sounds like a gimmick and nothing more. I will attempt to explain why this is done. First, it gives us a gods eye view of these events, its almost like we're seeing into the future and seeing the events before the characters in the movie technically experience them. this make the whole movie, extremely eerie and sad. it makes every event seem tragic, no matter how trivial or happy, because it is in the shadow of this horrible tragedy that we know is just hours away from happening to this woman. Something else the movie achieves by telling the story backwards is that it does not lead up to violence and sex as a finale or a pay off. instead we see the events first, and are forced to deal with them for the remainder of the movie. and again, every scene after the tragedy is haunted by the rape.I personally was very impressed with this movie, it is very effective and masterfully done. Never before has rape been shown so truthfully and tragically. There are no quick cuts to make the rape seem more exciting, there is no dramatic close ups or heavy music playing to enhance the drama. It is surreal, it is sickening, it is slow and painful for the viewer, just as it would be for the victim, it is not glorified in any way, and is shown as the pure tragedy that rape is. I am not ashamed to say that i was brought to tears by this scene, it is extremely sad. The acting by both the victim and the attacker is so convincing that if you saw the actor of the attacker on the street you would want to attack him. its truley amazing and should be applauded for its honesty towards rape. Also the opening scene where we see the two friends of the victim hunting down the bad guy in an underground S&amp;M club for demented men, is also very disturbing and really gives the movie a proper dark and horrific start that shows the audience exactly what they're in for, and if they cant handle this, then they should leave because it only gets worse...Something else i noticed about this movie is its attempt to show both the horrors of the world and the beauty in the world. The tempo of the movie changes so dramatically from beginning to end that you wouldnt even know it was the same movie. It begins with dark madening camera shots seemingly out of control and spinning around to convey a sense of insanity, while showing horrific images for the first 40 minutes. towards the end however, we are greeted with beautiful scenes of pure love and tenderness as we see the future rape victim with her boyfriend in bed, obviously madly in love, and we realize was a fine line we walk between happiness and tragedy. this is a very unique touch to teh film, because what would normally be considered a happy ending to a movie, is absolutely heart breaking with it being shown in the shadow of the tragedy that is only hours away.Irreversible is a great movie, but that isnt to say that everyone wll like it or respect it. But it is a movie that is undeniably honest with its portrayal of rape and loss, and will give a face to every faceless woman we hear about who was raped on the news. Definately a powerful movie that no one will ever forget after watching.9 - 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** SPOILER REVIEW *****::note:: I do believe viewers of this film will do best to know the story before they decide to watch it. ::note:: This film is somewhere between genius and obvious in it's portrayal of events occurring to 3 friends in what could really be set in any time period but is set in an ever so apparent present. Straight from the outset we are taken into the seedy aspect of the city where we hear the story of a man who went to prison for having sex with his daughter. This was dealt with in such a calm manner that it's an almost flippant remark when we hear why the man had spent time in prison. There was no description or flashback of the event so we are left to our own devices to imagine that scenario. One which i'm sure the director devised as a way to question ourselves on what we have the capacity to visualise without the need for film. Human nature is common to all of us and the film opening scene begins to put that into perspective. The camerawork gives the appearence of a fly-on-the-wall with it's almost random movement and bird's eye views. The soundtrack is everything I want in a film soundtrack. The ambience suits every moment of the film as if even the beethoven was written for this peice of art. By the time you have been shown around the area and worked out that the credits came at the beginning and in reverse, you know that we are being told a story in reverse also. The events occur from what is really the most visually presented. We are taken around a nightclub called "The Rectum" where we are shown in graphic detail a reality of the gay life. This isn't more of a nightclub in the sense but a whorehouse with sex acts in every direction. The soundtrack gives us an ambience of fear and intensity with it's drone and the ever repeating lines from the focus of our story "where is The Tapeworm?" and "Who is The Tapeworm?". This section in time culminates in the most amazing scene in a film I have ever witnessed.One of our two "heroes" , or at this point anti-heroes, presumes to find The Tapeworm and starts to push and hit him. After taking a knock and crunching to the ground he is about to be raped when the second guy turns up with a fire extinguisher and proceeds to beat the rapist with it until only his lower jaw remains recognisable on his face. This is done so visually adept it is the reason you may be told not to see this movie. It is bearable to watch however as your not really seeing someone die. As a come down effect to what you have just seen the film takes you on a backwards journey to how a dispicable event could come to pass. We see our anti-heroes making their way to The Rectum with no consideration for how they get there. This is reversed back to the after-shock period of the rape sequence where our anti-heroes are seduced into obtaining revenge for theirs and the rapists victim's unbearable pain. In a deal that involves money also they are told that for a price they can be told who the rapist was.We are left here with our own moral decision to make. Would we find the rapist of a loved one and exact revenge? The film will help us along with that decision in the rest of the film. The rape scene was one I had to read about first in order to know why I was watching this film. I always feel obliged to know the opinions of others first because if the general consensus is that it's done in an exploitative way I tend to give them a miss. This scene however won praise from both this website and the BBC review on Film2xxx in the way it was handled. I can't say much about this scene apart from it was disturbing in a good way. You are shown a helpless victim who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. An immediately violent place by it's description with red walls and graffiti strewn across the walls, floor and ceiling. Our rapist is shown to presume that our victim is a prostitute but further into the 9 min scene it is made obvious that it made no odds if she was or not by his constant muttering whilst violating the victim. When he has appeared to finish he then sets about smashing her head off the floor repeatedly. By this time I think most people would have made the decision that they would take revenge but if not the rest of the film will maybe bring this inevitable fact closer to home.Scenes of fun, happiness, love and absolutely enthralling conversation topics in a film with no script. Just like life in all it's beauty the slow and the fast paced elements of time are shown in the new love between Marcus and Alex and the eternal pain in which the self-proclaimed interlect Pierre lives in having to watch the woman he loves be happy with the friend he loves. The film draws out with our victim becoming preganant and then daydreaming in a scene which seems maybe too idillic in comparison to the opening scenes but effective in it's picture of happiness.I don't quite understand the relevance of the strobe at the end of this film but as it begins to fade we see the milky way inside.This film does exactly what it sets out to do. It brings to each of us that see it a question and an answer to which maybe we would have to stop and ask ourselves one day. There are several aspects to discover on completion of the whole film with after-thought and in my opinion this film should be celebrated not shelved. It has the impact of a Larry Clark film with the storytelling of a japanese classic in a french body. A must see for all who require a film to envelop their senses beyond the films finale.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reversible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The three or four lines on the backside of the DVD package I brought home last week, were enough to give away the whole story of Irreversible. I read it and afterwards I felt that it was a shame that I knew the ?whole' story in advance so I advise you not to read anything containing the plot of this film. Why? Because I think it will be even better if you don't know anything about the story. I knew almost everything and I still thought this movie was good and I can only imagine what it would be like if I hadn't already known everything. I will not give away the contents of the film here, but I will point out some things for you. The first one is, that this film is very disturbing and certainly not for the faint of heart. I know that's what people say about many films, but those are usually horror or splatter films like The Evil Dead or Braindead. There are no flying limbs here, but there are some scenes of realistic and disturbing psychological and bodily damage that will certainly shock everyone (some of which might not be able to endure it). I therefore recommend everyone, who has a faint heart and is shocked or disturbed a great deal by realistically filmed trauma, to inform about the contents of this film.The second (and last) thing I want to point out is something people who have watched the film might better understand than those who haven't (POSSIBLE SPOILERS). Contrary to the title of the film, I felt that the events was very reversible. I mean think about it. In most cases you leave the film feeling the way the main characters are feeling at that time. Was this not a feeling of happiness in this case? And was this feeling not contrary to the one you had in the beginning? And wasn't it so that the film was portraying the events in reversed order? It was! Then in reversing the irreversible events, the director actually managed to reverse your feelings. Had the film been chronological, would you not have left it disturbed and frightened? But IN FACT, did you not leave it with a warm feeling inside, resembling one of happiness? (SPOILERS END) I know I did. Many of the disturbing events I had seen in the beginning of this film, had already faded away a bit in my mind by the time the film ended. That is what made this film so special to me. It was very disturbing and very real, but when the film ended it was almost as if I'd seen a heart-warming film. A very nice trick achieved by the director and very original. It kept the film in my mind for quite some time after it ended.8,25 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film that's easily misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first ever comment on IMDB. I figured that if I only ever comment on one film, it ought to be this.Watching "Irreversible" forces an opinion and reaction out of you. To me, a work of art is defined by being open to interpretation, yet strong enough to elicit a concerted response from the viewer.You have to be very serious about watching this and making yourself sit through the graphic scenes, in order to appreciate it. The hype is enough to forewarn you but please DO be prepared to see two incredibly brutal scenes. The subject matter is handled with the utmost respect to reality, and no sensibilities are catered to. It bothers me that people can knock these scenes or dismiss them merely as "shocking". These are real life experiences for many unfortunate people and this is the world we live in. Wherever you live and however you choose to wrap yourself up in your mentality, the events that occur in "Irreversible" (particularly the violent rape) are commonplace.When I had given it some time for this movie to sink in (and it does stick with you for days), I was both glad that we live in times where brutally honest movies can be made and watched openly, but saddened by the fact that our realities can be so horrific.The camera work in particular is designed to make you incredibly uncomfortable, when it is required. The alternately jarring and still shots place you in the scene and force you to feel as the characters do. Some people have complained that the rape scene is too long, wishing they "would just get it over with". I imagine that's part of the agony in the mind of a rape victim. To me, the moment during this scene when a passer-by enters the tunnel and pauses, only to turn and walk away, is supposed to fill you with anger (at his refusal to help) and reinforce the feeling of hopelessness, hopefully keeping you in your seat.Vincent Cassel once again shows his wealth of talent, going through a vast range of emotions from start to finish. I know more of Monica Bellucci the "beauty" than the actress, but her performance here can only be described as heroic. Many of her western counterparts simply wouldn't have the guts to perform in scenes so ugly."Irreversible" managed to knock me on my ass in an age where sex and violence are used to sell and sensationalize just about everything. For that reason alone I consider this one of the greatest films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film just after Baise Moi. Having seen both films occupying the same tabloid column inches, I was expecting relatively similar films. They couldn't be more different. Baise Moi is Porn (Really Sh*tty porn) posing as art. Irreversible is a sterling example of excellent European cinema. It is brutal. exhausting and uncomfortable to watch, and in that respect I think it is quite similar to Requiem for a dream or even The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It is also a fantastically acted and directed film that is worthy of the acclaim it has recieved. See this film now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now that the dust has settled...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to let this movie sit a week or two before commenting because I came out of it shaken and it took a few days to shake off. Now that the dust has settled, I really don't this of this as much of a movie. It is more of a stunt and really a 20 minute stunt at that. The opening sequence is a technical marvel, almost a cinematic spookhouse that ends with an unbearable scare. I think the rape scene is depraved because it is empty and exploitive. The same effect could have been achieved in three minutes that was in ten, so an excess of rape does not help a film. The rest of the film needed a script. Noe went though so much trouble to get a rise out of the audience, he should have provided the actors with a script. This in most evident in the train sequence which is so unfocused and dull, it brings the movie down. The movie seems to end abruptly, making it feel like half a movie. Admittedly, this film has a powerful effect. While Belucci is being raped, you really want the satisfaction of seeing the revenge on the man (any man at that point), but because of the film's structure you don't get that. This is a touch of brilliance on Noe's part because it leaves you feeling broken when you leave the theatre. If I were to see this movie again, I'd walk out for the rape scene and wait in the lobby until it was over. The head bashing scene is incredible in both good and bad ways. Technically, I found it flawless, almost magical. It's not often I think to myself "how did they do that?" but this was one scene that has me in awe. On the other hand, it is virtually impossible to watch (I hope to go frame to frame on the dvd so I get a better sense of how it was done). Still, when all is said and done, there's not much of a movie here. If you piece it together front to back, there is even less. The movie literally brings you to hell (the opening sequence) and back (the rest of the film.) Also a word on the sound. If it is true that Noe used the same noise that police riot patrols use to disperse crowds, this is completely Irresponsible. I saw it in a small theatre with kind of crummy sound, and I was still disturbed by the dreadful siren noise which lasted for 10 minutes. It's the equivalent of releasing tear gas into the audience and it's wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dude, where's my car?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Been chewing over a way of expressing the type of anger this film generated. This is how it's looking so far: the film works much in the manner of the police infiltration of the Black Blocs during recent protests (in Genoa, for example) ? content to smash a few windows, trash a few banks? but all for reasons that are counter-revolutionary, self-serving and only to be condemned. This film may act like it, but it's not our friend. The film takes on the outer-trappings of High Art. The camera spins, the actors practice their silences, degradation, sex and extremes are served up? but to what effect? Are we really supposed to play-off the opening of the film (homophobia spiced up with brutal violence, disorientation in every sense) with the ultra-cliched final images? What are the creators trying to tell us? That life isn't ? hold on to your chair ? all sweetness and light? That life is cruel, vengeful, bombastic and crude? (Something achieved with a lot less self-importance in A Ma Soeur!? or even from an exposure to any mainstream media outlet at the moment). The problem is that this film takes a lot to watch: it demands patience, an open mind, a willingness to let the film lead us around the block. It delivers nothing of worth in return. Consequently, those with willingness, and those who thought they had it and felt they could test it by buying their ticket, have their faith thrown back at them. The incredible camera work and superb performances don't mitigate this (if anything, make it worse? an awful meal in a beautiful restaurant). This is a film worthy of contempt ? but let's not be idealistic and simply say this: it's a waste of my time. The director needs to wake up to contemporary reality and engage with palpable tragedy. This is titillation and shock for the Middle Classes and should be avoided as surely as a Multiplex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rape happens. It happens to someone, somewhere in the world, every minute of every day. To avert your eyes is to deny that it exists in your world. To turn away is to shirk responsibility. This film is truthful in it's depiction of that horror and the feelings of vengeance that inevitably follow. There will be those that are repulsed by this film, a film that can make 'Requiem for a Dream' seem like a little girl's fairytale. If you are one of those who refuse to watch 'Irreversible' or one who watches and is offended... then you are living in a fake fairytale world of your own. This great French film is as brutally truthful and poignant as any in recent memory. It is one of the saddest films I have ever seen. And yet, because of it's reverse chronology, the final scenes of blissful romanticism are some of the most beautiful and heartbreaking moments ever committed to the silver screen. This is a courageous and magnificent artistic achievement!'Irreversible' unfolds backwards, much like 2001's 'Memento'. It's not a gimmick... far from it. The film begins with the revenge beating of a suspected rapist. It is a savage and relentless scene that will make many squirm. It is as graphic and violent a scene as could be imagined, and at the end, you will feel like you were the one who had their skull crushed in. And because we have no real idea who these characters are, there is a sense that this is gratuitous and pointless violence. Then we go back in time just a few minutes to the search for the rapist and watch as the frenzy of revenge consumes a man who is bent on justice for the rape of his girlfriend. The next scene is the rape itself. It is a soul-crushing scene of relentless intensity that seems to drag on forever. It makes the earlier beating scene seem rather tame and almost justified. And the film continues to track time in reverse to the beginning of a seemingly innocuous day filled with hope and love and tenderness. But of course, unlike the characters, we are painfully aware of what awaits them as the day unfolds. It is tear-inducingly sad to watch these people drift toward an irreversible destiny.Monica Bellucci is astonishingly brave. This performance is as courageous and accomplished as Diane Lane's role in last year's thriller 'Unfaithful'. She should be decorated with every award there is for her role as Alex. She is terrifyingly scared and desperately sympathetic in the rape scene... but her best work comes later in the film (earlier in the day) as she shares some tender moments with her lover (Cassel) and some funny moments with an ex-boyfriend. The final twenty minutes of the movie are all a showcase for her... a chance for her to show that she is capable of magnificent subtlety and tremendous range. The bedroom scene with Bellucci and her real life husband, Vincent Cassel, is as realistic and honest as you will ever see. There is no need for added sentiment or melodrama... only truth. Their interaction is spectacular in these moments.'Irreversible' is a film about many things: The Relentlessness of Time; The Cruelty of Karma; The Inevitability of Destiny; The Natural Tendency of Revenge; The Randomness of Luck; The Sadness of Truth. I could go on and on. This film doesn't give us convention. It says that sometimes bad things happen to good people. It shows that fortune sometimes smiles on evil (Try to remember every face you see!). The movie doesn't perpetuate our need for fakery and fairytales. Bad things happen... but time will destroy that too.As the film tells us over and over... "Time destroys everything."Director Gaspar Noé and his cast have created a great film... one that should be seen by everyone, especially those that don't want to! This film has the ability to change you... and how many times can you say that about your typical fluffy Hollywood fairytale? This is a masterpiece!I am sure that this film has reserved a place in my Top Ten list for 2003.</fullReview>

But then you go home and in the subway you remember heroes discussing orgazm, then you are afraid of pedestrian subways - congratulations, mr. Noe, you did it!

		<fullReview>Irreversible is so far one of the best movies of the new century.A Clockwork Orange type film, but something else. It runs backwards like Memento, but instead of running into the next scene, it stops.The reason I drove more than 3-hours to see this movie, was because Newsweek called it "...the most walked out movie..." How could you not see it?I wanted to see what the fuss was about, and if you have seen anything about this movie, they would most likely include telling you about the 9-minute long rape scene, or the gruesome beating with a fire extingusher (which honestly, I found to be worse than anything found in "Saving Private Ryan"). At the end of the film, when everything ties together in a nice little bow, and you forget about the rape scene, and the ending of the film spins, you sit in the theater in awe, and think to yourself, "this was worth the drive."Not for children, but if you are a movie buff, and you are looking for an unforgettable movie, see this. It's a must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the most amazing film I have seen this year, watching Irreversible is often comparable to having your face worked on by an emotional jackhammer. The narrative of the film is backwards, sort of like Memento. This works out as a quite effective storytelling device, and, as the characters progress backwards through the story, it adds dimensions to them that would be impossible to explore through a conventional narrative. There is perhaps one of the most brutal rape scenes I have ever witnessed on film, and much violence. I have never seen so many people walk out of a movie theater as I did on the afternoon that I saw it. There was a mass exodus less than halfway through the movie. If you can stomach the brutality and sit through the film, then you are definitly rewarded by the film's higher state of consciousness. It transcends. Simple as that. It transcends all you know about revenge, love, time, etc. I would say it is more than just a film. There is not really a word for the experience it offers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>while my initial reaction to "irreversible" was horror and disgust, i have since begun to regard it as one of the best films i've ever seen. the acting is impeccable (especially considering that the majority of the dialogue was improvised by the actors), and the impression the film leaves you with is amazingly powerful. while the opening murder scene is the most gory and explicit i've ever seen, and the rape &amp; beating the most painful (due especially to it's length and incredible acting), gaspar noe's message was clearly portrayed in the images he showed. this was not a film showing the better sides of life, nor one that was going to dilute reality in order to keep more sensitive viewers happy - he showed life at its most painful, and the reactions every choice we make have. this said, i have to admit that in the week that has followed the film, i have been unable to get the painful images out of my head (affecting my sleep patterns, my ability to concentrate, my relationship with my boyfriend &amp; other males), and to viewers as sensitive/more so than i, this could be problematic. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM if you are unable to deal with explicit violence and rape, and go into it knowing that no matter how desensitised you are, you will leave feeling sickened and frightened. When i went to see this movie, over half the theatre walked out during the rape scene (several left earlier, during the murder). The first half of the film is intensely difficult, and very emotionally trying. Overall, this is a movie i reccomend - but hesitantly. for the overall impact and message, it is INCREDIBLE, but the violent images are so explicit that i wouldn't reccomend it to any except the strongest of viewers.</fullReview>

The performances are flawless and compelling, the story perfectly realized from an Aristotelian perspective of the unities of space/time, the cinematography excellent, and every detail enhanced to achieve the right tone/mood by a director that strives to deliver a true work of art. Rarely we get to watch and experience a film that challenges us to stay inside the theater in the hope we will be rewarded. Perhaps since Fassbinder.

		<fullReview>From the country of Jean Francois Lyotard comes this nasty little postmodern fairy tale about the human perception of time and random acts of violence (which as it turns out are not so random after all). Hindsight is 20/20; we all know this. It's quite another thing to be shown it in such a graphic manner. "Time destroys all things," Noe tells us. If you can make it to the end of this film, it's difficult not to agree. For creatures so perilously shortsighted as humans, a linear perception of reality can be a deadly thing indeed.It's impossible to describe this film or do it justice in print. Like any example of true cinema, it needs to be experienced directly. That said, this film is definitely *NOT* recommended if you are squeamish or easily outraged by the actions of make-believe people on a movie screen. It is *NOT* recommended if you must have characters who do not have deeply rooted and nonsensical prejudices or tendencies. It is *NOT* recommended unless you commit to watching the ENTIRE film, regardless of how repulsed you might be by what you see on screen.It *IS* recommended if you want an original, thoughtful, and ultimately well-made meditation on the human condition. Regardless of what its critics may think, _Irreversible_ is fine bit of fictional cinema. The sting of it is that perhaps it strikes a little too close to the horrors of our own lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mainstream Snuff Film - The Rotten.com Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film left me shaken and very confused. I work in the film business and after watching the film I was suddenly very worried about the direction of "entertainment" in general. I've seen violence in film before. This is different. Just because I'm deeply distressed by the intensity of the images, does it make this a "good" film? Will we be seeing more of this, simply because it's effective? (I suspect so - it's the modus operandi of visual media).Irreversible gives us the dubious opportunity to feel what it might be like to see a man murdered savagely and graphically in front of us. The atmosphere created just prior to this extreme moment is choreographed to be as unsettlingly realistic and unpredictable as possible. It's like watching a real moment, bled of any sense of artifice.Thanks to Jean-Christophe Spadaccini (who created the heads which are destroyed,) and to Mac Guff Ligne (the Paris based fx house which augmented the effects digitally) we are witness to all the horror that one might expect to see in a snuff film. Without the intensity of the violence, the film serves as a sophomoric, manipulative revenge drama. Sophmoric because, without time reversed, we have a film about a sexy girl with a complex life who we get to see graphically raped, and then follow the more dynamic storyline of the attempt by boyfriends to find and kill the rapist. Unlike Haenke's "Funny Games", there is no insight behind the audacity.The rape scene, the other aspect of this film's notoriety, is far less troubling than the earlier(subsequent) murder. There is no voyeurism at play here and there is thankfully (a little) more restraint in depiction. However, the fact that the film cares more about the interests of macho rage and its more aggressive possibilities than what women endure from rape is problematic. More so, since the beginning of the story (the end of the film) is all about her, at least as a visual/sexual archetype. It's seems like once she's battered to a pulp she's no longer visually useful to the real story.The philosophy behind it is troubling, too, for several reasons. Nietzsche has often been trotted out by intellectuals in France (particularly during the period that Mr. Noe was in high school). Morally untethered power as a challenge to established authority and as an effective social critique seems to underly his published justification for making this film.However, in real terms, Gaspar Noe is on record as wanting to make a Hollywood Porn Film - "Irreversible" is what he ended up making.No matter what he might think or say publicly, his real motives are clear. He's a vicious misanthrope who wants to urinate into the face of the audience. And he wants to be deeply admired for his audacity in doing so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreversible when you have those images in your head!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being dragged to watch "Seul Contre Tous" (Noe's previous film)by a friend one afternoon, I found myself disturbed and very angry after leaving the cinema. It was only 5'o clock but my head was really screwed up for the rest of the day. "Thank you very much Mr. Noe for showing me these darkest parts of a soul" I thought. "But why?" But I couldn't deny the intensity. The funny thing was that even though I wouldn't consider watching that film again, I couldn't stop thinking about it. So when I was told that "Irreversible" was showing the following week and that it would be even harder to watch...well I went anyway.But after seeing "Irreversible", though it still disturbed me, I started admiring Noe's approach to film, more than it's loud message(Violence is violent, rape is bad? Yes,I know!).The movie shows the events that follow a rape in chronological reverse time(like Memento). But why is that movie so disturbing? Of course showing a woman being raped and then brutally beaten is shocking enough, but having the camera view this scene for an unmercyful 10 minutes, actually makes us part of it without being able to do anything. Like in Michael Haneke's "Funny Games" we have to ask ourselves, why don't I just leave (Haneke said: "Whoever leaves doesn't need my movie!"). But compared to "Funny Games" where the actual act of violence isn't shown, only heard(which i'd consider nonetheless powerful), Gaspar Noe grabs us by the neck and pushes our faces right into it. Even if we don't want to. His approach is defenitely more hardcore and unmercyful. But it's actually working. It makes you much more angry (something i'd defenitely consider Mr. Noe to be). I think less than actually portraying a rape scene and the events that follow, Noe wanted to point the finger and show us, that a violent act can't be justified, but also that we all have the potential in us to act violent(that's why it's Pierre-the character it's most likely to relate to-, not Marcus, who kills the man in the beginning/end). SPOILER:I think everyone who's seen the film really wanted to see the Tenia(the rapist) get killed( I know we shouldn't think that way, but..). So realizing that he actually got away, while at the same time having to witness the rape scene (this is when the backwards telling of the story makes sense), knowing that the brutal(justified?) act at the start of the film happened to the wrong guy, really makes you feel helpless and angry. It's that feeling that combines both Noe's Films: "I'm really down and p***ed off, but what can I do to make it stop?". After the rape the film gets much softer, but the bad after taste is always present. When the film ends, the violent scenes are not as present anymore and you don't feel as disturbed as when walking out on "Seul Contre Tous", which has it's climax at the end, but nonetheless helpless and angry (but also relieved). I have to give respect to the actors for those long uncut scenes and realistic acting (especially Monica Bellucci) and to the director for the way it's filmed (yes we can barely see anything at the beginning, but it helps portray the confusion, anger and disgust of the main characters)and the setup of the immensely long scenes(genius). But there are things that could have been left out, without losing the intensity of the film, and just seem to make it more sickening and sensationalizing (why did he have to sodomize her??, why all those sexual acts in the background on the party or in the gay club??). If you want to break taboos do it so it makes sense! Especially since I consider sensationalist films like "Baise-Moi" a load of rubbish! Well at least it must have helped the film's mouth to mouth propaganda: Have you seen that film where....? It is defenitely not an amazing film( I now consider "Seul Contre Tous" the better one of the two), but a very, very powerful one! In my opinion, there are good films that are nice to watch (e.g. Amorres Perros), then there are films that provoke (e.g. Happines, Kids) and then there are films that are a real challenge (e.g. Funny Games, Gummo and Irreversible). The last section I'd consider: DEFENITELY NOT FOR EVERYONE! You don't have to like them, but you should defenitely not deny them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing about this film was the title sequence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What did this film gain from being backwards? Nothing! The entire plot was known after 20 minutes. What did this film gain from Gaspar Noé's crazy spinning floating camera and nauseating effects? Nothing! Maybe if the film had been done forwards, we would be able to understand why the "Rectum" scene is filmed in Blair Witch style, and we would not want to walk out of the cinema.The only thing this film has going for it is a variety of very strong scenes. The face-smashing scene, the rape scene, the party, the subway, and the bedroom scene were all riveting in very different ways. Unfortunately these great scenes were completely let down by the rest of the film, which is an ugly mess.SPOILER: bring a sick bag, this film has an interactive ending that'll bring out the epileptic hiding inside you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I have no objection to movies being extremely violent and/or sexual in nature, but there was absolutely nothing being said in this film to necessitate the circus of horrors on display. It's like the director thinks he's the first artist to notice that no matter how good your life is, it can always get bad, and that women get raped and it really sucks. You think? Genius! This movie is just further proof that you can make any old pish, and if you make it in french and move the camera about a lot, a bunch of pretentious critics will go on about how "Important" and "complex" it is. I read one reviewer saying that anyone who doesn't like it just doesn't understand it. Please. My dog could understand it. I had no trouble in working out what the film makers were saying. It's just that what they were saying was about as profound as an episode of Happy Days. This is just the worst kind of pornography. And believe me, I'm no Mary Whitehouse. Fight Club is one of my favourite films ever. Irreversible is Crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although Very Interesting, I Have One Major Gripe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoilers Within** Just some thoughts..... I saw this film mainly due to the hype surrounding it during the cannes film festival, and to see (once again) the pairing of Vincent Cassel and Monica Belluci. Following the recent trend of extreme french cinema. (Romance, Baise Moi etc.) Casper Noe's film centers around a husband's (Vincent Cassel) quest for revenge following the rape of his wife (Monica Belluci), the controversy of this film is centered around two scenes. 1.A man being murdered by having his head caved in with a fire extinguisher (Single shot - very graphic - you see the actual disintegration of his head as it is pummeled in repeatedly - blood added digitally) 2.A single shot rape scene, 8 minutes long. Although there is very little nudity and even a brief shot of a man's penis at the end of this scene was added digitally, it is still very disturbing, this is due to : i)The time frame (8 minutes) ii)The facial expressions iii)The constant sounds iv)The fact that a man walks in halfway through and abruptly leaves v)The sight of the rapist, savagely beating the woman into a coma after raping her These scenes are justifiable in the movie's context and the directors eye. What you are seeing is everyday evil, these are acts that are commited everyday and you get to see the motives, the consequences, and the whole unedited act, and these scenes are in direct contrast to the sweet natured romance scenes at the end of the film. There are good points to the film if you look at it through a critical perspective. The camera work and acting is exceptional, there is a high degree of invention, and a high degree of labour has gone into this film,the directors intention is clear throughout and his message is conveyed appropiately My main problem is this :The film's tagline is 'Time Destroys Everything 'which is a stark depressing prophetic statement of the horrors to come, but it is a lie, it is just the directors view that he has superimposed on the audience through the extreme graphic nature of these scenes.The world is a beautiful place and time is a great healer, to accept the statement that 'time destroys everything' is a self admission to depression and is to acknowledge the fact that love and trust is a banal concept. There is no redemption for the characters shown, not in violence,not through revenge,not through anything, and the irony is, is that the men seeking revenge kill the wrong man, the rapist walks free,the rapist looks on as Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel (in one of the most excrutiatingly graphic scenes ever commited to celluloid) murder the wrong man. My thought is this, watch, but don't take it to heart, it's only a film,the opinions shown are that of the director and just the director, and his opinions are worth absolutely nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, where to start?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is a tormenting and brutal reality with absolutely incredible directing, editing and camera-work. The film's events are played in reverse chronological order, with each "event" each being one single shot, strung together with a fluid and inventive, if dizzying motion, making the film a continuous stream of visual grunge. The violence in Irreversible is called by many "too extreme" or "unnecessary", but I believe that it is important that some films delve as deep as Irreversible does into the dark recesses of society, unexplored by "serious films"; Irreversible is certainly not a snuff film as many may say, like 'Cannibal Holocaust' or 'A Serbian Film'. This is especially the case as 'Irreversible' is in fact a very good film for those who can stomach it; featuring thematic insight and even haunting dissonance as a result of the reverse chronological order. This film does not promote rape or violence, the extremity of the depictions deplore rape and violence if anything, Irreverisible's greatest flaw would be that the signature scene is so well done and is so difficult to sit through that most people will only concentrate on that, and ignore the film as a whole. Also ironically, due to Irreversible's inventive and unconventional structure, repeated viewings would likely be rewarding, even though few would ever dare to do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will leave a lasting impression, whether you want it to or not. That is, if you can get through the shaky camera scenes at the beginning without getting a headache. However the way it is shot does a good job in throwing the viewer into the atmosphere of the film, leaving us disoriented in a sense. Rather than beating around the bush when it comes to a controversial subject such as rape, it forcefully makes you aware of just how brutal and traumatic it is. Some scenes are downright uncomfortable but at the same time, can only be described as real and not sugarcoated. It shows you how your life can be destroyed in the blink of an eye. It sticks with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreversible - A Relentless Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some spoilers I guess, but the reverse plot line makes it rather unspoilable imoHaving just seen this wonderful, challenging and inspiring film at a cinema as part of a season on controversial films, I feel compelled to defend and put forward the case for what has become my favourite film of all time.Firstly, from a purely technical standpoint, the film is an absolute triumph, objectively so. The design of the production is something that is often forgotten but Noe chooses his locations brilliantly and makes them complement his film in a way I have seen few directors manage to such an extent. By god does he film it well though! Some people see his camera work as gimmicky but its often beautiful, always challenging and a true landmark in modern cinematography. My favourite work comes toward the end of the film when the camera subtly follows the characters through the subway and the party in a way that adds to the naturalism and immediacy of the film in a way that I had never seen done before. The acting is also, without a doubt, some of the best I have ever seen. While it might seem cheap to cast real-life couple Cassel and Bellucci as the "romantic leads" this hasn't always worked and has certainly never produced anything so intimate, tragic and energetic as the performances in this film. Cassel is at his ferocious best, whilst Bellucci gives real credence with her entire body and soul to the most difficult scene for an actress in movie history. Mesmerizing stuff.The film is far more than just a technical delight, however. It remains an absolutely awe-inspiring emotional experience told primarily through our senses rather than our thoughts. The backwards structure makes the tragedy become overwhelming as the film reaches its climax and Noe, in the tradition of the greatest directors, suggests everything and nothing with his camera. A plot which is in reality, so simple (death wish meets memento) becomes something that has a message about the universe, existence and the passage of time. Its visual storytelling allows the viewer to decide for herself. Truly awe-inspiring cinema.I think people have often judged this film wrongly and I would disagree strongly with those who would call it misogynist or homophobic. The "misogyny" label is completely out of place on a film which treats rape in the way it really should be treated, a horrible, tragic and repellent act which is completely unjustified. Critics of the movie have said the rape scene's length adds viewer complicity, however I think it does the very opposite in that it presents horror as truly horrifying and in no way eroticised or glamorised, unlike other controversial films on rape such as Straw Dogs. The homophobia allegation certainly makes more sense but it is still from a misunderstanding of the film. Le Tenia is not gay nor does he represent gay people, he is merely a monster who cannot be explained by sexual orientation or any human discussion of the character. In a way he represents fate and inevitability more than anything else, his appearance in a gay club does not necessarily make him a gay man per se.Overall this film should be watched by all strong-hearted lovers of cinema.</fullReview>

Every single review has been on point with my on opinion about a film if it has a 5 its an o.k movie if its a 7 or higher i found it very enjoyable ... until this point. I can not disagree more with the overall score on this film. Just because it has a strong message DOESN'T MAKE IT A GOOD FILM ! almost like taking a black and white picture don't make you an artiest. After what felt like 15 minutes forwarding through the opening credits ans camera spinning( not giving to much away ) their was a man getting his face bashed-in which is the sole reason for the 3 star rating , not because of the gore but because it was real time hitting blows with amazing effects. Pass this point the movie gets bad and I MEAN REAL BAD. Scenes in this film get dragged on for WAAAAYYY to long 7 minutes of not saying anything relevant to the movie too several minutes of a person just brushing hair AND the WORST PART several minutes of flashing lights. After nearly catching a seizures the movie finally ended. Well now i know why they called it irreversible , because i can never un-see what has been seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are films out there that attempt notoriety with a big 'unrated' stamp on the front of the sleeve. There are films with infamous reps such as the 'Saw' and 'Hostel' franchise. There are critics who view these films of notorious infamy and rattle on about obscenity and controversy and all things nasty. When those films have had milk and cookies and gone out for some winks, Irriversable comes out to play. The difference between Irriversable and other theatrical films is quite simply that it has an utterly 'real' feel. As dizzying and mind bending as it is through Director Gasper Noe's miraculous camera work as it is, this feature length picture does not clean, polish, tweak or enhance. What we have, is a gritty, nasty, dark, sweaty, vile, and yet utterly authentic work of art. Lee Daniels 'Precious' taps into a similar aesthetic, not compromising or holding back, not shying away from what we all like to pretend does not exist. After the rape and beating of his woman - Belluci, Marcus- Cassell goes on the rampage. There is no over acting, suspension of disbelief or melodrama. The pulse is pounding as chaos and insanity rain down upon the viewer. The camera rotates and turns, sometimes mercifully blurring the screen, sometimes exposing closed door debauchery. I have seen few films out there that expose, but not exploit this level of violence and human madness. The first twenty minutes are grim and terrible, also nauseating and horrifying, yet they bear a significance that can only be realised as the film takes us back in time, quite literally as the story unfolds from end to beginning. In truth I cannot recommend Irriversable to anyone, as I would 'Precious' that uplifts in between grueling intervals of domestic abuse. One thing is certain and IMPORTANT. We all consider revenge and retribution in return for acts of disrespect, large and small and in our minds eye we act out these dark fantasies. Irriversable is here to tell us, and in fact show us just how acts of vengeance can tear the soul apart.Be warned. Unlike Kubric's masterful 'Clockwork' Orange that knows when to stop, or take us away from the 'ultra violence', Noe's 'Irriversable' keeps us there. In the dark red room where developing photographs appear before us in the liquid, shocking and terrible.. and keeps them in that water, taking them away only to give us the next one.One of the most important films in cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the film was made in chronological order I would have turned it off when the rape scene started getting long as a something beyond disturbing and why do I have to watch this crap. But the scenes are in reverse order and it's easy enough to figure this out after about twenty minutes. I don't know how I lasted the first twenty minutes of wild camera work and trashy sounds. I suppose we were curious what happens next. What happened next was gory violence beyond limit. Then the rape scene and I should have ended it there but at this point it was with an attitude of "what the hell, it's only a film". So we got to the beginning at the end and the only redeeming part of the film the beautiful Monica Bellucci. Would have turned it off if wasn't so upside down. Definitely not recommended. See the last fifteen minutes of the film or so if you must. Spare yourself the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trauma and healing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there were to be a single film determined as about as far from enjoyable as possible yet also profoundly important viewing, Gaspar Noé's Irreversible would end up a strong contender. Infamous for featuring two of the most harrowing and gruesome rape and murder scenes in cinema history as well as some nauseatingly stylized camera and sound work and a narrative told in reverse order through uncomfortably long takes, it is worth asserting off the bat that Noé's film is simply not one for viewers squeamish in any nature (Newsweek scathed that the film takes "adolescent pride in its own ugliness"). Conversely, for a film with so much extreme content, none of it is included for any reasons of gratuitous shock value, but rather for the sake of reinforcing its own crucially important themes in an extreme enough fashion as to render them unforgettable and thereby continually resonant, making Irreversible, in spite of its "ugliness", one of the most perversely beautiful films in recent history. The key is in the line which both opens and closes the film, "Time destroys everything", and the statement's inherent ambiguity. At first, followed by a brutal, unflinchingly graphic murder, a sickeningly swirling camera and a maddening consistent low thrum, the line suggests nihilistic, fatalistic disdain. However, it is in this fashion that Noé's genius in telling his story in reverse order becomes apparent, as, rather than building into a crescendo of abhorrent content, Noé works backwards to make sense of the outcomes of his film through examining what transpired before them. As the film progresses past the infamous rape scene, the stylistics become steadily calmer, the content progressively more palatable, until finally closing on a note of such serene yet bittersweet grace that "Time destroys everything" has come to take on an entirely different meaning. Noé utilizes the cinematic form to not only allow the viewer a chance to trace the roots of the tragedy but to effectively "undo" the trauma, suggesting a spiritual healing and 'destruction' of the trauma ? a bold and masterful approach.Nonetheless, Noé does not utilize such an approach to devalue or dismiss Irreversible's traumatic 'beginning/end' as the film grows steadily less unpleasant, planting pointed reminders throughout to assure that, while suggesting that the results of such atrocities can be overcome, they should never be forgotten or ignored. In particular, the narrative draws emotional blood through a climactic quasi-twist that, in light of the events of before/after, is simultaneously joyful and heartrending. In spite of this, the viewer still leaves the film shaken but ultimately filled with cautious optimism, elation at having 'survived' and a poignant perspective on trauma and linear time ? no small feat indeed. Being caught in such a difficult film through extensive, unbroken takes could have felt gimmicky, yet Noé's performers keep the film appropriately claustrophobic without entirely alienating. Vincent Cassel delivers a masterfully manic performance, transitioning from devastation and rage to narcotic-addled insanity to heartwarming humanity without ever losing track of his character, stressing the sympathetic humanity of a questionable man subjected to unbearable circumstances throughout. Monica Belucci demonstrates unbelievable courage as well as crushing credibility through her challenging role, yet crucially also building to warmth and serenity. Finally, Albert Dupontel underplays to perfection as the ambiguous, emotionally stunted friend of the couple who undergoes a profound personal revelation. Seldom do the words 'sickening' and 'beauty' function so suitably in tandem, but Irreversible accomplishes such a fusion ? a film that unflinchingly explores the disturbing underbelly of the human condition yet also makes sense of it and suggests the possibility of overcoming it. Beyond a powerful anti-rape film, Noé's work proves challenging and essential viewing for all those capable of stomaching it. -9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soulless and pointless cinematic experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that it is a faux-pas to ask an artist to justify or explain his works, but I think this one makes you wonder if maybe Gaspar Noe doesn't have some explaining to do.The events shown in the movie as such are not over the top.Rape does happen,retaliation does happen,lunacy does happen,extreme cruelty and urban filth sceneries like in the movie do exist.Nothing wrong with that.Comparisons with other cringe-inducing movies are inevitable,Straw Dogs,Deliverence,Cruising come to mind.However,none of those were...well...so damn "artsy".Those movies and others like it had a human and real vibe to them, regardless how twisted they were.In this one, you get the feeling that you're dealing with a humorless Quentin Tarantino. You realize that you're dealing with a twisted artistic experiment, but to what purpose ? To gross you out ? Check. To induce nausea ? Check. To feel horror ? Check. Well, I could achieve all that by smashing my face against a wall and then look in the mirror.Judging by the amount of gore in the movie, you may ask yourself if maybe this isn't Gaspar Noe's way to let us experience his fictional self-mutilation. Leaving one scene in the middle of the movie and the very last one aside, there is non-stop violence that would probably be more appropriate for a snuff movie. What the hell is the point of scenes where a man's face and skull are crushed like a melon with a fire hydrant or one of an extremely long depiction of a brutal rape and beating ? Where is the point ? If I'm going to stand being grossed out by a movie, I want a reason. I want to know where the director's feelings are. Irreversible doesn't seem to shed light on any of that, it just purposely shocks you. The reverse chronological order, the sound effects and the hand-held camera stuff may be interesting but so are my hangovers in the morning. In the end (actually the beginning), you find out that all was great and all is lost now. Not really a discovery and not really food for thought, not to mention feeling kinda numb.In conclusion, this may be a unique and interesting line in Gaspar Noe's, Cassel's and Belucci's resume, but so is a certain underpaid and back-breaking employment in mine. I'd rather deal with my own demons rather than some artist's experimental gore and fetish, if that's all there is to it.And as far as I'm concerned, it is just that. Unless of course you're pervert enough to want to watch Monica Belucci being raped for 11 minutes, which, when I come to think of it, may have purposely been just the right thing to promote this pretentious and artsy flick.</fullReview>

Seriously, I can understand why there was a rape scene in the first place, but why does it have to carry on seemingly forever? This is an unpleasant well made film. The director and all the people who have commented (50 pages full for a film most movie goers have never heard of.....) can preach all they want about art etc, but this film has gotten so many replies on IMDb because it has a horrific (if not always seen) unending rape scene.Some of the people here disgust me.</fullReview>

That statement has been misused time and time again and although I kept my-self aware for the trip , Irreversble was a movie that took me on a ride and forced me to watch it in a helpless manner. From the start this movie had only one objective in mind and that was to confuse the person who was watching it, its use of camera angles, the way it was shot , it only had one goal in mind and that was to daze and confuse. This movie plays you out like a piano and one just sits there helpless watching. People tend to go on about the violence and one very extremely disturbing scene in it but this to make is a vision of the world and society that we live in. Now although the way it has been shot may be a bit gimmicky , it works well with seconds of intervals for you take on everything on board . The only thing that stops Irresversble from going the whole way is that the script might be a little dull but that it saved by a great performance by Vincent Cassell and a truly magnificent performance by Monica Bellicui , it truly is like watching husband and wife on screen , the violence that might seem over the top to some people and thusly this movie I WILL SAY IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! However to conclude Irreversvle is a more like a study of the 2 most basic of human emotions brought to you in their true ugly shape and form , by the end of the movie it will leave you calm but nothing short of dazed and confused as it will have to settle in to you. For those who seek enlightenment in the further realms of experience away from the some what bloated Hollywood.IRREVERSBLE - 8.6 OUT OF 10TIME DESTROYS EVERY THING ....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreversible = Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 45 minutes of this film were a movie trip unlike anything I think I've ever witnessed before. It was such a relentless whirl of darkness and rage conveyed superbly by Noe. The no holes barred approach needed for films like this was employed, no half measures can be taken in a film like this and I applaud everyone involved for it's gritty realism. The sound effects and nightmarish camera spinning really make this first part special.It's by far the best I've seen Cassell, he was made to play this angry, vengeful, if slightly unlikeable character of Marcus. I feel the fact that he plays a fairly unlikeable guy works, as you can't help but brush it aside in sympathy for the guy. A goody goody character wouldn't have been as effective if you know what I mean.Because I knew of THAT scene in the film (which I'm sure everyone knows about before they watch it) and due to the structure of the film and the first scene in "The Rectum", I was not looking forward to it one bit. When Alex left the club and was told to take the subway my heart was going like the clappers.I was brought down with a sickening bump with what followed.Perhaps the second half of the film will not everyone's cup of tea. After all, this is traditionally what should be in the first half, and some may think "I know what's going to happen, this is irrelevant". I think it's very clever indeed and what sets it apart from the similarly structured 'Memento'. To go through all the character introduction knowing and more importantly having seen what 'fate' is going to be handed to them is heart breaking and adds an extra dimension compared to if the film was put chronologically. I'm also glad that Noe used a fairly traditional directorial style for this part. It contrasted from the nightmare we know is ahead and really makes the characters more real.Put simply, Irreversible is Incredible. A masterpiece and the favourite film I've seen this year</fullReview>

Yes, every technical aspect about this movie is really good, particularly the seamless editing during the (unfortunately) limited conversational segments.So I don't think it constitutes a spoiler to reveal that this movie has two of the most grisly, violent acts committed to the DV it was shot on. At least the grotesqueness of one is removed since it's been made public that a dummy was being hit with a fire extinguisher, but the other is just vicious and cruel. To whom is this movie making a statement to? Like Michael Haneke, Gaspar Noe feels his film isn't to entertain but to make the audience guinea pigs to his sick experiment on what we view as entertainment. Most people who see this movie already know rape is wrong and most don't delight in it when it's in other movies. So again, my question is, what's the point of this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, has anyone seen "the toxic avenger"? I mean the first one (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090190/). Has the "postmodern avant-garde" director from Argentina ever seen it? Or seen it but won't tell? Well...there is one iota of residual value...the spinning camera angles, which remind me of psychedelic, surreal experiences in strip clubs or discos; i guess he wants us to "see" as if we were the character going through the motions. I understand he wants to show the unbridled quest for revenge of two amateurs; "revenge is a dish best served cold", so the two amateurs basically quantum leap in the blind and miss the hit...the gay club scene is (hear me) R I D I C U L O U S, not because of the graphic content, but because any moron in Tromaville (see the Toxic Avenger) would know that one ought NOT to enter the "love nest" (ehm...) of a rapist sociopath he wants to kill shouting to everyone he's looking for him, especially when doesn't even know what the sociopath looks like. Ah, and when you are not Hulk Hogan you don't go around in such a nasty place slapping bare-butted men around to advertise your presence. The head smashed is a very bland and amateurish scene: in the toxic avenger they squeeze WITH A CAR the head of a boy, whom had previously been savagely run over. Oh, and when the forehead is smashed into pulp, the mouth still moves... The gay club fight is middle school grade. Honestly, does ANYONE (except postmodern directors from Argentina ) think ANYONE expects to settle the rape of his woman IN ONE NIGHT AND WITHOUT ADEQUATE PREPARATION? Come on...No Charles Bronson there. There is one iota of residual aesthetic (=purely formal) value in the rape scene. Forget skin &amp; sex ( you get MUUUCH better stuff and more skin over the net for free ), but i see the inner city upper middle class cutie who- mistakenly, inadvertently, innocently - "goes under" (the underpass being a metaphor ), where conventions she is used to no longer hold valid. The sodomy choice adding to the disrespect for the "spoiled brat". But it takes too long to unfold...i've seen more violent and graphic rapes in 1970s Italian police movies, so no news there. Ah, and you do not let your beauty pageant woman scantily dressed walk home alone...and a scantily clad woman alone takes no underpass...her man calls a cab for her, and sees her in...or she does. So what do you expect...i see errors leading nowhere but hell.So a movie i wouldn't bother with, despite the toxic avenger is a cult for me, and Pialat's movies, and 1950s movies...but this is tripe with only residual value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most shocking scene ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone doubts the rumors about this film all it takes is one watching to know that you must believe the hype. This film is brutal, perverted, and even sadistically pornographic yet I can't look away. It is home to the most shocking, mind altering violence ever displayed on film. I have never had to actually stop a movie to calm down after watching a scene, but this movie's "fire extinguisher" scene forced me to. I find myself watching it again and again. The damage that this film does to you psychologically is certainly irreversible. Overall a good film, but undeniably excruciating to watch. I have scene some horrific films in my time, but nothing I have ever seen stands up to Irreversible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally heartbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked the spoiler box just to be safe, but I will not venture too far from the film's opening chapter in this review. The ideal way to see this film, for the first time, would be to have no knowledge of its story (which is simplistic, but effective). First, this film regresses; that is, the story unfolds in reverse chronology, but do not confuse the narrative structure with "Memento." The film begins (ends?) with a scene involving the butcher from "I Stand Alone," (Philippe Nahon) but soon moves to a Paris gay bar called "Rectum." Two men search the club for a man known only as 'Le Tenia,' the tapeworm. After the tapeworm is discovered, (perhaps)one of the most uncompromisingly brutal scenes in cinema follows. Viewers with no prior knowledge of the film's story have little context in which to place, justify, or condemn the scene they have just witnessed. Noe's decision to present the film in reverse chronological order serves a higher purpose than the obvious irony the title suggests; it is not merely a gimmick, but a technique that forces viewers to hang-on and discover why the two men do what they do at "Rectum," and also questions free will, fate/destiny on a deeper level. Technically, this film amazed me. The camera is not a voyeur, or even a fly-on-the-wall; but, more accurately, an objective correlative demonstrating the inner turmoil of the characters through its outward movement and perspective. The editor achieves the highest purpose of editing: viewers are not aware of edits (cuts) in scenes, where the narrative may become compromised; the finished product seamlessly assembles a story that is presented backwards, yet maintains technical continuity. The SFX are too awe-inspiring to go into detail about in this review. The opening chapter (about 15 mins. in) demonstrates a coming together of CGI, live action, latex prop dummy, matte painting, lighting and editing in unison, leaving the viewer oblivious to any artifice. "Irreversible" is not an easy film to watch, but difficult not to appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to sit through... for several reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From when I first heard of it, this sounded like a controversial and worthwhile film(it should be noted that the two are seldom one and the same; some works feature both qualities, but one should have more of a reason to see any given film or read any book than simply the fact that many found it to be controversial)... and the idea of playing with time has always intrigued me; it's one part of the freedom of film-making that too many ignore and deny the power of. Tarantino understands. So does Nolan. And as is undeniably evident herein, Noé does, as well. I haven't seen any of his other works, but the two films about The Butcher sound interesting, and I certainly intend to look for(and look twice at) anything with his name on it. The plot is simple enough... in essence, it could be summed up within a sentence or two. What is fascinating here is how it's told... the reverse order puts an unusual spin on the typical revenge-tale. With the vengeance being one of the first things seen and the story moving backwards from there, the ending has an ironic tone to it. The film opens to end credits... rolling backwards. The first visual we see is a naked man(though it should be mentioned that there are parts of him that are not visible), and the first line spoken is "Time destroys everything". This sets the tone perfectly; the glum, dark atmosphere, the bleak visuals, the seedy locations... only at the very end are we treated to bright, happy, beautiful colors. But by then, we almost can't enjoy it... we've seen the cruelty of the world, witnessed repulsive acts and experienced terror first-hand. In the end, one faces the ultimate truth... you don't know what you've got until it's gone. The acting, editing and character writing(as far as that can go, from just a synopsis) are all top-notch. It should be noted that most of the scenes are several minutes long... with only one camera angle, and no cuts. This, coupled with most of the acting being improvised, creates some of the most natural and *real* performances and scenes ever seen. The cinematography bothered me early on... for the first third of the film or so, it's just frantic beyond reason or belief. Seriously. You have to see it to believe it. With the subtitles on, it was also really hard to tell who were saying what in those scenes. The film contains some seriously disturbing sights... and it dwells on them. There are no quick images of something unsettling; instead, the camera finds itself a fixed position to view the unpleasantness and remains there for the duration of it. The two (in)famous scenes(I see little reason to name them here, as they have been mentioned countless times before, in relation to the film) are indeed very strong(I doubt anyone can claim them to be anything less than disgusting and disturbing in the extreme) and should *not* be viewed by anyone who thinks there is even a slight chance they may find it to be too much. It takes a lot to bother me, it takes a *lot* to shock me... but this film crossed that line, did so happily and did it several times in quick succession. Finally, I advise anyone to not eat anything for the first half hour of the film(for the reason why, read the trivia page); I, myself, did, and, well... nothing happened, but it wasn't a good idea. I urge anyone who believes they have the stomach for this film(and feel inclined to watch it, too) to just make the most of the shaky(literally) cinematography of that first bit and hold out, because after that, it gets good... really, really good, and getting to that is more than worth the wait. I recommend this to anyone who can take it and who find the subject and style interesting. I suggest you make sure that you find yourself in both groups before watching... otherwise, I would imagine, the film may be too strong for you. Difficult to sit through, but if you make it, it's worth it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable motion picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible Perhaps, one of the difficult films I've ever sit through in my experiences. When I saw it for first time, I thought it was one of the most revolting films I've ever sit through but it left me with many questions. I thought about it for several days afterwards and I couldn't come to conclusion if I really like it or not. It is not fun and entertaining film, but rather it shows what human beings can be capable of, which is very ugly. My opinion on this film hasn't established yet, which is unusual because I could easily form an opinion on any films I saw but not this one.Personally, I find first half hard to sit through because of cinematography and sound effects and second half is very tolerable for me because it develops the characters, which we already know their fates. I think it makes it very tragedy because we already know their fates, yet we care about them. It's amazing film-making and it's unusual to see film on this topic starts backwards with very minimal cuts. When I saw it for first time, the camera couldn't stop flying around in all directions and I felt like I want to puke but I managed to hang in there, despite the sound effects and brain buster cinematography.I revisited it again after my friend had purchased it and to my surprising, I find it very tolerable on second viewing, even if it's still hard film for me to watch. It's not easy film for casual moviegoers and that's why it prompted lot of walk outs when it premiered for first time. It's ugly and realistic, which is something that no casual moviegoer would like to watch in their films. It's very unpleasant and right in your face, which is very brutal.On second viewing, I was bit surprised that the director never took sides in this one. He just show everything in objectively way, which makes it very horrifying. I don't know if it's amazing film-making but it's certainly brutal motion picture to sit through. I kept want to screaming throughout this film but I restrained myself from doing so from risking of appearing looks like fool.Monica Bellucci, what an amazing performance! She gave one of the most amazing performances I've ever seen and one of the possibly most demanding performances I've ever seen. One must applaud her for taking such risky project like this one and clearly, it paid off. I cannot think of any big named actresses would accept the project like this one because it's hard enough to put yourself through such brutal and messed up situation like that.I don't know if backward format work for this film but it certainly provoked such strong reaction from me, which is very seldom these days whenever I watch the film. You have to ask yourself many questions throughout the film, but it's not very easy to do so because it's just hard film to sit through. I find myself flinching numerous of times, even if second half is somewhat tolerable.It's solid art house film that should be only seen by mature viewers because casual moviegoers wouldn't able to tolerate this type of cinema. What a piece strong piece of cinema it is and it's solid film with lot of great performances from the cast. Not sure if I would recommend this one offhand to anyone I know. But very unforgettable motion picture it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>emotionally draining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time destroys everything. The philosophy of Irreversible is time has written our future, that everything is set and can't be changed. Three people in one night meet their fate and what time has set for them. In the vein of Momento, Irreversible is told all in reverse, starting at the end and working back to the start. Two men talk about how time is destructive and our fate is set, then we are shot down to a underground gay club called the Rectum, where Pierre and Marcus are looking for a man called Tenia. The camera is all over the place, you cant make out the surroundings; the club is very darkly lit. Marcus is out for blood and isn't thinking straight, fighting a man who then violently breaks his arm. The man is then violently bludgeon to death by Pierre with a fire extinguisher. As we keep going back in time, Pierre's ex-wife and Marcus's current girlfriend Alex was attacked; raped and beaten into a coma by the man Tenia.Gaspar Noé's Irreversible is a dark, grotesquely violent look at fate that crushes you with heavy emotional impact. The crusade Marcus and Pierre go on is so full of hate and malice that its hard to cheer for them, especially on how it ends, though there is understanding behind them. The rape in question is the most grueling and emotionally draining sequence in a film. Lasting for about nine minutes, its a difficult watch. When the mans means behind the rape are revealed, it does hold true to all rapes; it is that emotion of superiority and degradation. When we reach the end, or beginning, it makes what went by even more unnerving, with a 'joyous' twist.Gaspar Noé's direction is a high light of Irreversible. The erratic camera work at the beginning reflects the situation perfectly, with Marcus and Pierre spiraling into hell in the club. When the camera is more restrained, it brings the love story between the three people to the fore front. The three leads all bring great performance. Vincent Cassel is emotionally charged as Marcus on a mission. Albert Dupontel as Pierre is the antithesis of Marcus, the more rational side. Monica Bellucci is wonderful as Alex, being stuck in the middle of these two men. She brought such beauty to Alex, that its so hard to watch the rape for it.Irreversible may not be for everyone, but it does deserve your attention. On the surface there is a lot of brutality and violence, but once you dig beneath it there is a truthful and honest love story between three people. You wont be as emotionally changed by any other movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of the comfort zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As any film moving the viewer from their comfort zone, irreversible draws considerable fire. If I have any complaint with the film's technique, on occasion it is a little too self-conscious. But for the movie itself, many of those disapproving must have no understanding of the street, or what it can produce; and for that matter, of people in general. Of course, it could be they desire no real understanding, and have no wish to be reminded all our little decisions in life are irreversible and consequential. You took a left turn instead of a right at the intersection, and there was that semi that smashed your skull. Had Alex left the party a minute off in either direction, she would never have had the encounter in the tunnel. I think what may disturb many folks about this film is the graphic detonation of one's presumption of control. It is Pieere after all, the most controlled of the characters (delineated by his sexual difficulty with Alex), who ultimately is the most out-of-control, and perhaps the scariest, person in the movie. Those reviewers off-handedly insulting the intelligence of people appreciating this film need to be informed words of that nature may lead to "Irreversible" consequences, uttered on the street. And so, possibly, illuminate their discomfort at being so reminded by Gaspar Noe ...(For an excellent critique of Noe's films and the "Cinema of Attractions", go to: http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/03/noe.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen, in its brutal depiction of evil. Beneath the endless violence and rape, there is actually a strong anti-violence message; you just have to have a strong enough stomach to sit the whole way through it and try to understand it. Despite what many of its critics say, the violence is not gratuitous or pornographic. Why is it that when a filmmaker shows the hard reality of what violence really is, they are demonized, but when brainless PG-13 action movies dumb it down to make it look "cool", nobody has any problem with it? Irreversible is simply showing violence that happens every day, and the lives it destroys. It is something that hardly anybody wants to think about, but it's something this film makes us think about strongly. This film is hard to forget, and if you have a strong stomach and an open mind, I give it my highest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets in your head and stays there......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything you've read about "Irreversible" is true. This is a shocker of a movie. It's also a fantastic piece of work that dares you to ignore it once the credits have finished rolling.This movie blew me away. Yes, the imagery can be a bit much; which is mostly due to the fact that during it's most disturbing scenes- director Gasper Noe does not take the camera off the victims for one single second! Watching somebody get their head violently smashed in or watching Alex (Monica Bellucci ) get raped from beginning to horrific end can be hard to stomach for most viewers, which is exactly why Gasper does not cut corners in his depiction of the brutality of murder and rape.This movie is about as close as you could (or would want to ) get to actually witnessing a real-life murder or rape without physically being there. Although, when watching "Irreversible" you cant help but feel as though you ARE there....and as the movie continues to play out you will no doubt sympathize with Marcus's (Vincent Cassel) anger, Pierre's (Albert Dupontel) sensibility, fear, and rage; and Alex's ultimate violation."Irreversible" is a mesmorizing and unforgettable trip into the depravity of a sick world. It's also a beautifully fleshed out character drama that unwinds nicely as the film plays itself out in reverse. In short, I loved this movie, and recommended it highly to only the most mature and intelligent audiences."Irreversible" becomes such a personal experience for the viewer, that watching it alone is best recommended for a first time viewing. I wouldn't recommend this movie to be watched with most friends and family- but a solo viewing will no doubt leave a lasting unforgettable/irreversible impression! Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting cinematic experience, graphic offensive scenes notwithstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Time destroys all things", we're told at the end of the movie, or the beginning of the story.Technically, Irreversible is not as clever as Memento. Its backward narration is quite straightforward, in twelve distinct "chapters", all shot in single takes, that are quite easy to follow once you catch on with the idea. But reversal narration should not be done just for the sake of doing something clever. There should be a purpose. In "5x2", for example, it shows how a normal romance ends up in a failed marriage.In Irreversible, the cause and effect is much simpler, in fact random. What we experience is raw emotion rather than detached reasoning. As each chapter unfolds backwards, we understand a little more about the ultra violence seen in the beginning of the movie. The audience's warped emotions were untwisted, as they realise that things are not (or need not be) as perverse as it might appear, until at the end, it could simply be the start of a gentle, ordinary love story. Had it been presented in the normal, chronological order, the movie would have lost most of its impact. With the beautiful, idyllic opening (i.e. ending) scene, the four words "time destroys all things" really hit home as the audience is left with a sense of frustration with the cruel randomness of life.Now 3 years after its first release, some of the controversial, shocking graphic aspects of this film have been digested by the general public. Still, to many, this movie would require pretty strong nerves to watch. In my own case, there was a moment that I might have "walked out" (i.e. stopping the DVD machine), even before it got to scenes considered unacceptably offensive by many. It's just that the "looking for Le Tenia" segment that got to be so long that I though I'd rather be waiting for Godot. Glad that I stay on with the movie, or I would have missed a very interesting cinematic experience, graphic offensive scenes notwithstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If we only new what lies around the corner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About half way through this film we are made to watch the most loathsome scene imaginable, lasting about nine gruesome minutes, during which the lovely female lead of the film played by Monica Bellucci is raped and then has her lovely face savagely smashed by the rapist's boot, his fists and the concrete pavement. When her boyfriend sees the red pulp that her lovely face has become he is convulsed with anger and goes on the rampage to wreak vengeance on the animal who has done this. And when he finds him he behaves like an animal himself and smashes the rapist face in with a fire extinguisher. And can we really blame him?The film is shot in reverse, so we are then taken back to before any of this happened, to a time when she was happy and looking forward to a bright future. The last shot of the film shows her on a bright, sunny summers day lying on the grass in the park reading a book in perfect contentment, quite unaware what the future holds in store for her, and surrounded by a group of happy children playing at dodge the grass sprinkler to the music of the last movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.It's painful to see any kind of beauty destroyed, but when it's the fragile beauty of a lovely young woman, it becomes almost unbearable. Having her face defaced must be a woman's worst fear, though in the course of time all beauty is destroyed, in the course of time her beauty would have been lost to wrinkles and sagging flesh. But to have it destroyed with such brute force and so senselessly is what made the scene so horrific. And all because the thug hated her for being rich!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never purchase a video unless it's recommended to me by people I trust. That way, I'm absolutely sure I'm going to view it at least twice. However, I bought this movie without hesitation because all the awards the packaging flaunted. Well... that'll learn me. ;o) I can't say the technique (movie going backwards in time) was so original because we saw it in Memento. Who knows, it was probably done before that as well. What I can say for sure is that it was way too violent. It does hit you like a tone of bricks. If you want to be shocked, this is your movie. Speaking for myself only, I don't mind being shocked as long as the movie has a purpose. Apparently, the director's purpose was to show that "rape" is a horrible thing. Well, I already knew that. I didn't need such a long and brutally graphic scene to tell me that. I had to fast forward through that scene since I developed a headache halfway through it. Pros: I do believe the way the camera flips around giving you the sense of a chaotic state of mind was very effective. If that was original, then it was a brilliant technique. The lighting, camera angles and editing were superb.Cons: The gratuitous violence ruined it for me. It was hard to relate to the characters. Nothing original about it as far as I'm concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've decided that my reviews should range somewhere between 500 and 1000 words from now on. Maybe more, but certainly no less. The only issue is that I now have a movie to review that causes such anger and disgust in me that I can't even bring myself to begin justifying it by describing the plot and discussing the acting. I just want to tell you that I hate it.Irreversible is a film that exploits irrational anger and fear to try and stir it's viewers' emotions. By showing the downfall of two men and a woman from good people to soulless monsters and a victim, Irreversible tries to show how a beast lives in each of us. By telling this story backwards, writer/director Gaspar Noe thinks he makes the film artsy and provocative. It's really just confusing, infuriating, and pointless.And there I go, delving deeper than I want to. This film doesn't deserve an intelligent review. It deserves to be launched to the center of the sun, and quickly forgotten. The same should happen to Gaspar Noe, for only a perverted and twisted mind could invent such a disgusting pile of filth, and we don't need people like that here on Earth. We're fighting to get rid of them every day at home and abroad. Forget about bombing Iraq, we need to invade France and take out Noe."Irreversible" is a homophobe's delight of a movie. Basically it suggests that gays will rape our women and, therefore, we must kill them. Of course, since the movie is backwards, we don't learn of this so-called "justification" until after we've watched a man be brutally beaten about the head until his skull liquefies. At the end of the day, it makes no sense, and should get the perpetrators executed. Rape is not a justification for murder. It justifies jail time and psychotherapy. But this man has no brain left to have analyzed. And that's perfectly OK with Gaspar Noe.Well screw him.I hate Gaspar Noe. I hate his film. I hate the people who acted in it. I hate that some people are calling this a masterpiece or a work of art. Even I can take a dump and call it art. Irreversible is the cinematic equivalent of that.That right there is 381 words. I still have at least 119 to go. Let's see...If you want to watch a skull-rape of a movie that will leave you 50 IQ points dumber, than watch this film.If you have an irrational fear of gays, than this is right up your alley.If you prefer a film that makes sense, isn't hateful, and doesn't pose as something it isn't (I.E. art) than you can join me in watching, oh, anything else.This review is not informative, I know. But the best information I can give you is this: stay away from "Irreversible". Stay away from any other movie this one touches on the store shelf, for it may well have infected them. Do not think about this movie. Do not breathe on this movie. Do not even look at it from across the room. Don't even touch it with a thirty-nine-and-one-half pole. Go punch yourself in the face. You'll learn more from that, and it's way more fun than watching "Irrversible".That's 560 words. 560 more than it deserves, and 560 words I'll never get back. But at least someone will learn to avoid this film by reading those words. That makes it alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have also seen this particular movie and nearly turned it off after watching the first five or ten minutes. There is a great deal of camera spinning and red light flashes, with a constant, pulsating noise in the background enough to make you want to switch off. However i carried on, and realized that genius film making was about to take place. Camera shots begin to emerge as clever 'confused' and scatty, broadcasting the obvious confusion felt by the characters that have just experienced something hideous. The film does shock you quite early on - but i found myself willing 'Pierre' on to do what he did. As the film goes on you discover why the two main male characters did what they did at the beginning, and it goes from a fast paced, hectic and confused vision pf a film to a slower paced, more romantic and calmer film. Revenge for love lost here i'm afraid. Good overall if you can stand the first twenty minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shocking stuff!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen this Gaspar Noe's movie and I must say: Shocking stuff! But i have to say that shocking isn't always good. What i really meant is that in unbelievable in some way. Let's see: most actors performance are quite perfect, from the brilliant innocence of Bellucci, till the furious anger of Cassel, all is perfectly believable. To say that THE SCENE (the capital letter is on purpose) of the rape is almost real is to enter in a common place. There's no place for a metaphor in the entire movie. And the story, quite short and simple, i must say, is, although, interesting and fluid. And that's it... there's nothing else to applaud in the movie but that and the fact that Monica Bellucci is naked a really long time. I think you will agree with me if I say that, in spite of being an outstanding show, someone so beautiful or more, nude in a movie does not make it great.So, where are the problems of 'Irreversible'? To start, the way to present the scenes, backwards, isn't original anymore since 'Memento' did the same. It has the same objective, and, I admit it, it doesn't fail (if the story were told normally, the movie would be pure crap), but it seems to be a stolen idea. It is also really bad (but I must say that if what I said previously wasn't original, this was something I've never seen in my whole life) the way Noe moves the camera in unstopping circles in the first half hour. I saw the film at home, in a poor screen and I felt sick (as if I were about to throw up), so I can't imagine what would have happened if I had seen it at the cinema. I could not help myself feeling sorry for the director... The grossness of most scenes only show the quality of his sickness, and the way he present several facts just made me think that he didn't want us to like his movie.It was shocking, it was disturbing, it was original (in some way)... it was also poor, short but not always interesting, uselessly demonstrative and almost offensive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god, just watched Irreversible for the first time in 2 years. This is what modern film making is all about. It's very rare these days that a movie actually touches something deep inside and make me feel a raw emotion. This is whatIrreversible does. It makes feel a raw emotion that very few films have everdone. You feel anger, complete repulsion, nausia, disgust and finallyhappiness. The master stroke with this film is when you feel the happiness at the end but you know whats in store then it quickly turns back in to anger. Vincent Cassel is absolutely amazing in this. His raw emotion and anger just spills out. He can be terrible (Blueberry, Hotel Paradiso) but here his performance fromthe very first time we see him livid and uncontrollable then arrogant and cocky at the party and contented and happy (unsurprisingly with Monica Belluci in bed). His performance is edgy and unforgettable,Even the most unwatchablemoments of this film need to be watched to feel the full emotion of what thecharacter goes through. Please see this movie, if you're left with a feeling of anger, then great! I think the film makers truly achieved their goal!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What "Irréversible" penetrates..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: Spoilers.While many people focused on whether or not this film has made a landmark in cinematic culture, I believe it breaches a mark in acting. Bellucci's character has possibly the most difficult part; bearing the horror of rape. Though the scene is nearly impossible to watch, her acting was so conceivable, I felt as though I was watching an actual victim.This is not to say that the director is heroic for his portrayal, but that if anything, this is a landmark in acting. Cassel was authentic as well, and I believed his anger, and felt his revenge to the rapist. Near the beginning, Cassel and another character search for the rapist, and when found, his face is bashed to the point of no recognition, with a fire extinguisher. The scene is also unbearable to watch, but done so effectively, that I felt every bash to the man's face.The film's photography, and lighting was amazing, though nauseous at times. Sometimes I feel that directors try to be "controversial," and forget about the art, and focus on what can put them in the media. I tended to feel that this movie was made graphic, solely for the purpose of controversy, but overall, the artistic view, was innovative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tremendous shock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gosh... Where to start?First of all, there probably will be spoilers in this comment (I don't dare call it a review), so if you haven't seen the movie and intend to, you should probably look away. Or maybe not, if your intent is to prepare yourself to watch it.I came to Irreversible rather by chance, hearsay, and curiosity, rather than being attracted to either its plot, actors, or director in the first place. I hadn't (still haven't) seen Gaspar Noe's previous effort, I Stand Alone, so I was totally estranged from his universe. Not anymore. The clichéd comments I'd heard about Irreversible depicted it rather like a gratuitous, vulgar French nouvelle-nouvelle vague provocation a la Baise-Moi than anything else (mostly from people that either hadn't seen it, or left the theatre early in the movie/stopped the DVD - which can be understandable in itself. More about that later...). These comments are so far from the truth it's laughable, and do miss the point completely.If you're reading this, then you've probably read most of the other comments so I won't offer any synopsis, you know what it's about in terms of storyline. However, mark my words, NOTHING can prepare you for this emotional devastation that is Irreversible. It's the very first time that a movie really doesn't present itself in terms of "I like it", "I don't like it", or any expected logical conclusion we usually draw when the curtain closes. I still don't know if I like it or not. The point is moot, anyway, at least as far as I'm concerned. Irreversible shares only celluloid, the physical format, with so-called "traditional" movies. The comparison ends here. Other than that, it's a primal assault on the senses and emotions, unlike any other I've ever experienced. One word of advice: if you really want to try to get to the core of this work, do watch it until the very end. It's much easier said than done, however. Yes, everything you've heard is totally true. It is literally NOT, I repeat, NOT for the faint of heart. And I don't mean queasy stomachs by that, though those sensitive in that area should also think thrice before deciding to watch this.The first quarter of the movie is an absolute abomination. Forget Cannibal Holocaust, forget the pseudo-snuff movies (Faces of Death comes to mind), this is ten times more intolerable. The first twenty minutes are something that will probably stay in your mind for life. It is that barbaric and gruesome. I freely admit, I could watch only part of the murder that takes place in the club. I had to avert, even close, my eyes. And I had to lower the sound, completely, until the monstrous deed was done. This sequence is formidably potent, and has the power to make you feel literally close to panic. For the record, I've seen it all too, in terms of horror movies and the like, so I've seen much more than my fair share of gore ;-) Or at least I thought so. The "problem" here is that it goes far beyond just gore on film. I don't think I can clearly depict here in mere words the why and how, the reason, regarding why it's so brutal, so raw a shock, but the fact is, it's a lightning bolt right into your cortex. And I felt physically ill watching this, not just queasy or nauseous. Sweating, with accelerating heartbeat, tingling extremities, the works. So there you have it.Frankly speaking, the infamous rape scene coming some fifteen minutes after that is not nearly as traumatizing. Sure, it's atrocious, hard, viciously brutal. But honestly, what do you expect from a rape? Of course it's gonna be one the most despicable act that you'll see, no surprise here. I digress, but what did people expect of that scene before the scandals and controversy began? It's for sure what a rape should be: violently repulsive and merciless. However, except for a few seconds at the scene's end, it's nowhere near as primitive and graphically indescribable as the first -and only- murder in the film.All this being said, this work is THE most vibrant anti-violence statement I've ever seen put on film. There is no embellishment of any kind here, no stylish editing, smart cuts, slow motion... It shows violence -and all of it- only as it should be seen: repulsive to the extreme, blindly and uselessly destructive, utterly unable to resolve anything, and as the most terrifying dead-end that exists; indeed, having totally irreversible results. There is no coming back from such acts, no redemption either. Man just has to live with his obsession of being stronger than his neighbour, whatever it takes. It's also, let's admit it, a very cruel movie, in terms of its resolution -yes, the beginning of the movie as such, as the character of Pierre destroys the wrong man, and the rape's perp is not only alive and kicking, but apparently rejoicing at the sight of another act of terrifying violence. That, by the way, puts an end once and for all to all the ridiculous comments I've heard made that the movie was an apology for revenge. This is in total opposition with what really happens in this story, and on the screen. It's up there for everyone to see. The film is much too clever to try to deliver a lesson however, but it's obvious to anyone who watched this closely that Noe does not condone violence of any kind, but condemns it without appeal. He just gives a cold, harsh look at whatever is sleeping -or not- inside ALL of us. Personally speaking, I can understand where Pierre comes from when he snaps, I can relate, even if I don't give him excuses. All honest people will. I did have, like so many other people, somebody close to me that was mugged/robbed rather brutally (though thankfully not raped) and the first, FIRST thing that came to mind was "where are the b***ards?". If you get my drift... Unfortunately, it's a human reflex. Whether we're solid enough not to give in to it, is what's decisive... If I had the possibility, in my own experience, to find the aggressors, I still don't know to this day what I could have done. Probably I could have killed someone out of sheer rage, anger, and blind fury. So there is no clear cut, prefabricated opinion to have about the madness and rage these people dive in. This is part of the unease we feel as we watch... The characters are likeable, but blend. Anyone could be in their place. That is the power of this film, to rub where it hurts, to tell it like it is, that anybody tomorrow, despite all our certainties, could end up in exactly that same situation as the average folks depicted in Irreversible. And the movie shows it as real as it gets, not only the violence of course, but in terms of witnessing plain, normal people who are going straight to hell because of uncontrollable circumstances. All it takes is nine minutes, and dark, nasty chance. All of this is not preachy, by the way, just the embryo of reflections I have from seeing this film a few days ago. I'm only beginning to feel good -no, strike that, NORMAL again just now. So this scribing is probably not very structured or coherent. ;-) There's much to be said about the arresting camera work, the infernal soundtrack (the synthesizer drone during the club scene evokes a demented and anguished monochord lament), and mostly the quality of the acting -suffice to say that all the actors in the movie do a superb job of capturing truth.In the end, Irreversible is a most unique, if sobering, experience. A weird one, a disturbing one, even and especially a tremendously traumatizing one, but ultimately a rewarding one, for there is good and beauty in the film too. It's quite a paradoxal feeling though, and starkly ironic; this beauty is all the more dramatic because as we are witness to it, we do know at the very same time it's about to be irremediably lost, crushed, destroyed soon. That's also why it's obvious the movie could only be edited as it is, telling the story backwards, comparisons with Memento be damned. So finally, whether or not you'll be willing to pay quite a lot in terms of emotional cost to experience the power of this film is all the question.Good luck...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appalled!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For such a lovely actress whom I thought had better taste in what roles she chose (regardless of the whore theme from Passion of the Christ and Brotherhood of the Wolf), I was completely shocked and appalled that Monica Bellucci consented to the most graphic and violent rape scene that I know of. The movie Irreversible succeeds at one thing - completely disgusting its audience. If your not nauseous from the vertigo created as the movie moves in reverse order with rollercoaster camera shots each segway, then you certainly will be disgusted by a horrific murder and rape scene. The film was so violent and unbelievably sick that I began to believe the director was on a mission to just screw up people's minds with the most wretched and foul elements of the human character. The movie has no happy ending and poor Monica is left unrecognizable after her character is raped and savagely beaten. To make things worse her character was pregnant with the new love of her life's baby! It is not implied in the movie, but one is left feeling that not only does she lose the baby but also her own life. At best she probably remains in a coma the rest of her life, terribly disfigured from the attack. I still find myself asking why did she agree to the scene and why the director felt the need to go so far in its portrayal. To save some of you the horror of what I saw and perhaps deter you from making the same mistake I did in watching the movie, I feel must give you a sample of the scene: A woman leaves a party to go home and waits for a taxi. A fellow pedestrian gives her advice to take the subway. She proceeds down a long red corridor until she witnesses a man beating a woman. She goes to get help but the man grabs her. The other girl flees for her life. The man then threatens Monica's character with a knife, forcing her on the ground where he anally rapes her. The rape is so disgusting and inhuman that he speaks to her as if she is less than an animal, a piece of trash. Afterward he beats her with closed fists and repeatedly kicks her in the face. She begins to try and crawl away and it is too painful to watch as her attacker enjoys seeing her try to crawl as he kicks her again.If I had my way, THIS MOVIE WOULD BE BANNED. Some things just shouldn't be portrayed or at least not vividly, especially when the entertainment value that is normally inherit in film only serves to leave the audience calling a therapist to deal with the anxiety and heartbreak the film caused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't a movie for everyone but its brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Violence is an irreversible action. I'm sure everyone at least once in their lives has struck out at someone in anger and then felt the sickening combination of regret and guilt.In Gaspar Noe's new film we see violence and revenge and the terrible consequences. The plot concerns 3 friends out on the town for a night of partying. Monica Belluci who play's Alex is raped and beaten to within a inch of her life, her boyfriend (Vincent Cassell) tracks down the rapist and along with his friend Pierre viciously beats the rapist (or who he thinks is the rapist) in a gay S&amp;M club.Much has been made of the scenes of violence in this film, the beating in the the disorientating and disturbing scene in the gaybar is extremely graphic and impactful, the rape scene lasts 9 minutes in duration, such are the hype surrounding these two scenes that the achievements of the rest of the film have been overlooked. Despite the core of ugliness and nihilism, there are moments of transcendant beauty and insight. The last two scenes in this film have particular resonance with what will happen later (did I mention that the story is told backwards?) Noe lies Belluci on a bed underneath a poster for the film 2001: A Space Odyssey and with no dialogue, no nothing, makes a scene ripe with meaning and power. The last scene of this movie and the controversial last seconds will shatter you.Shooting on 16mm film (then digitally altering in post) gave Noe the freedom for 20 minute long takes and the ability to move the camera in ways that would of proved more difficult with bulkier cameras. The dialogue is improvised and all the 12 seperate scenes in the film are shot in one take. Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassell are (or were) married and unlike alot of real life couples that appear on screen together they look totally real, have great chemistry and understanding, in several scenes we see two actors in great form just going for it.It was a master stroke to tell this simple tale of revenge backwards. The film opens with a crpytic conversation between a fat naked man and skinny young man in a hotel room, characters from a previous Gaspar Noe film, then we cut to outside the gay bar, two men are being led away by police, punters are gathered around shouting abuse at the men. The men look dead, numb, beaten down.Then begins the infamous scene in the S&amp;M club. For many people this scene will be too much, the camera swirls and pans out of control, we glimpse images of gay sex out of the darkness, all around are disembodied aggresive male voices, a throbbing electronic soundtrack featuring 28khz frequences (sounds used to break up riots, that induce symptoms of vertigo and sickness) drones.when our hero catches up with "The Tapeworm" he starts a fight and is beaten down, his friend Pierre appears from nowhere and uses a fire extinguisher and to beat his skull in. After several strikes and when the skull begins to collapse the camera does an amazing movie, much like a backflip, and gets us closer to the action, all the factors of the scene, dialogue, lighting, violence (much of it well used CG), soundtrack are design to make the viewer as disgusted as possible.(A quick note on the homosexuality represented in the film. Noe set this scene in a gay bar because he wanted to show a place of total male sexuality, where there are no female influences.)At this stage we do not know the reasons for this brutal murder, we are just witnessing one man kill another. It may not be apparent on first viewing but they don't even kill the right man, the real rapist is in the background lurking in the crowd of men watching the fighting.This whole scene is probably the most disturbing thing ever committed to film and once we make it through anything that comes later might seem quite tame in comparison, but before we can relax we have the actual rape itself. Alot of people seem to complain that it goes far too long but the movie is shot in real time and all the scenes done in one take so to cut it down would be silly. Belluci directed the scene herself, the only note from the director being that it couldn't last longer than 20 minutes because the film in camera would run out after such a time.The fact that it lasts as long as it does is a tribute to Belluci's willingness to immerse herself in the character, to impose a time limit would destroy the spirit of improvisation that this film thrives on.A quick look at the films ratings on the IMDB.com website shows that females rate this film higher than males, why would that be considering it has such a awful end for a female character? Noe has a theory that the film puts off males more than females because the rape scene is "femanizing". It is shot from the groundlooking up at Belluci's character Alex is lying on her stomach on the ground, so we see nothing sexually very graphic, rather we see Belluci's trapped and frightened face, unable to stop whats happening to her. We don't so much see the rape as hear it.For me the film's most chilling moment comes during the rape scene when at the end of the tunnel where it happens we see a shadowy out of focus figure enter the tunnel, he sees whats happening, then walks out again.As I said earlier the movies violent scenes have overshadowed its other scenes. The scenes before the rape happens but come after (remember the story is told backwards) make up the bulk of the film. Improvised scenes of great skill, both technical and acting, the scene on the train in particular is brilliantly done.The films ends with Belluci and Cassell at home contemplating a night out, Belluci tells Cassell of her strange dream that hints at her fate, the two actors are very tender and beautiful and especially considering the first half of the film we are relieved to see them so happy together. It would be interesting to see this film in chronological order, I think these scenes wouldn't play half as well.This isn't a movie for everyone, it is violent and upsetting, but its brilliant and in my opinion for what it sets out to be is pretty much perfect. It is hard to describe this movie in words, it speaks for itself. The last scene with Monica Bellucia in a park and discovering a secret is perhaps the most moving scene in cinema history. Art is not always meant to be pretty, art is meant to make you think and feel, by this measure Gaspar Noe has made a masterpiece of art.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Advice: Try to hold on through the first 20 Minutes...after that the movie starts to get "watchable" (i really mean it in a "one can't stand the camera movement" way).***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** It starts almost with the climax and simmers down while going on. And after a while you will (hopefully :) understand and appreciate the DOP-way of seeing things. ***SPOILER OFF***Unfolding the Story backwards gives you the ability to think in a whole different way about the various incidents in detail......thats one thing that really fascinated me about this (very hard to watch) movie!I never experienced this before (afaicr). Very good Acting! Also Directing! The Camerawork and Editing is (please see the whole thing before complaining) IMO outstanding!I think one can get a little bit more aware of cause and effect in live.

		<fullReview>If the editing in this film actually ordered the scenes sequentially as opposed to adopting the Memento-style the-end-as-beginning approach, I would advise anyone renting the DVD to pause the movie two-thirds through (up to when Alex tells Marcus that she's leaving the party and says good-bye to Pierre), before carefully considering the cost of continuing: i.e. are you willing to subject yourself to the visually and psychologically gruelling and nauseating disintegration of what has otherwise been a subtly engaging, flawlessly-acted story? (And when I say disintegration, I mean in terms of narrative, dialogue, character development, cinematography, camerawork, the whole shebang - annihilation would be a more accurate term.) But because of the Memento-style chronology, you are subjected to this final third first, and I can assure you it's not very pleasant. You pray for it to get better. It does, of course, but it subsequently renders what you've already witnessed all the more horrendous. Director Gaspar Noé is gratuitously and excessively cruel, to both his characters and the audience. The theme seems to be the force of impulse-driven revenge, among other things - but what a painful execution it is! Furthermore, I took issue with the portrayal of homosexual males in this film, for it was very one-dimensional if not outright demeaning.I will admit that once you've actually sat through it, an intrinsic but irrational curiosity will beg you to rewatch the final third of the story (which is to say, the movie's beginning) in order to place the events within a larger context. I still have not satisfied this curiosity, because like I say, my gut feeling tells me it's completely irrational and I will very much regret it afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had built this film up in my mind. I was prepared for a shocking film that broke a million taboos and would leave me shocked and reeling. I didn't get any of this.Yes, the rape scene and the very brutal murder scene were jarring and at times disturbing but I didn't feel that any lines were crossed with these scenes. In fact, I found the murder scene much more grotesque than the rape scene.I did enjoy the film, the scenes towards the end (or beginning?) really showcased how well Cassell and Belluci work together and how well written the film actually was. But the very bizarre (and sea-sick inducing) camera work at the start of the film detracted from the story completely and it was only after this hand-held movement calmed down that I was able to enjoy the story.I would recommend it, but fast-forward the first twenty minutes or take some Dramamine first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is a thought provoking film about the human nature of revenge. With shock-value, we see scenes with the brutality of murder and rape, uncensored. The film touches an extreme range of our emotions. We the viewers are provoked to feel anger, repulsion(Monica Bellucci delivers an unabashed performance with bravery and courage that a minute minority of actresses are willing to give. She was exceptional.) and tension that leaves you tasting adrenaline in your mouth. The audience also experiences the beauty of life, the tender moments shared between two lovers. In a scene that is so naturally developed, we can all relate to the feelings of comfort and intimacy between the two characters.The plot line may be simplistic thus the characters do not get the chance to blossom completely, although the brilliant acting that we witness leaves no doubt in our minds that there really is more to these characters, this film is only allowing us a glimpse of their world. The dialogue is consistent throughout the film pertaining to the themes; time destroys all that is good, premonitions do not change the course of fate, and being in the moment is only way to experience life(for better or worse). I recommend this film specifically to the art/film study community. For the simple reason that the high level of violence can be misunderstood(concluded from reading reviews posted on other message boards). I rate this film 9 out of 10. If you are interested to vicariously live through a good day gone horrible, realisticly, I recommend Irreversible to you. *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I purposely haven't read any of the reviews here just so my thoughts could be clear and untainted about this movie. There was one thing I liked about the movie (the telling from backwards to forward), but mostly I found this movie to be irritating, unbelieveable, maddening and unsatisfying. First, I gotta just get this out of the way, who were those two men at the beginning? Secondly, and here comes a SPOILER folks, Pierre kills the wrong man which is so, so deeply unfulfilling to me as a moviegoer! The rapist was a misanthropic, cruel and despicable human being. For him to continue living just sucks! And the camera work while in the club was so dizzying it made me sick and had me sighing and squirming in my chair willing it to stop! The savage beating of the so-called attacker seemed very fake to me. The same shot, shown over and over again, to give the effect of someone being beat to death. The much touted rape scene was nearly unbearable,however. I didn't realize it was 9 minutes long---it actually seemed longer. It was very "authentic" looking, certainly. But, I couldn't help but wonder: where were the tears of pain, indignation and shame that should have been flowing from Alex's face? Was this simply poor acting? And...no blood, although the rapist stated she was bleeding. If you're gonna shoot a scene so graphically, anyway, why not show some bloody fluids on the ground as he pulls away? Finally, the "ending" (really the beginning) was really a let down. BORING. After thinking about it long and hard, I came away thinking that ultimately this movie was misogynistic, racist and homophobic in its presentation. Alex's brutal attack was NOT avenged and that makes me wonder just what it was the filmmaker was trying to say. Want a good rape revenge movie? Go rent "I Spit on Your Grave."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very hard film to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just witnessed this film. I will remember it for a long time indeed. This must be one of the hardest films I've ever seen. We are used to films in where good prevails and evil is punished. This one breaks that rule, and leaves deep scars behind.The scenes in Irreversible are presented backwards. There is no introduction of characters. So one starts to judge the characters on what they do. A guy, who is'nt introduced, gets arrested in a gay SM-bar. He is beat up a little but nothing too serious. OK, you think, how did this happen? Why is this dude carried away?Well, this becomes clear in the next scene: He brutally murders a man by smashing his face in with an iron fire-extinguisher, endlessly. He smashes his face to pulp. It apparently takes some time to kill a man with a fire extinguisher, which the director is all too glad to show in great detail.Why did he do this? What caused such rage? We see this man crying over the body of mutaleted woman. His girlfriend, apparently. Why is she mutaleted? I feared to know. I have watched in absolute horror how she was being sodomized in a pedestrians tunnel. After the violence of being raped, she is kicked into a coma. Once again this brutal scene is shown in all its horrific details.It left me with a feeling of total confusion: surely there must have been a reason for all this violence?This is where Irreversible gets really cruel: There is no reason.The rest of the film serves to deepen your sympathy for the victims. The more you get to know about the characters, the more you get to like them. BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN!Irreversible does not judge anything; it just shows you a terribly sad story in reverse. This makes it even sadder by eliminating any sort of happy ending all together.This is NOT a happy movie. You are NOT dared to watch this.Regards,Coen Rem, Eindhoven</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As many people here, I've seen this movie just because it was controversial. As many people here I wanted to stop the film after the first 15 minutes, but I don't regret having seeing it. In fact, even it the director's style tries to be "original", is not bad, is really a good job, but very depressing. A good movie is the one you don't forget two minutes after having watched it, I still remember this film, mainly the last scene with Beethoven's music. And this makes me feel more depressed. Time doesn't destroys everything, it's life which destroys everything. What this movie tries to tell you is don't be happy, soon you'll suffer! I also want to say that the rape scene didn't need to be so explicit, it was really a nightmare, it is because when you think that a lot of innocent women have suffered that, and that none is safe from it, it's really depressing! Well, in any case look how she is dressed in such a district! Sincerily, if a girl dresses like that in some way she's putting herself in danger. Too stupid for her two friends to left her alone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but easy to miss the point on first viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible is a graphically violent film that intentionally leaves nothing to the imagination, including watching a man's face disintegrate as it is bashed in with a fire extinguisher, and a very violent nine-minute, single shot rape scene (with one of France's top actresses). The film totally divides viewers. Many people will walk out rather than watch the whole film - which would make it difficult to assess, especially as it goes through major shifts of mood and tone that are intrinsic to the whole.Irreversible is certainly a serious piece of film making. The use of flashbacks is sequential - we see the 'end' scene first, then the scene that led up to it, and so on. It is full of powerful images and innovative techniques. It can be described as a journey from hell to heaven. The theme is 'time destructs everything' and, starting in reverse by showing, at the beginning of the film, terrible scenes that are the conclusion of events we have yet to witness in flashback, slowly moves from nightmare to happiness.The first 'nightmare' scene is in a gay sex club somewhere in France. The soundtrack has a steady note that reverberates insistently like an audio depiction of a throbbing headache. The camera, hand held, thrashes wildly around in the dimly red-lit areas, catching up with and following the two men out for revenge. It slows somewhat to focus on the apparent object of their anger. The initial attack is thwarted, but the second of the two men takes over and pummels the victims head to a pulp - and we see the face and head disintegrate under blows as it is mercilessly bashed with a fire extinguisher (an unusual and unexpected use of CGIs).Next we follow the attackers before they reach the nightclub. We learn that they are hunting the perpetrator of a violent rape on the girlfriend of one of them. The film is still not easy to watch, but the jerkiness of the camera slows enough to allow us the indulgence of following some sort of plot. The anger of the two men as they try to trace their intended victim is still uncomfortable viewing.Next we see the rape scene. This time the camera is motionless. The movement and struggle of the victim becomes paramount. The graphic nature is mostly confined to the violence. There is no penetration seen, and very little exposure except a momentary glimpse of a breast. The attacker's penis, seen briefly at the end of the act, was added digitally (explained the Director in a Q&amp;A discussion at it's British premiere). After the rape, the attacker beats the victim into a bloody coma.Next we enter a scene that is slightly more recognizable as ordinary life, although not exactly pleasurable to watch. It is a party where the future victim and her boyfriend and another man are present. The scene is hedonistic, with drink, drugs and a hedonistic abandon which the woman eventually finds distasteful and she leaves early.As the story unfolds backwards, ever into scenes that are more pleasing on the ear and eye, we see the future rape victim in an ordinary and delightful relationship with one of the men. It turns out that the other man was her former boyfriend. In a beautiful few scene of domesticity she takes a pregnancy test and visits an open air park area where children are playing delightfully on the grass, running in and out of a fountain. The camera work, having gone slowly from barely watchable to enjoyable, takes us on a heavenly treat as we watch the children from above in play that seems almost like a cinematic dance sequence.We put all the pieces together in the knowledge that all traces of humanity will be wiped away (as we have seen the 'ending'). The film finishes with several minutes of strobe light, enveloping to the initial drug-like hand held camera work by its concentration on light rather than specific form.There are many haunting 'comparison' elements between the horrific scenes and the pleasant ones. For instance, the victim's mouth is held shut by her attacker's hand during most of the rape. Earlier in the story (and later in the film), her mouth is held shut in a fun-loving way by her boyfriend during sex-play. Some of the lines of dialogue similarly echo and cause interesting resonances.But are these technical innovations enough to justify the film? Quite possibly, though as art and a study a study of sexual repression and violence rather than as a statement about rape. The rape scene conveys the horror of rape to women in a way that underlines the importance of not walking home through a subway in a very disreputable area alone at night, but it fails to show the traumatic effect on the woman's life after she has survived it, and the emphasis on the violence (the victim is beaten into a coma afterwards) maybe blurs the horror of the actual act of rape, or suggests that rape not involving violence is not so bad. Irreversible is a story of revenge which, at it's most basic level, simply emphasizes male violence and physical violence as a reaction and an ends to a means.Interestingly, during the rape scene in the subway, a man appears in the background, starts to enter the subway and thinks better of it and leaves. This is perhaps like those members of the audience who find the initial half of the film so distasteful that they leave. Only deep reflection on the film convinced me of its value as art. I had also made the mistake of sitting too close, so the disorientating strobe and backbeat overwhelm the consciousness so much that it is hard to view anything dispassionately. Irreversible is not an easy film, but a valuable one.</fullReview>

BAD. the movement of the camera is so beyond annoying that after 20 min I couldn't watch more. Came back later to see the rest of the movie. So the camera it shakes moves and rotate so much with no reason than to look smarter and more original than other movies. The gay club atmosphere which is supposed to be a junk underground is simple stupid you can see a dick rubbed then the camera rotate and move around the walls then an ass and again camera rotate, some clubbing music with some vibrations and most of all dark. the director really believe that he build something very smart but actually is just trash, movie trash. Effects done for their selves not for the good of the movie. Scene done for their effects not serving the whole as a unit. Is like a school boy is making a movie and trying to show as his muscles. That was really a wasted time. I was always afraid of the average French movies. They always play smarter than they are.

		<shortDescription>Simply Pretentious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, in life, movies go over people's heads. People think they are dumb when in fact they are really quite intelligent. This is not one of those movies. This movie is a simple example of pretension in action.The characters are boring. The story arch-typical. The movie is shot in reverse in an attempt to hide the fact that the plot is... nothing. Everything that you'd expect to happen, based on the premise, does happen. So they tell the story backwards. It's a weak gimmick. The camera work is a weaker gimmick. You probably won't quite understand what I mean by this, but in the movie, they swing the camera around arbitrarily non-stop. You might be surprised by this, and think there's something I'm not telling you. Surely that can't be exactly what it sounds like. But it is. In a decision that would make even the lowliest film school freshman cringe, they swing the camera around like idiots. Is it symbolic? Is there a message behind it? Probably, but it's still a flat out idiotic way to communicate a message. And that's what defines this movie. Failed attempts to deliver substance. There's no substance to this movie. It's so desperate for substance, it ends (begins?) with an ten minute long rape scene. As if that has worth in some way.Don't see this movie. There have been a thousand before it and there will be a thousand after it, that are the exact same way. Just a movie made by someone with no artistic skill, who tries his best to fake it.</fullReview>

The wildly swinging camera is just plain nausea-inducing, and the graphic gay sex and the infamous rape scene all make for a film you'll never forget. Unfortunately for me, I saw Japon the night before; what mistake! Irreversible looks like every scene and camera move is deliberate (as opposed to what looks merely sloppy in Japon).So if you like going to the museum of modern art and love the giant painting mostly of great swaths of black and red, this movie is for you(ooh art!).

		<shortDescription>Most Disturing Film I Have Ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is the Film good? Yes. Is it effective? Yes. Is it stylistically unique? Yes. However, this is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. This film of course contains the most brutal rape scene in the history of world cinema. The scene goes on for what feels like 10 to 15 minutes and leaves you breathless, stunned, scared, and sick. Monica Bellucci is one of the most beautiful women in the world and to see her violated like this makes it that much more disturbing. Not only does she get raped anally but she gets the crap beat out of her after the act. This happens somewhere in the middle of the film. Just like Memento this film is done completely backwards. At the Beginning of the film, which is actually the end of the story. Takes the viewer on a disturbing tour of an underground gay asylum. This was particularly disturbing for the fact that Noe did not shy away from male genitalia, phallacio, male masturbation or anal sex. This is followed by a scene where Vincent Cassal fights with a man that he thinks is the man responsible for his wife's rape. We see his arm get broken, when suddenly Vincent's friend knocks the man with a fire extinguisher until the man's head is nothing but a bloody pulp. Definitely not for everyone and consider yourself warned.</fullReview>

There was no need for the gay porn at the rectum club or the male masturbation. the best part of the movie is in the rectum club where the rapist gets his brains smashed over the floor with a fire extinguisher. Also the film leaves unanswered questions such as did she die? what happened to the gangsters after they jumped in the taxi with the two main men after questioning the transvestite hooker? you see them get in the taxi. All in all this movie is a tasteless piece of female hate and gay exploitation. one more thing how on earth did the b.b.f.c (british board of film censers) pass this uncut when they still refuse to pass last house on the left, maniac, and new york ripper uncut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dealing with violence and vengeance Seven and Fight Club are in my opinion much more interesting, not even comparable to this movie.Why the need to make it a flashback movie like Memento? Only because the story itself is poor. The only thing the story really has, are two of the worst, more disgusting, scenes in the story of film-making.I didn't particularly appreciate the acting, nor I considered it particularly bad. I didn't find the directing original, nor too bad.I choose to do not see that movie for a long time, because I don't want to feel bad for violence scenes when they are pointless.After seeing the movie (actually the uncut version with the rape scene full of the face kicking of Mrs Belluucci face) I asked myself why to watch it, and if sustaining the pain of those two scenes have any sense and if there's any point at all in seeing it.I don't know. What I do know is that you can look at the first 35 minutes, watching the two disgusting violent scenes and skip the rest, since there's nothing else in that movie.And about those 35 minutes, is it valuable? I don't know. I am not sure it is. But it's up to you. About how you do feel looking at them, and what thought will come to your mind looking at them and reminding them... Since you will find yourself thinking about them over and over for days.If that expression of violence is valuable to you or not depends on you.What I do know is that I would not recommend watching that to anyone young.</fullReview>

Maybe someone can give me a hint? Is this intended for a complete study of psychologically deranged and sadistic human behavior or maybe it is intended to let us mortals know that this kind of behavior exists and there are a bunch of individuals that do this for fun ? Or perhaps this film is a kind of extreme violence apology intended for mentally deranged individuals who are feeling sexually excited watching it ? In any case I think that this is not a film to win any awards (even if the role played by Belluci was very good?) and furthermore I think that this kind of film (increasingly "en vogue") should be pulled out from the market !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uncompromising film that stays with the viewer long after it ends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it hard to make up my mind about Irreversible. At first the harshest scenes, horrifically realistic, powerfully acted and hard to watch, seam a little desperate in their attempt to shock. But then in comparison to the glorified, 'fun' violence of Hollywood, at least the director is telling it how it is. Violence in the real world is sickening and rape is a vile, destructive act of power and this film certainly forces that point home. You have to give credit to Gaspar Noe for making such an uncompromising film that stays with the viewer long after its abrupt ending. The sound in the film is a thing of genius which, when married to the constantly moving, spinning shots, leaves the viewer woozy and disoriented, but also engrossed, before the plot even begins. Despite all there is to admire in the film, the story didn't quite work for me. Told in reverse, it's an overly simple tale of effect then cause, with a lot of implicit comments on human nature thrown in. We don't get to know the characters enough and by the end it is the shocking moments alone that stand out. I'm glad I saw the film- it holds its own in comparison to recent revenge films. I preferred it immeasurably to Kill Bill which shares the same lack of story whilst being less original, but I enjoyed Park Chan-Wook's Old Boy more, which despite the odd moment of cheesy violence, tells a heck of a tale and asks the question Noe fails to- 'What would you do?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left me shaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing this review more to exorcise the demons this film has left me with more than anything else. I watched it last night and have been distracted all day thinking about it.I was unfamiliar with the work of Gaspar Noe before this but couldn't ignore the tremor this film had caused forever. Having browsed the web I can see that there is a definite polarized opinion on Irreversible. People either seem in shocked awe or have dismissed it as exploitation trash. I'm in the first camp.SpoilersThe film details a brutal rape and the equally brutal revenge meted out by the victims partner and ex-partner, however it is told in reverse, starting with the revenge and ending with everyone involved blissfully unaware of the horrors that are about to befall them. Many have dismissed this technique as nothing more than a pretentious gimmick but I feel they're missing the point. Having the film close with the happy characters not knowing the horrors that we have just witnessed left me sick and sad. I actually pitied their future which is a very bleak feeling indeed.Now I have seen a lot of nasty films. Just check my other reviews. I've sat through I Spit On Your Grave and Last House On The Left yet the rape scene in Irreversible was on another level. Through most of the film Noe adopts a swirling camera style. The scenes in the gay club are dizzying, the camera swooping and diving through rooms letting you catch glimpses of all sorts of unwholesome acts. Yet from the moment the rape begins the camera remains static throughout. Forcing us to watch, daring us to look away. There are no cuts, this is realtime and we are there for the grim distance. Monica Bellucci's performance is heart breaking and painful and the moment when the rapist kicks her in the face I actually involuntarily shut my eyes. I have NEVER done that. Possibly the most painful part of the whole scene is when a figure appears at the end of the tunnel then turns and walks away again. Noe is forcing us to ask ourselves 'what would I have done if that were me?'. Would you have come to the rescue or would you turn back through fear for your own safety? It is a moment of salvation that is quickly snatched away.Also of note is Cassel's performance. He is truly a man possessed. Until the events unfold he appears a mere thug but by the end I almost wanted to go back to the start and root for him.If you think you can handle it I urge you to see Irreversible and make up your own mind. It is an unforgettable experience.I promise you two things; You'll never look at a fire extinguisher again without wincing and you will definitely think twice about taking the subway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy Reversed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before this movie came out, everybody knew what it was about. Yet no one would expect to feel such intense feeling of despair, sadness and trauma after watching this film. The history itself is rather plain and simple, though horrid and brutal, but it's not the story that matters - it's how it's told.By reversing the story, Noe has managed to deepen our shock and grief, to show how something injust and terrible to every person can get more injust and more terrible if we get to know the main characters' life after we've seen all the violence and crime. In the beginning we only see irrational violence and rage, and though of course we know what is the cause of all this, we don't feel so much compassion for the characters, because we don't know who they are, what they went through, we just see violent, irrational behaviour and dirty, vulgar places. Then comes the horrible rape scene...and then, when we get to know the characters, we realize the full monstrosity of the crime done to them, how a wretched, sick man destroyed three happy lives (well, at least two - maybe even four). Because of the reversed story the movie is even more painful to watch, it becomes a study of happiness being utterly destroyed, of how "time destroys everything", how we can't reverse things even if we would die for it. I like to see this film as a string of recollections - a dream of a tortured soul (maybe Alex), wishing to turn back time...The way of shooting this movie is a very pioneeric one. The camera movement reflects the emotions in the story. First, we have a very vivid, brutal sequence, and from that, the camera movement is becoming calmer, more steady, until the end, where it seems to float peacefully in the air. Also the colours get calmer and calmer from the start (finish?), and the soundtrack too. If there was an Oscar for showing emotions, I'd give it to that film.The acting...a brilliant Marcus by Cassel, who is in my personal opinion the best actor in France in showing emotions (as he did also in his debut "La Haine"). Monica Bellucci is beautiful as always. One might say that she didn't have a lot to act, but she did - especially in the scenes in Alex's &amp; Marcus' apartment, she really embodied happiness and peace, and she was brilliant in the rape scene (I know it sounds like I was fond of it - believe me, I was abhorred, but nevertheless, it was brilliant acting). The Pierre character was a funny guy, nicely played. The rapist...well, he too had acted good. Too good even.What most people don't see, and what scares me the most, are the hints of precognition we see later on in the film. A dream, a book Alex reads, conversations about sex...Does someone want us to think those people knew what will happen?I have an interesting theory about the eyewitness of the rape...I think it could be someone we know...My grade: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I need say is WOW.This is the new Gaspar Noe pic starring my dream woman Monica Bellucci, and her real-life husband Vincent Cassell (he's lucky I like him too or I'd kill him).This is the movie getting big press over here (the controversial kind), where it just came out 2day, over the graphic nature and excruciating length of the rape scene. THEY'RE NOT KIDDING! Here you have Thylacine, one of the most ardent anti-censorship proponents around, doubting his very position during this scene, and actually having to look away, it was so disturbing and horrifying.Now don't by any means think that it was somehow titillating; it was sickening and horrifying, and another scene in the film contained violence so graphic it put "Passion of the Christ" to shame - it was literally like a close-in vid of the leadup to an Ogrish pic.Now you may at this point be thinking a-la "Ken Park", shock for the sake of shock with no substance whatsoever. You'd be very wrong. The film is utterly brilliant. It's told in reverse scene-order, in the same way as "Memento", starting with Vincent Cassell being stretchered out of a club unconscious and beaten to a pulp, and his friend being led out in cuffs alongside, being sworn and jeered at by the patrons. As the film progresses (and the scenes are revealed in reverse chronological order), we see the day in reverse, the film ending at the morning of the day depicted.Now the start of the film is a TRIP. The camera is swirling and swooping all over the place and you can barely see what's happening, and I was beginning to wonder what the hell was going on and hoping it wouldn't all be like that, but it isn't - give it a chance. To me this is a representation of the madness and psychotic frenzy the main characters are in at this point in the story. You can barely see what's happening with all the swooping and shuddering, and thundering rise and fall of some deep bass thunder overlaid on the scenes.People walked out during the film, not surprisingly. Interestingly enough, it was all the young people! All those left in the theatre were older (than me, at 25), 40s-50s, including a COUPLE in their early 50s who stayed through the whole thing. RESPECT! THEY recognised it for what it was... a genius crafting a visceral experience, not a blatant attempt at shock. Not ONCE were the violent scenes glamourised or glorified.See this film. Seriously. I realised towards the end, as skilfully manipulated as I was, through their depiction and conversations that I really cared about these people, and soon had it hit home - I'll never know what happens to them. Obviously we see what's happened at the end of the NIGHT, but there's a long way to go for the characters if they're not totally destroyed. I cannot recommend this film enough. Trust me, I doubt you'll EVER have seen anything so violent or disturbing, but if you believe you're capable of stomaching that to take in an utterly brilliant piece of film-making, get out there and see it. 10/10 (a DAMN rare mark from me).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gasper Noe has created a film that's sole purpose is to make you feel sick. As well as the lengthy rape and graphic violence, the film is shot in such a way as to bring on sea-sickness or an epileptic fit.Using the backwards narrative technique from MEMENTO, a simple rape and revenge story is told in reverse, meaning that we see the revenge, then the rape, and then the characters getting on with their lives before the whole thing happened. The revenge section of the film is largely unspectacular but at least manages to keep the viewers interest as the story unfolds.After the rape scene, the story (such as it is) has been told but the film is not over. There are lengthy scenes of the characters at a party, etc that get more and more tedious. A laughably contrived sub-plot about real events being predicted in our dreams is added, as is a revelation about the rape victim that is presumably intended to make the rape scene seem even more shocking.The film contains an excellent special effect (the face smashing scene) and the rape scene is not filmed in a titillating way (apart from the woman's near-see-through dress). But really, there is nothing here to make the film worth watching. Noe ends the film in a way that confirmed to me that this is nothing more than an exercise in inducing nausea. A lengthy strobe effect is used for no purpose but to make the viewer feel queasy. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful piece of crap wanna be an art film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review of this movie will not contain any spoilers since this movie is so damn awful that I do not want to put its story in my own words. One second, was there a story to this movie?. Not at all its all about irritating camera work (may trigger migraine), unbearable lighting, poor character development, explicit sex scenes in its most god damn awful manner. There is no moral to the movie except its graphic violence and sex content intended for adults only. It is only for those who like torture, violence, rape, sex (weird and nonsense) non-stop in its most disgusting manner in a movie. It is a shame to a masterpiece like 'Memento' and was the only reason (reverse story telling) I rented this piece of s***. Wow what a way to make a movie! This is a good example to show it to film student of how not to make a movie. This movie is mother of 'Hostel' in showing the dark side of humanity. And I read lots of user reviews appreciating the 'realism' of this movie, I would say the realism will make you hate this movie more. It is a mere 9 minute destruction of a woman (shown explicitly) in all the ways possible with obscene language throughout. I want my time back I gave it to this movie but it is after all IRREVERSIBLE!!...It fails in all aspects except making viewers throw-up.A solid 0/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most "fucked up" movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched "Irreversible" and the only comment I have is that I can remember just one movie, which is so sick, depressing and brutal- "Requiem for a dream". If you like that one, you surely will like "Irreversible". The first 40 minutes are the most cruel ones. Actually, the movie is really sick and is not for everybody. So think twice before watching it. Monica Bellucci is beautiful as always, which actually made me feel worse, because of the things that happen to her. In my opinion most of the people don't wanna watch that kind of movies. Still there are people that "enjoy" them. So if you consider yourself as a normal guy, I suggest you- don't watch the movie unless you want to feel bad afterwards. I watched the movie just because of the idea about the "reverse order" of the things. So, I suppose that they could do another type of movie (for example normal thriller) with the same idea- the things could happen backwards and it would be much more enjoyable. And in the end, if you decide to watch the movie, I wish you good luck :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Irréversible' is considered to be one of the most controversial films of 2002, since it has strong scenes of rape and murder. Many people are saying about how the rape scene is violent and terrible, but in my opinion, the fire extinguisher scene is worse than the rape to watch.The beginning of the movie, where Pierre and Marcus are in the ''Rectum'', let me very uncomfortable to watch, but I discovered in the trivia section that the set was indeed'' very cavernous and confusing, and that many of the crew members, became claustrophobic in it.''The story is told backwards, what can make many people stay confuse about it.( I got confuse in the beginning of the movie,but nothing as watching the movie two times to understand it better)The director's point in this film is that time destroys everything. The story starts with happiness and a nice relationship, and in the end, everything falls apart.Alex, raped and in coma, probably lost her baby and her aggressor stays alive and intact. (This shows how to have impulsive acts are terrible, and most of the time, ends in trouble)The Plot: Alex and Marcus are a couple that are in love. Pierre is friend of both of them and Alex's ex boyfriend. One day, when the three of them are in a party,Alex stays angry with Marcus because he is using drugs.She then decides to go away from the party alone. Not finding any cab, she decides to enter in an underpass to go home. The rape takes place when Alex encounters Le Tenia beating a prostitute in the pedestrian underpass. Soon Le Tenia decides to harass Alex, that avoids him, until he anally rapes and beats her until she stays in coma. When Marcus and Pierre are going out from the party, they discover what happened to Alex, and both of them,specially Marcus, go after revenge to her aggressor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a film I would recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Irreversible is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but not the best either. I've seen "I spit on your grave", "Accused" and some other rape flicks that were much better than this. The story line is good, but the camera man spins the camera around so much you can hardly make out the actors in the movie. I would guess the camera man was an amateur and has very little experience staying focused on the scene. I only watched it once and would not recommend it to anyone. Watching the beginning gave me a headache because of the poor filming. I almost felt like I was sitting in a chair spinning around getting more dizzy and sick as the camera moved through this movie... Otherwise, it could be an OK flick.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I went to a screening of Irreversible last night, and oh dear. Ignoring the hype, what are you left with? A film with annoying "shaky cam" to the extent that it makes Blair Witch look serene, with a plot that wafer thin and cliched. Not to mention the fact the films ends with a long dose of strobe lighting that gave me a headache.Everything about this film was done better in I stand alone. Noe has let his nihilism get the better of him here. How are we supposed to care about the characters when he doesn't- and anyone inclined to try and form a connection with the characters would be too put off by the violence. The pointlessly angry racism, shown here in the cab scene was done much better in I stand alone too- it was cold, irreversible is pointless.And we move onto the violence. And heres a problem- it's been hyped to the extent that that everyone going in imagined it was worse than it was, and strangely therefore, I was left thinking "so what, Salo was worse" when I came out, hey maybe Noe's nihilism is spreading! This is not helpful. Only 2 of the 150 or so crowd walked out, (which was less than did during a murder scene in the unhyped My little Eye BTW) so I think this was a common problem. And where's Noe gonna go for his next film? It can't really get any darker.I quite liked the fact that each scene was 1 shot, and the concept time destroys everything was interesting if underdeveloped, and I get the point that movies should be like real life, but that is no excuse for this film. This is not to say I think it should be banned, it should not.I am a big fan of Noe's first film I stand alone, and this was very disappointing. I wouldn't waste your money on it.3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the annoying credit sequence, with names in reverse, the film opens with a scene that is totally unrelated to the rest of the movie, an homage to one of the Noe's earlier films, an indication of the director's ego and pretension. The irrelevant scene is followed by a long sequence of incomprehensible cinema, filmed using a spinning, constantly moving camera, low-visibility lighting, and repetitive screaming by a maniac looking for someone in a gay joint, probably the worst 30 minutes ever captured on celluloid by a professional filmmaker. After that it gets better although there is very little that is interesting except for the rape scene, which is quite effective in conveying the stark brutality of the crime. Although this film is about a crime that is irreversible, the gimmick is that the film is told in reverse. So clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminded me that time is irreversible, and that once your eyes take sights in, the images remain permanently seared in your mind. So it only makes sense that we take care what sights we expose ourselves to.Irreversible is an exploitation film. Those that praise the film seem to believe that anything of a realistic violent and/or sexual nature that successfully unnerves them must therefore be art. That is frightening. What's next? Mainstream snuff films?I was unable to discern even an inkling of purpose or message that this film was attempting to demonstrate. When the Marcus character (Vincent Cassel) and the Pierre character (Albert Dupontel) savagely assault and graphically mutilate the perceived "bad guy" in a gay porno parlor, was I supposed to cheer or throw up? I felt nothing for either of these characters, and because the film works itself backwards, the event offers no finality or redeeming factors that, had it been presented after the rape scene, might have been somewhat of a benefit.Director Gaspar Noé made this film to make money, not art. He did so by casting Monica Bellucci as a woman who is brutally sodomized and beaten to near death. Bellucci being a beautiful woman, Noé knew that the buzz of the rape scene would draw folks in. Add in extreme and realistic violence, and the controversy surrounding the film would act as a lariat.But the absolute most irritating part of this film was the constant camera spins. I guess that was art too?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most of the pompous around here, I'm going to get right to the point.Irreversible attempts to make a bold statement further emphasized by the music and camera effects rampant throughout the movie. In my opinion, it fails.Hard as I tried to enjoy this movie, and understand what it all meant, I found myself bored. Gore fanatics will be mildly entertained by some of the movie's scenes, mostly because the camera stays (for the most part) focused upon the happenings, rather than the typical Hollywood horror trash of today (camera looks away, only screaming to let you know what's going on...pfft), but will eventually end up frustrated as, not only is the movie extremely dark, but by the time the camera stops moving enough for you to focus on what is going on, you're not that interested anymore. Those looking for a deeper yet just-the-same disturbing meaning and peek into the workings of the depraved are better off with movies like Salo or May.And for those interested in an off-the-wall movie with homosexual/homophobic themes should stick to Skin Flick. Don't lie to yourself, you know that's what you were ~really~ looking forward too...Now with all that said, I will say that this movie wasn't a total waste of my time. Though I think it tried too hard, I did find myself immersed in the story following certain points in the movie. Unfortunately, just as quickly as I became interested, I began wishing I had something else to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it without the violent scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have never seen this film then watch it without the violent scenes first and then see what you think of it.For the fire extinguisher scene jump to the end just as Marcus is about to get a good bum bashing from the guy he just glassed in the club. That's the point when his friend Pierre steps in to give the harris bandit a good slap with a portable safety device. In other words Pierre caves the man's face in with the fire extinguisher (very graphic, realistic, swirly camera work and low frequency doning sound designed to make you feel qweezzzzyyyyy) Secondly, for the rape scene, you can jump to end of scene when Tapeworm, or La Tenia, starts threatening Alex with the Knife. She then get brutally and graphically raped.Without the violence you may well find it very boring as most of the scenes are long dragged out affairs with pretty pointless dialogue which goes round in circles. The theme, time spoils everything......well what does that mean? Shown in the correct order the story is about a girl who discovers she's pregnant, gets raped and then her boyfriend and ex go to get revenge and they get the wrong man. And that's it! You could choose any series of unfortunate events, chop the film up into scenes, reverse the order a la Memento, and apply the same moral. Some people have suggested the film shows the futility of revenge....well of course it does if you choose to let your characters get the wrong man. But that's hardly very creative or inventive. Had they got the right man they would have done the world a favour.Lets face it, without the fire extinguisher and rape scene, nobody would be talking about this film!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely walk out of a movie, but I couldn't endure more than 20 minutes of "Irreversible". It's not that I was offended by the subject matter (gang rape and gay sex). Nor did I take exception to the crude language -- and there's plenty of it, including references to fisting, but nothing I'm not used to as a gay man myself. Heck, I didn't even object to the name given to a gay leather/SM bar in the early sequences of the film. ("The Rectum" ... How's that for subtlety?)What did me in was the sheer annoying pretentiousness of the filmmaker's technique (or lack thereof). "Irreversible" makes Dogma look like Capra. The leather bar scene might have been shot in a blender through a red filter, with a garbage truck for background noise. It was the cinematographic equivalent of Chinese water torture. I finally walked out, leaving a mostly unfinished soda behind, and made sure I got a free pass to compensate for the purgatory I had just endured.I heartily recommend this film ... never be seen by anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definition of fascism: fascism is an authoritarian political ideology that considers individual and other societal interests inferior to the needs of the state.IRREVERSIBLE is a fascist film because every individual action taken by every main character in this film results in: tragedy, disaster, pure boneheaded actions. Though the director/writer probably would claim that this is just the side effect of the love and passion the main character has for his girlfriend and that he couldn't think things clearly because of the rage that erupted inside of him but the main character is not the only individual who makes these disastrous decisions. The film's message clearly shows, in extremely graphic details (just in case someone missed the point), that actions made by individuals cannot be trusted. Actions as simple as how to cross a street: from sidewalk to sidewalk, or by going through the underpass. This fascistic side of IRREVERSIBLE is undeniable. You cannot overlook it.It's also fascist because practically everything in it is shown to be quasi-evil or corrupt except for the couple, or to be more precise, a pregnant Monica Bellucci. I guess Gaspar Noé is a softy after all. Seriously, had the film NOT included the clichéd plot point of Monica being pregnant, I probably would have been a bit more appreciative of IRREVERSIBLE but because he showcased everything else in such a bad light, including that grimy gay S&amp;M club, where the film starts off, which is basically shown as a horrific dead zone, a place where no life can be conceived (no matter how much they try there), and it ends with a colorful, glorious image of Monica Bellucci, who's lying on beautiful green grass and is surrounded by playing children. In other words, Monica represents life itself. Thematically, I hated almost everything about IRREVERSIBLE. Its "soul" is ugly through and through and the director revels in the ugliness of it all, from the first frame to nearly the last frame, only to end up pushing trite conservative idealism in a good light at the very last frame. You mean, we went through all of that pain and ugliness just to end-up with such a sappy image, which would be more suitable for a Pampers commercial?But even with all of these repellent qualities, I still appreciated the first two thirds of the film, mainly for the technical aspects and how it was filmed. IRREVERSIBLE is visually striking. I cannot deny that and it's the reason I rated this 5 stars. My absolute favorite part was the beginning when the camera was hovering over the sides of the brick building. Hypnotic and memorable. But I cannot abide for the rest.</fullReview>

I, although must give this film credit for truly disturbing me, which is quite an achievement, considering that The Exorcist had little effect on me when I was 13. But this film is completely different because it is so realistic.In reality this film is a true story and the events occur frequently in modern society. So it is fictional characters acting out a film which could be based on thousands of real events.I'm surprised I watched the whole film. It is in reverse-chronological order and the first 10 minutes or so is a swirling camera with disturbing sounds which ends up at a nightclub called "The Rectum" a nauseating start which I hope to forget soon. But some scenes are far more toxic than the introduction.Try to avoid. Especially females. But much can be learn't from watching this film, but learn't from seeing the shocking consequences of poor decisions made by the characters. Hence the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The red tunnel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gaspar Noe's admiration for the late Stanley Kubrik is evident in most of this film. In fact, what is even more surprising is that a movie has been created from such thin material. This is a film that depends on shocking its audience, as proven by the opening sequences. The credits are nightmarish, as are the scenes that show unrestrained violence perpetuated on the main characters. By confusing the spectator, Mr. Noe creates a suspense, as we all want to know what was the origin of such behavior. Most of this violence, I found, is a turnoff.Mr. Noe is very clever in telling the story from the present to the past, as it certainly would have been a complete let down to see it in a chronological manner. If the director would have decided to do it differently, half of the theatre would have emptied because the last sections of the film are totally boring.Did he need to have the scene in the Metro at all? How about the tunnel sequence? Did Mr. Noe have a need to show us in vivid detail what happens to a woman in a situation such as he presents it? Is it necessary to show Vincent Cassel with his 'thang' in full display? How about the disappearing genitalia in the leather bar? For that matter, how about the naked old man at the beginning of the story?The advice to any would-be-swingers is: carry enough cash for a taxi, just in case the party sucks big time. Oh, and never go into an underpass anywhere in the world late at night, let alone a red tunnel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a realistic horror-movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie learns us about the nightclubs, secret bars for homosexuals and the whores in a big French (supposedly Paris) city. Those are all subjects not worth making a movie of it (a TV-documentary could be interesting as a curiosity). Marcus (Vincent Cassel) is at the pursuit of the author of the violent rape (Mourad Khima) of his girl-friend Alex (Monica Bellucci). He is apparently hiding in the closed circles of underground-bars for homosexuals. The problem is that the time-order of the movie is turned around so you see the beginning of the movie at the end, which is the only originality of the movie. Not only you see the end at the beginning but it is filmed in such an awful way that your eyes cannot follow the movement and in the night-bar for homosexuals you cannot distinguish what is happening. Above all Marcus is on drugs and the movie pours out such a violent atmosphere that you think your are in a nightmare. If this is one of the hells of Dante's Inferno, than it is well described. The movie is only interesting as a charge against drugs, prostitution and rape. The theme of the movie that time destroys everything is not the correct one; I would suggest that crime destroys everything. As an illustration of the horror of such crimes this movie has a merit: is an indication that real life can be more horrific than the most frightening horror-movie.</fullReview>

But his main fault is a lack of anything interesting to say.All I felt after this experience was ashame at being part of the male species, I will never think about sex in the same way again. Noe has an extraordinary problem with his own masculinity, almost an embarrassment.

A lot of the scenes are seen as glimpses without a clear shot. The camera floats from scene to scene seemingly continuously by rotating upside down, left right... This sickening cinematographic treatment is very interesting and catchy... As original as the treatments in Blair Witch was in its time.I strongly recommend that women and children not see this as it is *very* disturbing and could cause phobias.

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.One of the giants of film, Kubrick's contribution was an exploration of plastic narrative within the story. A simple story just happens and the narrative stance is one of simple observance. Kubrick looked at competing perspectives, for instance `2001' shifts among three perspectives (the human, HAL, the new consciousness), each with its own truth. The result is that any of all of it could be untrue or heavily colored. While focused on tone, Kubrick never worked with extending this to the eye of the camera as dePalma has.Now we have a blizzard of projects that honk around with the order of time, the stance of the camera, the truth of what is happening versus what is imagined, the introduction of ghost narrators, and the extremes of fantasy versus reality. All this is rolled into one package for us here, all the while quoting Kubrick's subtle tale of imagined futures (sexual fantasies and consequences): `Eyes.' We have the twelve sequences played in reverse, obvious enough. The trick is that when presented this way, we accept the events that happened later in time as if they really did because we have seen them and noted their brutality. They are played (once the camera stops swirling) each in one single take which makes them seem more real and our position more inescapably anchored in that reality.We have the camera which is the dervish instrument in finding the appropriate universe between scenes and showing what is going on there. This eye is bluntly veristic when it arrives, but notably unachored when it seeks registration in the next reality. At few times does it stay where a person might, always flitting into spots that are not those of a normal dramatic viewer, rather a ghostly presence which subliminally turns us into imagined beings.We discover at the end, sixth-sense wise, that all we have seen is probably an Alice-like musing on the grass from reading a book and ending in a tunnel-like fantasy. `Alice in Wonderland' incidentally has twelve sequences. Alice (here Alex) is in a sexually unfulfilling marriage with Marcus. She imagines having a child (put the sequences back in order) and life of unconstrained sex with his friend Pierre, indeed a situation where they talk constantly about how Marcus couldn't satisfy her. Pierre wants anal sex, so her `child' becomes a tapeworm (tenia). And so it goes.Or not. We equally have an equally powerful framing device in the beginning with `the Butcher' from a previous film, talking to a (real life) film director, telling a story that becomes the story we see coming from the utterly fantastic Rectum. Some elements which support this ironic narration: that opening scene includes an inanimate (comatose?) woman whose right foot is briefly seen. The pedestrian in the tunnel who briefly views the rape is probably Pierre, who is later told that half as much energy as finding La Tenia could have saved Alex and to think about it. La Tenia is not the guy killed, merely a friend.Or maybe even not that. What we may have is a `Jules and Jim' situation where a contested beauty is `invented' as a matter of competitive sexual fantasies.I am quite a bit less impressed with a filmmaker who copies ideas, but the synthesis here of ideas from others is very competent. At least this is intelligent fare, not at all like `Baise-Moi' to which it is frequently compared. It is not graceful or original, but it is competent and effective as can be.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie most likely polarizes the audience. Yes, it is graphical and will touch everybody who is capable of emotions. Yes, the characters are believable although I wish they would never be real. Do people who watch this brutality benefit from experiencing it? Do I need to witness such decadence, rage and brutal killing, sick behavior and endless despair in order to learn, understand more, be more fit for life? I personally don't. I respect others who say they do. This choice, however, should be limited to those who have a chance to cope with the impressions. This movie should never get in front of adolescents or kids!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by telling you that I am a scholar in literature with a profound interest for literature in general and the works of the Russian masters in particular. Modern day authors are often completely uninteresting for me, since they fail to comment on questions that are immortal for mankind and only submits to shallowness.With that being said you might not be surprised when I tell you I tend to look for the same thing in movies. Sure I can watch a movie purely for the entertainment factor, but the ones that become favourites are always profound and often splits its audience in two halves. What prompted me to write this review was scanning the comments that have been written on "Irreversible" before. It seems many who watch this movie does so with the wrong kind of preconceptions, resulting in displeasure when it fails to live up to their expectations. Also, the curse of humanity is that stupid people have no way of knowing that they are, so there is no way keeping them from watching movies they do not understand.Not only do I hold this movie as the best one ever made, but also doubt there will ever be one as good in the future either. Pretty strong words, yes, and I should probably tell you why... Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, in "Irreversible" is there for a reason. Every move of the camera, every word spoken and every face made by an actor. Let me point out a few of these: 1. The inverted chronology is there to enhance the atrocities the characters live through and increase the sympathy any sane person would feel for them. It is NOT a gimmick to draw attention to the movie, nor a rip off from "Memento".2. Many of my friends have (unfortunatley) misunderstood the reasons for some of the dialogue in the movie and found them excessive. They are not! They are there to make it impossible for the intelligent viewer not to identify with the characters. The unmasked realism makes it impossible to say "it's just a movie" and leaves you pondering the issues raised by Noé long after you've finished watching.3. The controversial scene everyone talked about (and Noé was accused of making so long to draw attention to the movie) is constituted also in a way to reach a climax of realism and transfer some of the pain the character feels unto the viewer. I was both sweating and shivering from paroxysms of fury when I watched it, but as Aeschylus said "With suffering comes wisdom".This movie is as close as a movie will ever get to literature and actually adds depht with its format (which is extremely rare). Anyone attempting to adapt the screenplay and rewrite it as a novel would fail.Basically if you like a movie to end when it ends, don't watch this one. If, however, you like to be left with thoughts open for discussion and interpretation and have a chance to evolve as a human being, this is for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, pretentious, typically French.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Try as they might, the French cannot make an "artistic" film without making the subject matter too sick for human consumption. In this blatant ripoff of the unique storytelling method born in "Memento", the film is told in 5 minute sequences in reverse order. It includes an incredibly annoying revolving camera as an opening, in a not-so-subtle attempt to demonstrate how badly things have spun out of control. Needless to say that when you get to the end of the film which is of course the beginning of the story, it is in vibrant colour and perfectly steady. Had the director not insisted on prolonging the agony, perhaps he would have gotten away with it. Instead, he goes on for 20 minutes spinning his camera in a very improbably gay leather bar, trying to shock the audience into appreciating his work. He also faded all the colours, leaving only a hazy red washout, ostensibly depicting the depravity occurring around the central character. It doesn't work.As pointed out by every reviewer on IMDB, there is a very brutal rape scene that just goes on and on. The point was made, there was no need to make the audience physically ill. I understand it was the director's intent to try to explain the horror of rape, however the sheer brutality presented to the viewer is totally gratuitous. I have endured years of Palme d'Or films since moving to Paris, and most are so pretentious and unwatchable that it makes me laugh to read "art" critics speak of the "pioneering spirit of new-age filmmakers". In all honesty, most French films vying for top honours at Cannes are trite, non-sensical, and shocking exposes each attempting to outdo the other in terms of "artistic vision". The prevailing attitude amongst those who buy into this idea is that if you do not understand the films, you are obviously a peasant. Irreversible fits nicely into this category. It is nothing more than a different take on "Romance X", "Baise Moi", and "The Pornographe". Each tries valiantly to shock the audience, showing as much flesh as possible in the most demeaning way possible. BORING! OBVIOUS! If the directors had any talent they wouldn't have to make movies that only rely on their shock value for any sort of commercial or critical success.This film is brutal, vicious, and utterly without restraint. The characters are wooden, you couldn't care less about them, they are carefree partiers, annoying, irresponsible, and without any direction in life. What a travesty, this film belongs on the Cannes trash heap.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning cinematic achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Gasper Noe's wonderful I STAND ALONE, Gasper Noe's IRREVERSIBLE is also the work of a unique visionary.The film is notorious for its extended rape sequence and fire extinguisher beating, but it is also a scathing study of the male animal and an exercise in style that is never gratuitous.Fans of rape-themed movies will not go home unimpressed with the brutal staging of Monica Belluci's rape; nor will fans of extreme violence be disappointed with what transpires in The Rectum. But it is the film's incredible soundscape that initially arrests our attention with its industrial drone that becomes the aural equivalent of a pendulum swinging just inches above our faces.The camerawork mirrors the emotional state of Vincent Cassel, the male lead, and, as the film unspools in reverse, so does the camera retreat from its wild, anarchic rhythm to a state of peace and fixed composition.Noe is an uncompromising soul who fixates on a theme and gallops to the horizon with it.IRREVERSIBLE joins films like IN A GLASS CAGE, ASSAULT JACK THE RIPPER, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and BEAUTIFUL GIRL HUNTER in their shared defiance of all that's bland and wrong with most of today's cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that whips you from the beginning to the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was little I read a lot of articles and reviews about this film on newspapers and magazines. They stuck with my head through the years, especially the things told about the 'rape scene'. I Googled 'Irreversible' between October-November 2002 and came up with almost same reviews. Then I decided to watch it out of curiosity. Unexpectedly, I loved it very much. Saying unexpectedly because I tried to watch Noe's film 'Enter the Void' twice, and I couldn't finish it ( gave me headaches ) that's because when opening credits of Irreversible started to roll I hesitated to watch. But gave it a chance. The film's main purpose is to disturb the audience and it achieves this. It looks like a plain and dull movie but deeper it means something. To see those characters' dreams, plans, pains and wills to live were great. And was almost unbearable to witness of them getting destroyed. I think the famous rape scene is overrated but it's something to see. In my humble opinion, fire extinguisher scene was much much much more disturbing. I give it 10 because of Cassel's acting and Noe's great vision. This film is a must-see. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extreme. Genius. Art. Irreversible. I'm left numb and in a daze.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is film? Is it only for entertainment, or something much more? In most cases people watch films to be entertained for an hour or two and then move on. But then if your a real film lover like me and appreciate art you will appreciate an absolute genius at work here. I'm left absolutely numb after viewing this film. I will never forget it and truthfully, I am lost for words after this one. (bear with me) I'm sure all of you are aware of the subject matter in this film and that it is extremely brutal, the most brutal I have seen in fact.Having the movie run in reverse chronological order was a very intelligent choice for this film, because you know what's coming and exactly when its coming before the scene actually begins, but nothing can prepare you for how shocking the scene is, I mean that, take note of that! I must give the utmost credit to Monica Belucci for taking on such a role, it must have been incredibly difficult. It was filmed almost unbearably realistically and I'm sure the majority of viewers will find it hard not to look away... (The actress herself has apparently never been able to watch the scene..)I've ran out of words, I am totally drained actually. Basically films show us the real world, and though it was hard to stomach, I'm glad I watched it, and I fully appreciate it. Jesus I'm knocked out... I may have to review this one again later on..Overall Opinion: Its a controversial film, so come to think of it, these reviews probably wont help you either way! But if you can gather from this review how much it had an effect on me then you must realise that surely this is a film that needs to be seen...</fullReview>

The first 15 minutes are a near-descent into Abyss, with twisting camera movements and 20 minutes into the film, Damn it left me shaking... The Camera angles suits the Atmosphere of IRREVERSIBLE. Grim,Nihilistic &amp; Melancholic that's the tag for the Camera Angles.. and from then on there was no turning back.. there are handful of films that entertains and on the other hand there are few films which engages... Films that keeps us hooked on and unravel in our minds for a period of time.. Well IRREVERSIBLE did the latter for me..

		<shortDescription>Brilliant joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Controversial, but some people don't get the joke.The opening scene is strange - it relies on two characters from a previous film (prequel or sequel?), who end up commenting on the racket from a police raid on a buggery club down below, Le Rectum.Intriguing, but then the action kicks off with the spinning camera work and only calms down after 25 mins - it felt like 5.Then there's a chase, and I finally twigged we were travelling back in time. The brutal scene in the underpass, the party, the pregnancy, the unsatisfactory relationship, the innocent desire for children, and spinning out into the cosmos.The camera work and music was awesome. Acting was spot on. The only reservation I had was with the scene in the train, where the characters become typically talkie-talkie in the French way. And I'm not sure they followed up on the pill given to the ape character. But still, it's a 10/10.The Joke? The irreversible was reversed. Entropy and time's arrow were sent back to where they came from. Hollywood can do clever stuff, but not a patch on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Irréversible' may be one of the relevant films of the last 20, maybe 30 years. Yes, it is shocking on the first viewings but this is not a film made only for that purpose. At its core, Irréversible is a powerful manifestation of the human condition, of our bounds to the little details that surround us and how helpless we really are against destiny. If you look past the nausea-inflicting soundtrack you will also find one of the most step-by-step perfect films ever made. The color, the lighting, the pace, the camera movement, the acting and the script are all made with such mastery that at the end you will find yourself troubled by such a disturbing message delivered in such a beautiful package. The much- discussed non-linear narrative has also an elemental purpose; instead of telling us a tale that goes from hopeful to bleak as many similarly- themed films, the director chooses to end the film with the brightest, innocent scene, and that is the scene that lingers in the viewer, not the rape or the head-smash, but the image of joy. Not all monsters were born that way. Kudos for Gaspar Noé, Monica Bellucci, and Vincent Cassel for giving us truly a masterpiece. Le temps détruit tout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits you like a ton of fire extinguishers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't my first taste of Gaspar Noe as I have seen I Stand Alone, which I liked a lot. The directing was incredibly stylish and the violence brutally shocking, however I felt like it lacked potential. I thought it could've been something really great if it had a stronger plot, as it was basically a depraved butcher walking around and giving vile monologues on how much he hates life. I still liked it though, and I especially saw the potential in Gaspar Noe as a film maker. It's Irreversible where Noe shines beautifully.The film instantly grabbed me with its seriously unusual opening. The credits roll back up and sort of spin around to show the title card, "Irreversible" with some unsettling music playing in the background. The camera then spins in an incredibly disorientating manner to show a creepy shot of the butcher from I Stand Alone. The actors' names then all flash up on the screen in a super stylish manner which utterly gripped me. It's one of the best title sequences I've seen, but enough about titles. There's much more to Irreversible than that.Irreversible begins in the depths of hell and ends in some sort of stroboscopic utopia. It's a startling contrast and a brilliant one. The opening is incredibly intense as Marcus and Pierre enter a frightening gay club called, "The Rectum". Marcus is full of rage and we have no idea why. He marches through the club asking anyone and everyone where "The Tape Worm" is. The directing here is nothing short of masterful. The camera-work is like Darren Aronofsky on acid and his very own slimming pills. It's all done in one shot, making it incredibly intense as the camera hypnotically floats around in a chaotic and disorientating close-up. Not only that but there's a startling siren soundtrack which only serves to heighten the intense atmosphere.I was shocked to see that the much talked about fire extinguisher scene was in this early on. It very much feels like the climax of the film as it's full of such anger, rage and raw intensity. It's easy to see why the extinguisher scene is so talked about as it's unflinchingly graphic and extraordinarily brutal, however to say it's gratuitous is ridiculous as it doesn't feel like glamorised movie violence at all. It feels frighteningly real and is extremely relevant to the film's characters and themes.Just like Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, Memento the film is told in reverse. At first I wasn't sure if it worked entirely as all the horror and the madness was placed near the beginning which means the film becomes more and more soft, however then I realised that it was the perfect way to tell the story. Not only does it show that violent actions cannot be reversed, but it also allows us to feel sympathy for the characters and forces us to place ourselves in their shoes as we play detective.Now, you can't talk about Irreversible without talking about the infamous rape scene which occurs half-way through the film and is the most important scene in the film. It feels far too real as the camera shakily follows Alex down the underground tunnel and encounters a deranged sadist who brutally rapes her. This scene feels all the more harrowing as up until now the camera has been insanely mobile and hypnotically dreamlike. Here Noe keeps the camera deathly still like Haneke, as we're forced to endure Alex's ordeal. It almost feels like the audience is being raped too. It's shocking and shockingly realistic. The only time the camera moves during the 10 minutes is when the stranger picks up Alex's head and slams it on the floor. The camera moves in order for the audience to witness this brutality in unflinching detail.Some have called this scene gratuitous and even accused it of titillating the audience which I find ridiculous. Rape is something that happens all the time, yet most films are too scared to tackle it. Noe tackles the issue head on and shows us all what rape is really like. It isn't pretty and it isn't supposed to be either. Only a sadist would find the scene a turn on.The rest of the film is mainly concerned with showing us the relationship between Alex and Marcus. It's all the more tragic to watch as we know how the night is going to turn out, whilst the characters are utterly oblivious. The directing is still absolutely stunning. I loved the party sequence which follows Marcus, Alex and Pierre around all in one shot with deafening music. It feels like you're actually there! We're also treated to some detailed conversations about sex on a subway and a heart-breaking romantic scene between Alex and Marcus. These scenes have a layered and tragic quality about them as we know exactly what is going to happen next.The acting is extraordinary. Vincent Cassel is the best I've ever seen him be and the relationship between the characters is utterly believable. Although it does help that Vincent and Monica were actually in a relationship during the time of filming. Monica is also sensational, especially during the gruelling rape scene where I could've almost cried out for her. The end scene is unlike anything I've ever seen and will stay with me for a long time.Irreversible is a harrowing masterpiece. The scenes of violence and sexual violence are amongst the most shocking I've ever seen. It's a film which wants to show you the dark side of life. Time destroys everything as we do not know what the future has in store for us. It's a tragic and powerful piece of filmmaking with extraordinary directing and acting. Small-minded critics may mistake the film as a gratuitous piece of work, but it really isn't. Irreversible feels real and is an intense and powerful experience which I'd recommend with caution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Irreversible, but I had no idea I was watching the film from back to front until quite a way into the film, which made me wish I'd paid more attention to the start of the film.Watching a film in which you know what's going to happen because it's already happened is pretty strange. I guess the beginning, I mean the end, of the film is supposed to make us deplore the rape scene in the middle of the film even more, getting us thinking, over time, about the depravity of people who understand nothing other than seeking out personal thrills. It certainly got me thinking and here I am typing out this review, but it didn't shock me in the way I'd hoped or expected.On a positive note, the rape scene itself was more graphic than I had anticipated, especially as the film had incorporated so much blurry camera work beforehand. Here it seemed to steady down and just focus on this intense, pivotal point of the film. I'm thankful for that detail because I had expected the director to skip over this scene. There was also quite a lot of nudity which was another sordid surprise from a person seeking gory kicks, but besides the obviously alluring beauty of Monica Belluci, the film failed to really bind me to the characters. If you don't really feel for the protagonists, why should you care about their ultimate plight, regardless of how gruesome it is?I didn't find the film as shocking or harrowing as I was expecting. I enjoyed it and I'll no doubt watch it again if I get the chance, maybe upgrading my review by a star over time, but for now it hits a steady seven as solid, interesting, inventive entertainment, but not quite as disturbing or gripping as I'd hoped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Head Spinning, Eyes Hurting Vulgar Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a serious head trip. Most people won't even get to see the whole thing because of the dizzying vertigo camera work. Seriously, about 15-20 mins of the film is showing the sky, room, or something else with the camera constantly spinning. There's like 8-10mins of this at the very end of the film with flashing lights. I literally just fast forwarded through it. If you have Epilepsy or are prone to seizures, do not watch this film. Seriously.There is a story here. It's about a couple Alex &amp; Marcus, who go to a high society party with their friend Pierre who was once Alex's boyfriend. He still has strong feelings for her, but is very happy that his friend Marcus is with her now. Marcus gets drunk at the party and Alex decides to leave, even though Pierre begs her to stay. He also tells Marcus to go after her, but he refuses. Alex decides to take an underground tunnel that passes under the street to get to the other side. She runs into a man (we find out earlier that his name is Le Tenia) who's talking to a woman. The woman he's talking to breaks free from his grip and escapes. Tenia approaches Alex and after a few harsh words, he throws her to the ground and brutal rapes her. The rape is somewhat graphic. There is some nudity, but the belittling and verbal abuse Tenia does to Alex is over the top. Very graphic and cruel. The beating is even worse. Of course Marcus &amp; Pierre later find out and seek revenge on Tenia.What's interesting about the film is it's told in reverse (hence the name 'Irreversable'). The film actually starts with Marcus and Pierre running through a gay orgy house called "The Rectum" looking for Tenia. You'll have to see for yourself what happens when they finally find him. Then the next chapter shows how they got the info to find him. Eventually the film will end at the very beginning of the story, which is a happy and sad moment.The best scenes in this whole film are "the train ride to the party" and "Alex &amp; Marcus at their apartment before the party talking." You can truly see and feel how much love they have for one another in these scenes (Monica &amp; Vincent are married in real life you know). The train scene is interesting because you learn more about Alex &amp; Pierre's relationship and nothing is held back. Every secret is brought out to the opening. It's a little hard watching it in subtitles because they talk so fast. The acting is very well done in these scenes. Vincent Cassel, Albert D. and Monica B. are all very good here. Even Jo Prestia is good as the vicious bad guy.What kills this film is the crazy camera work and some obnoxious scenes that are a bit over the top. The trip through the Rectum club was just torture for me. I wanted them to hurry up and find Tenia and get the hell out of there. The fact that there is a real bar called Rectum is just disgusting to me. I would never set foot in a place like that. I can understand why people walked out of the theater. The first 20mins is hard to stomach. I understand why they played it in reverse, but the crazy camera scenes seem to be there to make you nauseated and extend the film. The film is only about 75-80mins long really. If you must see this, Netflix is the place to watch it. It's currently streaming right now.I gave this 5/10.</fullReview>

That is why I watched it, but after watching it would not be on my top 20 anything list.For me I had a hard time watching it when the camera was spinning not shaky like the Blair Witch, literally the people are sometimes sideways on the screen. The spinning goes along with the music like a amusement park ride. At parts I had to fast forward until the screen stopped spinning.The effects in the fight and beating were very well done not the CG stuff in a lot of movie. The attack on the women was long, and did not add anything for me by being that long and showing me the whole event. In an Eye for an Eye we only see blurred images and the phone on the ground but that was move emotional upsetting for me.I gave this such a low rating because I really had a hard time watching it with the spinning.

It takes a time worn exploitation premise - that of the "rape and revenge" tale - and gives it a "Memento" style spin by telling the entire story backwards.It plays out over the course of one day, focusing on a sort of lovers triangle - Alex (Monica Bellucci), Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel) - and the strains in the relationship that lead to the untenable circumstance of Alex being raped in an underground tunnel by a demented stranger. Of course, since this tale is being told in reverse order, this event actually occurs around the midway point and the graphic revenge takes place near the beginning of the movie.If nothing else, Noe does an excellent job of thoroughly disorienting the viewer with the dizzying camera moves and the often very moody cinematography. This movie has a palpable atmosphere that really gets under ones' skin, especially when one considers the extended sequence(s) inside the gay night club - which is dubbed "The Rectum" - where the revenge takes place.The three leads deliver impeccable performances (Bellucci and Cassel were an actual couple at the time of filming); Philippe Nahon from Noes' earlier "I Stand Alone" makes a brief cameo. The dialogue of full of sexually frank lines.The pummelling of a victim using a fire extinguisher is fairly potent stuff; if Noes' intent was to make the viewer uncomfortable, he succeeds admirably. For one thing, the rape sequence goes on for an awfully long time, and is punctuated by the rapist assaulting poor Alex. The director certainly displays incredible audacity in taking a very unflinching look at material that many viewers would find repellent. It's truly disorienting that because of the gimmick the story starts getting lighter and more appealing as it progresses, "ending" on a happy note. Once it's over, it's impossible to not get the message of Noes' movie: that any (bad) thing can happen to anybody at any time, and that we can all be capable of the most savage acts if properly provoked.I would recommend this movie, but only to those who appreciate those movies that go to the darkest of places.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Realistic on screen violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was told not to watch this movie by a friend of mine, who, like everybody else, had certain moral judgments about this movie. I'm pretty sure that if any of what happens in the movie was real, it would've been very hard to watch. Knowing this made me watch it a bit like a horror movie: sure, terrible things happen, but you know they are fake. The story is told in reverse order. This actually made it easier to watch. Once you have seen the opening scene, things progress from bad to better. Besides feeling a bit contrivedly 'artistic', it reduced my sympathy for the characters, because you do not get to know them before terrible things happen to them. It's style is fast-paced and absorbing. There is some graphic violence and sex, though I've actually seen much more graphic stuff on screen recently. The soundtrack and the acting make it feel slightly nauseating and uncomfortable (perhaps disgusting, if you take it seriously), which results in a more accurate portrayal of violence than I have ever seen on a screen. 'Irreversible', while being far from fun to watch, succeeds at being a unique movie that you will remember for a long time after. It also left me wondering: do we really want be numbed to this kind of violence by watching hyper-realistic movies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreversible??... Unforgettable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone will talk about the 2 scenes of graphic violence in Irreversible (especially the rape scene). These 2 scenes are rightly notorious and the rape scene especially is something I had no chance of preparing myself for. It is gruelling horror. However, Irreversible has some scenes of genuine beauty(especially towards the end of the film) which in my opinion are just as memorable. Scenes like Monica Bellucci washing in the shower and then laying on the bed with Vincent Cassell are humane, natural, moving and initmate. I also believe that the best shot in the film is saved for last with Monica laying out on grass in what seems to be Spring sunshine. The camera starts off near, overhead and then begins to spiral up and start an ascent in to the sky whilst still looking down on Monica's beauty. Resulting in a dream like sequence and beautiful artistic mastery.The fact that the last 3rd (or so) of the film is so beautiful and compassionate is vitally important. After viewing what I believe is the most violent scene (the rape) that I have ever witnessed in any movie. I needed to see in the latter parts of the film scenes that were tender, touching, soft, natural and at the same time believable. Irreversible delivered. Not a film that I will watch over and over again but certainly a film that I will never forget and importantly for me not just because of the violence.However, Irreversible isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea. Some people believe that the rape scene (sorry to refer to 'that' scene again) is offensive and glorifying violence. I am of the belief that this opinion is rubbish. The perpetrator mocks his victim and the violence is graphic but it felt real to me and I was sickened but not offended by the scene. I ask myself, if I were going to make a movie that included a rape scene, would I want to hold back or water it down so as not to try and offend a few people? Absolutely not and why would anyone want to do that? Rape is an horrific crime so you might as well portray it that way, for what it is. I didn't't enjoy watching that scene but it is undeniably a remarkable piece of cinema also.I would suggest you only watch Irreversible if you have an open mind and if you're keen to see more than just the violence that everyone talks about. Because if it's just the violence that you are interested in, I believe you are missing the point of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the kings as far as world cinema goes. Everybody hears about the 2 scenes in this movie that shock and are hard to watch... i agree they really are as described but there's so much more to this film then them 2 scenes. The character development, the acting, the storyline, the unravelling of why what you see at the beginning of the film is happening. This was a mind blower. A film i highly recommend as long as you can get past the 2 extremely hard hitting scenes and believe me they are not over hyped they really are hard to watch and extremely disturbing. I own the collectors edition of this on DVD and easily recommend it to anyone really into hard hitting films with serious directing and character development the acting is supreme and watching the movie that starts at the end and finishes at the beginning is an incredible journey with Irreversible that keeps you hooked, guessing and shocked at the same time. Great movie a solid 9 from me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible is a nightmarish, never ending trip, starting with the nauseous scenes at the "Rectum" bar. This place is filmed with a camera which never stops rotating; I mean, it really never stops. Sometimes you have to turn your head away from the screen. The mood is heavy as hell, with a dark-red tone, and there are gays making out everywhere, some of them doing very hardcore stuff. We are searching for a guy named Tenia, even though we don't know why. We want to kill him, yet we don't know what he has done. This film has a reverse chronological order. As such, we go backwards in time to understand why we want that person dead. As we travel backwards in time we find some evidence that we are doomed for every action we take. As time is one direction only, every thing we do is Irreversible. So the "Time destroys everything" motif.Marcus could have not taken drugs thus provoking the discussion on the party, witch ended in Alex leaving. Alex could have gone through the surface. But someone said it was better to use the tunnel. and so on. Noe's Irreversible reminds us that we are free to do what we want , but time is our death, our destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and shocking film that goes in a reverse chronological order, but nothing really astonishing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From just few film I seen directed by this guy, I can tell Gaspar Noé is a ballsy director and from his works you can sort of tell Stanley Kubrick was one of his inspiration sort of. camera work is very nauseating at times now I know why it went in this direction but a 10 yr old could hold the camera more properly and sometimes don't even know what is going on during certain scenes. I don't know if that was the aim to make the audience nauseating or just trying to seem artsy but I didn't like it. Maybe it was to try and make everything seem more grimy and ugly on purpose to show the nature of the people and direction of it all. What makes this movie unique though is that it goes in a reverse chronological order where you see how the story end and from than on it goes in the direction of the beginning of the story. This is basically a disturbing movie with some shock value but nothing really outstanding. The reverse chronological order in a movie, maybe has been done before but the way it managed to pull it off is pretty simple and yet sort of intriguing. Gaspar Noe seems to be a director that doesn't have regards to the audience or the actors or actresses when it comes to their well-being. Which can be a positive or a negative depending on who is watching this movie. I don't particularly think this movie has notions of enjoyment or even entertainment, but other dark notions. This movie really isn't for everyone, most mainstream audiences may actually dislike this movie. But it does have it's target audiences, I didn't find this movie to be uber terrible but it wasn't anything astonishing either.6.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Film like 'Irréversible' is not meant for the faint-hearted at all. It's a disturbing film, with Strong violence and a brutal rape scene. Director Gaspar Noé, succeeds by making a film that offers shock value and a bitter hangover.What works in this non-linear narrative, is it's writing. Of course, this film is not going to be hailed by everyone. But I found the Screenplay absorbing &amp; disturbing. It held me, the entire dull atmosphere is upsetting, but that works on it's advantage, as this story is meant to shock you.Gaspar Noé knew what he was getting into. Since it's release, the film has become hugely controversial and has remained as a boy-cotted topic in general discussions on films of the early 2000's.Monica Bellucci delivers an awesome performance. Vincent Cassel is fabulous, he lives his character from scene A to Z. Albert Dupontel is good.On the whole, Watch 'Irréversible', only if you have a strong heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where you'll never look at cinema violence again, in the same way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the story: two men search Paris for a man who cruelly beats and rapes a woman, the girl friend of one of the searchers. They find the man and kill him, or so they think. That's it, in two sentences; how the story is told is what makes it almost unique.Technically, this film is well done: innovative cinematography, truly imaginative use of high and low, angular shots, editing the like of which I've never seen before, incredibly discordant sound, and lighting that makes the whole experience surreal. In fact, viewers with epileptic disorders are advised not to see this film. In the Extras section of the DVD I watched, I discovered that the whole film was shot using a mix of 16mm and 35mm ? and then digitized, thus allowing for infinite manipulation of the imagery, sound and so on.So, it's a stunning experience in the art and craft of film-making, as much as it is one of the most repulsive ? indeed disgusting ? stories I've yet seen. Only Salo (1975) exceeds the excesses of human misery displayed in Irreversible. However, I'm glad I've seen it; yet, I'd not bother to see it again.In the tradition of films like Memento (2000), the story begins at the end, and works backwards in time. That also adds to the experimental nature of this production. So, again, it's interesting to watch to see how the director keeps the story in sync by telling it backwards. Interesting, yes; but not a technique for mainstream viewers, generally.So, why do it? Well, when starting at the horrific end, and then moving backwards in narrative flow, we know what's been; hence, we have a heightened sense of dread for the main characters, particularly the young woman who is brutally and viciously raped in an extended scene that must rank as the most gut-wrenching, horrific and voyeuristic piece of filming yet done. Violence is not just for bad guys, though. For example, Marcus (Cassel) as the hero searching for the rapist is seen beating up on various women to elicit information needed to find the rapist: hence, the rapist and Marcus are separated by degree only.The actors are without equal in this film; one wonders how they could have even performed so well ? the violence looks and sounds so real, you want to close your eyes, but can't.Which brings out the even more horrific thought: maybe the director wants each viewer to find out just what sort of a person s/he is, by either turning off or turning on? You decide, if you want to see it.So, give it five for technical excellence, acting, and innovative narrative structure; give it a half for a run-of-the-mill-story; and another half for having the chutzpah to make it.Overall, I recommend this film only for students and professionals of film art and craft. It's not entertainment; and I don't think it was meant to be. But, of course, you can prove me wrong by seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant attack on the audience by one of France's most skilled Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite directors of all time and one of my favorite movies. "Irreversible" is an experience unlike any other. Gaspar Noe uses reverse-chronological story telling to give us one of the most visceral and frightening encounters you are ever likely to have in the Cinema. The film is beautifully shot and intensely acted. "Irreversible" is Noe's first use of the floating camera technique that he also used in the 2009 film "Enter The Void", another roller-coaster of a film. Not surprisingly, this film is not for everyone. It is widely known as one of the most difficult movies to watch due to the graphic violence and long rape scene so be warned. But it is not just a shock film, it has an important message about relationships and how the decisions we make ultimately decide our fate.The story involves a couple played by Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel who after a heated argument split ways for the evening. Alex, played by Bellucci, gets fed up with her boyfriend Marcus (Cassel) and leaves the safety of her friends to go home. A decision we eventually find out is a near fatal one. Marcus finds out that his love has been brutally raped and beaten on her way home. This sends him into a rage of revenge and he will not stop until he finds the one responsible. Along the way Marcus' best friend and Alex's former lover tries to convince him to leave it be so he won't do something he will regret. As you can imagine, he is unsuccessful."Irreversible" starts at the end of the story and ends at the beginning, much like the movie "Memento" by Christopher Nolan. A decision that could have gone either way. Most people like the reverse story telling, I think it could have gone either way. Gaspar Noe is known to push the limits and make his audience as uncomfortable as he can by graphically presenting topics that are hard to witness and think about. In this outing he decides to hit you with the heaviest scenes in the beginning and middle of the movie then ending with the character development. Thankfully, the third act was designed to slowly bring the audience back from the horror they have just seen. By the end you have (slightly) come to terms with the earlier terror and you are left with an array of emotions.The production team Noe surrounds himself with are some of the best in the business. "Irreversible" is a marvel of film making using dreary soundtracks and showcasing the seedy underbelly of France. As mentioned before the use of the floating camera is outstanding; a major challenge since it was filmed using cables suspended in the air. It's as if you are on a ride, one that you want to get off but can't; the ultimate "fly on the wall" experience."Irreversible" was filmed with a loose script and literally no dialogue. In fact, the infamous rape scene was essentially free-form by Bellucci and La Tenia, the antagonist played by Jo Prestia. Gaspar used one long take from a fixed camera to film this scene which made a huge impact. It caused the viewer to believe they are witnessing an actual rape on camera. It truly is the most difficult scene I have ever witnessed. Many people walked out due to this scene during the premier, cursing the director. Noe, however, loves to get these reactions as it shows his goal to push the boundaries was successful. Cassel and Bellucci have amazing chemistry (it helps they are actually married). Bellucci is as beautiful as ever and Cassel presents an intensity rarely seen from actors. I think having his wife presented with such a horrific experience pushed him further. Pretty much all of the other characters were cast with unknowns or people that haven't acted at all which pushed the realism.It has been over a year since my first viewing of this film and I still think about it. "Irreversible" is not a film that can easily be watched over and over and probably shouldn't be. Afterward you feel drained, angry, sad and confused. Confused because you aren't sure whether you just watched one of the worst or best films ever made. If you are up for the challenge, I highly recommend giving this a shot, but be warned it's not for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gaspar Noe has made the sickest film that I have ever seen. It is a shocking portrayal of the thin strand which separates us all from normalcy and absolute, utter horror. No one with even a slightly uneasy stomach should even think about seeing this film. It makes Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer, look like a walk in the park with Fido. That said, and I can't believe I am even thinking this, it is a terribly well made look at what passes both for happiness and torture around human existence. It is not gratuitous in the sense that we begin with ruin, and pass, albeit forever changed, to innocence. It is shocking in the depiction of truly terrible violence, toward men, and especially toward women. It is time in reverse. It is damage, it is regret, it is jealousy. It is as well a very clever allowance paid to us, the viewer, to appreciate what we hold in our hands, our hearts, and our lives. It is also undeniably sick and messed up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing Irreversible, one cannot help but ask who the film was intended for. It is quite possible that Irreversible was intended to please no one, not even art critics. Indeed, this nasty piece of work almost drowns in self-indulgence. Director Gaspar Noé is clearly not satisfied unless he can steal the title of 'most disturbing film' or something of that sort. Irreversible turns a world of decency and convention upside down, resulting in a film that might literally hurt to watch, but maybe that is why Irreversible deserves some credit...it has balls.I guess it counts for something when a movie decides to run backwards (obviously a decision influenced by Memento) with every scene done in single shots. It must also count for something when considering that few movies ask us to endure a ten minute rape scene which is as vulgar as anything in movie history. The style of cinematography is also unheard of, but effective and distinctive and strangely brilliant. Pieces of Irreversible, if isolated from the rest of the movie, look like something that was literally produced and shot in hell. The last shot is especially epic, and may actually have the capacity to actually cause brain damage to any frail person in the audience.There is no denying that Irreversible is a film that wants to hurt. It takes a crazy genius or a heartless fascist to do something like this. Only objective film-goers will be able to sit through this film and appreciated what it does well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of alternative, indie and foreign films, I wanted to see this. The way the filmmaker plays with the time line, bouncing forward and backward, is excellent and achieves the desired effect of upping the suspense and making the audience want to continue watching.Vincent Cassel is always good as a physical, visceral French actor in a league full of bloated, overly intellectual performances. His cohort, Albert Dupontel's Pierre, is a calm counterpoint to Cassel's Marcus who is an emotional loose cannon.BUT, I just had one problem. As usual, a glowingly beautiful model (Monica Bellucci) plays the lead, Alex. Most French filmmakers cast women who are photogenic above all else. Who cares if they can even say their lines? Just as long as they look stunning in wide-angle shots.Bellucci's Alex is dead flat and predictable. She's a prop shoved up against Marcus, the live wire. She even has trouble delivering some of the key lines in the film, like when she mentions a premonitory dream she has or stumbles when talking about a philosophy book she's reading (ya know, that's all French model/actresses do? lay in parks all day in skimpy dresses while reading philosophy). They may as well had her say no lines and instead just walk around with a big sign on her forehead (or ass) that says FEMALE VICTIM.My biggest problem with the rape scene isn't the length or graphic violence, but the flaccid, helpless behavior of Alex. She doesn't run, she doesn't kick, doesn't bite, punch -- or really DO anything most rape victims do when attacked. Several minutes go by before the evil rapist even bothers to pull out his modest pocket knife but does Alex try and knee him in the groin? No. She whimpers, avoids making eye contact with the camera and then cowers for 9 long minutes while he sodomizes her and then beats her into a coma.I can't help but wonder what my favorite French filmmaker, Patrice Chéreau, would have done with this umpteenth re-telling of the stock Revenge Fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a strong female lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's a pretty cool movie but as a female, I have to say that the rape scene seemed unrealistic and even slightly eroticized - though everything that happens immediately afterwards is very clearly NOT. What's with that? This is the thing that always bugs me about rape in movies: the act itself is not depicted as being as physically and emotionally violent as being kicked or punched in the head. And yet any woman who's been through it would tell you different. Without giving any spoilers away I also want to say that the kind of sexual assault that is depicted in this film is far more consistent with a date rape, so the only thing I felt while watching was frustration with the men who wrote and directed the film. Did they REALLY think that women can be that passive when facing stranger-violence? Experience tells me that we are not. But I will let you, the female viewer, watch it and decide for herself.That's the only comment I think I need to add here, as the movie is very well reviewed by all the other people who have written something about it. If you're a woman, don't be afraid of watching this: you won't be as shocked and horrified as male viewers expect you to be. the Accused is a far more graphic and upsetting film by a factor of 10. Far from being the physical violence, it was the emotional violence and stress in this film which really left an impression on me, and hopefully this is what will stick in your mind long after the opening credits roll (i.e. the end), as it is far more realistic and revealing than any of the action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gaspar Noé offers you another sullen, nihilistic insightful approach to the human psyche yet again. If you are unfamiliar with Noé, he's also responsible for 1998's Seul contre tous - which I had the opportunity of reviewing some time ago. Irréversible stars Vincent Cassel (Oceans 12 &amp; 13, and Le pacte des loups from 2001) and Monica Bellucci (Le pacte des loups and 1992's Dracula).The story is not told in chronological order - Marcus (Cassel) and his friend Pierre are seeking vengeance due to the rape of Marcus's girlfriend, Alex (Bellucci). The plot contains scattered subtleties, demonstrations on human behavior, and of course...sexual brutality. Bellucci's character is involved in a rather lengthy rape scene that have turned many patrons of horror away in disgust - and undoubtedly, it is a difficult thing to watch. Much like Noé's previous endeavor, Seul contre tous, we're left to our own emotional devices after the film's conclusion. He manages to address a myriad of feelings and senses by showcasing controversial and ghastly imagery; possibly with the intention of forcing you through a hellacious journey into the dark recesses of the mind. Perhaps Noé's vision is lost on me...but what I've gathered is that he manges to incite feelings of uncertainty within each viewer. In my opinion, films like Irréversible don't have a definitive meaning. It's up to each individual to decipher the events that unfold. Noé seems to enjoy exploring an alternative approach to film-making...it's just unfortunate that his efforts are bogged down by lengthy dialog and irrelevant plot details. I don't consider this a good film in and of itself...I only appreciate Noé's ability to think outside of the box, even if it's at the expense of controversy. Seul contre tous seemed more like a social commentary based on the times we live in - even after a decade, society has changed very little. I put Irréversible on the same unfamiliar platform - two films that incite feelings of wonder well- after the closing chapter...perhaps that was Noé's vision after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This not rape/revenge; this is revenge/rape.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gaspar Noé's Irreversible takes the rape/revenge genre and turns it on its head, presenting events in reverse order in a stunning whirl of chaotic, somersaulting, nightmarish imagery.We begin with the act of revenge itself: Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel), boyfriend and best friend of rape victim Alex (Monica Belucci), hunt for the woman's attacker through the hellish bowels of gay bar The Rectum, where they are confronted by shunting, grunting males indulging in all manner of perversions, before becoming involved in a violent altercation that culminates in a nasty broken arm for Marcus, and an even nastier headache for one of the bar's patrons (as Pierre stoves the man's skull in with a fire extinguisher).The action then travels backwards through time, allowing the viewer to witness the incidents that lead to this moment: the frenzied search for the rapist; the ugly sexual assault itself (a prolonged and harrowing spot of buggery in a lonely city underpass); the argument at a party that results in Alex leaving alone; her journey to the party with Marcus and Pierre; and Alex's delight at finding out that she is pregnant. The final shot is of Alex relaxing in a park, blissfully unaware of the horror that is soon to come.Whereas traditional rape/revenge movies build towards a climax that is designed to evoke a primitive response from the viewer as justice is finally metered out, Noé immediately shocks his audience with extreme violence, bludgeons them further with the horrific rape, but winds things up with a serene finalé designed to deliver an entirely different kind of emotional wallop: presented with the idyllic image of a happy, carefree Alex, the viewer?already aware of the character's terrible fate?is forced to face the fragility of life, the truly abhorrent nature of violence, and the startling realisation that tragedy can strike anyone, at any moment, without warning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I am conflicted as to what to rate this movie. I understand that this movie effectively achieved its goals. The torturous, sickening rape scene definitely evoked the desired, implacably angry response from me. As the movie was told in reverse chronological order, there was no retribution to be found after the event. Rather, this anger was deepened and sculpted by making the characters sympathetic (all humanisation occurs after the rape scene). Some uncomfortable parallels are also drawn between the rape and the sex-life of Alex and Marcus. I definitely won't deny that this movie is effective. My problem with it is, understandably, the rape. I worry about the movie aiming to shock with no real message or lesson to be taken from that. Of course, that is in-keeping with the nature of the subject matter. I feel as though my sustained anger about it and reluctance to praise the movie are, at least somewhat, intended also. I am sure that, with a little distance, I will rate this movie highly in the future. Just now, however, I am content to say that I don't want to see it again. Think carefully before you watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sex, drugs and deplorable violence: all part of a crazy night out for Parisian Marcus (Cassel) who, while leaving a party, discovers that his girlfriend has been defiled and mutilated. Essentially a revenge story told backwards, (think Memento meets Baise Moi) with nauseating camera work, unsimulated sex acts, graphic depictions of violence and one of cinema's most horrific rape scenes, this is a hideous car wreck that you can't take your eyes off of! Noé's unconventional approach to cinema, coupled with some very high concept dialogue add real credence to one of the decade's most disturbing films, making it much more than just another Last House on the Left.A strange masterpiece that's gripping from start to finish (or from finish to start depending on how you look at it) Irreversible is at once unwatchable and unmissible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A quick warning on this movie. A quick google of this movie will place it on many websites 'Top x Disturbing Movies'. It is a title well earned.Irréversible is show in reverse, in a seemingly continuous stream. This lends to the film's atmosphere and theme, however it is extremely disorienting to the viewer. However, as an film lover, the cinematography is technically brilliant, and the film-making process well realised. The director also chose to include an extremely low pitch(inaudible) as part of the backtrack for the first 30 minutes of the film, so if you feel sick or dizzy, don't worry, its the film.The film features two main events that will quickly disturb you and repulse you to your core. A Hyper-Realistic approach is taken to these scenes, which is well suited, as the scenes seem more terrible and personal than any other movie in recent memory. !!!SPOILER ! SPOILER!!! The murder scene early on is disgusting and, at the time, completely unprovoked. Even at the end, that opinion wont be completely changed. !!!SPOILER ! SPOILER!!! The rape scene is even more terrible, as it forces you to watch everything with no breaks. A 9 minute unbroken scene. Deeply effecting, it is savage and too personal. No-one can enjoy this scene. But stick it through or skip the chapter, as it starts to make sense now. !!!END OF SPOILERS!!!Not an enjoyable movie, not a movie to even watch with friends, or women. This is a personal experience, and everyone will have a different opinion and lesson learned. I adore the acting, and actors, as well as the technical brilliance of the movie, as well as stripping me of my mental eyelid, and forcing me to realize that this happens in the world.

		<fullReview>Irrevérsible concerns a brutal act of retribution: an innocent man has his skull repeatedly and graphically stoved in with a fire extinguisher as misapplied revenge for a nine-minute rape in real time - perversely, the most static segment of a nausea-inducing maelstrom of hand-held bravura and cacophonous aural affront.And yet for all the hysterical headlines and reports of mass walk-outs at Cannes, it's important to remember Gaspar Noé's film was passed entirely uncut by the BBFC. "Censor's betrayal as he passes 'sick' rape movie", as the good old 'Daily Mail' put it.It also distracts attention away from what this picture actually is: a thoughtful and audacious ensemble piece, which suggests our destinies are predetermined, or as JW Dunne (whose highly influential 1927 essay 'An Experiment With Time' is featured in the film) suggests, that past, present and future exist simultaneously. That title, then, is both ironic (the story is told back-to-front, a la Memento) and a lament.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irréversible is a unique film and its probably different then anything you have seen. Its edgy,graphic and experimental and its only purpose is to evoke a reaction.I think by now its pretty obvious that this film isn't suitable for everyone.I know a lot of people who would be disgusted with this film,in fact most of the people I know would not be able to watch the entire movie and even I, wonder, if it isn't in fact a bit gratuitous. Some of the scenes could have been toned down, but then again it would not be the same movie.Irréversible shows the events over the course of one tragic night in Paris, but in reverse.The plot is quite simple; a young women is raped and her boyfriend tries to find the guy who did it. But the way the story unfolds(backwards) plus the experimental camera-work and the background noise added on purpose to cause nausea and vertigo make this film a unique experience.6/10</fullReview>

This was the only part that made me a bit sick and I really can't understand the idea of making it this way.Second: The rape scene, which is uncut and extremely long, however 'brilliant' and exceptional thanks to Belucci.Third: The stroboscopic very ending. It could end with the wide upside-down shot easily. Didn't get why was there supposed to be there.In the end, it is quite easy love story. Nothing exceptional, but a nice movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant idea marred by excess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film brought to my mind other films such as Uli Edel's Last Exit to Brooklyn and most of David Lynch's work. The aforementioned directors are talented people who get stuck in their childish crusade to enlighten through shocking their audience. Gasper Noe's film is shocking and beautiful. Too bad that the shock overshadows the beauty. The concept was brilliant. I "got" what he was trying to say. That is why I'm so disappointed by the excessive violence in the film's opening scenes. The beauty of the film's second half made the brutality of the opening sequences more irritating. Gasper Noe, the film's director is capable of telling a story that is thought-provoking and engaging as is evident in the scenes following the opening sequences. Film directors insult their audiences when they leave nothing to the viewer's imagination. When an artist says that they are showing us something that is supposed to disgust or disturb us, my intelligence is offended. Who does not think or know that mutilation and rape are bad? Why do modern directors (and other artist in other mediums) hate their audiences so much? Do they not appreciate that we are paying their rent with our hard-earned money and therefore desire something other than abuse and repulsion. This film fits into the same genre as tabloid news, Reality TV and most pop music. It is purposely unsatisfying and immature. Where are the real storytellers? Hitchcock could frighten and disgust by showing us the nothing but the face of the hero witnessing horror or maybe even the sound of the horror(birds pecking at flesh). Watching the violence in this film was like listening to a four year old learn to curse. It was fascinating for and few second and then turned quickly stupid and overly indulgent. I'm glad that I saw this film. I will not watch it again nor will I recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

The story line is awful and there are lots of flash backs. It is hard to follow plot of the story. The way Alex (Monica Bellucci) leaves the party does not make sense. Also it is not sensible that just one guy goes down the stairs during the long time of the rape scene, sees how she is being raped and then returns without doing anything. It is recommended to everybody who just likes to see how Monica Bellucci gets raped. But the movie has nothing else to say at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits you in the guts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard for me to put my feelings about "Irréversible" into words. Let's start off with the easy part: Director Gaspar Noé manages to combine three highly experimental elements in his movie without distracting from the story. "Irréversible" has dizzying cinematography (the camera is virtually spinning around in some parts, symbolizing the way the characters' world is spinning out of control), reverse storytelling, and long tracking shots in each of the ten sequences. All of that is executed perfectly, but what's even more admirable is the fact that none of the stylistic magic tricks is taking away from the story itself. Of course, the performances by the brave cast help, too.Now for the subject matter: This movie is about three lives changing drastically within one day because of a brutal rape. There's an excessive amount of violence, including, of course, the infamous explicit rape scene. The question is: Is it necessary, is it even allowed to show rape in such detail? I say yes. At no point is Noé presenting rape as something erotic. That scene isn't just put into the movie for shock value, either. In fact, I think the most effective way to show the horrors of rape is to shove it down people's throats the way the director does here. In real life the situation doesn't end with a discreet cut to the victim in a hospital bed, either. So why not put the crime into focus with all its ugly details for a change? This is art, after all, and art must also be allowed to show the sick sides of life.The weird thing, however, is, that I don't think the scene would work as well if Noé wouldn't use reverse storytelling. By making the rest of the movie "conventional", the rape scene would stand out much more, and then it would probably feel like a gimmick to attract an audience by adding shock value. Why? Because Noé's movie doesn't really have a whole lot to tell. There's no deeper meaning to the story of a girl getting raped and her boyfriend seeking revenge. Noé tries to add something by incorporating the line "Time ruins everything", but that really doesn't have much to do with what we're seeing.In the end, I'm undecided. I was intrigued by the movie. As I've said, technically it's perfect and its bold approach, to go into detail where no other movie would, is boundary pushing. Still, there is this weird sensation, that the movie is devoid of any message. I guess in the end "Irréversible" is supposed to get to your guts rather than make you think. The message is that you should be disgusted, and that the movie achieves. At the very least this is cinema as you don't see it everyday. And how many movies can that be said about anymore?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very hard for me to give this film a high rating, but to give it less would be unrealistic. While incredibly disturbing, "Irreversible" is a brilliant film in every regard. The sheer effect the film will have on every viewer is nothing short of incredible. I don't know if I've seen a movie that left such an impure and disgusting taste in my mouth.The acting is way above average, with the infamous rape scene standing out as one of the most believable things I have ever seen in a movie. I salute the two actors who pulled that off. Noe obviously wants the viewer to experience, partly anyway, what a victim goes through and experience it we do. I had to look away a few times during this one and my jaw was clenched the entire time. To say it was brutal would be the understatement of the century.I was impressed with the camera work and the way the movie flows from end to beginning. The obvious comparisons to "Memento" should be ignored; this film is way, way better in every regard.Pay no mind to the negative reviews, they are people who couldn't sit through this one. And I don't fault them; it is one of the most difficult films ever made. I've seen my share of disturbing stuff, read my other reviews...this one is not for the faint of heart.But it's message is important and ultra-real, something everyone should know about. If you want to see something that will shake your very soul and give you nightmares, something you will NEVER forget, see "Irreversible." 9 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning (or is it really the end ?) of this movie a homosexual gets his head smashed in with a fire extinguisher for trying to sexually attack this guy's friend. These events transpire in the squalid, dungeon like atmosphere of an establishment called 'The Rectum'. (Reminds me of real establishments I have heard about like 'The Mine Shaft'.) This should give you a general idea about the feel of this movie. It touches on many of the more exotic aspects of human sexuality. 'Touches' is probably not the right word here.The story is told in reverse with the end of the story appearing at the beginning of the movie. This just makes what is already a very backwards oriented movie even more bizarre. It reminds me that when people become possessed by demons they start talking backwards.Monica Bellucci treads into uncharted territory in this horrific movie. What a woman.A guy on amazon.com wrote a review for this movie and said he wishes time was reversible so he could go back and not watch it. But alas I guess time is not reversible.Not me though. It's one of my all time favorites.Also interesting for me was I found a poster I was looking for with Captain Marvel. It's on the wall in the guy's bedroom. I couldn't remember the name of this poster that I had many years ago but now I have found it.I guess only the French could come out with a movie like this.Jeff Marzano</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most disturbing film you will ever seen,it has a simple story but in a very good direction and acting, believe me. Gaspar Noe was a very creative director,I don't know why he wasn't nominated for a golden globe or an academy award, the film making is very original though. I warn you that the film is pretty violent and very pornographic.The disturbance that this film makes is hard to explain, the thrilling sound effects, the constant rotative movements of the camera and confusion makes you be alert at anything in the film, it obligates you to concentrate. The violence: There is only one big violent scene in the movie but is one of the most graphic in the cinema, SPOILER ALERT: A man is hit in the face with a fire extiguer several times (Every hit occurs IN-CAMERA so there is no censorship) the mans head deforms with every hit until its head is totally smashed, the body of the man stills moving the fingers and part of its remeaning jaw. Sex: We see several homosexuals having sex in a club and also a nine minutes nearly anal sex rape scene SPOILER: The woman is raped and the man dirty talks her and insults her touching her breasts and destroying her clothes covering the mouth of the girl with one of his hands also her anus is bleeding, at the end the guy kicks the girl around three times in the face, we see blood, then he starts to punch her several times in the face and the he hits the girls face several times with the flor leaving her face highly hurt. Also a sex scene between a man and a woman is showed.If you don't have the film I suggest you to get it quick, it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IRREVERSIBLE is the kind of unflinching and uncompromising film that examines the concept of violence in an industry that has, for the most part, become desensitised to it. The acts of violence depicted in this film will serve to offend and disturb over half the audience, and walk-outs are not uncommon. That's not to say the movie is riddled with violence; in fact there are only two scenes worth mentioning, and they do not exceed 15 minutes total (out of an approximate run-time of 90 minutes). However these acts serve not as focal points of the story, but as a reminder of what distinguishes reality from fiction, as these are two of the most shocking scenes viewers will likely see in a Motion Picture.In Gaspar Noe's IRREVERSIBLE, the story follows a reverse chronological order, filmed in segments, reminiscent of the brilliant MEMENTO. But that's where the similarity stops. In MEMENTO, the ending of the movie (or rather beginning) was meant to be a tremendous plot exposition, and the story in that film was a convoluted and complex one that relied heavily on the narrative. In IRREVERSIBLE, the plot/story is a relatively simple one by today's standards, and I will not be surprised if viewers watching this film without the English subtitles still understand the gist of the story. The ending (or beginning) of IRREVERSIBLE will seem to be a pleasant and happy one, but upon realising exactly what will happen in the future (i.e. the events that preceded it in the film), one will understand the true nature of the tragedy, and that within 24 hours the lives of these individuals will be irreversibly altered, and that the ending is of no real consequence. This is where Gaspar Noe, armed with the tag-line 'Time destroys everything' transforms this movie from a brutal uncompromising study of violence into a more cerebral and intelligent film, examining the notion of time. There is no such thing as a true ending, as there is always something yet to come. Alex's quote in the film, "It says that the future is already written. It's all there. And the proof lies in premonitory dreams", in which she discusses a book she is reading, is the most potent and poignant one.Viewers who are able to make it through the film will begin to appreciate the messages and the undertones portrayed in this movie. Additionally, while MEMENTO relied on the narrative, IRREVERSIBLE doesn't need to, but is instead infused with a style that no viewer is likely to forget. Noe begins with unsteady, uneven, nauseating shots, and as the film progresses (or rewinds/unwinds), the camera-work becomes more calm and placid, right up until the ending, which is beautifully shot, showing more vibrant colours than the rest of the film combined. Noe then ends the film with a reminder that things are not all sunshine and paradise, by employing a rather upsetting film technique, which I will not divulge here for the sake of the potential viewer.The acting in IRREVERSIBLE is solid and engaging. Monica Bellucci's portrayal of the female lead is as powerful and believable as one will see. Vincent Cassell and Albert Dupontel also do incredibly well in a movie that is not character-based, but more reliant on the manner and style in which the story is told (or untold).IRREVERSIBLE is a brutal, unflinching, and uncompromising film. It will shock, sicken, offend, and disturb. But unlike many of these modern films that try to sensitise violence (inexplicably by infusing themselves with as MUCH violence as possible), it is a film that should not be missed. It will challenge you greatly. During the first 20 or 30 minutes you will ask yourself repeatedly, "What am I watching?", but after the plot begins to unfold you will become engrossed.8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Will just about enter my Top 100 at #100 or so. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some have called this movie stupid, arrogant, pretentious, and brutal. Others swear by its greatness.Gaspar Noe has offered a film which tops his I Stand Alone in its sheer ability to manipulate and horrify the viewer. Like Memento (although far more engaging), the film unfolds in reverse chronological order, and interesting technique which transforms a would-be-average revenge fantasy into a provocative meditation on the destructive nature of time.The film begins with distracting camera movements and overwhelming violence as several men avenge the rape of a young woman (a 10 minute scene that drove many critics from the theater at Cannes), and then descends into the realm of these people in their normal lives.The second half of the film is undoubtedly superior to the first because it dares to draw the viewer in whereas the first half merely smacks you in the face.The young actress Monica Bellucci, who is the recipient of appalling violence, is particularly exceptional in the final act. This film is difficult to place and will clearly be the subject of much discussion in the years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the begnning, we're introduced to two beaten and bruised men, Marcus (Vincent Cassel, recently of Ocean's 12/13 and Eastern Promises fame) and Pierre (Albert Dupontel). From the ambulance ride and on, we learn, in reverse, the tale of Marcus and Vincent's quest for vengeance, which stemmed from a brutal and vicious act against Marcus's girlfriend (and Pierre's ex-girlfriend), Alex (the beautiful Monica Bellucci, of Passion of the Christ and Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions fame).Irréversible is the type of modern-day film that fans of the classic shock cinema and rape-revenge stories can enjoy. But, instead of playing out like a regular I Spit on Your Grave-esquire story, we're delivered a more original take on the classic tale. Sure the 'reverse story' idea isn't 100% new, and it's most commonly associated with the fantastic Memento, but that doesn't mean another film can't work wonders with the same tricks. The story here is great. It's a well known one, but it throws in a few curveballs to spice things up (like (for lack of a less-reportable term) all-men's S&amp;M clubs). Watching the film, you'll see a fresh style from Noé and, while I dig the experimental cinematography of Noé and Debie, some of the camera-work got a little dizzying and distracting at times, especially at the beginning. Throbbing music, grinding beats, flashing lights, and spinning cameras can sometimes aid in intensifying any headache or nausea. But, when it comes down to it, these 'tricks' definitely helped spice up the brutality. Speaking of brutality, there isn't a whole lot, to be honest. . . but when you see it, boy does it hurt. It's a rare time when I'm actually holding my head in sympathy for a fictional character, but in here. . . I certainly was. By the end, Irréversible reveals itself as more than the typical revenge tale, and helps face, head on, a truly heartbreaking story of pain and desperation.Final verdict: 7/10. Hell, see it for the first 25 minutes alone, if nothing else.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was just great in many levels. Is by far the strongest and most horrible filmed i have ever seen but it made me think a lot and it shacked my world and mi mind. No t many films have this power. The scenes in the gay bar while the guy was killing the other one and was so graphic and the very commented scene of the rape are the two parts of this movie that took my breath away without counting with the violent move of the camera and the colors that were so dark and disturbing. Something very interesting is that it starts telling the story backwards and that is also a very important element because at the end of the movie you feel terrible to know that is just the beginning for a series of awful events that will come later. The message is strong but powerful and this director had the best way to show us this so we can understand and sure its to painful to watch but necessary to make us react and realize how terrible is the situation of the characters how are they feelings in every moment, why raping is so bad and should be punished in every way and how violence and revenge affects or lives. How destiny can influence our worlds because what got me more impressed about this movie was that the characters were just happy people trying to live normal lives and then everything falls apart and its so unfair, so awful. Only people that are really interested in good movies that will make them think a lot and are very strong emotionally must watch this film because as good and necessary it is it must certainly give you a very unpleasant feeling after you end watching it and its possible that it disturbs your mind and feelings in unsuspected ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Irreversible, You Don't Ever Watch It Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gore in movies doesn't bother me. As a fan of horror movies, one knows it's all fake and starts to enjoy the ingenuity behind some of the effects. There is an effect early on in this movie (or near the end, depending on your perspective) that I would have gone back to inspect more closely if only I wasn't so shocked and grossed out by it. It involves a fire extinguisher, a guy's head, and the floor. And I couldn't see where reality ended and film-making began. Starting a movie with that casts a shadow over the rest of it, so you can never tell if you're watching some type of twisted snuff film or not. (IMDB now tells me that the movie includes many digital effects - including Mr. Cave-in-Head. I don't know whether to congratulate the digital artists for their seamless work or scold the director for making it look TOO real.) Irreversible starts at the end of its story and each scene unfolds in reverse order. We start with an act of vengeance, go back to see what inspired that vengeance, and then continue even further back into the characters' lives together. At the beginning, the camera sweeps around wildly, like a garden hose run amok. We're seeing the end of a spiral and the movie moves backwards to show us the point where that spiral began - the camera behaves less frantically with each scene. The fascinating thing is that the point where it all begins is not notable. The catastrophe that occurs at the movie's midpoint, a rape, was not born out of anything except the random meanderings of people on this earth.Before we see the rape happen (in a single, unmoving camera shot that lasts probably 15 minutes) we can piece together what has led the two main characters, Marcus and Pierre, to seek revenge. We see the violence and are shocked. We hear why the violence was committed and we decide that is was just. Then we see the rape. And we realize Marcus and Pierre didn't assault the right man. The director, Gaspar Noe, seems to be saying with this movie that the world is a crazy place where the most outrageous things can happen to a person literally depending on which way they turn at the street corner. One's life can change based on things people have no control over in the first place. I guess it's true, which is depressing. I just really wish Monica Bellucci had been packing pepper spray that night. This movie, infamous for driving people out of the theater, is an experience not meant for the faint-hearted.

		<fullReview>Irréversible, well what can you say? This movie is one movie that i will ever forget. From its disturbing scenes, to its unraveling told backwards plot, it is a blandly said mind throbbing movie.there were distinct scenes where i wanted to turn my head away from the screen because of the shock that i had experienced but i forced my self to keep watching, this is because the scenes that were played before me where actual reality. Even though this is a movie who says that things like this never happen in our every day life, for that same reason i would not have wanted this movie to be less violent or disturbing. and what better way to wake awareness than through a movie.The story is difficult to watch because of the fast motions of how the movie is filmed, it is hard to grasp your mind around it. To fully understand and follow this movie, it must have your full attention. the main actress and actors in this movie do a great job perpetrating their rolls, therefore us viewers are captured into the movie even more regardless of the actual storyline. I give props to the beautiful actress who played Alex in the movie. She truly played quite roll during the rape scene where i wanted to gag because of the violence and disgust, i felt horrible that something like this could actually happen when i put myself in her shoes. the actor who played Marcus as well does a great job. he shows the viewers this feelings of revenge so well, from his facial expressions to his actions.All and all this is not your regular movie.Though I do recommend you watch this movie, not because of the violence or vulgarity but because of the message behind the movie and the wakening of awareness. I don't suggest you watch this movie if your sensitive to violence, i personally don't think that i can watch this movie again, But i give it a 9/10. A point off for the little too complicated filming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, brutal, thought-provoking and extreme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irreversible could be seen as a film as shallow and manipulative as anything to come out of Hollywood in the last fifteen years, or it could be a genuine masterpiece that just so happens to be a few years ahead of its time? It all depends on the individual person viewing it. I can personally appreciate both sides of the argument... on the one hand director Gaspar Noe could be accused of revelling in excessive scenes of physical and sexual violence in an attempt to capture the audience's sense of morbid curiosity (in a further attempt to boost the word of mouth, thus resulting in a greater box-office gross), or he could be offering us a genuinely heart-wrenching and ground-breaking depiction of revenge and retribution in the face of absolute destruction? It is up to the audience to make up their own mind and to approach the film in a manner that will allow room for analysis, discussion and personal interpretation.The basic story of Irreversible involves three protagonists; the sultry Alex, her laddish boyfriend Marcus and her bookish ex, Pierre. During a night at a friend's party the relationship disintegrates - due in part to Marcus' drug-taking and womanising and the on-going sexual tension between Alex and Pierre - which eventually results in Alex leaving the party early. Unable to cross the street, she takes the underpass and is violently raped and beaten. Still high and irrational, Marcus drags Pierre through the nocturnal Parisian streets (quizzing local gangsters and prostitutes for information regarding potential attackers), before eventually ending up at the Gay S&amp;M club 'The Rectum'. Here the story comes to a head and a scene of violent retribution plays out. However, the twist here is that the film follows a reverse chronology, starting at the end with a vague and fragmented scene between two men in what looks like a prison cell and ending with a scene of transcendent bliss and an odd moment of bleak foreshadowing. The framing of the film in reverse (where the end is the beginning is the end, so to speak) is a novel approach, allowing the audience to reflect upon the events leading up to the opening scenes of destruction with the added benefit of hindsight. It also offers an ironic twist on the film's tag-line; "time destroys everything", when the final (opening) scene reveals that Alex is pregnant with Marcus' baby. This gives a sense of weight to the scene of revenge... (although, this itself is turned on its head in a further ironic twist when it is revealed that Marcus and Pierre have taken revenge on the wrong man, and that the actual rapist is stood within the throng of semi-naked on-lookers deriving a twisted sense of pleasure from watching Pierre bash another man's face into pulp with a fire-extinguisher). This scene, along with the later rape of Alex, is the major talking point of the film, with Noe capturing the violence with an excessive and slightly pornographic attention to detail... using digital effects combined with prosthetics to show a human face being slowly pounded away into nothing!! The scene is already considered one of the most shocking in the history of cinema, and along with the rape of Alex, leaves Noe open to accusations of exploitation and sensationalism.Whether the violence is gratuitous or not will again be down the individual, who will have to decide whether or not the decisions that Noe has taken are justified in light of the film's bleak sense of misanthropy. Further viewing discomfort can be found in the way that Noe has decided to visualise the film. In a clever use of mise-en-scene, Noe adopts an approach to the cinematography that mirrors the atmosphere of the story; so, as the film begins with a sense of spiralling confusion, so too does the visualisation, with the camera often trawling the streets, circling buildings, drifting at bizarre angles, moving into blurred and fragmented close-ups, plunging into darkened corridors, hovering above crime scenes and adopting disorientating points-of-view, all with a jarring and continually confusing hand-held approach that will no doubt induce seasickness in anyone not weaned on the films of Dogme 95. As the story runs backwards, eventually developing some kind of stability following the desolation of the eight-minute rape, the camera becomes more focused, employing smooth stedicam shots and clearer compositions.The first half of the film (the end) also makes use of a disorientating low-frequency audio distortion that runs throughout the scenes in The Rectum, which is intended to induce feelings of nausea and seasickness in the audience (the reason - alongside the excessive violence and scenes of homosexual sex and bondage - why so many people have found it impossible to get through the first thirty-minutes). Again, this makes Irreversible more of a cinematic endurance test than a film in the traditional sense, with Noe seemingly taking a sadistic glee in repulsing the audience... a notion that might expose the shocking scenes of rape and violence to be nothing more than shallow attention seeking? Once again, the power of Irreversible relies entirely on the attitude of its audience and their willingness to question Noe's intentions, whilst simultaneously, picking through the film's fragmented narrative and the inescapable idea that time really does destroy everything.Irreversible is, without question, a brave film that demands attention, and is one that will certainly leave the audience with a number of serious thoughts and questions as the film comes to a close. It is also worth noting the film's bold visual style, its inventive directorial flourishes and the great performances of its three main leads (in particular the harrowing Monica Bellucci and the powerful Vincent Cassel), all of which mark it out as more than mere "art-house exploitation"!! Regardless of how you feel about it, Irreversible is a powerful and original work that seems content to challenge and provoke the audience (like all great art should), and really, deserves to be seen as such.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie will disturb you as it shows some really graphic content-sexual images in a gay sex club, a brutal murder with a fire hydrant, a sustained rape and beating and other scenes. but yet when you watch it you feel a shocking sense of realism and tragedy about how someone's life in a regular night can be destroyed in a tragic moment it shows you the consequences of anger, violence, hate and revenge. it is told in a superb way backwards because it starts of dark and ends in a beautiful peace which in fact makes it more tragic. watch it if you think you can handle it for it is quite good but not necessarily enjoyable and the moment between Alex and Marcus at the end is quite touching. THIS FILM IS NOT RATED BY THE MPAA BUT THIS IS HOW I WOULD RATE IT - NC-17 for - brutal graphic violence, degenerate images of perverse sexuality and graphic nudity, a sustained intense brutal rape sequence, language and sexual dialogue, and drug use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but tough film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 10 because it is a fantastic movie. However, it is very difficult to watch. Especially if you know that it will hit close to home. If you've been through things that you know are in this film and being reminded of it upsets you then i would really advise against watching this film. I normally find that watching these kinds of things help me but this was more upsetting than anything. I got half way through the rape scene before i had to turn the film off. I was sweating and dizzy, almost at the point of panic attack. I was literally squirming from the moment the film began. That night I could hardly even stand to have my boyfriend touch me and decided that the next day i had to watch the rest of the film so that I didn't just keep thinking about the nasty bits.one of the reasons that the rape scene is so hard to get through is that you've already seen the outcome - and you know that that doesn't come from rape alone. as he gets off her you have this sense of relief but at the same time a sense of dread.close to the end of the film you find out something that changes your perception of the film that far. everything you think and feel about the characters changes. it might seem silly that the character development comes so close to the end but it gives you this huge rush of new feelings. in this last scene my opinion of this movie went from something that was graphic violence for the sake of pushing the boundaries to a tragic and sad movie which really touched me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Irrevérsible" is a chilling but at the end totally glorious experience, as a new effective narrative style: The story is told to us from the ending credits to the beginning. But what makes "Irrevérsible" more bitter but necessary, is its vision of "Le temps détruit tout".The story of "Irrevérsible" is about the destiny of three people in one day. And how the things that happen in just that day changes them for all their lives. With Monica Bellucci, Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel, who make the best in this movie of Gaspar Noé (Unknown director for me before). This movie is maybe strong -and for this is very talked for much- and much people going to think about sensationalism and be like all that movies that exaggerate all to create strong and even, disgusting situation without any reason for do it. Much times just for call attention. But "Irrevérsible" - in my point of view- has its reason for all the images that manage. The innovative narrative is the first and maybe most important thing to take account. The film is -among other things- about time -past, present and future- and its consequences. As we see the end, we know yet the facts and what already happen to the caharacters, in other words, we know now its future and what going to happen them -the most notably is when we know that the character of Monica Belucci, Alexandra, down in the tunnel. We feel awful, because we know that there is not any salvation for her-. As the movie go on, we found after some strong scenes a certain calm, that after all in the beginning of the the story -or the end of the movie- we found a surprise anyway that makes the things that we see more terrible. In its scenes, of course that the things that shows us are very strong and even traumatic for a while. The scenes of the assassination in the decadent gay bar,the search of revenge, the rape scene, the party, the sex talk, the room full of love and finally the early calm is the full content of this film (For that and next reason is that this comment has BIG spoilers). And although that there are yet movies that portrait the revenge for the damage of a beloved been (Take as example exactly as "Irrevérsible" do with the rape and the kill in the sense of revenge with "Jungfrunkällan" by Ingmar Bergman or "The Last House on the left" by Wes Craven) "Irrevérsible" do certain different effect, but still very effective.In spite of that i have not seen much movies about time -of course, few of different narrative ways like "Rennt Lola" , "Amores Perros" or even Griffith "Intolerance"- but this movie brings it message with a big force. A message about don't waste your time, think in your future... NOW! As we see the premonition of Alexandra of her dream. And then when we found that she is pregnant... and the Kubrick "2001: A Space Oddissey" poster. And then, we've get lost in the space and time.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Backwards Roller-coaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film uses a technique of going in reverse chronological order simply to add shock value to discoveries later throughout the film. You begin with what would actually be the end of the films story line, and then proceed to the beginning of the story line. The film wouldn't be as shocking were it in normal chronological order, and therefore, I believe, would not have received as many good ratings as other users have given it. Aside from being backwards merely to attract more attention to itself, the camera angles will remind you of a strange roller-coaster, often going up, down, left and right. The movie is filmed in a way that the camera is not steady, perhaps also to add to the shock value, and keep viewers in suspense. The keys to the suspense in this film lie not in the story line, but in the filming techniques and order of presentation. Remove those two key features, and you are left with a film that is mediocre at best. The story is of a man who seeks revenge, as you discover at the beginning of the film, and then proceeds to show the viewer the events leading up to this moment. The summary is not as jaw dropping, or shocking as others may make it seem, and to classify this movie as one of the most shocking films in history would be a huge overstatement. Don't get me wrong, the film is "watchable", however I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it. It's like one of those, if you've nothing better to be doing, why not. Overall, the film manages a six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aow, I loved this movie. The effect of the images and sound at the beginning is incredible. My heart was beating twice faster than normal. A friend of mine recommended the movie, but I chose to wait to be alone at home to watch it: I do not recommend the movie to everybody; I am not sure I will recommend it to my wife for instance.&gt;&gt;&gt;Spoilers: The first part is difficult to stand and will hurt you. You will feel pain. The second part will let you think and feel mixed feelings (joy, sadness). When I first watched the movie, I was unsure who they killed in the gay "the Rectum" club; Yes, indeed they killed the wrong guy.Well you have read about the head crunching and the rape scenes.And Yes, this movie is about violence. How and why can human be/become violent. The pimp is violent, Marcus (Alex', alias Monica Bellucci boyfriend) gets violent, and Pierre the calm history teacher explodes in violence.In this respect, I would compare the movie to Cidade de Deus (2002) (City of God).Clearly, the movie is about revenge.But the movie is also about Love. How strong is the love of Marcus (and Pierre) to super sexy Alex (Monica Bellucci)? In its second part, the movie is one of the most romantic movie I ever saw. It is about silliness: how silly can you waste your life? How silly to kill the wrong person in your attempt to take your revenge to maybe end your life in a jail? How silly is it to waste your relationship with a dream woman? How guilty are you to let your dream woman go alone back home?Very good performance by Vincent Cassel (Marcus) and Monica Bellucci (Alex). Very good soundtrack by Thomas Bangaler (of Daft Punk). And very good direction.As written by another commenter, get the subtitled version if you can: it is sometimes difficult to catch what is said at the beginning of the movie.10 out of 10, no hesitation.I just regret I can not recommend the movie to everybody. But still a 10/10.</fullReview>

(Does that make it a good film) I would be so interested to see what the people making this film wished to achieve. If it was to shock, disgust and nauseate this we duely achieved. I am not one to critise any film, so i will tell you what i enjoyed. I thought the second scene of the film, in the rectum club was amazing camera work. Although the acting was very European in the film i loved how one long scene in a film captured the frantic, vengeful, disoriented feeling that only a man in inner turmoil could experience. Excellent!!! I liked how the film defied convention in the chronology sense, it would probably make a better film if it was chronologicly correct, but the fact that it wasn't makes it more disturbing and harsh! I hope someone else agrees with me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible unfolds reversely. It begins with the end and ends with the beginning. It has Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel. Miss Bellucci has a sequence lasting forever where she's raped by a by-passer in an underpass. The camera is fixed on this from a distance and makes it so distanced and cold that you are utterly sickened, disgusted and angry. The controversies around this are well known and people say don't believe the hype, but this stands so well on its own merits. Somehow by starting with the most brutal and dizzy going to explain what motivated that anger instead of numbing your senses, makes you more angry about tragedy. It's hard to describe this movie, it's been a while since I saw it, but you will never forget it. Bangalters music also is so fitting for the images and the feel of the movie, it's some of his best work IMO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was feeling sick from the camera spinning and droning noises, while guiltily enjoying the anticipation and excitement of the extreme sex and violence that made me rent this, when I started enjoying how smart and philosophical the movie is, which is when I began to despise its manipulative and fake picture of the world.It goes in segments back through time like Memento, with a similarly sadistic plot but more so. The three characters and their relationship are richly developed in a way that tells an interesting story, which feels 'profound' (and the framing of the movie emphasize its 'philosophical' quality). Its formal film-making heavy-handedly illustrates the regression through time from chaos (the camera and sound in the beginning are hard to endure) to pastoral, such that you see the seeds of chaos in the pastoral: the lovers in the hedonism of their happiness and the ex-boyfriend, a professor of some kind, in the way his 'philosophy' gives free rein to the masochism (and with it sadism) of his clinging to the lovers. The long takes are great, and are edited together digitally so that the whole movie seems to be one take, which isn't as great because it requires the camera twirling around into the sky a lot.But when I think about it it occurs to me that neither people nor Paris is as chaotic as the movie wants to make a philosophical point of -- people follow lines of conversation and desire self-indulgently, but even on drugs or under great stress not as aggressively for as long as in the movie -- I doubt any parties are quite as hedonistic as that one, nor are there S &amp; M clubs as alienating as that one nor any named 'Rectum' -- and pimps on their own street corner don't, I think, attack random women in sidewalk underpasses, rape them at great length and beat them into a coma. To make those the premises for philosophy is wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about this movie when it came out and I didn't have the "balls" to see it then. So, somehow I came across it again this evening and decided to see it no matter what. No matter how scared I was at the content, no matter how worried I was that I would throw-up all over my living room floor, no matter how sorry I was that I had no one here to watch it with me.And I have to say - what a bunch of hype and what a great movie at the same time. I have a whole different take on it than the posters I have seen so far. SPOILERS*************************************************************Regarding the face bashing scene in the beginning - so scary and disgusting - but butted up against what the director and writer wanted you to feel...understandable. Strange but true. The music, lighting, crowd and camera angles all worked together to make a "killing" sort of feel. You couldn't help but feel "amp"ed up, ready for anything, what with the friend saying to Marcus as he entered the bar, "I won't save you" or something to that effect. And Marcus went in anyway in a headlong search. Headlong because the music and the lighting said so. The camera was Marcus' drugged out, scanning eyes, sick for revenge against the one who had ruined his one love. What else are you going to do after a horrible event? Stay with the victim? And what does that then say about Marcus's "friend"? Pierre was nothing but a reasonable mind the whole time, only to break down and kill the wrong guy for the crime? He was obviously the kind to break under extreme pressure. He listened to the crowd and bashed that man's face in only because he had taken too much throughout the night. He advised nothing all night but for Marcus to be at Alex's side in the hospital. Yet, he didn't even blink an eye when the guys at the rape scene put it up to Marcus that they know who was responsible for the rape and that there is "No room for pussies" in the business of revenge. Where is Pierre in all of this until the end (the beginning)?And, finally, the rape scene. I would like to be able to say that I did not bite my fingernails almost clean off during this 11 minute scene. I would like to say that I could not imagine what it would feel like. I can't. However, I have a real problem with the scene itself. She barely put up a fight. I suppose that my perspective could come from some Reader's Digest fantasy to be the one woman who is not afraid to try anything to overcome her assailant, but really, there was not much fight in this scene here. I don't know if that was supposed to be timely (depending on when the story was set) or what, but I have to believe that if I was in the same situation, that the guy might eventually get what he wanted but would be bleeding too. I don't hold any complexes about my abilities to ward off evil men, but I do think that once he put that knife in his pocket, I would fight to the death before succumbing to a fate worse than death, which would be a 6 minute rape up the ass with a brutal beating following. I have personally been in abusive situations that took my by surprise, but in the end, I was ready to run and kill. I didn't get the whole 'wait for him to do more' action that was taken. Furthermore, I did not for a second believe that Alex loved Marcus. I was not intrigued by their love affair and got from her character that she would have been much better off had Marcus been slightly more like Pierre, in that he would have been with her in her time of need instead of running around, crazy, trying to find the rapist. Marcus was too self-absorbed to be a good man for her. I am sorry I spent so much time avoiding this movie. It was a masterpiece of cinematography and direction. A bit light on the writing.</fullReview>

Dizzying cinematography, backwards storytelling and gratuitous violence are desperate attempts of an amateurish director trying too hard to create the biggest gross out that he can. He succeeds in disgusting the audience, which I think is his primary goal. He may even succeed in shocking a few people but there is nothing more to Irreversible than shock tactics with some very boring bits in between. I was surprised by how clichéd and monotonous this movie was. It is not subversive. It is not powerful. It says nothing.

		<shortDescription>Yet another french dissertation on brutality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I agree that Irreversible is a movie that explores new technical ground in several respects, I have an uneasy feeling that (some) french auteurs are playing a vertigo-inducing game of "Can You Top This?". Consider, among other cinematic examples, Doberman, Baise Moi, Irreversible and Les Diables.Philosophically speaking, Irreversible may be the standout in this garçon-du-mal shock-art group. But by the time I saw it, this trend had desensitized me, I am no longer shaken by newness, I just have a numb bitter taste in my mouth. I rolled my eyes, thinking "Oh brother, here we go again".I cannot figure out why these directors obscure their surely commendable ideas and stances, in film after film, behind a barrage of stylized raw violence, rape, incest and cruelty. In fact, I suspect there is a major nihilistic streak percolating behind this emerging gallic franchise.And so, french auteur, I can think of five major reactions to your type of cinema:1. "It's an unbearable piece of trash and I walked out!". A reaction is yanked from the so-called complacent individual. But you hold contempt for this person anyway, do you not, auteur? 2. "It was unbearable for me and I had to walk out". The sensitive person is intimidated. Is this a victory for you, auteur? Or a casualty of war? 3. "I sat through the whole thing, I am tougher and better than you are". Or "Oh man, it was awesome! Check out how X does Y to Z!". Is this jaded individual your ally, auteur? 4. "It was devastating and moving". Very few appreciative people remain on this side of your blunt filters, auteur. Also, lightning will only strike once here. 5. "Behind the extreme visual and dramatic content, there are brilliantly well executed ideas". But this intellectual person has already seen and read elsewhere the very same ideas you express so...colorfully, auteur.I can see you taking a premise to its' final, logical extreme, permutated in as many different ways as you can think of, ninety minutes at a time. I just don't see the value of it anymore. Maybe you will grow wiser next time, leave the bad boys club, and surprise us all with a complex jewel of a movie, without the need to confrontate with sensationalism. Then again, maybe most of us will grow wiser and remember that the king was never wearing any clothes in the first place, as you noisily keep on penetrating a niche market.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very stirring film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading about all the controversy surrounding this film, and having never seen a film by Noe before, I felt I owed it to myself to check this one out. Although I agree that the rape scene was particularly disturbing, what I found to be more disturbing was the fire extinguisher scene. I have to say that I believe this is the most violent scene I've ever had the opportunity to see in a film. I think the reason I wasn't particularly shocked by the rape scene is because that is how I imagined a rape would be; horrifying, terrifying, and brutally vicious. No real surprise there. But I never really thought about what bashing someone's face in with a fire extinguisher would look or sound like. These images will stay with me for quite some time. I highly recommend this film, but, just like everyone else, only to those with strong stomachs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD from Netflix missing an important scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I just watched this DVD last night. When the FBI warning started to rotate the 'special effects' were already becoming irritating. By the time the first scene ended with the old naked guy and his 'friend' I was throwing stuff at the screen. I did not care for the spinning camera. Let's lose that, OK? However, it's like a headache. It feels so good when it stops. I was able to watch the most brutal rape scene I've ever seen and, since the camera was still, I thought 'hey, this aint bad'. So the director introduced a little psychological torture for the audience to make scenes that otherwise may have been unwatchable into entertainment.After watching the whole film I had to return to the scene in the beginning at the 'Rectum' to see what actually happened. After the 'old naked guy scene' they were removing a guy on a stretcher and the another being taken into custody with no explanation of what had happened inside the club. After reading the reviews here I now see that there was a violent scene within the club that was cut from this DVD. I had previously thought that those two heavyset guys that were going to help with the revenge for $$ had led them completely astray and the rapist had nothing at all to do with the gay bar. Now, I'm going to have to look on the DVD for deleted scenes to see what really happened.Either way, it was the kind of movie you'll remember for a long long time. I'll take my chances crossing the wide boulevard with the fast traffic from now on, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like movies. With this one, it's impossible to give a general rating. About the story: It sucks big time! If you look at it, there just is not an interesting storyline/plot to be found anywhere. When you tell a story backwards, it probably will be better to tell a simple story instead of a complex one. This film does not have any.Spoiler: A woman finds out she's pregnant from her boyfriend, who is stoned most of the time. Together with her ex and her boyfriend, they go to a party. She leaves early, while the two guys stay. On her way home she gets raped. The two guys learn what happened, and take revenge.That's it. And nothing else happens worth talking about. About direction of photography: This film is excellent! I could not take my eyes of the sublime way the absence of story was portrayed.As far as I know, this kind of photography was never seen before. To me the "story" rates 1/10, and the photography 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest review, hold the ego.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One way to take a mediocre story and make it 'artsy' is to tell it in reverse. Irreversible is a simple tale of revenge - guy's girlfriend gets raped and he angrily tracks down the rapist to get - yes, revenge. Another way to make it artsy is to add in a lot of shock-value and long vulgar scenes. Another way is to add in a homosexual backdrop (nearly a requirement for an `art film' these days. Just go to any film festival! Plain sex doesn't do it anymore. The final way is to move the camera around so the audience can get only a glimpse of what is truly happening, i.e. make the audience work for their entertainment so the audience feels smart and satisfied when they `get it.' Ego-stroking for audience and the French `auteur' alike. If a real producer had gotten a hold of this bad boy, it would have been cut down to 45 minutes. Sadly, this movie is basically a very fat, overcooked, dry turkey, with as much sauce, stuffing and dressing added as possible - to make it palatable to our intelliguntz.The good side is that if you look at this movie as experimental, with techniques utilized in the extreme to prove their mechanical-dramtic effectiveness, then, if that really is the message, well done. Camera movement and creepy music do add tension. Telling the story in reverse does make you watch some scenes twice (with the luxury of dvd or tape). Rapes do make people sympathetic and angry. Gay themes make it edgy. Long scences demonstrate that the director called his own shots (Baby!). All done to the extreme? Yes, an interesting experiment, but not really a good movie.</fullReview>

This film almost had me turning away, i know of no film which has managed to do this previous. This is a definite must see, Cassel is brilliant (as always), and the "Memento" style narrative works to great effect. the film starts in chaos, and slowly works towards tranquility. This film is stylish and original, but doesn't alienate its audience, there is something to relate to within the film. A great piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film that will come out in 2003.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barring some truly amazing film, and I fail to see none on the horizon, this is will be the best film of the year. Noe's camerawork is some of the best I've ever seen in a feature. Noe brings you straight into the action. The first half hour is shown at such a frantic, obsessive pace. The music is filled with anger and an impending sense of doom. As anyone who followed this movie knows, half the crowd at Cannes walked out after the screening started. I was further intrigued when I saw Monica Belucci defending the film while doing press for Tears of the Sun, saying "It is a difficult film to watch, but its important." The film really isn't all too violent, you're just assaulted with such graphic brutality at the beginning. If you can get past all the violence in the beginning, you should be fine. There is an amazing flow to this movie. A lot of the scenes are all one-take, one shot. Dialogue is entirely improvised. There was no shooting script. It's refreshing to see a film where you don't have a cut everytime a different character speaks. In other films, jumping coverage shots of each character in scene can take you out of the movie. The segues from scene-to-scene are ingenious. Noe keeps the music going throught the segues. This helps the film flow so well, it feels as if you're watching it almost in real-time. Great performances are turned on by Belluci and Cassels. You feel more empathetic for them as the movie goes on. A strong soundtrack also helps drive the narrative. The end shot is one of the most beautiful I've seen in a film in a long time. A must-see for all movie fans. A landmark in innovation and a gem of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie provoked deep feelings inside of me, touching corners on opposite sides of one another. The initial scenes of brutality made me wince, not in disgust, but in anguish. The rape scene was unrelenting. I felt like the guy in the film who was witnessing the rape, and was helpless to stop it. As the scenes progressed to the beginning, you start seeing the characters as human beings, which makes the beginning of the movie all that disturbing, because you know their fates.The movie really gives you pause to think about the relentlessness of time, how it keeps coming at you..... you barely have time to breathe. Time itself has no memory, it progresses along...Good things, bad things, god awful things happen, in spite of the past, unwary of the future, it happens as a perpetual present... and because it is relentless, no matter what it gives birth to, it destroys everything in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is seldom that a movie is able to make one think twice about it(certainly if you see many) Irreversable is one of those movies. If you've seen la Haine andliked it, or "C'est arrive pres de chez vous', I would recommend thisone for sure (rating it even higher). It is, for instance, shocking without that many shocking images. It'sin the way the camera moves, it's in the editing, the story and themusic. The acting is sublime. The director succeeded in creating an atmosphere that eventuallygrasps you by the throat and drags you deeper down into themovie's gore reality. Such is life, this could happen to you! Yet, it'sgruesome and unimaginable. Although a bit like Memento in it's reverse mode, this movie keepsyou in the simple story where it's very easy to get lost in Memento'smany clever tricks. The irreversibility of life become painfully clearas the movie unfolds. It is very easy to dismiss a piece of work like this as a cheapchocker just because the message is too painful and the imagesare in your face. After the first 10 too boring minutes this moviemakes you angry, sad and impressed. See this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most radical and demanding film experiences ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A word of advice: if you're sensitive, epileptic or easily impressionable, by all that's holy stay away from "Irréversible". Gaspar Noé's "cause cél?bre" is probably the single most violent film experience I have ever had in my life, with much less actual violence than your average Hollywood actioner, and a film out to make grown men cower and flee with the sheer impact of its images (at its premiere Cannes screening, the harrowing ten-minute rape scene is said to have driven viewers out in droves). Unfolding like a dark, devilish "Memento", it's the story of a rape and of its retribution, told backwards in twelve one-take tableaux from the moment the police arrive on the scene and find a man dead in a Paris hardcore gay club, through to the beginning of that evening when Monica Bellucci and current boyfriend Vincent Cassel (who are a couple in real life) are preparing to attend a party. The violence of the hardcore gay club scenes and especially of the rape have tended to concentrate punters on the film's vendetta motif, when in fact there is something more, something else afoot : yes, the film is about the animal inside us and how it can be released with just the right stimulus, but it's also about class struggle, about the despair of living in a chaotic universe, about love and the wondrous places it takes you, about the chasm between thought and emotion, all topped by the bitter irony of calling a film whose story is told backwards "irreversible". Although carried by the gutsy performances of the central trio, this is really Noé's baby (he wrote, directed and edited), and a stunner it is: almost always handheld, the camera slowly evolves from the nervous, freeform, aimless wanderings of a man lusting for revenge to the quiet, sexy early scenes of the couple. And the backwards construction, more than a narrative gimmick, actually lends poignancy and gravitas to the tragedy. If you're impressionable, don't even get near this. But if you can stomach "Irréversible", then it's probably one of the most radical, fascinating films you'll ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For what it's worth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... here's my own, personal reading of Irreversible. I don't normally make comments on films here, but, on this occasion, I have felt moved to, as I truly feel that the film, in some ways, has saved my life. I really don't wish to enter into the work of art/sick piece of rubbish debate (although I, for the record, thought that the film was a masterpiece), but rather, I would like to share with you the conclusions I reached by the end of the film. Perhaps they will give you a new angle upon a second viewing.WARNING: SPOILERS(NB: To avoid confusion, from now on I am going to refer to moments of the film based on the order in which they appear onscreen, eg. the beginning of the film means the scene with the two men talking in the room above "Le Rectum")In the second, infinitely easier to watch part of the movie, we have a couple of revelations: Alex (Monica Bellucci) is reading a book on dreams that predict the future. Later in the film, towards the end, we see her and Marcus (Vincent Cassel, who for my money gave possibly the most fantastically intense performance of the year in this film), waking up. Marcus admits to dreaming that he lost the feeling in his arm (an allusion to his arm getting severely broken at the beginning of the movie), whereas Alex describes the tunnel where we saw her getting raped earlier. We then see Alex find out that she is pregnant.The final scene has Alex lying in a park, reading the above-mentioned book, while children play around her. Then, the camera swivels towards the sky, we witness some strobe lighting, and the curtains close on the film's final message: "Time destroys everything".Now, here's the question: Does time destroy everything? In English, the saying goes "Time heals all wounds". After a long walk (much needed after witnessing some horrifically graphic scenes), I came to this conclusion: neither of the above are true. Time is like an express train on a long, interminable track. We board at one station (birth), and get off at another (death). But we can't stop the train. What we can do is make the most of our journey.The best way to illustrate my finding is to take the two above contradictory time-related statements: imagine, if you will, two people who have a parent die at the exact same time. The two people are the same age, have had the same intensity of love from said parent, and have had the same level of proximity to the parent. This does not mean that both will react in the same way. While it is obvious that both will grieve for a period, one may eventually come to terms with the fact that death is a part of life and move on, while the other may become resentful and bitter, withdrawing more and more into themselves. What this means is that life is both what happens to us and how we perceive it: how big a deal we make out of it.With the revelations given to me in the final scenes, I realised that I had the power to decide that Alex was never raped, and that Marcus and Pierre never made the subsequent descent into hell. This is backed up by the final scene, in which Alex seems to be some way into her pregnancy (although this may just be the angle at which she is shot). The film is a work of fiction, and therefore I can make that decision: it was all a dream, and, contrary to public belief, the film was in fact shot in the correct chronological order, starting with the nightmare and ending with the pair waking up. Dreams are, by nature, hazy, disorientating affairs, which explains the camerawork, sound and editing.Another realisation I made was that, given enough time and without external influences, a human being (if of sound mind) will always see what is right (whether they choose to act on it or not is another matter). This is illustrated by the speech of the Butcher from Noe's earlier "I Stand Alone" (Philippe Nahon), who admits that he was wrong in all he did in that movie.But more importantly, the film teaches us to learn all we can out of life, to consider all the possibilities, and to seek happiness and peace in all we do, for every second counts.Anyway, that's my two bits. And while I will admit that, on a number of occasions I was forced to look away, and indeed nearly vomited at a couple of points, I ran the course and came to the conclusion that "Irreversible" is a profound, moving and not at all gratuitous piece of work (having said that, anything can be profound if you read enough into it). I feel privileged to be one of the few people living in Britain who (at present) seems likely to get the chance to decide this for themselves. It's a great shame that the film is unlikely to ever be released here, and I'm disgusted that the BBFC can't see past the sensationalism surrounding the work (stirred up mainly by people who haven't even seen the whole film) and get to the heart beating inside it. If it is released uncut, and only one person came away as enriched as I have, it would be more than worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irréversible deserves a lot more than censorship barkings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But it does not deserve all the media-fuss about a scandal. Perhaps marketing troops thought it would be better for publicity. Personally I think not. There's much more in Irréversible than just in-your-face violence.From Chaos backwards to dream lifeGaspar Noé wanted to use the same narrative structure as Memento for he thought it gives a very deep insight on some psychological disorder. So Irréversible starts with the darkest and you got to know it before because it is not like The little house on the prairie opening credits and therefore you know it will not end up with a nice Walt Disney sunset hand-in-hand walk of some 90 minute industry-packed entertainment. Memento, I found it was a mere pain in the head (only the idea of global backwards montage lives up to it) but in Irréversible the result is much more natural: from violence back to innocence. All the lines in the script makes the storytelling more traditionally linear: you increasingly get in the movie as the lines spoken while you go back in time get increasing depth with the benefit of hindsight. Memento failed to do so, just clever for the sake of being a clever torture.Weirdly enough I think of Irréversible as complementary with Amélie and it's revealing that in France the very same critics who reluctantly accepted Amélie's happiness (too cheap happiness for those guys) lambasted Irréversible with cruel words. I wonder what they might like between beautiful dreamlike tales and pertinent movies deep rooted in the "humble reality".Cassel Bellucci and Dupontel are simply fantastic and Noé makes you feel so close to them (long sequence shots) that it's not possible to behave as a stubborn narrow-minded censor not acclaiming these outstanding performances.Bottom line: Gaspar Noé succeeds here where Mathieu Kassovitz failed with Assassin(s): deal with screen violence on a larger perspective, leaving more room for audiences to make up their minds about what they've seen, about their lives... I think it's the main achievement: bring us near nausea then give us fresh air on condition that we bear all this in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic piece of film making!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are those who's whole attention is drawn to the two graphic depictions of sex and violence within this film and those that see the genius within the whole story. This is not simply a story of revenge but in fact a real time experiment in the use of time as blatantly stated by the book read by Monica Belucci's character towards the end, 'An Experiment with Time' by J.W. Dunne. The audience is engaged both emotionally and physically by the controversial scenes and then slowly healed (at various points I heard the audience laughing at the light-hearted dialogue). The controversial scenes are also used to to show the weight of emotion that can be elicited from an individual and help us experience the rage and anger that lies within us all. Noe also shows us how complacent and desensitized we have become to screen violence by depicting a realistic scene and showing us the real horror of these situations.As a whole, the film is structurally, narratively and visually stunning, with one industry insider stating that the credits alone deserved a prize. Having seen 'Irreversible at the competition screening I can say that the only thing that disgusted me was the amount of people who walked out. It seems that alot of people only pay lip service when it comes to being serious about film and film making and once the glitz and glamour have worn off find the ride to tough to handle.If you think that you are intelligent, open-minded and can tell the difference between art and real life then see this film; you may have to re-examine your place in the herd!This is film making at its best and unmissable.</fullReview>

There are only two "shocking" scenes and they are not that shocking to be honest. People talk about the realism and sure it looks fairly realistic, but that isn't hard to do when you don't show much or the scene is so dark that you can barely make out more than silhouettes. If you want to be "shocked", then pass on this film. It isn't really a bad film per se- just not what it is advertised as. Wow, I need two more lines- fine. 99.9% of the movie is about an idiotic, annoying protagonist- partying, acting the fool, or on a mission for "revenge". The whole situation occurs because he is a selfish oaf and then his actions following (or in the manner the film is shot, preceding) the situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible is a lot to take. A disturbing confronting movie with some hard to stomach scenes. It's more disturbing than Salo. What we have here is real life. Rape happens. And what happens to this woman in this movie is probably exaggerated in it's violence, but this s**t does happen. It could happen anywhere, some guys go out with their girls, whatever. The girls are left alone for only a minute, then some jealous guys go nuts, cause they just can't have her. Anyone who bashes a woman almost beyond recognition, like in this movie shown through a nine minute rape scene, that even for me, took it's toll, should be castrated in the slowest and cruelest manner possible. The hot looking french chick in this is a woman who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, in this case, the place is an underpass, and alone, hot spunk that as she is, shouldn't of used in the first place. But Belluci, cheesed off with her partner, has left this party, a semi orgy, you could say, so she's not thinking rationally. This brutal pimp is knocking one of her girls around. Belluci, a witness, hesitant to make an escape, does, but in seconds, is ultimately tackled to the cement and is now in the clutches of this monster, who in this movie they never catch. Refer Deathwish. What this movie does, in it's storytelling, is sort of something Tarantino would do. The first scene leaves us quizzical. These two naked guys, middle aged, are having a bit of a crude discussion. Outside, there are a lot of sounds, noises, ambulances. They're coming from their neighboring nightclub. The boyfriend of the victim (Cassell) whose arm has just been broken, is being lifted into an ambulance while Belluci's older ex, has just been arrested for killing a guy in one of the most graphic scenes shot on film. The cops showing him great pathos here, it kind of got me angry. We go back in story. As the movie furthers on, we reach the part where we're in the wake of the girlfriends's attack, the two men, left to track this sonofabitch down in a sea of weirdos, transvestites, perverts, whatever, and will pay for info. The current lover, Cassell is fantastic in the way he demonstrates heartbreak, guilt, desperation, and especially RAGE! I've never seen an such emotion, so brilliantly displayed. Truly believable acting. Belluci doesn't have much to work with, concerning her business here, and the ex downplays it. The way the two male leads play off each other is interesting, especially in the wake of the rape, where the ex is trying to him talk out him of his unconstrained rage, you almost want to punch him, or tell him to shut the hell up. The first twenty minutes of Irreversible is in dizzying, circling shots, it almost passes itself of as garbage to the point of asking, "Where the hell is the movie going?", but you have to hang in there, as you the viewer, will be rewarded, like I knew would be. The story is told as if you started watching the last fifteen minutes of a video, you've just slipped into the VCR, then you rewind it, fifteen, twenty minutes before that, and watched that section, up to the point you first put the video in, and so forth, until you eventually wind up at the start and watch the first fifteen minutes. This works dynamically. So near the movie's closing, beautiful Belluci has just discovered she's pregnant, after taking a test, and this movie shows what can be lost in a heartbeat, from Cassell making just one stupid mistake, and the consequences of that mistake. Note: That graphic scene earlier mentioned, is the notorious one, a unforgettably disturbing scene of sickening violence, involving the ex, splitting half a guy's head open with a fire extinguisher. This shows the inner violence, us humans are capable of, when pushed. If anything, this scene could encourage a replica act of violence to those unsound minds. The last overhead, swirling shot of Belluci, stretched out across the grass, basking in the sun, looking beautiful, is somewhat haunting, as in the fact of the violent events that proceed. Footnote: An almost blinding, one minute of camera strobing follows. Weirdorama. Mystifying hey. Personally, I loooooved it, among a lot of other things this great drama offers. Ex-cellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick on Methamphetamine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed." ? William Gibson This is a review of "Irreversible" and "Enter The Void", two films by director Gaspar Noe.Stylistically both film borrow heavily from directors Brian De Palma and Stanley Kubrick, artists whom Noe himself readily admits are his chief influences. And so the roaming cameras of De Palma (primarily "Snake Eyes", a film which Noe adores) are taken to their extreme, and are applied to Kubrickean narrative structures which rely heavily on seemingly self-contained sequences; what Kubrick called "non submersible units". Beyond this, both films are packed with many overt and subtle references to Kubrick's "2001", "The Killing", "Eyes Wide Shut", and "A Clockwork Orange" (key characters in both films are called "Alex").But while De Palma and Kubrick went for classical beauty and ornate compositions, Noe ? a guy who habitually visits prostitutes, strip clubs and drug dens in real life ? goes for sleaze, gore, grungy cinematography, nudity and seedy set-pieces.On the surface, "Irreversible" offers a simple story. A pregnant woman called Alex is torn between two men, Pierre and Marcus. She is carrying Pierre's child (we think), but resents his oafish behaviour and drug use. Out one night, Alex is raped by a man called "The Tapeworm". Seeking revenge, Pierre and Marcus go in search of The Tapeworm. A transvestite points them in the direction of "The Rectum", a gay S and M club. Here they find a man whom they believe to be The Tapeworm. They kill him and are later arrested by the police.Told through 12 sequences (seemingly single takes), and with a plot which unfolds in reverse order, "Irreversible" sports a highly symbolic narrative structure and at least 6 warring narrators. On the first level, "Irreversible" can be read as the "linear" fantasy of a serial killer called The Butcher. Appearing at the start of the film, The Butcher tells a story to a character - who is a film director in real life - who will later spin this into The Butcher's sick fantasy journey away from the filthy streets and toward his angelic daughter. This is the daughter he raped at the end of Noe's "I Stand Alone".On the second level, the film can be read as the musings of Alex. She becomes an Alice in Wonderland figure (another story told through 12 sequences) who imagines a discontented life with Marcus (who can't satisfy her sexually and whom is unfit to father her child), whilst also longing for her true love, Pierre.On the third level, the film is entirely literal and simply told through a disembodied "ghost camera". Here, noir fate is evoked, "the future is irreversible" and all beauty turns to muck, all love a veneer over debased flesh. On this more metaphysical level, the film journeys from beautiful, heterosexual sex, to romantic disintegration, to homosexuality, rape, drugs, violence and sodomy. The baby itself turns from Kubrickean foetus, to a trans-gender to a parasitic tapeworm literally hiding in a Rectum.On the fourth level, the film is a competing fantasy between Marcus and Pierre in which they jostle to dominate a woman whom they both believe to be slipping away. On the sixth level, Alex doesn't know the father of her child, wishes the baby's death, and stages a rights of passage for Pierre and Marcus. Marcus wins and Pierre is arrested.There are other things to look out for: both the Tapeworm and Marcus spit on Alex, the Tapeworm has anal sex with Alex and Marcus vocalises his wish to do the same, Marcus suffers from "dead arm" and will later break his arm literally, Alex dreams of the red tunnel in which she is raped, Marcus and Alex's bedroom frolic is staged as an innocent version of an earlier rape sequence etc."Enter The Void" is a more straightforward film, but larger in scope. Here, a character called Oscar dies after reading "Bardo Thodol", The Tibetan Book of the Dead. The book details what happens after death (the soul leaves the body, explores moments from its past, is drawn towards a new body which it inhabits prior to reincarnation), a journey which Oscar himself undergoes.And so the film is comprised of numerous long takes in which Noe's camera roams above a city like a ghost. Here, quite naively, the body is shown to be a finite, spatial, temporal entity, while the spirit/mind is atemporal, non spatial and infinite. "Hole" motifs are used to frame each scene, suggesting links between vaginas, bullet wounds, corridors, pipes and mouths; life and death an interlinked conduit.Mostly, though, the film is a systematic reversal of Kubrick's "2001". While Kubrick's film is structured around a series of symbolic sex scenes and hopeful rebirths, Noe's film journeys through time and space and finds only intoxication, drugs, sex, incest (a brother's literal desire to enter his sister/mother) and masturbation. Here, all desire's are insatiable, humans are id-enveloped instant gratification desiring fck-machines and man has forgotten about outer space and instead turned hopelessly inwards. In a parody of the birth of Kubrick's Star Child, Noe then ends his film with an ejaculating penis and a baby being graphically born...before the whole ugly cycle starts again. Where Kubrick gave us Nietzsche's triumphant Übermensch, Noe gives us the apathy of Nietzsche's Last Man (complete with his own Kubrickian hotel sequence), all hope decimated, everything inherently "void". This is a decidedly postmodern taken on spirituality: there is only flesh; transcendence as ejaculate.Despite their eye-popping visuals, both films are too long, too repetitive (also the point; Noe banalizes "human sensation"), possess sex scenes which are at times too prettified (why stage the rape of one of Europe's most beautiful women?) and fail to go beyond easy pessimism.7.5/10 ? For better New French Extremists, see Assayas, Claire Denis or Dumont.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another of Noe,s brilliant masterpieces, which he uses his very visceral shooting styles, above and in between making you immersed in the film. The shots feel real and the sexy scenes, very visceral, as well as the violent scenes. You feel like you are watching fire unable to take your eyes away from it, unrelenting and brilliant, it encompasses your soul and body, and fills you full of emotions.A clear 9.4/10 and one of those brilliants like such films as memento.Another Noe film to be seen to believed and brilliant film like this doesn't come around that often and caress the mind body and the spirit inside.A must see for all film fans, and one of those very few French films I find entertaining and beguiling as well as thoroughly enjoyable and enthralling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this movie violent? Yes it is. What you see from beginning to end is the progression from gentle to pure rage and violence in reverse order. Many movies you spend several hours wondering when will the movie get to the point and in the case of Irreversible you're curiosity asks how did I get to this point. All being answered in 97 minutes time.If your stomach is weak then this movie is not for you, the very graphic nature of the violence causes you to ask was that needed. Maybe, Maybe not but it becomes so much more clear as the movie progresses. If you love watching the growth of a character then you will enjoy this film. Keep in mind the name of the film while you watch.Also pay close attention to how the wild camera movement works so well with the mood of the movie. This is a movie that might need to be watched more than once to really enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bold, harrowing and perhaps fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been 3 months since I saw 'Irreversible' for the first time. I know, a bit late, but it's honestly taken me that long to put what I've seen into perspective in order to write an adequate review for it. All I knew, immediately after watching it, was that it was an experience.I was screened just the opening sequence; which began with the closing credits scrolling backwards and then strobing Noe and Bellucci's names, white against black, synced with Thomas Bangalter's pounding music (of Daft Punk fame). The camera then swings through a window into a small room with two scantily clad men philosophising and reminiscing about days passed. The camera is never still, to the extent of causing nausea to some, and swings again to cover the entrance to a club called "Rectum" with an ambulance and Frenchmen screaming profanities. What is this??In any case, I was intrigued. Any film which experiments with form in such a way must be worth watching, so I tracked it down.Beforehand, I was "warned" about certain content in it that could possibly be disturbing. I braced myself but it didn't prevent particular scenes being deeply harrowing. The rawness in which it was done left an impact on me, I had to have time to take in what I had just seen.The film follows Marcus and his mission to avenge his violated girlfriend (Bellucci) but told in reverse chronological order. This way, the climax of the film, as it were, comes pretty early on. It's such a surprise that you can't help but be affected in some way by it. The violence is far from gratuitous or manipulative, it's raw and it's realistic. In fact, this accurately describes all of the content, plot devices and acting; the issue most people have is with the narrative style. I however, believe it is due to this that the film has such an effect on people; causing huge discomfort and confusion. You feel almost as Marcus does, utterly out of control with rage. I'll personally give you ?500 if you can watch this without having some sort of emotional reaction to it.It's not for everyone, that much is clear. I believe 'Irreversible' is one of the few 18 rated films which truly deserves that rating. This is light years apart from a teen horror flick that will give you a good thrill and some gore perhaps. This will truly disturb you, in the best way possible.Gaspar Noe has balls. He forces you to face up to some of the most horrendous things that you could possibly experience, showing it to you straight with no way of escape. You must not (and probably won't) stop watching. This is truly bold film making and that deserves immense credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memento for adults. (Oops?well, that only describes the first half hour.)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you ask most people the one major aspect that encompasses most children's fiction, most will tell you: "A simplistic story; be it in black-and-white morality, or in an A to B plot structure." Ironically, this definition also describes what critics and viewers both hail as one of the most disturbing movies ever made: Irreversible?and that's why I find the film lacking.If you know the film's title, then you also know it's one of the (handful) of movies that tells the story backwards. Though there were several lesser known films to do this long before the turn of the century, the one popular example is Memento. The one major difference here is, Memento was essentially just Happy Candy Land Rainforest Rainbow Ride, filled with trite, clean characters, and trite, safe, generic conflicts. When I first started viewing Irreversible, my only thought was: "Dude, this is Memento for adults! Thank God SOMEONE used the telling-the-story-backwards idea with an actually good story." And that's partly true . . .Irreversible does have some of the rawest, unexplained perverse human behavior every filmed?that is, in the first half hour. Because the movie is reversed, the characters brutal actions aren't explained until the midpoint of the movie, and, until that point, it's downright awesome. You're led to believe the characters are nihilists, causing this mayhem for no reason at all. The gritty environment (Rectum, the hotel, the tunnel) is genuinely gritty?not that cheap gangster shoot-'em-up atmosphere you see in generic crime movies. Then the bad storytelling ax falls and I felt cheated.After the over-hyped rape scene, the entire movie falls into predictable slasher-revenge-angst plot line; or just downright boring horror. The actions are explained as being revenge for rape (ala The Last House on the Left, I Spit on Your Grave, Straw Dogs, etc., etc.) and the awesomeness of nihilism ends and the cliché storytelling begins. Point blank: the original body of work we're led to believe the movies is, now is revealed as an unoriginal slasher flick. It's like ordering an expensive gourmet Italian pizza, eating a couple bites, and finding out it's really just frozen Save-A-Lot pizza from the local dollar store. And don't even get me started on the so-cliché-I-laughed-out-loud pregnancy test ending . . .Speaking of the rape scene: it's pretty generic. According to a quick IMDb.com search, there are more than 2,206 movies with a rape plot line, and if I were to do a more advanced search, that number would likely triple. Yes, kids, rape is a disturbing and terrible thing in real life, and I am in no means patronizing the real life event. But, folks, WE'VE SEEN IT IN MOVIES THOUSANDS OF TIMES. What's the big deal? You act as if Irreversible invented the scene or something. It's not any more disturbing or graphic or more weighted than any other rape scene ever filmed.The cinematography is cute. Spinning cameras, 2001: A Space Odyssey rip-off stylizing and music. I'm sure on a pretentious level this has a deep meaning (time and space and human insight?oh my!?as if we haven't heard that before!), but I'll just take it for face value and call it what it is. Cute cinematography that is both innovative and neat. But calling it "deep" is beyond melodramatic.So.Is Irreversible an enjoyable movie? Sure. I guess. It's okay. Watch it on Friday night, go to bed, and, unless you're a pretentious prick, I guarantee you won't remember when you wake up Saturday morning . . . but it killed some time, right? 5/10</fullReview>

That is the twisted revenge and that was what actually hit me the most. Finally he was not punished. I wonder if anyone noticed this. The rapist is shown to have a band-aid sort of thing on his nose which makes it easier to recognize him in the dark in The Rectum. There was a slight confusion between two men, Vincent asks them repeatedly who The Tapeworm is, of the two. It is shown, according to me, only because he ends up killing the wrong guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only will you go to bed still thinking about this shocking and disturbing movie, but you'll go to bed dizzy and physically sick from watching it. The camera is constantly moving in circles during the beginning of the film, and when it stops, it stops to show a hauntingly real and gruesome rape scene, a skull smashing fight scene, and other distasteful images. I can't think of the last time I actually had to stop watching a movie because of how grossly it affected me. So this comment really only applies to the first half of the film. After the party scene, when Alex leaves Marcus and Pierre alone, I had to turn it off. This movie went way beyond what I expected... I'm not really sure what I did expect, but if you were to ask me: "what is one of the scariest movies you have ever seen?" I would put this one at the top of the list. And when you're browsing through the horror section of your movie rental place, I'm almost positive you wont find this movie there. But it should be there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER! I've seen this move years ago unintentionally at the theatre. The summary did not give a hint that this is not some Hollywood "shocker" about revenge, but a true peace of art. But the extraordinary opening told me very quick that this would not be one of those amusing evenings at the movies. When we left the cinema, it took some time till we spoke again, and we all where fascinated.When it came out on DVD I bought it and tried to watch it again. But I was amazed that I did not had a problem with the scenes of extreme violence (the killing and raping) but with the end of the film. As the film goes further, it becomes more and more positive and that was what I couldn't cope! The film is told backwards (like Memento), so it start with the ending which is a lynch justice in a gay club, followed by a never-ending rape in an undercrossing. But after that (in watching-time, but before in story-time) the day of that sweet but everyday couple is told. And the story gets nicer and nicer, ending with the girl learning that she is pregnant and being very happy about that. And I had to learn that it was more horrible to see how good that life had been before what happened to it (and what I already had seen) than to watch a life going down from a happy point. When watching it an DVD, I had to turn of in a scene in the underground when the talking gets more and more common and more away from any indication of what will come (in story-time, but what has happened in watching-time).This was the first "happy ending" I could not stand, as it was "only" a happy ending in watching-time, but the happy starting in story-time.I hope I was able to express this in my poor English ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have trouble standing on your two legs after seeing this film. It's a little twisted but it's still incredible. The continuing shots that carry you backwards through the story of this couple keep your eyes fixed on the screen. However there are those moments when you want to look away. Like the scene in the bar when Pierre bashes the wrong guy's face in and leaves a bloody stump. Or the infamous rape scene, in which you yourself want to take revenge for Alex. I think there are only a few people who can watch any of these scenes listed above. Even the scene at the end of the movie, when Alex finds out she's pregnant is extremely difficult to watch.But even with the gut-wrenching details, it's a film worth viewing. I'd recommend it, unless you're the faint of heart or you get dizzy easily. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

I am particularly interested in how the facial injuries were done. Clearly some CG was involved. Could somebody give me a step-by-step breakdown of how it was done? I have some entry-level knowledge of prosthetics but not much of CGI. I am shooting a film (cinematic video more like it) that "references" this scene I while I certainly don't intend to duplicate Noe's technique (even though he himself said "nothing is original) I intend to parody this scene . Not a parody in the traditional sense, as I can assume most of you will agree that there is nothing humorous about the film, but a parody/reappropriation of his depiction of violence in what viewers seem to ascertain as realism, utilizing the surreal-structuralist technique (as if to say, "this is not real" by driving it to a further extreme by combining the technique of breaking the fourth wall of realism and incorporating elements of the vocal musical). Anyways, thanks, -Devon</fullReview>

It is far too easily written off as exploitation due to the 2 famous, explicit scenes. These scenes comprise about 20 minutes of a nearly 2 hour movie. They are graphic and disturbing and hard to watch. But the one thing they are not is exploitative. They are not gratuitous. They are necessary. Noe wrote, produced, directed and even shot some of Irreversible. This is truly his vision and one worth seeing. If for no other reason than such a thing is a very rare thing in this detrimentally politically correct time, where everything is made by committee, everything is PG-13, and art takes a backseat to selling tickets. I haven't the words to describe how important this film is. Experience it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, OK. So the flick's got some really brutal and graphic violence in it.That's cool--I like unflinching examinations of the pathos of humanity.But what's the story? Is this just a real-time (albeit reversed) exploration of a few horrific events in the lives of the characters? Is there ANY kind of cohesion to the killer's apparent sexual inadequacy and his willingness to beat a stranger to death, or is that just a coincidence?For whatever it's worth--Noe really should have made at least two minor efforts to make the film more watchable. Most of the drifting camera does little but annoy the viewer. I've seen better video of Las Vegas shot by drunkengamblers than the majority of this picture. And of course, the torment ofwatching movies that are inadequately LIT cannot be justified by the "brutality" of the content--if the filmmaker has decided to put it on screen for you, has he not ALSO committed to presenting it in a format that permits you to SEE THEACTION?All in all, I'm sure there are a million good reasons for giving this film a good review, but I regret to confess that I am unable to think of a single one.If you're the sort of person who likes amateurish presentation/polish of a "dark brooding theme," this may be the film for you.

In at least half of the movie, the camera swings around as if it were on a thrill park ride; so badly that it made me slightly nauseous.I know others who for that very reason skipped the rest of the movie and headed straight for the rape scene. I myself found it very powerful and scary in the fact that it seemed incredibly real. I would not advise viewing this movie if you have a background of sexual abuse. For those who have a liking of rougher sexual practices, this does in fact play like a low budget pornographic scene.Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci are always a pleasure to watch, though for real entertainment value, I would suggest viewing a very similar movie, Memento (2000), instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie for the sole reason to see Monica Bellucci. I am admirer of the Christopher Nolan film "Memento" because it was unique and stylish. Nolan is one of the best directors to emerge in the past twenty years. It is obvious that the film makers of Irreversible took the concept of starting from the end to the beginning. This was only pulled off because this was a french film. If it was done in america it would have been easily pushed aside as a Memento ripoff. In fact, it is a ripoff, but how many frenchman have seen Memento? Both movies are about revenge, but Memento created an antagonist that only lived to revenge his wife, and he kept changing his information so he would believe that he hadn't caught the killer. It is clearly obvious that Memento's style and look far exceeds that of most films to date. It is also obvious that the creators of Irreversible tried themselves to be creative, but in the end the camera work invoked rage instead of sparking intellegent thought that most movies do. In the end Irreversible's soundtrack, sets, and Bellucci's nudity is the only good things to come from this movie. The rape scene was too long. Who wants to see someone get raped for that long unless you have a fetish for rape. Overall, rent Memento for a better movie, and only rent Irreversible if you want to see Bellucci naked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie made to shock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IRREVERSIBLEThis is a movie made to shock. Like any movies, one can see Irreversible as many things. The critics are divided into: love it or hate it, my opinion on the other hand goes in between. I have not seen any movies made by Gasper Noe before, nor have I seen French movies where Belucci starred.I came into the cinema with an open-mind and tried to ignore all the hype and praises that this movie had received prior to its opening at the Beck's Incredible Film Fest 2003, in Auckland.--POSSIBLE SPOILERS--[The Gimmicks] The first 1/3 of the movie is filled with awkward camera angles, tilting, rotations and dizzy lightings. From the epileptic credit openings till the white flashes at the end of the movie, I get the impression that the movie was made not only to shock audience, but also to make them feel sick literally. As such, all of those fancy camera tricks and lighting settings were just cheap gimmicks. There is a difference between being smart about conveying the feelings of the characters/situations/messages in a movie, and punching someone in the solar plexus to get your message across. In which case, Irreversible definitely falls into the latter category.I mean, Noe himself repeatedly stated that he wanted to shock people when he was interviewed by the French media about this film. On a more recent article in our local newsletter, Noe was noted to say that he'd be happy to have Irreversible played along side B-grade movies like 'The Cannibal Holocaust' and had no quarry about it being played along side trash movies either. I rest my case.So, for those of you who wants to see this movie out of curiosity or wants to get the 'message' of the film, look the other way when Noe starts to swing his camera in the film. If you want to get dizzy and vomit, eat lots of pizza and take a roller coaster in a theme park instead. Film critics who praised this movie for its 'positive' message, should just ask Noe what the movie is really meant to do, instead of theorizing on things that are not there to begin with.[The Rape Scene] The core event of this movie is the notorious 10-minute of rape scene. Some critics say that this is the most powerful anti-violence movie, anti-rape and so on. Rape is wrong. But this movie is not about anti-rape nor anti-violence. It's just a shock extravaganza. There are more brutal rape scenes in other movies, and they happened to nicer people. The 2 main characters in this movie, Alex and her boyfriend Marcus, are far from nice/innocent either. Both Alex and Marcus seem to be the kind of people who frequented rave scenes. We see Marcus freely flirts with other women, takes drugs and when push comes to shove, you see how violent and racist he is. Alex on the other hand, for someone who is supposed to be a 'sophisticated' upperclass woman, should have known better not to go through an underground passage way, at night time in a dodgy part of the city and dressed so provocatively. Simply put they are not the best of the human flocks; nevertheless they did not deserve the fates they receive in the film.[The Flashback] Well, I have to say Memento does it better and within context too. Reversing the movie from the end to the beginning firstly contradicts the movie title's Irreversible. Although the title implies that what happens to the characters at the beginning of the movie will make them unable to go back to their 'innocent' days, it undermines the characterizations of the people. Specially when it comes down to the character of Alex.We see her getting violated first before we learn who she is. Therefore one can't symphatize more with her character or understand the implications of rape, to the baby she's carrying (which we didn't know until almost at the end of the movie). I think the long rape scene would've been excruciatingly painful for the audience if we had gotten to know Alex better.The only character I pity most is Pierre, because he had to take the burden of killing the wrong person when Marcus almost got raped in the gay club.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. This film is one big joke - and ill explain why. This film is supposedly about the ramifications and seriousness of violence, told in all is horrible glory. Indeed, this film features two of the most sickening scenes in cinema history - a nasty prolonged rape and a seriously scary murder. However, everything after the rape is plain dull - an uninspired "conversation" scene on the tube, a sub Bertolucci bedroom scene (although it recalls the scene in "A bout de souffle" by Jean Luc Goddard, except much less convincing), and a stupid, cliched ending which turns into an epileptic's nightmare. And the lack of narrative thrust after the initial shocks proves my point - THE FILM EXISTS ONLY TO SHOCK! But credit where credits due; Noe knows exactly how to manipulate and terrify his audience. The rape is even more disturbing because of the naturalistic performances of the two actors (Belluci and Prestia), and the murder is preceded by five minutes of visual and aural chaos (spinning, twisting camerawork and annoying siren sounds) that put you on edge, even before any of the following violence. But this is all Noe's got! As previously stated, once the violence is over, the film stagnates and has nowhere to go. People have said that the second half works because it provides a stark contrast to the nastiness of the first half, that it somehow highlights the tragedy and makes the latter scenes more poignant. But this is simply not the case - Noe just plain runs out of ideas and the last half of the film is just padding to fill the ninety minutes (notice how the film is only 93mins long!)And therein lies the joke - Noe has sold the public a text book exploitation film, disguised as artistic meditation. Well done Mr. Noe. I hear his next film is about a trans-sexual serial killer, shot on monochrome film, has 12,000 edits and features an "hilarious" fifteen minute dismemberment scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in Sydney as part of the French film festival. Having seen Baise Moi, I was curious to see how this film compared.I think the reports that this is a sexual explicit film are unfounded. The most explicit scene was at a party before the rape. Alexandria is getting her coat to leave and for a couple of seconds you see a female party goer giving oral sex to a guy. In the actually rape scene Alexandria still has her dress 90% on. You don't even see her bare breasts and the only way you know she is being sodomise is because the rapist is describing it. The only bodypart exposed are her beautiful long legs and you only see her bare bottom after the violation.Compared with Baise Moi, I thought the acting in the rape scene from Monica Bellucci was unconvincing. I think she would have been screaming more and her body reacting violently to pain if she was really being sodomised in a forced situation. In Baise Moi the sex is real, not simulated, it should have been classified XXX. The lady being raped is screaming and crying at the top of her lungs.As regards to the violence, I think the level portrayed in the movie is very high and disturbing. However the scenes are shot in one take, the visual effects suffered. Again in the rape scene when Alexandria gets kicked in the face and then her head constantly slammed into the concrete floor, I would expect more blood. In Baise Moi, the level of violence portrayed isn't as high, but it was realistic which I felt had greater impact.In the scene with the fire extinguisher I think the visual effects were limited again because of the decision to do a one shot scene. The sound effect was real enough, but there wasn't enough blood. Saving Private Ryan was probably more gory. The only thing more disturbing in Irreversible is that the attack lingers on screen for a longer time, rather than just a few seconds.Was there a message in this film? Well I'm still struggling to understand what the Time Destroys Everything means. However what is an interesting point in the film is a concept that is deal with in Heart of Darkness. Pierre seems to be the person with more rigid moral and social boundaries compared with Marcus. There is a comical scene in the Subway where Pierre questions Marcus how he is able to get Alexandria to orgasm when he could not. Alexandria finally responds that sex isn't something you think about, it is something you do, which touches on the idea of primal instincts ( which I personal do not agree with having studied Tantra. Good sex can be taught )After the rape, it is Marcus who first wants revenge and is seen as almost out of control, while Pierre is trying to reason with him. But as Marcus loses a fight in the gay club to a gay friend of Alexandria's rapist, having his arm broken and is almost raped himself, it is Pierre who finally steps outside his boundaries to tap into his primal instincts of survival. This is where he decides to fight with a fire extinguisher.Was there artistic merit to the film? I couldn't find much. In Baise Moi I thought there was an extremely important statement about how some people are violent because of the environment they live in. Irreversible didn't really have a strong enough statement to make. The film is almost incidental. A woman gets raped and bashed. A boyfriend and ex boyfriend searches for the rapist and ends up biting off more than they can chew. The only reason I hung around to watch the rest of the film was to see Monica Bellucci's beautiful naked body.</fullReview>

My point is that I felt this movie went completely overboard in many aspects. The camera was too shaky, at times nauseating. The violence was taken too an extreme that I loved for it's absence from film but ultimately it was pointless. The story isn't that great and NOWHERE near the likes of Memento!!!

		<fullReview>Without wishing to seem perverse, my main reaction to this film was of frustration and finally boredom. The killing in the night club and the rape were both graphic but responsibly so and were both well done - I've no quarrel with scenes like these that show violence as ugly and repellant.What I mainly disliked were the pretentious commentaries on predestination and free will, the twee and cliched final scene between the lovers, the hysterical overacting and banal dialogue, and the forced romanticism at the end (complete with the portentious sub-2001 light show).What a disappointment after Seul Contre Tous, which was so compelling and skillfully done. Sadly, this had few ideas beyond attempting to shock, and those that there were present were banal and bathetic. An eminently forgettable film, which is presumably the one thing Noe wanted to avoid. Let's hope he finds his form with his next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the next step in cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a book written by Andrei Tarkovsky called "Sculpting in Time", in wich he tries to define an alternative to montage driven film; that is to say almost the entire film production in the world. He saw cinema as the ultimate art that was capable to reach the audience in its soul. By the use of time. This clearly appeared in his films by the extensive use of sequence shots. But, it doesn't mean a whole film like this, no; it's still moments in life carefully chosen, captured - through a single shot to truly FEEL the time, wich is inseparable from its meaning - and then arranged in the cutting room. That is what Irreversible manages to do in an absolutely, incredibly, fantastically stunning way. Don't listen to the easy critics; it's absolutely not a story of revenge. In fact don't listen to any critics, try to see the film with a neutral approach (impossible), and experience what cinema is. Like Tarkovsky's films, this film is the proof that eisenstein wasn't right. You can use juxtaposition of unrelated shots to create a meaning. But not emotions. Not rythm. Rythm and emotions are IN the shot, not around it.It's a film about what passion driven lives lead to. What you get when you just want to enjoy present time. Like Marcus, you destroy what you really care for.It's the film you have to see if you plan to be a filmmaker, cos it's a vaccine against mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irréversible explained in the words of Stephen Hawking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen Hawking explaining Gaspar Noé's film Irréversible and its main theme "Time destroys everything.".&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a big difference between the forward and backward directions of real time in ordinary life. Imagine a cup of water falling off a table and breaking into pieces on the floor. If you take a film of this, you can easily tell whether it is being run forward or backward. If you run it backward you will see the pieces suddenly gather themselves together off the floor and jump back to form a whole cup on the table. You can tell that the film is being run backward because this kind of behavior is never observed in ordinary life. If it were, crockery manufacturers would go out of business.The explanation that is usually given as to why we don't see broken cups gathering themselves together off the floor and jumping back onto the table is that it is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. This says that in any closed system disorder, or entropy, always increases with time. In other words, it is a form of Murphy's law: things always tend to go wrong! An intact cup on the table is a state of high order, but a broken cup on the floor is a disordered state. One can go readily from the cup on the table in the past to the broken cup on the floor in the future, but not the other way round.&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The second law of thermodynamics results from the fact that there are always many more disordered states than there are ordered ones. For example, consider the pieces of a jigsaw in a box. There is one, and. only one, arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture. On the other hand, there are a very large number of arrangements in which the pieces are disordered and don't make a picture.Suppose a system starts out in one of the small number of ordered states. As time goes by, the system will evolve according to the laws of science and its state will change. At a later time, it is more probable that the system will be in a disordered state than in an ordered one because there are more disordered states. Thus disorder will tend to increase with time if the system obeys an initial condition of high order.Suppose the pieces of the jigsaw start off in a box in the ordered arrangement in which they form a picture. If you shake the box, the pieces will take up another arrangement. This will probably be a disordered arrangement in which the pieces don't form a proper picture, simply because there are so many more disordered arrangements. Some groups of pieces may still form parts of the picture, but the more you shake the box, the more likely it is that these groups will get broken up and the pieces will be in a completely jumbled state in which they don't form any sort of picture. So the disorder of the pieces will probably increase with time if the pieces obey the initial condition that they start off in a condition of high order.&lt;&lt;&lt; Ergo: Time destroys everything.Stephen Hawking on the narrative structure of Irréversible:&gt;&gt;&gt;Suppose, however, that God (Gaspar Noé in this case) decided that the universe should finish up in a state of high order but that it didn't matter what state it started in. At early times the universe would probably be in a disordered state. This would mean that disorder would decrease with time. You would see broken cups gathering themselves together and jumping back onto the table. However, any human beings who were observing the cups would be living in a universe in which disorder decreased with time. I shall argue that such beings would have a psychological arrow of time that was backward. That is, they would remember events in the future, and not remember events in their past. When the cup was broken, they would remember it being on the table, but when it was on the table, they would not remember it being on the floor.&lt;&lt;&lt; That's basically it, in a nutshell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most revolutionary movies, in technique and in intent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marcus and Alex are a French couple. Marcus often enjoys trying new things. Alex is outgoing and likes to dance and talk with her girlfriends. One night, the couple teams up with Alex's ex for a night of conversation and partying that, unfortunately, ends up hellishly life-changing for all three.A simple enough story, but what makes the film genius is the combined vision of script, direction, acting, editing and soundtrack. Cinematic magnificence abounds as the story line moves backwards, the score throbs with inescapable doom, the camera moves like a mosquito, or a ghost, or like the sight of someone who is nauseous and on the verge of fainting.Yes, some viewers may wish Noé had chosen subjects not so displeasing as assault and battery, rape, murder, infidelity, and revenge. I know I had that wish while watching. "Why couldn't Noé have used the same technique to tell a sweet, life-affirming love story, or something with elves and sprites and a magical forest? Anything but this gruesomeness?!" But Noé seems to be in a bleak place, spiritually, and his only way out, is to search for meaning and to portray it on film, which he does masterfully. What is commendable about this movie is that he didn't flinch from portraying his nightmare, he didn't stop and say, "Well, maybe this is too much for viewers. This hasn't been done before, so maybe I shouldn't do it either." You see, we have movies coming out everyday which are made for us to escape into so that we can feel good about ourselves. And thus life stays fairly status quo, never with hopes of progressing. But with his intention for making this movie, Noe is at his most interesting. It is as if he is trying to destroy cinema as a means of escape. To wrest cinema from "feel good" "popcorn flicks", and to reclaim it as a means to wake us up. To use it to hold up a mirror to our bleakest, most hopeless side. And show us the dead-end that self-centeredness leads to. That's why it's so good and should be seen or at least attempted to be seen, because he uses his novel, disorienting techniques for a cause higher than just a momentary thrill. He uses it to appeal to elevate the human conversation. He shares with us his hard-earned philosophy. He shows us his desperation. And he shares with us his truth, without ever once preaching at us, without ever once spelling out a particular action to take, or a particular way to be. In fact, there may not be one definitive moral to take from it, but after such a harrowing journey as the writer- director takes us on, we are left scrambling to find or make one that will free us from the movie's infernal grasp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irréversible is what you get when you throw in a bland script, uninteresting story, long violent scenes and dress them with reverse- chronology. However, the reverse-chronology doesn't make the movie any good.The movie has a good tagline --"time destroys everything"-- and at first I thought I was going to witness a deep story about how time can destroy things. I persisted that feeling until about 20 minutes. The movie uses long takes with camera spinning and I thought they had some meaning. After awhile I get the feeling that this movie is just showing off its directing style and shooting techniques right from the start until the end.I didn't find it hard to watch at all. Every emotion shown on this movie means nothing to me because they feel so fake. After a while you're going hate the main male character (Marcus); I thought I'd feel a sympathy for the characters in the end but I was wrong. I felt sorry for the raped character (Alex) but in the end there's nothing that would make me feel more than sorry for her (this doesn't mean I don't have any sympathy for rape victims in real life, this is a movie and I knew it's not a real rape so I was hoping for something that'd make me feel sympathetic for the character other than just a rape scene). The character plot is just that uninteresting. Well, to be honest it could have been interesting if there are more development &amp; depth here and there or a creative directing style to stir your emotion. But no, reverse-chronology or not this movie is still bland.Sure Irréversible has a lot of realistic scenes, I applaud the special effects. It's a shame that this movie only focuses more on the presence of hard-to-watch scenes. It's proud of its violence and sex scene while it lacks a meaningful depth. Irréversible is no better than a gore- flick.I'd like to compare this movie with The Hills Have Eyes. Both film have rape scene, the only difference is The Hills Have Eyes delivers a character background and that makes the audience feel something for the raped character. Irréversible doesn't have that, not even after I watched the end and learned more about the characters.</fullReview>

This movie is not artistic, it's violent and disturbing. This movie is not erotica, it's exploitation. This movie doesn't have a plot, it just moves through violent and sexually explicit scene one at a time. With each move back in time we see a new and more disturbing scene than the last. Why anyone would pay money for this kind of film is just beyond me.

		<fullReview>Many critics have called this film unwatchable, and they're almost right, but not for the reason they suggest. I've got a strong stomach, so I could easily watch the murder scene and later on, the rape (although that was painful to sit through). The rape scene should be required viewing for anyone who thinks it's possible for a rape victim to enjoy sexual pleasure while being victimized. But the opening credits annoyed me because the reversed lettering made them practically illegible. I suspect even viewers fluent in French would have a hard time understanding what they meant. And I still don't see the point of spinning the camera incessantly for the first 15 or 20 minutes. Stop being artsy! I'm in a movie theatre, and I want to SEE what's going on!Aside from the murder and rape scene, there is very little to recommend this movie. Most people are overlooking the REAL reason this movie was shown backward. Writer-director Gaspar Noé quickly figured out the real reason that most people would be interested in seeing this movie---to get a glimpse of star Monica Bellucci naked. So it's not until the very end that we see a protracted scene of Belluci in the buff and her real-life husband Vincent Cassell knocking the bottom out of that THANG. If that's what you want to see, I'd recommend waiting for the DVD. Better yet, watch "Memento", a true masterpiece that uses the backward film gimmick for reasons other than to postpone a nude scene. Except for Guy Pearce, you won't see any nudity in "Memento", but the film will make you think and you'll actually want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directors need to stick with more conventional film-making techniques. Watching this was like seeing something with a strobe light on and and you're turning uncontrollably. I was able to sit through about 20 minutes of it before I had to turn it off. Good grief, I have to add 10 lines of text... OK, here goes. The movie opens in a crime scene, although you really can't tell it, except for the flashing blue lights bouncing off the walls; the camera is flying around, as if it's a leaf tumbling in the wind, so it rolls, and it turns and seems to fly around randomly without really settling on a scene. Finally, it does settle on a scene, and it's two guys in a hotel room which seems to have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. OK, I didn't sit through the entire movie and maybe they tied back in some time later, but at that point of the movie, they had nothing to add. The next scene is chaotic, as they pull the protagonist out of the "gay" club on a stretcher and place him in the ambulance. Then, there is more chaotic "leaf" blowing imagery. Then, it goes back in time, and it's the protagonist arriving at the club, and more leaf blowing video. The real issue is, I believe, that the camera never rests on a single scene long enough to actually understand what is going on. I finally gave up on this PoS movie after the protagonist's friend beats someone to death with a fire extinguisher. I know this was supposed to be presented ala Memento (another movie with sucked) or Pulp Fiction, but it really didn't work, at least for me.The fact that it was subtitled in English also helped distract from the movie itself, as it's hard to read text at the bottom and watch shifting images at the same time.</fullReview>

Put it in DVD player, didn't like the menu's even, right from the start there's's a lot of flashing going on, very annoying. But then it gets on it's way and that's one shaky road it's heading down, either the camera is shaking or it's turning around in some strange angle. I guess that's the tricks you have to use as a director when the story, characters and dialog can't carry the film. I do think the movie would have been better without those annoying things in it, and what's up with the flashing white light at the end ???? is that some kinda brainwash going on "you liked the movie, you liked the movie, you liked the movie", totally pointless in my opinion. on a 1-10 scale i give this a 5, it was OK but not very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Irreversible' is the best film I saw lately. It is a strong and original work, but it is not for everyone to watch, understand, or enjoy. The film is about the brutality of rape, and about the justification of revenge. The technique of telling the story in reverse order makes a lot of sense here, and helps us understand how easily our comfortable lives can be turned into a spiral of hell. Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' used the same technique, but there the result was just a cool, technical film. Here, we are rolled back from the violent end to the normal lives of the characters before the assault, and this is why the filmed violence does not look as inserted for commercial reasons, but to make the message stronger.There are at least two scenes of intense violence and another scene of sex that may turn censors and different kind of viewers against this film. Some people will not find the violent scenes easy to watch, and may simply walk off the theater, or turn off the player. The technique of filming in one shot, in a reality TV style only emphasizes these scenes. However they make perfect artistic sense. There is nothing cheap here, and the sincerity of the acting in the whole film proves that good actors under the hand of a good director do not need strict coaching to make the film happen.People need to be warned that this is no usual film. True cinema lovers will understand and love it. It gets a rare 10/10 on my personal scale</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yes, there are some SPOILERS.somewhere i saw someone mention that this joint was LESS boring than Memento (that ol' thing) because it didn't show the shots at the end of time sequences to remind you that the film was in reverse. Well, i hate to break it, but not only was irreversible incredibly more boring than the afforementioned (which didn't bore me at all), it also wouldn't have worked out re: understanding had Memento not come before it. in addition, Noe fails to be aware of and use the backwards device: the movie would have had more build up told straight forward and there is no plot twist (or plot, for that matter) at the end (beginning) of the movie that you should watch out for. that said, let's review: story is weak and uninteresting, once i had seen the head smashing and the rape i was wondering when the film would be over (when it would start?) and what Noe could do to keep me even moderately interested. Unsurprisingly, what he came up with was the two usual suspects, the rest of the film revolved around talk about sex and nudity. a note about the rape sequence, IT WASN'T GRAPHIC AT ALL. in the same way that last year's crap critics choice "y tu mama tambien" was filled with 'sexual openess' but utterly failed to depict any of what was to be its only gay sex scene (and possibly the best interaction in the movie), irreversible gives us the 'brutal' rape from one angle for 10 minutes. here's what you see: Monica Belluci screaming with her face muffled and the film's antagonist on top of her, presumably giving her the prison treatment. the guy behind me actually fell asleep during the rape scene. throw in some cheesy film school 'poster-symbolism' (via the 2001 poster at the end, amongst others) and mind bogglingly stupid statements about time that mean nothing, and there you have it.i must mention that i am quite disapointed that what was some fairly intense camera work and vincent cassell's great "maniac" portrayal went to waste on such an intentional turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rage rampage after rape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of the movie is because of its unbearable camera shaking kind of intriguing. But when it came to the 10-minute face-bashing scene I felt sick for the first time. Over the time the shaking camera, representing the rage of the boyfriend of the rape victim slows down with the pace of the story. Just when things were calming down and the motive for the face bashing was to be presented, I got sick for the second time because of a 10-minute rape scene. Usually I'm not easily shocked but `Irreversible' clearly confronted me with my limits. The idea of the movie and the technique is not bad but the shocking scenes and some of the visual effects clearly dragged this film down the drain for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Masterpiece? Don't make me laugh (though I could use it after seeing this shambolic mess).The good: acting performances. The bad: everything else. Shoddy editing, lousy storytelling, inconsistent style... as an example, the use of the twirling camera sometimes indicates the (unnecessary) reverse-time jump, sometimes (especially in the first half hour) it's just (over)used, ostensibly to disorient the viewer. A grand purpose indeed.Also, with a view to the storyline, there is no way Marcus would even have found out about Alex until the police showed up at his apartment. First, the rape happens a quarter of a mile away from where the party is being held - and in any event closer to the other end of the tunnel, so that's where the paramedics would pick her up. Why would the ambulance be parked right outside? Second, Marcus recognizing Alex is just ridiculous. She's on a stretcher with her clothes covered by a blanket, her face is a bloody balloon that looks nothing like Alex, and he's just snorted God knows how many lines of cocaine. Thus, the whole premise of the ensuing chase goes down the toilet.And no, the reverse storytelling adds absolutely nothing to the story, as opposed to e.g. Pulp Fiction and Memento. This film's sole redeeming feature is the fact that it presents 15 minutes of prime material for rape-fetishists to post and download in their forums.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because a film contains Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel and just because it is in French does not make it art. This is as much an exploitation flick as anything produced in the era of the video nasty. The whole exercise stretches credulity to breaking point and is not helped by the total lack of acting skills of Ms Belluci and the total vacuity and plain lack of any sympathy the average viewer will have for the majority of the characters.The rapist himself is just a cipher and has no apparent motivation - for which matter why doesn't he just kill the victim? As for the rape scene itself it is just completely unbelievable and looks over-rehearsed for cinematic effect.Overall a load of overblown schlock garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Entertainment Value At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please do not read this if you plan to watch the movie, unless you want me to save you some money.Like the summary of my review, this movie has no entertainment value at all.I work at a movie store and the owner asked me to watch the movie when I got a chance and to let her know what I thought about it. I found this website (thankfully) and noticed all the reviews it got and its average score. I thought it must be pretty good so I recommended it to a friend before watching it. He called me that night and really gave me a hard time about referring it to him. I thought, `Surely this movie can't be THAT bad.' So, I took it home. It is that bad. How it got a 7.2 rating or whatever it is at now, is way beyond me.The way the movie started out should have told me to press stop and eject. The filming looks like it was shot by the same company that makes those safety meeting videos a lot of employees have to sit through. Also, it reminded me of a cheesy PowerPoint presentation.The fact that the whole movie required English subtitles, which I was not aware of, disappointed me. If I want to spend 2 hours reading, I'd read a book.There are many negatives to the movie and few positives. There were a couple of times in the movie when I was anticipating the next scene. but only a couple.The fire extinguisher part everyone is talking about was pretty violent, but nothing more violent than in movies like Braveheart, or Casino, for that matter, when Joe Pesci actually crushes a guy's skull in a vice to the point his eyeball pops out.The gay love-bath scenes were just disgusting to me. There will be people who found it erotic or those that want to argue their opinions, but know in advance it won't change mine and I'm not going to argue moral grounds with you nor will I reply to such arguments.The Rape Scene: That has to be the worst 9 minutes of footage in any movie I have ever seen. I was appalled, and again, disgusted. The scene could have been told in 2 minutes. The only purpose it was given that length of time was to shock as many viewers as possible (which is what people with no talent usually do for attention.)Bottom line: Save your money and watch a rerun of Faces of Death if you want to see blood and violence. You'll get just as much entertainment.</fullReview>

I am ashamed that Monica Bellucci even agreed to take this role, not-to-mention appear at Cannes to promote this abomination of a film. Monica was on quite a role of performance gems (Malena, Les Pacte Des Loups) earning respect and creating demand for herself.

		<shortDescription>Interesting film technique without much substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the film technique is prodigious and inventive, but that's about all this film has to show. In his tentative to make out of Irreversible a subtle meditation about relationships, love, violence and destiny, the director succeeds only in having a juvenile, therefore superficial, glimpse at all these themes. Irreversible lacks substance and unfortunately this lack of substance is not compensated by the visual spectacle: the Dantesque homosexual bar called Rectum or the infamous rape scene, probably the longest in the history of cinema are images/scenes one can't easily forget. Characters aren't veridical - and that's a flaw in a movie that tends to talk about life and destiny. The script, the lines have the same shortcomings and only the fact that the movie runs from the end to the beginning makes it a little bit more interesting. But I'm afraid this couldn't be enough to make it worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sodomy destroys everything" Tagline for a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie essentially contains two hyper-violent scenes, the first is presented in the first act and the latter in the second act. These rather gratuitous scenes serve as the film's setpieces. After these two scenes are realized, the film has essentially shot it's wad. The third act of the movie attempts to flesh out the involved characters, but during the odd dialogue between the three, I kept thinking about the previous subway and gay bar scenes. The big reveal in the third act was not that big as I kinda saw it coming ever since the party scene. Traditionally, most people will sit through the more boring parts of a movie to get to the climatic parts toward the end. By reversing the order, the audience is expected to sympathize with the characters after the fact. That could have worked, but because of the extreme violence of the previous acts, it's seems as though the director was aiming for a shocked reaction from the audience rather than a sympathetic one. Personally, I believe that the gratuitous ten-minute rape scene desensitized me a great deal and after sitting through that, I felt it unnecessary to sit through the character development scenes. Also, the plethora of anus references was really distracting. The first and second acts are mostly filmed in reddish, enclosed, tunnel-like spaces. Male characters threaten to sodomize each other and bandy about homophobic language frequently. That movie is a hotbed of Freudism. On that note, I thought the movie should have stayed with that scene and placed a male in the role of rape victim and then the movie could have explored the whole "male anxiety over his anus" theme. Placing a women as the victim of sexualized violence perpetrated by a gay male? That was a stretch. I could see that man beating her into a coma but because he was identified as gay he should have acted within the confines of the term and raped a male. Then the movie could have retained a little consistency. Even the tagline, "time destroys everything" is nonsensical. In this film, it appears as though gay pimps who forcibly sodomize women in subways destroy everything. I found the fire extinguisher/subway scene quite affecting, but overall, this movie is heavily flawed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin with Irreversible.... I know from having read other user comments that a number of people out there like Gaspar Noe's style with short sharp cuts and whirling perspective's. To the uninitiated (I include myself in this) this can be hard to watch and can leave you with a nauseating feeling. This however seems apt for the subject matter of this piece. Stylistically I think the movie is well done, but that would be seriously overlooking the content of the film.I'm not the type of person who has a weak disposition or feels squeamish at the sight of blood. I've sat through and enjoyed "A Clockwork Orange" and "Silence of the Lambs" and although disturbing in the exploration of violence, and the psychology of the criminal mind, I never felt that there was a gratuitous nature to the presentation of this subject matter. However I couldn't help but feel that the two scenes that define this film were unnecessarily violent and amounted to little more than a dressed up snuff movie.The suggestion that by telling the story in reverse that somehow the movie ends on a pleasant note doesn't hold water for me. I was so shell shocked that even the sight of Monica Belucci frolicking naked made me feel a little uneasy, after witnessing her humiliation earlier in the movie.I think it's a disappointment that such an artistically shot movie should gratuitously present such horrific subject matter. I'd suggest that Gaspar Noe should turn his attention to something more worthy of his ability. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreversibly Moronic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today before leaving work, a good friend and fellow amateur movie critic recommended I see "Irreversible" because it was supposed to be "a movie similar to Memento in that it is filmed in reverse chronology, but much more violent. Directed by a guy named Noe who is way over the top." Well, with a review like that, how could it go wrong?Well, I have to say that this was a really BAD movie. I'm not easily turned away, even by the most graphic depictions offered by modern cinema. However, not only was movie thoroughly agonizing to watch, but was just piss poor in general.The "artistic value" was lost in the pretentious twisty, spinning, dizzy and very unnecessary camera-work in the first 1/3rd of the movie.Of the two mega-violent scenes in the film, the early one was gory but tolerable, though like most of the scenes in this movie you want to yell "OK, we get it...let's friggin' move on!". The second scene...the now well publicized "12 minute rape and brutalization" was pure torture. Anyone who felt appreciation for the scene for any reason after the first 90 seconds should immediately do society a favor and kill yourself. By the first 5 minutes of the rape at least 1/4th of the theater was walking out...with many women in tears. Normally, I would have silently jeered the escaping movie patrons for their censure, but instead silently applauded them for exercising their right to seek a more functional outlet somewhere outside of this theater.A few minutes later I realized that I was pushed back as far into my seat as possible and saw that the female friend I was watching the movie with was also crying with her face buried in her hands.In thirty years and hundreds upon hundreds of theater viewings I've only walked out of two movies, the first was "Larger Than Life" starring Bill Murray, the second was "Irreversible". Because of the reverse chronological order of the film, we had seen how the rape victim was going to end up, and at that point I had absolutely no desire to see how director Gaspar Noe was going to show handle it. I also had no desire to learn the characters back-story or know anything else about the movie. It was pointless and Irreversibly lost by that point. We left. After leaving I've read a few critical reviews of "Irreversible", most which say that we'd fortunately left just before the movie changed into a very sappy attempt at showing the extremes of "bliss" on film and that we would have been equally as eager to beg for the director to yell "Cut!" by the middle of each scene. I guess I may find out if I happen across this movie a few years from now on TV, or trapped at someone's house-party who's watching it. But, until then, Gaspar Noe can kiss my ass.This was not a movie that "would have been good if you get past the disturbing scenes." It was just a bad movie that happens to have some really disturbing scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A woman (Monica Bellucci) is savagely raped and beaten and her boyfriend (Vincent Cassel) sets out to kill her attacker.This film is almost impossible to watch--there's an extremely horrifying and VERY graphic murder in the first 20 minutes and the rape/beating goes on for at least 10 minutes. To make it even worse was that both of the actors are so good that it looks very realistic. I was basically crying my eyes out during the rape and considered leaving the theatre. Usually I can sit through anything but this was really sickening, disgusting and beyond belief. After that sequence the movie does lighten up--but the effect lingers on. Also the story is told backwards--why? It serves no purpose that I can see. In something like "Memento" it worked--in this one it's just annoying.This is a hard movie to rate--on one hand the acting was very good and the script interesting but there's very annoying camera-work at the beginning (the camera keeps spinning around and never focuses), loud, ugly sounds and there was no need for this film to be so graphic. Seriously--why shot a 10 minute rape scene in all its "glory"? What's the point other than to sicken the audience? So I liked the actors and the plot and dialogue but didn't like the direction, camera-work, audio or the unrelenting violence.Use your own judgment on viewing this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most homophobic film of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People like to excuse "Irréversible's" undeniable sense of homophobia by saying, "well, gay sex clubs do exist" and "the film is an anti-violence film and the homosexual stuff is just atmosphere." But what these kinds of comments ignore is that writing and directing are all about making choices. Gaspar Noë CHOSE, to make the film's central rape scene an ANAL rape (if, as Roger Ebert seems to think, it's just an anti-rape film, why did Noë make such a point of having it be an anal rape?), he CHOSE to have the film begin/end in a gay sex club, and he CHOSE to have the club be named "The Rectum". This all adds up to a classic expression of homophobia, which can be best understood, if your interested, by reading the famous essay about the hatred of gay sex by Leo Bersani (in the book by Douglas Crimp, "AIDS: Cultural Analysis, Cultural Activism") called "Is the Rectum a Grave?"An accurate interpretation of the film must acknowledge that Noë clearly thinks that the most wonderful thing in the world is vaginal intercourse, since it can lead to conception, birth, and the future of the species, and that the worst thing in the world is anal sex since (to him and other homophobes) it's all about dirty anuses filled with rotting excrement. The theme of the film is built upon the dualistic belief that vaginal intercourse leads to life and therefore anal intercourse leads to death. The theme, finally, is the polar opposite of Kubrick's "2001", which Noë clumsily references at the end/beginning of the film. He's saying that mankind is devolving toward destruction and death, and homosexuality is the key metaphor for, and a primary symptom of, our destruction.Sorry, folks, I like an envelope-pushing shocker--like "Sal?", "In the Realm of the Senses", or "In a Glass Cage"--as much as anyone, and many of the films considered homophobic (like "Cruising") have been, I think, misunderstood, but "Irréversible" is truly a textbook example of homophobia in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good in style, over use of violence loses the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that I don't understand is that so many critics have compared Irreversible to Memento. I find that a simple comparison as all the two films have in common is the fact that the sequence of scenes is backward, which makes it not enough for comparing two films to each other.The movie is very well done in style, the cinematography is good, and Vicent Cassel is a good actor as usual (Belluci is not good at all), altough he doesn't bring anything new to his performance.The rest of the film fails. One can debate that we are saying this because we are closing our eyes to the violence that is so existing in our environment and that is one reason why people get raped and get killed more and more every year, because we are in denial of the graveness of violence.I am a strong advocate of 'not closing your eyes to the truth and reality no matter how ugly and hard it is', but I think Irreversible exaggerates.The very long scene of rape starts so tense and painful for the audience that it can have the strongest effect and can work best as an anti-violence message (if that is anything near what Noe tried to get to) but towards the end of the scene, you are not as touched as before anymore, simply because of the repetition factor. You can see through the scene, you can see that this is a "film", that they are "acting". It also makes you think of the motives of the director to include this scene in that length. Is it for testing the audience's tolerance, is it a test of going to extremes, or is it just pure masochism and perverseness? You wonder whether you are betrayed by the director and he is indeed the rapist and not the raped?!That is where the movie fails and loses the point. If Noe had kept the violent scenes shorter and more subtle and had worked on the very weak and bad conversations, the film would have touched many more people on a different level (this holds for the cab scene and for the murder in the night club scene as well).It is a big responsibility to recommend it to others, so be careful who you are recommending it to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happens when a no talent film maker covers up his lack of creativity with attention grabbing violence? From the high rating on here, apparently idiots rejoice! I guess when a film maker makes the pretentious and terrible decision to keep a camera moving constantly we're supposed to applaud his creativity. We're not talking Tony Scott style camera moves, we're talking unapologetic messy camera movement with ZERO redeeming quality. Yes, the scenes are blocked well and it's obvious the camera man was told to hit "point A" at "beat 1" and "point B" at "beat 2" but between these beats we have constant rocking of the camera that simulates nothing but the rocking of a camera. It doesn't feel like we're on a boat or falling or much of anything at all. Just a rocking camera. Bravo, jackass.The soundtrack. Just annoying, nothing more (it didn't nauseate me). Its just bad... obtrusive and bad.Okay, so now we get to the violence that is allegedly "brave" or to be commended. I'm a fan of genre films and violent movies but don't insult my intelligence. It seems to me that it is only there to shock and detract from a boring movie. It reminds me of when someone is mad and they want to make you mad so they go out of their way to insult you. You're trying too hard and I'm not blind to the pile of s**t you're feeding me. You wanna impress me? Make a movie where that kind of s**t is necessary to the story. Make a movie where you can actually defend the violence. It takes no talent or creativity to put violence in a movie. Zero... the talent lies in giving it REAL purpose beyond its own presence.This movie only gets noticed because simulating rape in porn is illegal and this is the closest people can get for now. There is a taboo about rape and rebellious people like to embrace taboos to show how truly against the grain they really are. Don't mistake your stroke material for good film making. You're just embarrassing yourself when you do.Lastly, those of you that liked this pile are defending it in your head saying "He missed the point... its supposed to make you uncomfortable. You're not supposed to enjoy it." Hand a camera to a 5 year old and let him run around with it for a while, set it to a soundtrack of songs you hate and tell me how comfortable you are.

		<fullReview>ebert "this film defies a coherent defense" Irreversible 2002 Several reviewers declared it one of the most disturbing and controversial films of 2002. The film employs non-linear narrative. .Gaspar Noe tells us the story about love and revenge-a pregnant young woman(outstanding Monica Bellucci)is violently raped and tortured in the underground passage.Her boyfriend(Vincent Cassel) desperately tries to find her rapist to kill him.The infamous Monica Bellucci's anal rape scene is truly brutal and sickening,but at least the film can't be accused of trivializing or glamorizing rape or trying to make violent rape erotic,something many mainstream are guilty of. Interesting movie. Powerful Move. This movie is an assault on your senses. There is a lot of violence and there are are very graphic shocking scenes in this move. The first 15-20 minutes of the film with the spinning camera was a bore. I did not care for the story told backwards. I enjoyed a lot a similar told movie Memento, it was very inventive. This film did not do much for me first time around.. Too much violence and homophobia. This film contains nudity, raw language, extreme violence and a graphic depiction of rape, and male frontal nudity. I applaud the director and producers braveness, it is a powerful movie but I did not particularly care for it. This film strikes a particularly homophobic pose. I agree with another critic "this film defies a coherent defense" Watch this film at your own risk. I have since seen this movie a couple times and have changed my opinion from not recommended to recommended. if you can get past the dizzy handle held camera work and you have a open mind about film you might should watch. everyone else stay away after 3 viewings I think I now understand the film makers point of view and its very f**ke*d u** this film is a shocker and really set some new boundaries about what can be in a film and how a film should be constructed. When people were streaming from the theaters 20 minutes into the film I think Noe knew he had succeed for what he wanted to do. I have watched very film he has made. 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yikes! Perhaps one of the most violent movies I've ever seen-- at least realistic looking violence. It has two famous scenes. One scene occurs in a gay underground nightclub, where a guy gets his arm snapped in two and then his head and face literally smashed flat by a guy with a fire extinguisher (it is done so seamlessly that I re- watched it to to see where they managed to (insert fake head here) to smash to a pulp. And the head is so realistic that as it is getting pulverized, the face is still making expressions, his mouth is moving-- teeth are getting bashed in... I hope you're not eating... That scene runs for a full minute-- non-stop. The camera-work is this crazy swooping- twisting (not the shaky-cam)-- it gives the film a real sense of the insanity that's going on. Awesome bare-bones 80 techno and synths are the sound track-- which gives it an even more bizarre feeling.The other famous scene is an ultra-violent rape scene that goes on for over 10 minutes.It's done Memento-style-- essentially playing these crazy violent scenes near the beginning of the movie, and then hops back and back, scene by scene-- so you see how it all started (at the end of the film).Incredibly hard to watch. I'm not sure if the name "Irreversible" applies to the the backward story-telling style, or to the last piece of innocence inside me that it killed-- irreversibly. As they say, you can't un-see something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge is a dish best served backwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to know what to say about this film because it's artful cinematic devices mean you will not find a standard set of plots, motivations and morals in there. As one of the bedroom philosophers at the start of the film says: there are no bad actions, only actions - and the film sets out to make you understand this point of view by offering the otherwise standard revenge plot line with the use of low frequency sound, disturbed camera movements and reversed time.It is the careful re-ordering of time in the film that makes for a fragmented, intense and drug like experience which forces the viewer to witness it's acts without conventional story patterns to help you form a justification. Unlike a more Hollywood offering such as memento there is no comforting resolution or standardised meaning and it leaves it's otherwise pornographic centrepiece laid bare in a truly stark fashion that forces you to confront your own innermost feelings on the subject with only knowledge of the aftermath and not a tranquil beginning. This has a profound effect on the material that is worth some meditation if you can stomach it.A true masterpiece, but not in a pleasant way. Worth watching if you like to see human experience from a different angle, but definitely not for those with a weak stomach or who are looking for a self indulgent film experience. The actions are laid bare for what they are, the violence of murder and a horrific rape scene do not come pre-processed but feel real as they would to a passer by and are filmed in unrelenting fixed shots. The construction is good enough that it doesn't just decay into confusion. It is extremely intense and will likely incite feelings of hatred and hopelessness in equal measure. You probably won't enjoy it, but you may well admire it. I certainly did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whats with all the illuminati symbolism??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have chosen to add user comments on this film based on its worthiness as a film, not from any religious or secular viewpoint.First, kudos to Vincent Cassel. His acting was top notch. I would also give high praise to the makeup and special effects wizards. Their efforts could not be beat. However, the rest of this movie is a complete and utter waste of film.If the movie is an accurate depiction of Biblical accounts of the numerological, so called Da Vinci Code, then the Bible is a fanciful work of fictional horror. There is no way that anyone would live through the beatings depicted in this film, much less have enough strength afterward to seek out the perps and exact revenge. If the beating scenes depicted were exaggerated for artistic reasons, then all I can say is that Gaspar Noé is one sick and twisted individual and needs to be locked away for a very long time. A lobotomy might be in order.I think I will be praying for all of the "Christians" who think this is a great film. Methinks some of you need to take a hard and fast look at your morals. This is truly one disgusting horror film.I didn't get past the first 15 minutes. Nothing shy of a basement made smut. Do not watch around children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is really nothing to like about this movie.The title and opening sequence was the worst experience I have ever had in watching a film. I thought I was going to be sick. Some may call it art, but I found it to be disorienting and distracting.Then there is the discussion of the two men. It made absolutely no sense at all - and I even went back and watched it again after the movie. It still made no sense.Then things started making sense. We were watching a movie in reverse. What's up with that? It was confusing and distracting for the first 25 minutes, but then it really started to come together.The rape scene was the most brutal display of the degradation of women that I have ever seen and something that will be burned forever in my mind. That any man could be that evil is incomprehensible.The ending - or beginning - comes and all is wiped out for a moment as we see two lovers enjoying their lives together and the promise of a good future that we know will be wiped out in a few minutes of terror.If nothing else, this film makes us come to appreciate the moment; for it may not last.Vincent Cassel (La Haine, Ocean's Twelve &amp; Thirteen, Eastern Promises) was magnificent as usual. Monica Bellucci - a treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violents has never been so realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you should know about this movies is that it is a very realistic one and a very very violent one. If you think of realistic violence in movies you might come up with movies like Fight Club. Well this movie goes a bit further than that. Al the violence that you'll see in this movie is like being there while it happens, but not being able to do anything about it. They'll leave nothing to you're imagination, and all the gore will be shown to you.This movie is about a every day evening/night where some terrible things happens. It could happen to anyone. But this movie isn't just about that terrible thing that happens, but more about the 'most' terrible thing that can happen. It is also very realistic because the main characters are ordinary people with ordinary lives. This movie is picturing how that ordinary evening of that ordinary live can easily change into the worst thing ever, and how vulnerable we actually are. This movie is (just like memento) backwards. My opinion about this movie being backward is that it shows that our live isn't "reversable", although we sometimes wish it was. If I had to compare this movie, it would resemble Requiem for a Dream the most.In a nutshell I think that this is a very (again) realistic movie, which makes it interesting, but also very hard. If you have a stomach for it, and like artistic camera shots (like a scene of 10 min in one camera angle)you mite find it a interesting movie witch you'll see ones, because it is very very dramatic and hard on your feelings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time destroys all things...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented Irreversible after years of hearing about it. I was shocked when I found a copy of it at my local music store/video rental.For anyone who's about to watch it the first time, this is very important: STICK WITH IT! You may get very confused at first. This movie is told backwards. Instead of a beginning going through to the ending, the ending is first. The last scene of the movie is technically the beginning. It's a bit difficult to explain, but if you stay with it, don't get fed up and watch it all the way through, it'll make perfect sense.I heard that this movie was incredibly disturbing, and some aspects of it are. The story follows Marcus and Alex, a couple. The first scenes of the movie show Marcus being wheeled out and put into an ambulance. As the story goes back in time, it shows how he wound up there. You see him in a gay club called the Rectum, searching for a man called Le Tenia. At this point, you don't know what Le Tenia did. The unforgettable fire extinguisher scene pops in here; it shows Pierre (a friend of Marcus) brutally beating a man in the face with a fire extinguisher, inevitably killing him. The scene then changes to a conversation with a she-male, revealing that the man they want is Le Tenia.The story keeps going backwards, and every new scene reveals more information on what's going on. Alex, Marcus's girlfriend, is introduced on a stretcher, face beaten and bloody, only for Marcus to learn that she was raped and cruelly beaten. She's in a coma and Marcus knows that the police won't do anything to provide real help. Marcus wants revenge so he sets out to find her rapist, which is what the previous scenes show. Through talking to people and talking to the she-male especially, he learns that her rapist was a man called Le Tenia. The she-male knows because she witnessed it.The most horrific scene in this film is the rape scene, where it shows just what happened to Alex. As she's walking along in a tunnel, she comes in contact with a man who wrestles her into submission and anally rapes her, leaving her crying and screaming. What makes this scene especially horrific is that the camera DOES NOT fade away. For those few minutes, you see in full focus the brutal raping of a woman, nothing held back and nothing sugar-coated. Once he gets done raping her, he beats her. He hits her repetitively in the face and smashes it against the ground, leaving her in the coma.It turns out that she was walking home from a party herself, Marcus, and Pierre attended. She left in a huff of anger towards Marcus, who was messed up on a combination of alcohol and cocaine. As she goes to leave the party, Pierre nearly begs her to stay, telling her that it's too dangerous for her to go alone. She leaves alone anyway.The rest of the film shows the three hanging out, with Pierre nagging Marcus and Alex about their sex life. Turns out that Pierre and Alex were once together, and he wants to know what Marcus is doing right. After that, the last scenes are of Marcus and Alex together in their room. It shows how Marcus treated her when he was sober. Together, alone, they were gentle and playful. Alex discusses a strange dream of a tunnel with Marcus. When he leaves to buy some alcohol, Alex takes a pregnancy test since she's late on her period. It never clearly states whether she's pregnant or not, but my assumption is that she was.The movie closes with a black screen and the words "Time destroys all things" written in French.This movie made a huge impact on me. Yes, the violence and the rape are disturbing, but I think what disturbed me the most is that all these things can actually happen. Every single thing in that movie is possible in reality, which makes it eerie and frightening. Once the movie ended, I found myself sitting there with chills. You grow attached to the couple and to learn that Le Tenia was never actually killed in the beginning made me feel repulsed. The man who was killed in the fire extinguisher scene was not Le Tenia, but just a friend of his. This movie shows fate in its raw form and shows that anything can happen through the simplest of actions. In this case, Marcus getting wasted and Alex leaving in anger lead to a disgusting rape and lives ruined.If you can handle it, this movie is definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw this film only once in art-house theatre in March 2003. Extremely potent &amp; unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie after reading the negative reviews by the local movie critics who were appalled by the content and theme of the movie.Afterwards, if one have endured without leaving the screening room midway (I didn't and I was ready, I've seen movies with worse content), it's an unforgettable movie. Irreversible is one of the most haunting movies I've ever seen and I've seen it only once &amp; never again. Blockbuster &amp; Hollywood Video refuse to carry this movie for a reason besides it being unrated.Watching the movie trailer and the opening credit sequence on YouTube refreshed my memory and I felt the sudden surge of nostalgia. I felt such profound effect of recollecting the movie experience I was prompted to write this comment.Simply put, this is the movie that's basically a modern visual-aural version of Dante's Hell as far as I remember from the emotions of appall and ash-faced horror I felt throughout the movie. Nasty, nightmarish and brutish. The point of view refuse to condone or condemn the deeds as depicted.In other words, it's a completely neutral movie that doesn't side with good or evil. You, the viewer, are a voyeur that rides along with the human beings as they interact, argue, cuddle, kiss, relax, tense up and commit violent acts. You feel the effect as a participating witness. You are left with the ill feeling after having been subjected to the animal nature of humankind.Gaspar Noe have created one of the most spectacular movie experiences in cinema history -- the movie that ingrain the raw emotions and actions into the viewer. It's a painfully disturbing movie to watch, even for those with strong stomach.Irreversible is about consequence and man's inhumanity to man. I still feel uncomfortable when I remember the divulged point towards the ending -- the joy and the suffering.This movie would have been possible with Kubrick if he thought of an idea that require total, unrestricted creative freedom not subject to censorship and critical attack. Whereas Kubrick left us with The Clockwork Orange (a film I did not like anyhow), Gasper Noe introduce Irreversible with a not-so-subtle homage to Kubrick as seen on the poster at the ending.Irreversible is a rare film with profound psychological aspect, in treatise and tone efficiency. While people prefer to go to the movies for crowd-pleasing entertainment, this movie is similar to attending the class on the combined subjects of Western philosophy (Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Sade), criminal justice, sociology and psychology. It's too potent for the common people to tolerate (they will immediately cut off the movie when the first horrific aggravated battery occur early in the movie). Therefore, the audience reception to the ramifications of man's nature is very limited outside of the critic circles.I did not like Noe's I Stand Alone for its ludicrously over the top content in sadism, but the slow-creep effect of Irreversible in the first time I saw the movie left me humbled and slightly depressed.I do NOT recommend Irreversible if one is not prepared to handle what will transpire during the movie's run. I've seen it once and that's enough. The movie is a genuine psychological horror movie that will scar the unsuspecting viewers. It will give children -- even those who have seen dozens of R-rated movies -- nightmares if liberal-minded parents allow children to watch Irreversible uncut without exception.Irreversible is a potent and haunting film that do not accommodate the viewers -- it revels in emotional and psychological abuse of the audience without condescension.I'm not able to evacuate this movie in rating because it was so strong I felt it's powerful but dispiriting. Irreversible have something in common with Kathryn Bigelow/James Cameron 1995 production Strange Days in that the audience is the voyeur fascinated and repelled by the horror in progress.Interesting note - Gasper Noe is buddies with David Fincher and Roger Avary because the three of them are fascinated with the subjective perspective of psychology in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moral reflections</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Irreversible" is a reflection on antagonistic positions. It's not that they clash per se, but the struggle worsens by today's state of affairs. On one side, white. On the other, black. On the white side, life, procreative act. On the other, death, sodomy. On the bright side, love. On the dark side, hate. Both ends are not reconciled in the middle: they are united by a red tunnel. Red is the color of passion, not love (rose is reserved for it.) Red is a color of low vibration, not recommended for concentration with colors, because of the ignoble vibrations it attracts, as ignoble as the act of violence ?more than brutish sexuality- that explodes in the movie's red tunnel.It's not surprising that filmmaker Gaspar Noé has mentioned Pier Paolo Pasolini's "Sal? or The 120 Days of Sodom" as one of his influences for making "Irreversible." When Pasolini defended his movie ?a masterwork still not reconciled with bourgeois morality, after more than 30 years of being made- he cited Marquis de Sade's words: the act of sodomy denies life; it is a laughable grimace of procreation. In the black and red points of "Irreversible," there are acts of sodomy.In times of insolent incredulity, in which many of us laugh at abstract thought and meta-languages, and assert that there is nothing else to do but destroy, as in a manga Armageddon, Noé made a movie that, without renouncing to fashionable images and effects, faces us with these notions. What he tells us is known from year zero, but it is appropriate to reassess it today, with the retrospective analysis of the facts that led to the indescribable death of the first scenes.If you can stand the first 30 minutes of film, you will make a journey to the essential values of human coexistence. We can stand it or not for different reasons. Many cannot tolerate the fleeting male sex images in a disco, or the "indescribable death." Others, like myself, feel uncomfortable with the constant camera movement (as in a TV show that tries to be "modern.") But we later discover that it is Noé's visual strategy, to express the frenzied emotions that move the characters. As Noé recedes and tells us the story in reverse, the camera becomes more stable and its movements turn more fluid.If you can pass through those endless minutes, you will be revealed an ethical proposition, a necessary proposal for our times of confusion in which almost nobody speaks of codes to live in harmony beyond guns and bombs. Few parents, priests, politicians or teachers seem to care. Ethics have been replaced by patronizing "life styles", in a state of things in decay that gives excellent returns to those who want to see us all gone, so they can distribute the profits among a few, thanks to the myths of globalization.A single movie cannot change the actual road the world is following, a road paved with war, murder, corruption, rape, etc. Neither these times are worse than others already experienced by humanity: sooner or later, people find better ways. But "Irreversible" is a warning. It warns us of what is happening outside the cinemas and our homes. And also inside, even inside our heads."Irreversible" will not change the world, but it will remain for the future as the intelligent intent of a man that learnt (the hard way, judging from his filmography) that the foundations of humanity are solidly rooted in love and creative sex, and that if we are healthy, the better. One can take the so-called "via negativa," wandering through dark alleys (as the disco in the beginning), but in the end we will reach the same conclusion: that white, bright, intermittent light that almost blinds us in the movie's end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that cannot be summed up in any way to prepare you for the excellent material that is to be delivered upon viewing. Delightful to watch but hard to stomach this is something you can't talk about or recommend, but a experience that you need to find for yourself and explore. Quuite possibly the most raw material I have enjoyed but it is hard to tell under the presence hallucinogens. Reminds me of a happier place I once called Battle Royale and lost when I walked into Irreversible. No more paths to take - time to work on to Salo. But seriously, this was a very excellent film that works on so many levels that you can't count them all after a few viewings. Whether you want more than a few viewings worth of obscure media ADHD material or not is not a choice here. Watch it again. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. Welcome to class students.

		<fullReview>I watched this film in the late evening hours of a quiet Thursday night. I'd known about it's graphic nature before hand. It's a very graphic film and if your not use to seeing material such as extreme violence, or rape (in excess in this case), don't watch this movie. By the end of the film i was filled with a great admiration not only for the actors who participated in the film but also for the filmmaker and his ability not to pull his punches. As a film student of many cultures and many different kinds of movies, movies such as this one who push the envelope and don't exchange artist merit or vision, for financial success or glamorous cow towing to the actors involved. It's gritty. The beginning scene in the gay club is a scene that took a direction in film that i have honestly never seen before. It's worth it, but only in the same way for people who like Requiem For A Dream, or movies that have deep lows and that leave you emotionally straddling thin air, saying thank God i am where i am. But in the end, the message was clear, it's the presentation in this film which was impressive for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a reverse chronology movie, much like Memento in 2000. The movie disturbs the senses from the very beginning with chaotic camera movements and repetitious musical rhythms. The coarse and sadistic comments of the police grab you first. Then the violent and edgy gay club scenes will shock most viewers. There were several "Oh My God" and expletive comments from me as I watched the scenes. Viewers finally learn how time and chance conspire to produce life altering events, showing no mercy. The never ending rape/sodomy scene will have both women and men looking over their shoulder in corridors after viewing this movie. This movie shows how dangerous it is to stand up for someone else, how evil some people can really become, and how justice and injustice can be served at the same time. I would never watch this movie again, because it is just too violent and sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect but definitely interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie with an unique approach, that still works most of its time but is also definitely not without its flaws.It's a movie that is being told backwards. So it actually starts with its end credits and after that begins to tell its story backwards. No, don't worry, the characters aren't walking or talking backwards as well but each sequence starts at that moment where the next sequence in the film ends. This way you slowly start to see what event led up to its final sequence, which got shown first in this movie. This way of storytelling actually adds to the chaos, which gets further more strengthened by very dynamic camera-work and the fact that the movie looks and feels realistic, without any apparent setup or rehearsals. So in that regard I really like the approach and way of storytelling that this movie features. I was actually really loving its first half (or its second half, depending on how you take this movie) but the movie can only do so much with its approach and can stay interesting and good to follow for so long.There is no real reason for the movie to still continue after its notorious rape scene, at least for not as long as it did. The movie after that point lost too much of its power and steam. Also the entire way of storytelling ensures obviously that the movie gets a bit of a confusing and messy one to watch. You are constantly forced to think back about its previous sequence, which can make this movie a bit of a tiring one to watch. The movie is about 100 minutes long and it most definitely shouldn't had been much longer! As a matter of fact, it should had been much shorter really. All in all it still remains a good and nicely executed experimental film but I'm surely glad that not more movies like this get made, since it's also such an exhausting experience, that asks a lot of its viewers. Some people will already be scared off by its approach, while others will be by its dark, depressing themes and extremely violent and graphic sequences. It's a hard movie to watch at times, in more than one way. But then again, this was probably an angle that the film-makers were aiming for in the first place. This was of course never meant to be a big commercial success at the box offices. It's almost as if they wanted their viewers to suffer while watching this and in that way the movie is also mostly an effective one.It also works as an effective one because of its convincing acting. Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel surely add a lot to this film. It was actually the seventh movie they appeared in together and it wouldn't be their last one. The two of them have been married together since 1999, so they always have some great chemistry together, whenever they're acting in the same movie.It's a great, different, original and powerful viewing experience, that is still not without its weaknesses really.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible opens with the credits running backward. A strange man (Philippe Nahon) states, "Time destroys everything." We are then thrust into a scene of revenge. Alex's lover, Marcus (Vincent Cassel), and her ex-boyfriend Pierre (Albert Dupontel) enter a gay S&amp;M club looking for the rapist and end up -- as the camera swirls among writhing bodies and hard-ons - bashing in the head of the wrong man with a fire extinguisher, a moment so brutal as to prompt walkouts even before the rape that follows.You can't see Gaspar Noe's Irreversible without starting a heated discussion with someone else who saw it, or part of it. Many viewers walk out midway through, during the nine-minute scene in which Alex, played by the beautiful Monica Bellucci, is beaten and anally raped in the lurid red light of a Paris underpass as Noé stations his camera and watches. It would be easy and convenient to dismiss Irreversible as blatant sensationalism. But Noe's bruising film is too artfully crafted to write off as exploitation. To see it is to absorb it, even against your will. Noe, the acclaimed French director of Carne and I Stand Alone, tells his story backward, as in Memento, but offers nothing as comforting as amnesia.It's the last third of the film that eases up. We watch Alex, Marcus and Pierre at a party where Alex and Pierre quarrel and she leaves, heading for the underpass. Noe then tracks further back to Alex and Marcus in bed, naked and tender with each other. Bellucci and Cassel, married in real life, give these scenes an erotic charge laced with affection and delicacy. It's this harmony that time destroys, except, of course, in Noe's film, where time is at the mercy of the filmmaker.

		<shortDescription>An excellent harrowing portrayal of a bruised woman: engrossing to watch and impossible to forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irréversible is a frantic, dizzying and harrowing portrayal of something that never ceases being disturbing: a rape. I have it firmly stapled at the bottom of my top 20 films list for it is excellent, but it is nothing I'd like to sit through and watch again...The story centres only on this rape but is presented to us in reverse chronological order, just like Memento (2000). Confusing but effective, because then the film need not rely on foreshadowing and build-ups to a culmination (rape), but it starts with its climax and offers a safe, but bruised remaining hour. The rape scene breaks our hearts because it is so unforgettable and the rest of the film tries to amend it, but in vain, because the life of this woman is already ruined...in the beginning.Irréversible bluntly begins with a frenzied man racing through a gay sex club, madly searching for someone known only as Le Tenia. Only as the story develops - as we are taken ever further back in time - do we begin to understand what is going on: this young man, Marcus (Vincent Cassel), is seeking vengeance on the rapist who has brutally assaulted his pregnant girlfriend. As Marcus gets his revenge, it is a scene so violent and disturbing that its only rival is the actual rape scene.The latter comes right after the opening and is much eerily calmer than Marcus' maniacal state of epileptic confusion and spinning camera-work; it is a patient 10-minute long stead-camera take of Alex (Monica Bellucci) being raped in an underground alleyway. We do not know her now so it is not riveting, but as the story progresses (or, regresses) it becomes more heart-breaking. The rape part is of course relegated to a hype status, but in truth, I've seen worse in films. It is not unwatchable, people - but it is unforgettable.Gaspar Noé's Irréversible (2002) offers an ideal role for Monica Bellucci; she is a poor actress but brings a fresh charisma to her roles and Irréversible never sees her in emotional breakouts having to deal with the effects of the rape. It sees her before it, as an ordinary but high-spirited woman. Her beauty is, of course, greatly emphasized in love scenes. Cassel is more talented, capturing the emotional frenzy of his character well, because he DOES have to deal with the rape effect.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a film to watch by yourself. Don't even consider taking someone on a date to watch it unless you already know them really well. Don't watch it with friends unless you don't mind sitting with them in silence for 90 minutes at a time.This film is as far from light entertainment as its possible to get. The camera technique and story telling (in reverse order) leave you disorientated due to the lack of a normal narrative flow. Individual scenes contain sequences of violent, shocking, disturbing, and in some cases distressing events that appear to be totally unprovoked, random, and which continue long after you would expect or want them to stop. This is one of the few films that have made me physically flinch.Only as the film nears its end (the beginning of the story) do things start to make sense and fall into place.What did I take from this film? That the acts of evil people are matched by the acts of normal people put in impossible situations and transformed into people that they themselves would not recognise; That sometimes there are no happy endings, although there are happy "starts". This is a film that will leave you silent and contemplatative after watching it. I thoroughly recommend watching it - but watch it when you are in the right mood, rather than because you had planned to watch it a certain time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film which has been hailed by all including directors like Tarantino,Scorcese,Werner Herzog and Bertrand Tavernier.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine how the love of Cinema stimulates the world around you in such ways that sometime it's not easy to differentiate between reality and fiction. After watching "Irréversible" I realize that I am not the only one who is willing to change his life on the basis of what I see on the screen. I always believe that cinema is influential and it can change you thoughts, your beliefs, and your life if you be able to perceive half of what the film is all about and what the director is trying to create. It's also great to see that I can influence any one ? normal people like Vincent Cassel (the main character of this film). He is pretending to be a director and he wants to create a master piece but he didn't knew that while doing this he is effecting other people and their life. If you watched this movie without knowing that the story is based on real events, it wont inspires you that much but ? the story was real. To some extant we all have a little bit of what Vincent Cassel had in himself but we are afraid of expressing it and he wasn't ?. and that's why we don't except such people in our society.While watching this film, Tyler Durden of fight club was continuously bugging my mind. Edward Norton in that film was another character like Vincent Cassel who is pushing his inner self to such extant where its starts' affecting the lives of others around him.About the ending ....well one could only expect from Gaspar Noé for such kind of endings disregarded, deeply touched, and thought provoking. Once a saying that "it's every ones dreams to live every other's life, because you are not satisfied with what you are" and being a director is what Gaspar Noé chose. I am a big fan also of Abbas Kiarostami, a director who speaks to his audience through his movies. Taste of cherry, pocket money, etc. every times he is willing to make an impact through his films About Irréversible i must say ... a must watched movie and truly inspiring</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an amazing film. It was an amazing film because it made me squirm, gasp in utter disbelief, and and say "oh man that was some F-CKED up sh-t". I like that in a movie. It takes a lot do to that to me. I thoroughly enjoy being emotionally moved by a film, even if that emotion is disgust. This film confronts the viewer with the brutal reality of what actually unfolds in people's lives because of rape. This is done in a (nearly) completely realistic manner.It's not all disturbing though. It has all the elements of a good movie, including lots of witty humor. I also thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue, it was very well written. The scene with Pierre pressing Marcus and Alex about their sex life had me cracking up. This brings me to the acting, which was incredible. I thought every character was played very well. Although I don't speak a lick of French, I thought all the characters appeared to be very natural. This was crucial to making the movie feel "real", and not like some shock-value B movie. These actors had their stuff down. Talk about intense scenes, the rape scene was one shot!!!! This was also the most confronting film I've ever seen. There are few things in the world more messed up than rape. This film shoves that in your face. It FORCES you to face the reality of what happens to people everyday. This is why it was perhaps the most powerful film I've ever seen.However, it was not perfect. It does not deserve all the praise that it gets. I found many aspects to be quite cheesy. For example, how Alex foresaw the rape in her dream, and how she was reading that book about dreams predicting the future. That's just lame. I thought the foreshadowing (or reverse foreshadowing I suppose) was taken care of perfectly well when Marcus pinned her down in bed, and when he told her he wanted to give it to her in the ass. The dream thing was cheesy as hell. Another thing that bothered me was the cinematography. Yes, it adds to the disturbance, makes you feel disoriented, lost, etc. I just thought it was taken way too far. A lot of unnecessary spinning. I thought the most powerful part of "Irreversible" was its realism, how it forces you to accept the terrible reality of rape. The fancy camera-work took away from this realism. The film could have been MUCH more powerful (which is why I'm only giving it an 8).All in all, this was an incredible film. It made me gasp, wrench, and feel disgusted more than any other that I've seen. For all of you that complain that this movie is "depressing" or "has no resolution", please get a fOcking clue. That's not the point of the film. It's a friggin tragedy. The point of it is to move you by showing you, in complete detail, a terrible thing that happens all the time. And if it made you feel "sick" or "disturbed", then good, that's a testament to how powerful it is. One cannot compare this to films like "The Blair Witch Project". This was not a film going for shock value. If you think it was, then you need to seriously open your eyes to the world around you. Yes, many aspects of the movie were exaggerated, which is why it could have been even more powerful (8/10). If not for certain slightly cheesy aspects and overdone trick shots, this movie could have achieved greatness. Maybe even Blue Velvet status :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GROSS!!!!! I feel so gross after watching this travesty of a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love horror films &amp; after sitting through horrific exploitation films like I Spit ON Your Grave (which i watched after renting it from a local video store at the age of 9) &amp; Ms.45, I figured I could handle most films dealing with rape. However, this was a little too much. Why, for shock value would you let a rape scene go on this long? Too shock your audience into either loving this film or hating it? Too get rapists out there turned on enough by giving them their own form of pornography to get turned on &amp; go out &amp; anally rape a woman? The fact that the rapist was a bi-sexual pervert was gross enough, as she probably got AIDS, if she even survived. And, even though the gay S/m bathhouse-like club appropriately named "The Rectum"the scene where upon finding the person known as (in English) "The Tapeworm",the fact that they kill the wrong guy by brutally bashing in his head, (which I enjoyed as a gore-hound, but not that they didn't get the right guy)really ticked me off. Even though Vincent Cassel's friend saved him from being savagely raped by a man while the queers egged it on.was also cool. But,i hate the fact that the rapist gets a way with it. And in the rape scene the dialouge really left me feeling sad &amp; disgusted. Granted,i knew there was a gross long rape scene from word of mouth, but did he have to have said the dialouge he said? It truly made me want to puke,having been a survivor of a rape attack in my own life. So if you goal Mr Noe was to shock &amp; gross out people with the worst rape scene ever in film history, then your a winner. If it was placing 2 of Europe's best actors, Vincent Cassel &amp; Monica Belucci in a sick exploitation film,that wouldn't have been interesting at all without them,then you succeeded as well. This is not for the squeamish &amp; not for people who already want to censor film &amp; TV. This sorta film is what's getting those types riled up day in &amp; day out. I personally could've gone without seeing this film. Had I known, how it really was. i would have.If you like a film with an actual storyline,&amp; are a fan of Mr Cassel &amp; Ms Belluci's check out Brotherhood Of The WOlf, instead. Kudos to ms Belucci's performance however during the rape scene. Very powerful &amp; very believable. I felt sorry for you. That you signed up to do this film &amp; that a movie-man felt a need to film a movie about how awful not only rape is,but dry anal-rape. The writer needs therapy,in my opinion.** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chronic piece of shock cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So numerous people walked out in Cannes. And, the film has courted controversy everywhere it has played. Such a shame then, that the man behind "Carne" and "Seul Contre Tous" has created the most chronically vacuous piece of cinema I've seen in a long time.Yes, the film is controversial, but there are films already in existence much worse than this one.I won't bother with the plot, as most of you will already know about it. The film is told in reverse, ala "Memento", but it's a depressing, vapid and totally butt-numbing movie, that you really couldn't care less.The main problem, is not the scene of rape, or the man having his face bashed in with a fire-extinguisher. It's the fact that throughout the entire ordeal, you never care about any of the characters! Not once, do you feel sympathy or empathy with them! As such, the nine-minute rape of Monica Belluci's character "Alex", is neither titillating, erotic or even painful to watch. It's just dull and exhausting. At no point do you think "Is this what a rape might look like in real-life? Oh god, that's awful!". You actually think: "Poor Monica Belluci having to act out such garbage, for the sake of shocking the audience. Come on, get a move on, please!"The scene of extreme violence in the nightclub, involving a man's face being beaten to a bloody pulp, is filmed in such dark and unviewable surroundings, that what little gore you do get to see, is practically no worse than in any Peter Jackson horror flick. The only horrors in the entire film, are the sound effects of a man's arm being broken, and his nose breaking under the fire-extinguisher.Other than that, the acting is below par for all concerned. The story is pointless. The dialogue is banal, and the highlight is the ending piece of music - a piece of Beethoven, to be exact. For me, the most offensive thing about this film, is not the rape, but the unrepentant and blatantly outrageous homophobia. The entire 20 minute opening, is just full of inflammatory and offensive anti-gay language. As such, I can only think that Noe is doing to gays, what Tarantino does to blacks. Both Belluci and Cassel are wasted in this yawn-inducing film, and it's a shame that the two who appeared in the superb "Brotherhood Of The Wolf" (aka "Le Pacte Des Loups") have to meet again, in this septic-tank of a movie!If anything, I'd rather the British Board Of Film Classification banned or censored this film, than the far more intelligent, controversial and thought-provoking film "Baise-Moi". Sadly, it has not been the case. Don't bother with this movie, as it's all to do with hype! Watch Noe's other works instead! If you see this film, make sure you don't mind wasting 95 minutes of your life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Irreversible" is an art house experience which tells a story of a happy young adult couple who suffer; she through rape and he through revenge. There's little story in this uncomfortably harsh film full of sex, nudity, vulgarity, and violence. What story there is is told a chapter at a time in reverse chronological order so we see the unhappy conclusion first and work back toward the happier beginning. In addition to the backward flow, the film uses strange floating camera techniques which could cause motion sickness and ends with a long strobing blank screen which could induce seizure in some people and laboratory animals. Given subtitles, gross unpleasantness, and imagery which is annoying if not offensive, the only reason any normal nonpervert would want to view this film would be to experience it...presumably the same reason people ride roller coasters while screaming with joyful terror. Certainly not for everyone, "Irreversible" is not good or bad but it is different. Recommended for realists with a taste for art projects and bitterly harsh drama. (B)Spoilers -&gt; The most offensive sequences are a long violent anal rape of a woman and a man getting his head mashed to a pulp with a fire extinguisher.</fullReview>

It is also a movie full of homophobia : the gay club is Hell, the guy who raped the women is gay, the penis of a transexual prostitute is shown like "look this freak!!". In movie, women must be beautiful and pregnant to be good and everything else is hell, violence and perversity. The violence, the homophobia and the racism in Irreversible have nothing to do with A Clockwork Orange because there is no intelligence and sensibility in this movie, only the wish to shock the audience...

		<shortDescription>It's so bad it sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is this movie so bad? I keep asking the question. And why has it got such a high rating? The movie was apparently shot using only free hand, and the camera keeps spinning like half of the movie which makes you nauseous and also convinces you that people who filmed it had mechanical problems.This movie has probably the most prolonged scenes I have ever seen, a desperate attempt to lengthen the movie and keep us viewers in agony. In the beginning there's a scene where a man goes to a gay bar and keeps repeating the same question like 100 times which apparently in English is "Do you know Tapeworm" or "Where is Tapeworm" Why are the scenes so long? It could last only like thirty seconds and we would get the picture already. The scene ends with a man getting his face smashed with a fire extinguisher which probably makes some teenage boys think that it's cool and that they're such tough dudes now that they have seen this movie. Sad.There is also a rape scene in this movie which lasts like fifteen minutes, again unnecessary. Why are the scenes so long, honestly? Did the director think that it would add more shock value to the movie? They might as well shoot a ten second clip and then repeat it 50 times and have the same result.I didn't watch the last 20 minutes of the movie with full concentration, which in my point of view needs no explanation as I think I already exceeded myself by forcing myself to almost watch this ungodly abomination. But from what I understand, the movie ended with the woman finding out that she was pregnant. Great. Then the sun was shining again and the dark clouds were all gone.Bad actors, bad plot, bad directing, bad filming, bad attempt, bad idea (was there an idea?)Did they watch this movie after it was made or did they just think: "Nevermind, let's just release it. We can barely call it a movie but that's all we can do.Why was this movie made?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this film there is nothing new, without technique of movement of shot-sequence camera. The reverse narrative doesn't make sense, if it is only to illustrate the thematic phrase "Time destroys all",because there are many other cinematographic methods to imply(not to tell!)that truth. After having seen "Memento", which is in fact new and full of meanings, "Irreversible"seems to be only an unsuccessful effort to give something interesting to a very banal and uninteresting story. Lighting is rather flat, long-take shots are often boring, especially if you have seen such films as "Khrustalev,mashinu!"(A.German)or "The days of eclipse"(A.Sokurov). Actors are vainly trying to give characters something "real" but their efforts must be doomed because of emptiness of the drama. Bad and boring film.</fullReview>

In my opinion it would have been more suitable as a fifteen minute short with only the shocking parts. That is why I propose a re cut of Irréversible. The short would basically consists of three scenes:1. It starts with the revenge murder. (That befalls the wrong man if I'm not mistaken.)2. The rape scene everyone talks about.3. We are shown the innocence that will be destroyed.The dialogue and camera spinning that isn't contributing to the plot is gone, but the purpose of the film remains.To sum up, I can't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a perfect example of hype over substance. Some have compared Irreversible to Fight Club and Requiem for a dream. While the before mentioned films were graphic, these films had a message. The violence in these films was a tool used to advance the storyline.In the case of Irreversible, Gaspar Noe has no message. The violence is gratuitous and pointless. Yes, it is most definitely real, but for what purpose other than to shock. As for the camera work it is obnoxious hand held garbage similar to The Blair Witch Project.The only saving grace for this film is the acting. Bellucci and Cassel are brilliant. Vincent Cassel goes from one end of the emotional spectrum to the other. This is his best performance to date.Monica Bellucci is radiant, her reaction and body language after the rape seen is brilliant. Obviously, these performances do not occur spontaneously, for this I most praise Noe, who pushes these actors to the edge and beyond.Unfortunately I cannot recommend this film. I rate it a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depending on your level of vulnerability, you might be tempted to find something worthwhile in this film. There might be revealed to the inquisitive mind, for example, a sustained vision here that explores some new and exciting way of looking at life. That could be accomplished either by proving that the film simply demonstrates a vital essence or by observing more sophisticated aspects such as showing how good triumphs over evil, art transcends ugliness, technical virtuosity limns some heretofore recondite aspect of everyday behavior, or a truly magnificent and unique piece of acting conveys shades of meaning in a character or relationship.Alas! No such creature shows its face here. Instead the viewer is taken on a ride through the tunnel of sado-masochistic grotesquerie, beginning at the end and traveling with jolts and stops back to the start. The only frames that hold still long enough to form any impression are those containing violence and pornography aimed apparently at immature or obsessed members of the audience incapable of objective thinking. What passes for story or indeed acting is made subservient to an obscure purpose in making such a film.Other than that, I guess I really, really liked it. Or did I?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My god, it took me like 5 hours to watch this film. I kept pausing it, going and doing something else for a while, then coming back to it. I must have done that like 5 or 6 times. That's how dull it was. Another thing, this movie didn't have much of a plot. The thing about it being in reverse order makes it more interesting but, when you think about it, if this movie wasn't in reverse order, it would suck even more because there isn't much story to it. Also, in some parts of the film, the writing sucks. I didn't find it very suspenseful or shocking but, I've seen a lot of other films that make this thing look like "The Teletubies", such as Angel's Melancholy and August Underground's Mordum. I guess that if someone that wasn't used to shocking, disgusting and horrible content in movies would find this movie very disturbing. The only scene that made me feel uneasy was a scene in a gay club. The fact that it was a gay club didn't make me feel uneasy, OK? I'm not homophobic! It's just the way it was filmed and the soundtrack that was playing sort of disturbed me. But, yeah as I said before it's very dull at times, there isn't much of a story and some of the writing sucks. If you are looking for something very suspenseful, watch "Saw", "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" or "Prisoners". Those films have great writing, great plots, great acting, great everything!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Big Gay Heart of Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to go ahead and declare the 2000's as the decade of the French. Well, at least in terms of horror movies that is. One may argue that Irreversible is not a horror film or that it straddles that line from time to time without completely venturing into the realm. But once you see it, you'll rank it high on the list of notoriously 'classic' rape/revenge films.Playing much like Memento, the film is shown in a backwards chronology of events leading up to a confrontation between a pair of buddies and a man who raped their female friend. Both men have a current relationship with their victimized female counterpart: one as current boyfriend and another as ex; a good friend but obviously clinging to the off chance that she will dump her current beau and get back with him. The film shockingly starts as both men track down the assailant at a gay club (appropriately called Rectum) where they exact their revenge in a brutalized fashion. With the current boyfriend momentarily disabled, the more awkward and unassuming ex repeatedly beats the man with a fire extinguisher with such fervor and reckless abandonment that to start the film off in such away, immediately and emotionally connects the viewer.'Oh great', you say. 'Thanks Cortez, now why should I watch the rest of this?' Interestingly enough, it keeps you on pins and needles as you want to know why these two men are hellbent on exacting their revenge. From the trek through town in search of the club, to their wild and crazy party leading up to the rape, and the rape itself, its an interesting weaving of a tale that asks the all too important question thats necessary in a film like this: 'What would you do?' The unfolding of the relationship between all three friends gives such depth and gut wrenching weight to what was viewed at the beginning. And the most shocking element that I found was not the rape itself (although it was incredibly disturbing), it was the unassuming, self-deprecating, still sticking around in the hopes of getting back together ex who actually ended up being the more malicious and relentless of the two.A hard one to recommend for sure but ultimately, I do. As mentioned, the rape scene is entirely disturbing (its about 20 minutes long and rivals that of I Spit on Your Grave AKA Day of the Woman). But if you can get through that, there is a lot more going on with this film. And the surrealist way in which some of the scenes were shot adds another level of depth. Almost like you were inside the minds of the characters as they went through a sort of uncontrollable, completely out of their mind, experience.An incredible movie it will stay with you long after the credits roll. I'm still trying to figure out if they killed the right guy or not.Ed. Note: I've re-watched the film and in fact, the wrong guy was killed. This leads me to believe that overall, the director is making a direct statement about revenge and how it lacks any merit. ALI KOHAN FOROTAGHE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been the centre of a lot of debate and certainly seems to evoke equal levels of both love and hate for it. I for one think it's a breath-taking piece of cinema. I had heard the hype before watching it and had always considered myself very hard to shock but when I first watched this film my stomach was churning as though I were witnessing a brutal fight in a nasty nightclub. Even before the first instances of extreme violence are on screen Thomas Bangalter's outstandingly nauseating soundtrack has already set the scene. The camera work, though not to everyone's taste, perfectly matches the intensity of the lead character's mindset throughout the film and the sheer technical brilliance of how the entire thing is shot (long takes, invisible edits and gravity defying steadicam/special FX) is nothing short of breath-taking.Noe allowed a lot of improvisational dialogue and as such gets very realistic performances from his cast, a lot of whom are incredibly authentic (the rapist being the rather tough, former world kickboxing champion Jo Prestia and the two hoods being originally hired as security guards for the location shooting).The reverse chronology of the narrative, though it would seem like a rip-off of Chris Nolan's Memento and the movies of Tarantino, is perfectly justified in terms of how it relays the story to the viewer. As Noe himself has said it deconstructs the revenge-movie formula by robbing the audience of their big pay-off at the end and forces them to confront the horrible violence that many revenge movies choose to glamorise.For me Noe is potentially the most exciting director working today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true piece of art. Daring, controversial and confrontational.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irréversible is not an easy movie. This movie is (in)famous for it's violence. The rape scene is truly unforgettable in it's horror, and also the scene in the gay bar is far from pleasant to watch. But it is not the sensational type of movie violence, it definitely serves a purpose.First of all, the gruesome rape scene. Rape is one of the most horrible things a person can experience. Watching the ten minutes Noe uses to show the real face of rape is still nothing compared to the real thing. But Noe does an admirable job in shocking us all, confronting the viewer on a brutal way with the horrors Alex has to go through. Not only that, he makes completely clear how she is dehumanized by her attacker, who ventilates his anger and frustrations towards 'beautiful women' by destroying both her soul and body. But honestly, I think that he is not the only one treating her as an object. Even though both Marcus and Pierre do mean well, they both have a selfish streak when it comes to Alex. The highlight in this, how diabolic this may sound, is the revenge Marcus wants to take. From the moment he sees his girlfriend being carried away in an ambulance, comatose, he focuses on his own emotions, and thus revenge. We can't really blame the guy, but if you look a bit deeper than the surface, what is he really doing for his girlfriend? While his friend Pierre constantly tries to drag him to Alex in the hospital, he doesn't want to hear about anything else than his revenge. When we go a bit further down the story, on the party, Marcus is also totally busy with himself. He never cares about Alex there either, instead he is focused on snorting coke and other women. Pierre again tries to come up for Alex, and asks Marcus to stop being so selfish. After all, why did he take her to a party when all he wants to do is focusing on the attention other women give him? Pierre, at the same time, has his own reasons for being so nice to Alex. Yes, he still loves his ex, but he is also still frustrated by the fact that he couldn't satisfy her sexual needs in the past. There is a long scene in which he tries to find out what Marcus has that he doesn't have. At one point, Alex says: 'It's not the woman who can not come, its the guy who can not f__k' But Pierre hardly listens to her explanation, he is still too much focused on his own frustration.At the party, the main thing Pierre wants to do is watching Alex dance. He is protective towards her, and keeps on calling Marcus 'a primate'. Obviously, he considers himself to be much more than that. But personally, I wonder if he is that much different. Yes, he is protective, yes, he wants to be the savior and yes he wants to go to the hospital. All seemingly very nice things. But at the same time, he doesn't really listen to what she has to say, and he wants her to dance purely for his own pleasure. Now, nothing is wrong with the latter, but in a movie like this, for me it enhances the feeling that Noe keeps on pointing towards the objectification of Alex (women). Like in the opening sequence, the old guy tells about his time in prison for the abuse of his daughter. He sees nothing wrong with it himself, as she was so cute. His friend tells him: 'There are no bad deeds. Only deeds.'Alex tells Marcus at one point. 'I am not an object.'Personally, I think this is the message that Gaspar Noe tries to give to us. I think Irreversible is an incredibly strong movie. The use of violence, the way the camera works, the symbols being used in many small parts of the movie make this film to a true piece of art. No, it's definitely not an easy movie to watch. But for the ones who are strong enough to handle the subject, it is more than worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak plot goes nowhere slowly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with jiggly camera-work and a tired reversed order premise that didn't add anything to a similarly pretentious and shallow Memento. The whirly hand held cam (he's no Robert Rodrigues) got tiresome after the first couple of scene breaks. I suppose there's some people out there in screen land who think it's revolutionary and cutting edge, but it isn't. As for the extended anal rape, well I suppose he did the poppers so we could have a couple more minutes grunt and groan in the most deserted underpass beneath the quietest street(two cars went by after the prostitute said Bellucci would be safer using the underpass) in Paris. Where were the winos and rough sleepers? That's a prime location if ever I saw one. Fiendish these gay men, eh? and so desperate for a female to anally rape when he has the whole of Le Rectum fisting club to aim at. Can I get a puh-leeeeeze? Lazy plot devices abound throughout. Cassel's instant psychosis after a single tiny line of powder. Was it PCP? He "acted" like it was. The sudden appearance of the two local meatheads offering to help with the revenge. Where did they vanish to? Why did they bother? The unconvincing Brazilian trans hooker showing the meat and two veg under threat of a slashing. Quel surprise! Tres avant garde mon cher.The supposedly horrific violence is tame in comparison to the more graphic Asian gangster and horror movies, and anyone familiar with Takashi Miike would know that Yakuza bad guys anally rape everyone, male or female, as a form of friendly greeting.Irreversible is a relentless parade of tired clichés, ham acting, and effete direction. Shame I couldn't un-watch it. That's 100 minutes of my life I'll never get back. It reminded me of expensive boring clubs where the smoke machines and fancy strobes are a lame attempt to disguise the dismal quality of the entertainment and the paucity of punters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing all the great reviews here, I rented the film. I have to say, I wasn't very impressed. The story is rather dull with no twists or clever aspects. Being told in reverse order doesn't add anything to the film - in fact the movie, which is a pretty standard and pedestrian revenge flick, would have been improved by unfolding in chronological order. As for the camera work, which has been raved about - it comes across like a 1st year film student discovering all the effects with a newly purchased digital camera. The novelty of the swooping and trembling POV runs out of steam very quickly. Worth a rental, but does not live up to the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to avoid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please don't watch this film. It is full of hatred against women and gay men. It aims to sicken and it does just that. The film sets out to be a rape revenge. Or to say that we are all victims of fate. The intent then moves to sickening violence without point or explanation. A beautiful pregnant girl is raped and the man who does it brutally beats her. Her boyfriend tries to catch the rapist but gets the wrong guy while the rapist laughs. There is plenty of gory violence and grunts. The portrayal of gay men and of women is obscene. The film dresses itself up as art but beware it is full of violence and sadness. This is not what entertainment.It is torture.Be happy and avoid it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Junk!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like exploitation films. I can even stomach self-indulgent art-house crap if it's interesting enough. What I can't abide is exploitation masquerading as art. This movie was junk. It is exploitive without wearing its heart on its sleeve. So, the director played with timeline, etc. That doesn't make it artistic. A good director could have disturbed us without showing nearly as much. And don't give me that "he was trying to make a point" nonsense. It was a flat out movie about revenge and violence and that's it. Don't pretend it's art. It's not. Tough luck. Deal with it. And it's not like the film was terribly original (Memento, anyone?). It was derivative in the extreme and, by my way of thinking, it was really boring. If you want to see a good exploitation movie, watch "Vice Squad" or "Fight for Your Life." These movies don't pretend to be much more than they are. Yes, there may be a glimmer of social commentary in each, but, in the end each knows what it is: a sleazy exploitation film. Embrace it, man! All of you snooty art-film people out there: you can have "Irreversible." It was complete and utter garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film, I've seen a lot of films in my life, many more than you can imagine. But I'm still not able to find a merit in this film. Because the structure on which is based, is based on Nolan's "Memento" with Guy Pearce, an excellent film. Instead No? in "Irreversible" needs to use violence, ONLY violence, to justify a poor plot. Camera's moves were so frantic, that I were goin' to have convulsions! For me, nothing to justify your vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apparently if a movie is horrible you can play it backwards and everyone loves it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There just so much hype about how different and artistic this movie is and I ended up buying it. This movie beyond garbage, it doesn't even deserve one star. What you have is a generic rape/revenge movie that does nothing different from movies like Last House On The Left or I Spit On Your Grave. The filmmakers must have watched the finished movie and realized what a pile of crap it was so they decided to start it at the end and then have it end at the beginning of the story so that way it would have a gimmick to please the artsy crowd.It really isn't as brutal as people make it out to be, there is some blood effects and some sound effects but anyone with a camera and some actors can do a better job with it. 95% of the movie is dialogue, there are two scenes that have major impacts on the story, one is early on and the other is later on. So you'll be sitting through a really weak story with characters that you don't have any reason to give a damn about. If you can stay awake through the movie you'll see a very gratuitous rape scene that goes on for what felt like at least 10 minutes, it was nothing more than shock for the sake of shock.In the end there is no message, no meaning, and not a single redeemable quality. I can't think of one positive thing I can say about this movie, the nicest thing I can say is that it isn't the single worst movie I've ever seen, but it still would make my top five. It would be right down there with trash like I Spit On Your Corpse I P**s On Your Grave, May, Night Beast, and Hostel. Even if you found this movie for one dollar I wouldn't suggest buying it, after seeing this movie you'll want your time back. I wouldn't urinate on this movie even if it was on fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With time you began to venerate it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw a movie from Gaspar Noé, I was in England at a friend's house and we're watching "Seul contre tous- I Stand Alone", and at that time I despise the movie and the director, as timed passed the movie didn't get out of my head so I watched it again and began to like it, so I decided to watch all Gaspar Noé films and was the best thing I could ever do, saw "Carne" and the breathtaking "Enter the void".One to go, and it was the best of the four,Irréversible" is an amazing movie, that will stick to your brain for times to come. Accomplishes all that it aims for, the history is told from end to start and will always make you begging for more. The interpretations and dialogs are top notch. It's very graphical and it has some scenes that will make you a little bit uncomfortable, for that reason I believe it only has a 7.3 on the meter, I'm sorry but I have to give it a 10 a solid 10, a movie that after a year is still very alive in my mind and it's a must have it in my collection has to deserve that note.I dare you to see "Irréversible" it's a ride like no other. This movie will grow on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, if swearing, violence, rape, nudity and racial and homophobic slurs will really offend you, don't watch this.I really like this, and I like how it was done in reverse so you get the awful, horrible ending out of the way and then figure out how it all happened and the relationships between the three main characters. Love the way it was handled better than I liked Memento, I think the acting - considering it was mostly done improv - was amazing and very real. Very high respect for Monica Belucci, she's amazing.Very raw and shocking at a couple points. I didn't like the spinning camera, though, and the flashes of space pictures at the end? No thanks, though I understand it's to enhance the disorientation. Everything else? Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In truth, all time is always present, specifically, past, present and future are all occurring simultaneously somehow, but our perception goes through this concurrence in sequential form. It's like a book one reads for the first time. At any particular time, the whole book exists in itself but we can only read one page. The other pages, while existing at the same time with that one, stay beyond our ability to perceive. What Irreversible is about is if we could by some means read each page of the book together, or be capable of experiencing the book in total in a solitary instant then we'd be on the brink of a true understanding of it. Likewise in our lives, previous times are recalled but not currently experienced and the future remains unidentified.Irreversible is a film so brutal and unpleasant that most people will find it insufferable. I've even met horror fanatics that detest it on grounds of not being able to withstand the brutality of only two scenes. Or shots, frankly. The camera watches unflinchingly as a person (not yet viewed as a character) is degraded and terrorized for numerous lengthy, remorseless minutes in a ceaseless stationary shot that never cuts away, and as a man has his face literally pulverized with a fire extinguisher, in a hand-held shot that feels as if to partake in the pounding. That the movie has a profound intention is to its tribute but makes it no more endurable.Primarily, and importantly, the story is told in reverse. Memento notably employed that chronology. Now think about what happens if you reverse the sequence of Irreversible, so that it begins with fleeting, ephemeral images of the ultimate aftermath and tracks back through time to a peaceful guilelessness of youth and tenderness. There are quite a few ways in which this method creates a profound experience: It doesn't build toward sex and violence as its climactic inducement. It starts with its two staggeringly sadistic scenes, and then trails back into lives oblivious that they're about to be eternally changed by them.It also generates another sort of fascination in those earlier scenes, which are fully known to us but not the characters. When Bellucci and Cassel embrace and chat, we recognize what a slim fiber by which all happiness hangs. To both experience and realize the future, in that order, may not be a miracle but a dismay. Life would be unfit to live without the unawareness of our inexperience. Vengeance goes before violation. Simultaneously, and most importantly, Cassel is the vicious monster of our astonishing first impression, and the offense has yet to be seen. The later scenes make Bellucci appear defenseless and threatened. It also makes the charm and cordiality of both Bellucci and Cassel much deeper when we recognize what shadowy feelings she conceals.The reality is, the backward sequence makes Irreversible a film that structurally defies and laments its vicious brutality, while ordinary linearity would cajole us down a seductive plot course toward a scandalous, manipulative payoff. By placing the cruelty on the threshold, Gaspar Noe coerces us to solemnly contemplate the truly stunning brutality concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After first hearing about this movie, and reading many, many reviews about it, I was eagerly awaiting for pay-day Friday so I could purchase it, and eagerly awaited the arrival of it via US mail, since its not available in any local stores(Not in Ohio, anyways). After watching it, I was totally at a loss for words. Words can't describe what my two eyes had just viewed. And I'm mainly talking about the infamous rape scene. I will not go into details, except to say that after watching it, my jaw was dropped to the floor, and I couldn't seem to pop my eyes back into their sockets. Its hard to believe that there are people out there who would want to make scenes like this, but then again its hard to believe people pay to watch them. I signed up here on IMDb just to write this review about the rape scene. Its a very good movie, but if you haven't seen it, and your wondering if you should buy it, maybe thinking to yourself that it may not be worth it, BUY IT. If your not shocked by that rape scene, go see a shrink. Or somebody. Cause you need help. 8 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was a real experience, I'll give it that. Unfortunately one minute out of 90 can't save an otherwise boring and pointless movie.No one can really tell what influence "Memento" had over the making of this movie but it is clear that "Noe", what a pretentious ass, didn't understand why that movie worked. You can't structure a traditional story in this way.There was one climactic event in the whole story, and it's gone 10 minutes into the movie. (The rape paled in comparison to what preceded it). What's left, 80 minutes of exposition, was doomed to fail.What would this movie be without it's style. What would people say about it then. They would say nothing, because this movie wouldn't exist.</fullReview>

The end of this movie, (I mean the beginning)the whole reverse thing. A guy running through a gay club screaming and the constantly moving camera and that low frequency hum, (how pleasant). The rape scene was actually a slight step up out of the sewer after what occurs earlier. I did get to see Monica nude (did I mention she is beautiful?) Cannot recommend this movie for much else. I did find the plot to be somewhat interesting, if you can get by the gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. A little history about why I even rented this thing in the first place. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of IMDb and take its user's opinions seriously. I was looking for Oldboy discussions on IMDb and discovered that it was part of a revenge trilogy that also consisted of Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Also while looking for Oldboy, I found a link which lead me to discussions on a little movie called Irreversible, which I had no intentions of watching at that time.Recently, I found Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (finally!) at Hasting's and right next to it on the shelf was, *dramatic drum roll please*, Irreversible. Well, of course, I rented Mr. Vengeance. I had been looking for it for some time. But regrettably I also rented Irreversible based on the recommendations that it received here.Let me just say this to anyone who is cosidering viewing Irreversible. Don't. There's really no reason to watch it unless you want to be exposed to scenes of abject brutality and depravity. You learn NOTHING. Absolutely nothing from this film. If you need a movie to tell you that rape is a despicable act, and that it shatters the lives of the victims and their families then you are a seriously warped individual.This movie is completely ham fisted. It bludgeons you not only with the scenes in the Rectum and the underpass (as stated elsewhere) but every scene in the entire movie. There is no subtlety, there is no subtext, and let's face it folks, there's really no point.If you're going to make a *controversial* movie, featuring morally questionable scenes such as these, then you should at least find some way to justify what is portrayed on screen. A good example of this is Requiem for a Dream. Without a point, without justification, this movie is nothing more than sensationalist trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irreversible (2002) *** 1/2 (out of 4) After a woman is raped and beaten her boyfriend and ex go out to seek vengeance. I've heard a lot about this film from the past years and most seem to hype it up as the most shocking and outrageous film in history. While I didn't find it too shocking the thing still packs one hell of a punch with its vile and disgusting look at rape and violence. I really enjoyed how the film played the story backwards because this really left a bigger impact when the eventual nine-minute rape scene happened. The violence is incredibly strong as is the rape scene but I think it was done with a purpose and not just done to shock people. Director Gaspar Noe has a strange way of telling a story but he hits another home run here and this makes his first film I Stand Alone look like a Disney film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so let's start. 2 Ugly fat ass mofos appear in a room, one claiming to have had sex with his daughter. Touching really. I think that part was a cut from another movie. But let's not get sentimental on this one.Irony out. Nah, just kiddin'. Stepping over the junkie cameraman (i think he originally was a DJ hence the loops with the camera) that awoke the criminal part in me, the movie can be resumed to : Violence, rape, nudity. They brought Monica Belluci in, thinking : Gosh, that chick is probably gonna attract all the men on the world. Epic failure. Even the sex scenes suck, the plot is inexistent, the way of thinking the movie was creative (starting with the end, finishing with the beginning), but lamentably put on the screen.Every guy who honestly thinks about seeing this movie should get an attorney to sue the director afterwards. Waste of time which is life &amp; money. Typical for a french movie.PS : My deepest Condolences to those who've had their time killed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This French film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, I can definitely agree with that, because alongside such listed films as A Clockwork Orange and Eraserhead, this is one of those films that is really disturbing, but has to be seen. Basically this tells the story of a night out for a couple, but in a Memento style (not backwards and forwards until meeting in the middle, just backwards) this shows it in reverse chronological order. So the opening scene is the body of an assaulted man taken out on a stretcher from the gay club called The Rectum, this scene in regular order would be the ending. Then it flashes back to two men trying to find the club, looking for a man called Le Tenia (Jo Prestia), and when he is eventually found, after getting through people who don't answer and just want sexual acts, and the man wanting him starts a fight, but he ends up with his head smashed in by a fire extinguisher. It flashes back again with the two men, named Pierre (Albert Dupontel) and Marcus (Black Swan's Vincent Cassel), asking some prostitutes who knows where to find Guillermo Nunez, and talking to male transvestite Concha (Jara-Millo), and after getting beaten he says to go to The Rectum. Flashing back again to when Pierre and Marcus are leaving a party, they notice a body on a stretcher being wheeled out from the subway tunnel, and Marcus identifies the savagely beaten body as his girlfriend Alex (Monica Bellucci), and when asked by a man if he wants revenge he says yes, and they start the journey to find the guilty party. Another flash and we see what happened to Alex, she was with Marcus and Pierre at the party socialising with friends, after some drug taking and inappropriate behaviour from the boys she leaves and takes the route down the tunnel, and she passes La Tenia threatening a prostitute with a knife, and he lets her go to viciously rape and beat her for nine minutes. Flashing back more Alex, Marcus and Pierre arrive to go to the party, and we find out that Pierre was originally her boyfriend, but it is now Marcus, and there does not seem to be any bad feeling between them. Flashing before the party starts at all, Marcus and Alex lie in bed together, and they get a phone call from Pierre telling them they will have to take the subway as his car is broke down, and she also finds out that she is pregnant with Marcus's baby. The final flashback sees Alex happy and minding her own business in a park reading a book and watching children play, unaware of her fate to come, and the last words on screen are "time destroys all things". This is a really powerful film because it has some of the most daringly and extremely violent and distressing scenes, the beating to death with a fire extinguisher and of course the horrible rape scene are definitely the ones that stand out. Of course if the film was in the correct chronological order the disturbing sequences would obviously be towards the end, it is much more significant to see them towards the beginning, and this makes for an overall controversial, uncomfortable and distressing film, but equally a masterpiece drama. Very good!</fullReview>
