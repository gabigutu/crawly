		<shortDescription>accurate portrayal of use and behavior of informants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a defense lawyer in NYC for the past 35 yars. I have more than a passing familiarity with some of the actual trials and appeals generated by Ciello's (Treat Williams' character) testimony. More broadly, I can attest to the accuracy of the film's depiction of the agonies, doubts, remorse and dreads of the turncoat/informant-witness in criminal cases. No film has developed this theme - a very common one in federal criminal trials, but one never visible to the public - as thoroughly as this film. "Goodfellas" devoted a few minutes to this, but only to the witness protection aspect after Henry Hill decided to testify, and never developed the broader, morally ambiguos dimensions of becoming an informer who turns on former close associates.Nor has any other film more accurately revealed the way government prosecutors deal with their informants, which is not always pretty; often prosecutors treat their informers in ways that paralell the way Ciello treated his junkie informers on the street - he supplied them with drugs when he needed them, but he also abused, ignored or took advantage of their vulnerabilities when the need suited him.The film also displayed, though it did not emphasize, another aspect of the prosecutor/informant relationship: willful blindness to likely perjury. Here, when Ciello offers to cooperate, prosecutors sternly insist that he tell the whole truth, not just about the crimes committed by others but by Ciello himself. They want to be assured of this not only because legal ethics demand it, but because their cases can fall apart if the defense later uncovers and reveals nasty secrets about the informant to the trial jury to undermine the informant's credibility. Here, as in the actual case, Ciello insisted that he had committed "only three" crimes while a NYPD detective. While prosecutors sensed, but did not actually know, right from the start that this was highly unlikely, and that Ciello was in fact concealing both the number and severity of his past misdeeds, they preferred not to inquire too deeply, and did little independent investigation of Ciello's prior misconduct on the force ("willful blindness"). That came back to haunt them, because after the trials, the defense lawyers dug up many of Ciello's hitherto unrevealed criminal deeds, and severely damaged his credibility, almost fatally imperiling the convictions his testimony had been so helpful in procuring. This film portrays not only the moral dilemma of the informant, but the moral dilemma of prosecutors, who desperately need informants to build their cases, but who have mixed feelings about learning too much about their unsavory pasts.By the way, the detective played by Jerry Orbach has been a private investigator for the past 20 years or so (though never convicted, he was discharged from the police force); I've hired him, and he is terrific!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know the gag, "Behind the tinsel and glitter of Hollywood, there's a lot more tinsel and glitter." Well behind the filth and corruption of the so called "War On Drugs", there's a lot more filth and corruption. When I was a young and naive budding trumpet player, I idolized a trumpet player by the name of Red Rodney. He played with Charley Parker. That's like starting for the Yankees. Like Parker he became addicted to heroin. To me he was royalty. The drug life for him was one of incarceration and constant police surveillance. One day he said a common occurance during an arrest was for the police to take and keep any money he had, and take AND SELL THE DRUGS THEY CONFISCATED! After seeing this movie do you have any doubts? I saw Sidney Lumet give a talk about his career. After the talk was over, I went up and asked him how could the Ciello character even dream about talking to the Feds, knowing that his entire operation was mired in illegal hanky panky. Lumet says he asked Bob Leucci, the real life Danny Ciello, and he told Lumet to this day he still can't truly explain it. Where did Treat Williams, a competant actor up till this movie summon the greatness he reaches. The disintegration from a cocky cop who thinks he owns New York City, to a weasel who causes suicide and ruin for his closest buddies and their families is heartbreaking. The virtuoso cast and Williams probably said after seeing the film, "How the hell can we top this?" You want to know something? THEY NEVER HAVE! An American classic, not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best cop film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Treat Williams plays a corrupt New York narcotics detective who tries to redeem himself by volunteering to go undercover on the force to weed out other corrupt policeman only to find himself facing an increasingly difficult series of moral dilemmas involving his former partners. This intelligent film is possibly the best cop film ever made. Treat Williams delivers the best performance of his career although the excellent supporting cast, Jerry Orbach, in particular, comes very close to stealing the movie right out from under him. Williams is so good here that you can't believe he is the same guy who later appeared in "Dead Heat." (What happened?) Director Sidney Lumet, who also co-wrote the insightful, penetrating script with Jay Presson Allen, was never better. He does such a great job that you can't believe he's the same guy who directed "Family Business." (What happened?) The film is long, but you never lose interest. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lost Masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years after this was in the theaters, it was shown on TV over two nights. I remember reading that a significant amount of footage that had been cut for the theatrical version would be restored for the TV showing. That piqued my curiosity, so I watched -- and was completely blown away.But what amazed me the most was that I couldn't spot one scene that could be taken out of the movie without seriously compromising it. Since I knew it had been cut and restored, I was pointedly looking for stand-alone scenes that only fleshed out the characters but weren't integral to the extremely complex storyline. There weren't any. Every single scene contained some important bit of information that cast light on and helped make sense of something elsewhere in the movie.Ever since then, I've been patiently waiting for this director's cut to show up on VHS, LD, or DVD -- and refusing to watch the theatrical cut! It's been 15 years and I'm still waiting. But I would certainly think that eventually this will come out on DVD, and we can al hope and pray that it will do so in the full version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film, Unflinchingly Realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been made of this film's brilliance and how it was glaringly ignored at that year's Oscars. It richly deserved the awards it never received. Its realistic, gritty feel comes from the fact that the movie was lifted straight from the book, with only name changes. The viewer is drawn into the unraveling world of a narcotics' policeman as he recoils in disgust from what he does to maintain his squad's phenomenally high arrest rate, i.e., stealing, bribing, corrupting themselves to nail the corrupt. Cielo first targets people far from him but then the circle tightens until he fingers his own men. For a cop to rat on fellow cops is a deeply ingrained anomaly, an affront to the ties that bind the police in a brotherhood deeper than blood. The direction is great, the dialog heavily laced with coarse language that deepens the realism, and the acting is fantastic. Treat Williams never again received a role nor gave a performance that approached the stellar proportions of this one. Jerry Orbach is so immersed in his part that Dick Wolf cast him as a homicide detective for Law &amp; Order based on seeing his acting in this movie. All of the characters are three-dimensional, human and evoke emotions. Some are admirable, others pitiful, some are despicable. Though long, Prince of the City is never boring, and it leaves its moral dilemmas largely unanswered, letting the viewer sort out who did the right thing. This film was made by Sidney Lumet as an apology to the NYPD for his hatchet job in Serpico. It succeeds in more ways than mere atonement; this movie is superior to its predecessor in many ways and was inexcusably blown off at that year's Academy Awards. Still powerful and has aged well, even if Treat Williams and Lumet haven't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really, a stunning, unforgettable movie. This movie outlined very well the pitfalls, traps and emotional traumas associated with this type of betrayal. Although Danny Ciello wanted to cleanse himself and do the right thing, the path to that was to bring down the cop family, the close, tightly knit unit that he was part of. The tales he told had life-and-death implications for all involved, and may have been more than he bargained for.Treat Williams was tremendous in this, although I must indicate my one complaint with the movie. That was in Williams' occasional overacting. The pain and emotion mostly was silently played out by Williams. The wrenching, emotional toll was plain to see and sense, even on a tough cop's stoic face. However, Williams occasionally went emotionally berserk, ostensibly to indicate the depth of his turmoil. This is a minor complaint, though. Actually his performance in this was astonishing.There is a scene in the movie where Danny goes out in the night to help a junkie informant. The junkie is sick and desperate. He has nowhere else to turn except his cop handler, Danny. Danny finds himself in the position of having to get his informant his fix to keep him from getting violently sick. Danny finds himself running around in the rain and mud, ripping off another sick junkie of his stash. This junkie is desperate, too, and his cries dig deep into Danny as he rips him off. Later, when he takes the junkie home, his wife/girlfriend gets the drugs, disappears into the bathroom and takes them. When the junkie breaks into the bathroom, she tells him that the drugs were junk, and she flushed them down the toilet. The junkie is back where he started, and he begins beating her. Danny stands there, soaking wet and muddy, stunned by what is happening, and what he is out there doing. This simple scene is played out very well, and Treat Williams stands there with the revulsion and heartbreak played out on his face. This is not what he is supposed to be doing; this is not what he became a cop for.A well-directed, well-acted movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prince of the City is probably Sidney Lumet's best film to date. It is better then Serpico because it shows how dirty police corruption can get. Everyone is guilty in this film to some degree, there are no hero's. The viewer is taken inside the world of drug addicts and drug dealers, cops, lawyers and judges and is shown how easy it is for them to sell out and how sad it is when they do sell out. While "Prince of the City is a very long film and sometimes gets a little slowed down, it is a great story that is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Police Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people consider this movie to be one of the greatest police dramas ever made. It definitely looks and feels real. But many people have never even heard of this film. It's high time it was released on DVD with all the toppings because it was directed by Sidney Lumet, who is one of the greatest directors in modern day cinema. The film is based on a true story that happened throughout the 70's concerning a narc who out of the clear blue sky had a change of heart and decided to drop a dime on his entire squad. The story concerns him testifying not only against his former co-workers, but corrupt lawyers, bail bondsmen and the mob. Treat Williams, who plays the lead character is a dynamite actor who has never gotten the credit he deserves. Sure he's been around forever and has an impressive resume, but a lot of people have never even heard of this guy. As for the movie itself, even though it's about a special investigative unit in the New York City police department, there isn't much action here like you see in other police films. It's mostly dialogue that comes across as realistic and powerful. This is not a movie for children. The fact that it's based on a true story makes it look all the more real. If you liked Jerry Orbach on LAW &amp; ORDER, then you'll like him here.Score, 8 out of 10 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scales of justice drop and rise constantly in this outstanding performance by Treat Williams. By far his best interpretation to date.The difference between "Law On The Books" and "Law In Practice" is shown in Prince Of The City. Daniel Ciello's decision making process is a constant Russian roulette, as his destiny is a mystery until the end. Making a deal is the name of the game in this movie and Danny Ciello certainly gets the deal of his lifetime when the government decides to use the testimony on his and his partner's misconduct as collateral for the entire investigation.Daniel Ciello decides to do the right thing by ratting out himself and everyone else. A deep attempt to start again, to redeem himself. The law forgives Danny at the end however, the "unofficial" rules of life will show him the tab he'll have to pick up when, during a training class of rookies, Detective Stern asks "Are you THE Detective Ciello?" Kind of a positive-negative image of Lumet's Serpico, where the Cop is directly fighting police corruption. In Prince Of The City instead we see a gradual change in the bad guy's behavior, from corrupt cop to redeemed human being/whistle blower. I believe Pacino's soul in "Dog's Day Afternoon" had also contemplated a similar redemption path (Shown by his interaction with his hostages, unlike John Cazale's cold behavior). The movie is a repertoire of a long investigation which lasted over ten years. Sometime after Frank Serpico's repeated complaints and reports on NYPD corruption, the U.S. Department of Justice established an investigative body, the Knapp Commission, led by Judge Whitman Knapp. Treat Williams portrays real life former NYPD Detective Robert Leuci whose knowledge and information on his corrupt fellow officers working in the SIU (Special Investigative Unit), along with over two years of dangerous undercover work, dismantled an entire "Sub-division" composed by about eighty narcotics detectives, most of whom served time in prison. The SIU's detective body was responsible, along with several other felonies, for the infamous "French Connection Rip off", which consisted in the removal and reselling of over 110 lb of heroin from a police evidence room. The testimony of Robert Leuci was an important milestone in the effort to fight police corruption; Leuci's testimony, although he acted in good faith in order to redeem himself and put a stop on such heinous actions, cost some of his partners' lives, as they committed suicide once the various acts of misconduct became public knowledge. The movie is a real life story based on a book by former NYPD Deputy Commissioner Robert Daley, whose work was made possible by Leuci's full cooperation.Treat Williams was definitely worthy of an Academy Award, just like Al Pacino was in Serpico.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Isn't Easy Being Blue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Lumet's earlier work, Serpico, Frankie went through little in the way of a crisis of conscience. His fellow cops were corrupt bullies, comic Paisanos, sadistic goons, or real mean mothers. Serpico was an immensely popular movie for a number of good reasons, including the fact that it was a story of good guys against bad. Prince of the City is by no means as simple as that. It's far more demanding of the viewer and, in that sense, a better story. Once you join a secret organization -- the Mafia, the NSC, the NYPD -- you learn that the rules don't always follow the guide book's. The difference between theory and practice is much greater in practice than in theory. Inevitably, there must be slippage between the ideal and the real. Shortcuts are developed, corners rounded, edges softened. The world outside this cocoon of secrecy doesn't know about the slippage, except in rare instances in which it's squeezed out into public view, such as the defense presentation in the O. J. Simpson trial. Cielo brings himself, recklessly, almost hysterically, through a tentacular process, to rat one by one on the only people he truly can trust and who reciprocate that trust. They are not only his partners but his closest friends. When he almost breaks down from guilt at a backyard party, they take him aside and offer support, money, understanding, as much love as one tough cop can express for another. But it hardly helps. As he tells them, he's seeking absolution, perhaps a bit wistfully preoccupied with achieving what his last name implies. He blows the whistle while he is still an integrated, respected, even honored member of the organization, first on small fry, then people he's bonded with. As he says to the federal investigators for whom he is acting as informant, "The cops care more about me than you guys do." (He's right, too. Other cops save his bacon more than once while the feds are providing a dismal simulacrum of back-up.)These feds as we first meet them are represented by an interesting trio. The first one that Danny contacts (not the other way around) is patient, quiet, thoughtful, steepling his fingers before his face and waiting patiently while Danny works out his own justification for his betrayal, a kind of psychiatric fed. The second is the closest we come to a bad guy; his background includes Andover and Harvard and he has the inexpressive face of the FBI agents in Dog Day Afternoon. We know just by looking at him that he is the kind of guy who lives on Central Park West instead of Queens, the kind of guy cops hate, and Danny tells him so up front. He's the reason that cops feed heroin to their junkie snitches, and why they resentfully skim money off narcotics takes. He turns out to be not unsympathetic; it's okay to go to Harvard, I guess. The third, Bob Balaban, we meet last. He's in charge, a prissy, clipped instrument of distant authority. The feds not only provide inadequate protection, but when Danny feels he has gone as far as he morally can in his cooperation, they pat him on the back, assure him that we're all on the same side here, you know, and then coerce him into further betrayals with threats of perjury. When they're through with him they don't discard him, they do everything in their power to pin the French Connection debacle on him. When that doesn't work they bring up a junkie's payoff of four hundred dollars that some cop may have taken years ago. As Danny says, they'd get you for bad breath if they could. Not only does Danny lose his best friends but his family turns against him as well. His cousin Nick is whacked for warning Danny that a contract is out on him. Nick's family won't allow a drunken Danny into the funeral home. Serpico certainly suffered but he didn't go through anything like this torture.The lengthy narrative involves many characters and a good deal of intrigue and is sometimes hard to follow, which I take as a measure of verisimilitude. There are no car chases, no shoot outs, and no slow-motion violence. No violence at all.Treat Williams as Danny is an underused actor. Perhaps the reason he never became a major star is the very trait that makes him so effective in this role: a determined set of masculine features undermined by a weak voice that suggests an almost feminine vulnerability. His suicidal impulses are made believable. This is his best performance. Lindsay Crouse as Danny's wife has not much to do, but nobody is better than she at gradually allowing her face to melt from a smile into an expression of dismayed disbelief. His partners, whom he sends over, including Jerry Orbach, are more than adequate for their parts, hard-nosed but sensitive cops with families, who only reluctantly can allow themselves to believe that Danny is guilty of what no cop would do to another, turning over his partners. Nailed, two of them eat their guns, which doesn't help Danny's spiritual predicament.This story doesn't end with the protagonist's bittersweet success. Serpico's story was sad, as was Terry Malloy's in On the Waterfront, but Danny's is tragic. In the end this isn't about one good cop in a barrel of rotten ones. It more resembles a quest for redemption by means of a penance so intense as to amount of self flagellation, teetering at times on the brink of suicide. Danny destroys the real world around him and in the process, like Sampson, destroys himself because if we are not after all a part of the things and people we love, and they a part of us, then what are we?</fullReview>

Treat Williams has this role down Pat and for Law and Order fans probably the first time Jerry Orbach played a detective.

		<shortDescription>Lumet's best work on the two sides of the law</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one point one of the characters of "Prince of the City" quotes this: "The law means everything to me and if any arm of the law is corrupt nothing can work, nothing. It is simple as that." But both the movie and the real life seems to proof that the law is a body and the arms of the law has too many hands, too many fingers and they always want more than they can and should carry, they don't follow what the brain says: don't be corrupt, respect the honor code and things like that. In the story all the parts (police officers, detectives, district attorneys) works on different levels, one team doing the right thing and the other being corrupt, stealing and other assorted things. But in the story there will be one guy who has the proof to others and to himself that he can change things and make the law work again even though he was part of the wrong side.Sindey Lumet's second installment on the dark side of the law is "Prince of the City" whose story resembles "Serpico" and "Night Falls on Manhattan", both of these films telling stories about the lack of ethics of police detectives on law's duty. It tells about good people who want to bring these people to court and judge them for their crimes. The movie was taken of a real case. Treat Williams plays Daniel Ciello a corrupt police detective approached by a prosecutor (Norman Parker) to catch another detectives like him involved with the Mafia and other unethical behavior and bring them to trial. This detective is reluctant, nervous about what he's going to do, only accepting the task with one condition: he won't rat any of his friends, they must be out of the investigation. But that seems to be impossible. Daniel will be spiraling out of control while investigating another police officers, detectives, drug dealers, mobsters, recording their conversations but the D.A.'s office wants more and more names and some of Daniel's friends might get burned. Will Daniel survive to all this pressure?By hearing the plot you'll think that the film is filled with clichés and it has some, but for the most part "Prince of the City" stays in a original presentation of facts on a thrilling story that goes for almost three hours without boring the viewer. Here's a story about a guy who wants to get some redemption over his corrupt and criminal past trying to do the right thing, but he always see that doing the right thing is not so easy, and probably he'll disappoint his friends and family by investigating another cops. Treat Williams has a incredible performance playing this tough guy who has a Shakespearian dilemma and must fight against everything and everyone.The drama is very convincing, knows how to deliver some tense moments and it also has a strong but slightly sense of humor (the detectives meetings talks is a great example). Lumet did a terrific job here, among his best films of all time and I dare say that it is was better than "Serpico" even Lumet must think that because he always felt that "Serpico" was one dimensional, it didn't embraced the police work and the law work as a whole, it wasn't so much realistic. "Prince of the City" skilfully managed to get all that, presenting a deep and powerful statement over both sides of the law. Among the best moments of the film I select Daniel's testimony on court about the things he made and seen while on duty, and the prosecutors reunion trying to decide Daniel's future, having one side against him, quoting that he's a criminal and other supporting him, saluting this man's good work for them. These two moments are perfectly alternated between each other (thanks to a great editing), creating a extraordinary effect on the viewer.The supporting cast includes good performances of Jerry Orbach, Bob Balaban, Richard Foronjy, Lance Henriksen, Lane Smith, Lindsay Crouse, James Tolkan, Norman Parker (he should've obtained a Oscar nomination for his role), one cameo by Alan King and one small scene featuring a very young Cynthia Nixon. This a truly case of a great but underrated movie. 9/10</fullReview>

Danny Ciello, a NYC narcotics cop, deals with the conflict between his "moral compass" and the realities of drug law enforcement. The film is about Ciello clearing his conscience and suffering the consequences of seeing his police colleagues burned in the process. Supporting perfs are superb with special notice to Jerry Orbach as Ciello's partner and Lane Smith as the FBI agent that befriends Ciello's confused wife. Haunting score by Paul Chihara adds the finishing touch to this fine film about "doing the right thing" even when the consequences are so high.Hope this film is soon released on DVD for everyone to enjoy...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this many years ago, probably on TV, soon after it came out. It's always been on my mind and I watched it again over the last two evenings. I am just in awe of the powerful story, great acting and the gritty setting of this amazing film. To this day, I cannot believe Sidney Lumet never won an Oscar for best director for all the other great films of his: Twelve Angry Men, Serpico, Network, Dog Day Afternoon, and this masterpiece. With no special effects, no big name actors, no sex, Mr. Lumet has me glued to the screen for nearly three hours. I agree with the other reviewer that this is in the class of the great ones like the Godfather, On the Waterfront, Raging Bull, along with the French Connection, and Serpico. It's a shame that only a minuscule percentage of the IMDb population even has heard or seen films like these from this era, where films were truly an art form, rather than the commercial vehicle that they have become today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another unsung Lumet masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's "Prince of the City" is an astonishingly in-depth portrait of the interlocking worlds of the police and the criminal. Dealing with drugs, cops and corruption, this is "Serpico" all over again, but it's revised, enlarged and in some places improved.Like "Serpico", this is also based on a true story. Treat Williams plays Danny Ciello, a cop working in an unsupervised special unit of the police force, whose methods of gathering evidence and confessions are somewhat unorthodox. However, when his conscience gets the better of him and he decides to blow the whistle on the corrupt behaviour in his department, Danny finds himself in the awkward position of having to choose between saving his own job and those of his partners, whom he refuses to indict. Though most people ignore him, Lumet's films sparkle with a sort of gritty authenticity. He's influenced everyone from Spike Lee to Scorsese, and many films owe their tales of corporate corruption and grungy moralising to Lumet. "Prince of the City" may itself be long and at times taxing, but its final 20 minutes make the long haul worth it, particularly Lumet's final lines, a direct challenge aimed at his audience.8.9/10 - Underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but who cares?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's gratifying to see that 'Prince' has a cult following. It's one of my favourites too, despite its massive flaws: the writers' not dealing with the central fact that these 'hero' cops actually WERE corrupt - somehow that's OK, they're really good guys, family men, our protectors - and the performance of Treat Williams, whom Pauline Kael rightly criticised for playing 'each scene as an acting exercise'-lots of yelling &amp; emoting. We like Treat Williams-he's immensely appealing-but we're not drawn into his character's anguish. But the directing is superb (I'd forgotten Lumet got the nod from the NY film critics that year), and the writers do a terrific job of moving a phenomenally detailed story along at breakneck speed. There's an inspired economy in this movie, &amp; some wonderful scenes, like Ciello's confessing to his partners, in that dark room, that's he's cooperated with prosecutors. The supporting cast is exceptional, with Orbach first among equals. All in all, an often remarkable effort at a compelling story: how a man's brave search for redemption takes him to a lower level of hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prince of The City - Sidney Lumet's overlong melodrama about a cop who turns informant is out on DVD.This 1981 Big Apple corruption flick features great performances by Jerry Orbach and Bob Balaban- but focuses around Treat Williams.The first third of the movie features most of the action-including a heart-breaking sequence where Treat helps a snitch score drugs(look for a cameo by a young Cynthia Nixon) and an action packed big score with his squad.But doom is looming in the air- hell the sound design in the first scene leaves no mistake that foreboding and bad tidings are in the offing. I have not seen this flick since it ran on TV in the 80s.The agonizing last 2 thirds of the movie is a mix of speeches and screaming about lies,morals and trust and it is an unrelenting parade of mental hopscotch as the protagonist tries to to protect his friend's from the long arm of the law and his testimony.The DVD has a decent featurette about the movie and the book and has the person the movie is based on.A good movie is lurking in this package- too bad the editor sabotaged the deal with leaving almost everything in(167 minutes).

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest English language 'cop' dramas ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest English language 'cop' dramas ever made. Lumet and Williams take us along a path where almost everyone one might trust is dirty, the fantasy of the 'war on drugs' is forced to confront the reality of the streets and everyday life, and the closest bonds imaginable between men are fractured by a judicial system that is often itself corrupt and impossible to trust.Over the years much has been said about this film and its lack of recognition, especially in light of only one academy award nomination and no wins. I can't speak to why that happened, but I can say that a greater set of awards earned is the almost universal recognition of this movie as a truly relevant and brilliant statement still fresh over time.So many movies from 30 plus years ago are clearly 'showing their age'. Techniques used, scripts employed, acting, even costumes nail most films from c. 1981 to a particular time frame. Viewers must make allowances for the age, a real negative to enjoyment. Not so, Prince of the City. It is as crisp and compelling now as it was when first released. The only real difference between it and contemporary dramas is the ability of people to now enjoy it as a masterpiece and a reference to a great age of directors like Lumet, instead of a 'first run'.Lumet used a huge supporting cast. How amazing is it that so many near perfect performances are offered by actors that either were never heard of again or slipped into a careers that aren't worth mentioning? To me, that is a little bit of proof of the crazy magic of Prince of the City. For some reason so many people came together and jelled into an ensemble that for 167 minutes can still help us suspend time as we live the story with them. Certainly, the reason has to be the masterful hand of Lumet.If you haven't seen Prince of the City but enjoy this genre of film then please see it soon. It's long, so give yourself the required time to enjoy it. Extra points to you, if you watch it with one or more friends that not only enjoys 'cop' dramas but also enjoys great direction, smooth acting, and like to discuss film making in general. You will find great joy not only in the movie but in the conversations it will inspire. No doubt two threads of your conversation will emerge: where can I get more Lumet movies and why didn't Treat get more recognition for his work. Question one is easy to answer, check out IMDb. Number two is a question film buffs have been asking for over 30 years without satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong drama that oozes morals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody has something to hide. We all have secrets we don't want anyone to know about. Its personal information that is only given out to the most trusted of people - mainly close family and friends. But there's a difference when that secret crosses the line on ethics and morals. When it comes to this, people lie, and lying is never a good thing. The act of lying will always catch up somewhere and somehow. Everyone has a conscious, it's the device that let's the person know what they're doing wrong. And if the individual cannot justify to themselves why the secret they're keeping is for the right reason, their conscious will eat them alive. Almost like a self-destruct button. Some can repress this feeling while many others crack under pressure.This reflects on the story of Danny Ciello (Treat Williams), a New York cop who joined the force to make a difference and be a good person for society. However, it's not until he's is asked by a commission of investigators to spy on the system that he works at for possible corruption. Originally, Ciello is skeptical about the matter because he doesn't want to stab his fellow cops in the back, but he is convinced otherwise. And to his dismay, the longer he stayed in the business, the scarier the information became. Thus leading to an investigation brought onto himself.This kind of plot is very serious in nature because of how it focuses on morals and how people with even the kindest of hearts can fall. This is also the kind of drama that audiences should have the patience to sit through. The running time is almost three hours long because it carefully follows the path of the human struggle between knowing what is the right and wrong thing to do when it comes to telling the truth. The length may annoy some but the story should be powerful enough to keep people focused. And the writing not only covers the story of one man, but several people involved with the lies and how they deal with the stress they induce on themselves. Family life is also included although by the finale the closure isn't as strong as the rest. That also may upset some.The cast is very large in this movie. Treat Williams as the main character gives a memorable performance as the troubled cop. His reactions to many situations closely resemble to how anyone would react if they were in his shoes. It's a very human performance. Even a very young Lance Henriksen has a number of his own scenes. There's also a character named Gus Levy played by Jerry Obach, he would later voice Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast (1991) ten years later. Cool. Although the rating is R, it's more for language and a few beatings nothing gruesome or over the top.The music composed by Paul Chihara is unique too. It's certainly one the most absent of scores I've ever heard but it also helps make the story feel more realistic. This is one of the few times where the music doesn't need to be present to give emotion because the actors themselves give a lot as it is already. There is also a main theme, which is carried out by a saxophone that is good. But the one thing I liked most about this movie was how audience should feel at the end credits. In a court trial, no matter if one walks away guilty or innocent, the past will always be there to haunt them. People will always remember the bad and never your good deeds. And from that day on, the individual must constantly fight to uphold the respect they lost. That's the human struggle and it can be so terrifying. It's a movie that should been seen and understood at least once.The acting led by Treat Williams is very good. Its running time may be lengthy but its story richly consists of powerful emotions and life lessons that demand to be seen just for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Warning, Spoilers within) I haven't seen a movie about cops before or since this was made that is as great as this. This is probably Treat Williams best role. The bond that the policeman have in this movie is amazing. It is painful to watch some of the things happen, that happen. The other performances are great too. The late Jerry Orbach is great, as well as Carmine Caridi (an underrated actor), who plays a crooked detective. I found it to be an exciting and very tense and very sad film, as it showed all of the different characters. Between the cops and the prosecutors and the mobsters and the bail bondsmen and and the judges, drug dealers and the junkies, nobody seemed to be relaxed. Everybody is on edge, which makes them scary and dangerous to be around. Considering that the song "Love will keep us together", by Captain and Tennelle, is on the soundtrack was interesting to me. If you watch the film you will see what I mean. This film definitely needs to be talked about in the future when the late Sidney Lumet's career is discussed. He did a great job directing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and underrated cop drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prince of the City is an excellent film by Sidney Lumet, a director I feel doesn't get enough praise for his work.I noticed a lot of similarities between Lumets earlier film Serpico, and I was worried this was going to be a bit of a rehash. However once the film got going the story developed in a completely different way. Not only that, it was shot differently too. Even NYC feels like a different city than it did in Serpico.I was going to go on and explain the plot a little bit, but I really can't do it justice. What I will say is that this film feels very real, and gritty. Treat Williams (our lead) does an excellent job of playing a character who is at odds with the decisions he has to make. At times he overacts a little, but the majority of his performance is perfect. The supporting cast are also excellent, Jerry Orbachs performance sticks out as one that was particularly good.The cinematography is solid, and the sets are convincing, everything seems to add to the realism of the film. For me this film alone puts Sidney Lumet up there with Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. It's a shame this film didn't get the recognition it deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pletchner from REPO MAN sticking his head through a window pane during the Columbians' bust; the chair collapse in the IA office; Orbach roughing up the state's attorney; the junkie chase in the rain; accidentally handing a receipt from the DA's office to the crooked bondsman - these are dynamite scenes equal to some of Lumet's best work. The supporting cast and occasional gritty dialog are Lumet hallmarks. The camera's always in the right place, the city looks dirty, the cops look like hoods, the hoods look like cops, all's well in the looks department.But this movie is 2 hours too long at 3 hours, and Treat Williams, though decked out in a series of wonderful coats, gives an atypically uneven performance. The Lumet-Jay Allen script also is terribly imbalanced, burying Williams under awful expositional speeches. Depthful insight is sacrificed to an epic, shallow and ultimately trite style. Lumet got the best out of Chayefsky and Waldo Salt and Mamet, and Pacino and Steiger and Dan O'Herlihy and a lot of people, and he is among the best directors in terms of camera movement and B&amp;W lighting; but he also made THE WIZ, THE ANDERSON TAPES, and GUILTY AS SIN. He once said that the best work comes from preparing for the miracle to happen. Sometimes it doesn't happen. It happened several times on this set, but if you're going to write this many monologues your name better be Shakespeare; and if you're going to direct this many monologues, your name better be something other than Sidney Lumet. (for other Lumet monologue embarrassments, see Sean Connery's drunken confession in THE OFFENCE.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my personal database (FileMaker Pro) about the movies I've seen (and heard) since 2000, this film ranks in my list of the very best. I had the pleasure to admire it two times on TV, after midnight: plot, script, direction, acting are all outstanding... but the dialogues are really a delicatessen of good writing.After the glorious years 1945-1960 (cinema noir), I always was attracted by films who reveal the "double identity" of human beings (such as The Killing, The Wild Bunch, Badlands, The Conversation, Charley Varrick, Blade Runner, Hana Bi, Fargo, A Simple Plan, A Perfect World, Jacky Brown, Magnolia, 21 Grams, L.A, Confidential...) and this movie is exactly about the multilayer soul of wounded dreamers.In terms of powerful crossings of action in life (and on the screen), this forgotten achievement of Sidney Lumet, in my opinion is a genuine masterpiece.It's a shame that Treat Williams didn't get the Oscar for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this "cop-rats on cops" story was probably meant to impress in 1976. But it didn't age well. We are left with the clichés, a dragging, heavy script that is plain factual, and terrible acting.Treat Williams is ridiculous. He over-acts like those actors from the mute cinema era. but more than that, literally CRY like a child, his face full of tears, every over scene in a movie that last 2h40!! Result: He is very annoying, and you end up feeling embarrassed that this guy can get lead roles. 10 minutes into the movie, you can't stand him anymore and wish you never see him act ever again. The direction of Sydney Lumet is clean and professional as usual. But the script is so full of clichés, so heavy and demonstrative! Nothing gets to you: the characters, the story, the whole movie drags endlessly. It has absolutely no invention, no craftiness. It is plain flat. A below average cop movie that wants to be big, 2h40 minutes of plain "cop rats on cops story". No twists in the plot. Mediocre dialog. Bad actors... And Treat Williams cries and makes "hurt" faces as to tell you : look, something is happening!Not even nice vintage shots of the New York of the time. Avoid it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this film not known as one of the greatest of all time???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>VERY rarely will you see a film as emotionally gripping, intellectually stimulating, realistic, and well-acted as Prince of the City. It is AMAZING to me that it didn't win the Academy Award. Everyone knows "Serpico" (a good film), "The French Connection" (a very good film) and so many other good (and not very good) films, yet for some reason that remains sad and frustrating, this film remains virtually unknown and unappreciated. It's not a good film. It's not a very good film. It's a GREAT film. With all due respect, how Foxion in Houston could call this a "passable cop story" and "not the film other comments would have you believe" is not only misleading, it borders on irresponsible.By the time you read this, you're most likely already familiar with the plot. Just in case you're not, here's the synopsis....It's based on the true story of a highly decorated NYC narcotics detective (Danny Ciello) who has a crisis of conscience after years of using effective but illegal (and immoral?) methods to obtain the many major drug busts that he and his partners have accomplished. He decides to help federal anti-corruption prosecutors in an effort to once again become the "good cop" he started out to be and always wanted to be. By confessing some of his own transgressions, wearing a wire for the feds to get more corrupt cops, and vowing to "never give up his partners or the deal is off", he figures his soul will be cleansed and he can contribute toward helping stop at least some police corruption, thus making him a "good cop" again. However, once the wheels of justice start to turn, a very large and tangled web gets woven and spins out of control as more and more people get implicated and "strictly by the book" prosecutors who know nothing of how things work "on the streets" (and simply don't care), begin pressuring Ciello for more and more details (including info on his partners) as events further unfold. Being that Ciello has already "confessed" to them some of his transgressions, and being that he will have to perjure himself on the stand to protect both himself and his partners (thus jeopardizing his credibility as a witness and thus the entire government's case), Ciello is backed into a nightmarish corner that he never imagined could happen. Thus starts an ongoing series of further moral and legal crises that Ciello has to somehow face under extreme duress while things continue to fall apart in his world, sometimes with tragic consequences.Now...let's break down the common criticisms of this film: 1) "It's a bit long." Sighhhhhhhh. Lawrence of Arabia was long. Ghandi was long. The Godfather was long. Gone With the Wind was long. I don't hear anybody complaining that THOSE films were "a bit long." A great film is a great film no matter the length of it...and let's face it, there's a LOT of material to cover in this film and it does so brilliantly while keeping the viewer engaged. 2) "Treat Williams was too emotional and overacted." Sighhhhhhh. Someone who was as successful as Detective Ciello at such a young age HAS to be passionate (emotional) about the things in his corner of the world or they simply would not get accomplished. The unfathomable amount and intensity of emotions this man had to deal with are portrayed impeccably by Williams not only in spoken delivery, but in body language and facial expression as well. It's simply a "tour de force." 3) "They never tell you WHY Detective Ciello turned state's witness." Sighhhhhhhhhhh. So what??? As it turns out, upon being interviewed, the real-life detective upon which the movie is based (Detective Bob Leuci), states that to this very day, he can't put a handle on exactly why he decided to turn "rat" (and if you actually THINK about what you watched in this film, you'll realize that it's not simply a matter of "becoming a rat" as several others have described in their plot assessment.) Besides, if you read between the lines of this film, you'll realize the most likely "WHY" rather easily.Bottom line...this movie is extraordinary. It's intellectually stimulating, morally fascinating, and extremely well-acted and well- crafted, not to mention it has a TREMENDOUSLY powerful final scene that's just perfect. How it didn't get nominated, let alone WIN, "Best Picture of 1981", and how it remains virtually unknown, simply seems incomprehensible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one big irritating snore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PRINCE OF THE CITY is a film about a narcotics officer who co-operates with Internal Affairs to build a case against criminals and policemen involved in police corruption.This movie is painful to watch, because its protagonist is so pitifully stupid. From the start, he knows exactly what could go wrong if he becomes a rat for IA, but he still goes ahead and does it. The real problem is that when everything DOES go wrong, he is just astonished. Unfortunately, that astonishment translates into Treat Williams bellowing and shrieking for almost three hours, while the audience just shakes our heads in indifference. His Danny Ciello is everything which is wrong with cop movies or cop TV shows; the self-pity and self-obsession, the constant rationalization, the hiding behind cop myths and partner myths, and the corruption. The movie is such that to have a point, the viewer would have to empathize on some level with it's protagonist, but this protagonist, and the actor who portrays him, make that impossible. His issues are non-issues. He wasn't taken in, he wasn't deceived, he knew exactly what was going to go wrong, and then it did. His only real issue is that he's upset about it. We aren't upset for him, because he walked right into it. When he lies, he's not convincing. When other characters believe his lies, they just make us angry at their stupidity. When he lies again and again about giving drugs to his informants, he wears out our patience completely, and when he reacts in fury that no one believes him, we get up to do the dishes.Toward the end of the movie, James Tolkan's prosecutor character confronts Ciello and says, "That's how you got here, don't you understand?" Williams' facial expression here is unintentionally hilarious, because it is obvious that he does not, in fact, understand, anymore than he has understood anything else that's happened in the film.Lindsey Crouse as Danny's wife has all the personality and warmth of a statue in a dump in the dead of winter. None of her interactions, or her purpose as a character, make any sense. Neither do Williams' interactions make any sense. In the beginning, he smacks his brother around. His brother is screaming his head off, and Danny is beating the hell out of him, but we don't know what they're talking about, and it is not clear what this is supposed to show us about either of them, so there's no point to any of it. This scene, like most of the film, just comes off as an acting class exercise of some sort. If he's not screaming at someone or trying to choke them to death, he's hugging them like they are his dearest friends. None of these are ever appropriate to the scene or to the characters.The movie is easily an hour too long. A 2-hour film, or a 90-minute film, would have been fine, because there is not enough story for more than that. You could chop out the middle hour, have a placard that said "3 years later", show the concluding scenes, and it would be over. Having no story allows Sidney Lumet to practice cinematographic techniques without distractions. A film school student might enjoy watching his touches here and there, but an acting student, or a viewer hoping to be entertained, should avoid it like the plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black And White And Shades Of Gray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on true-life events, this film tells the story of a New York City cop named Danny Ciello (Treat Williams), whom the Feds ask to be an informant against local police corruption. Ciello is in his twenties, street-savvy, and extremely loyal to his cop buddies. He doesn't trust the Feds, but he's willing to help them. I'm not sure why.One would think that an informant has a clear-cut, unambiguous job: snitch on the bad cops and, in return, earn the status of hero. But reality doesn't always lend itself to neat, black-and-white options or outcomes. In this case, shades of gray complicate Ciello's life, because he knows that some of his best cop friends have indeed compromised their ethics in pursuit of serious criminals. He is caught in the middle, between local loyalty, and assistance to the American ideal of criminal justice.The story takes place in the 1970s in New York City. Ciello is part of the city's Special Investigating Unit, which has a generally free hand in dealing with dope pushers and other shady types. Even Ciello has sold drugs to street junkies, in exchange for information on bigger fish. Does this make Ciello culpable now that he's an informant?When a person gets trapped in the American legal web, there's no easy way out. That's Ciello's dilemma, and the essence of the story's theme. Ultimately, we feel sorry for the guy, with his naive, idealistic, black-and-white mental conception of right and wrong. Clearly, the Feds are using Ciello to their advantage, and most of them are portrayed in this film as smug and condescending.Technically, "Prince Of The City" is a fine film, one to take seriously. Color cinematography, sets, casting, and acting are all quite good. Visuals look very 1970s. Treat Williams is convincing as Danny Ciello.But the film is rather talky. And the runtime extends to almost three hours. The plot is so strung out, and there are so many characters, it's hard to keep track of who's who as well as some of the characters' motivations.The film could easily be described as a typical cop drama. But its basis in historical fact makes it more compelling. More than anything else, "Prince Of The City" is a character story of a man under pressure. We see how he deals with that pressure in the choices he makes. We see the impact that his behavior has on his family life and on those around him, who not only depend on his loyalty but also expect him to uphold principles of justice, regardless of where the chips may fall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lumet never made a bad film.I'm from the city (Philadelphia) so I can relate to the atmosphere here. And the story of a corrupt cop trying to do well without hurting his friends is a goldmine of possibilities.Treat's gamut of emotions, while seeming a tad OTT, were nothing but enhancement to his scenes. And the script itself was Oscar worthy.The load of supporting characters was great as well. Every one of them was a scene-stealer in their own right.The brotherhood of cops in just about any city probably goes though similar trips. The internal hell they go through was evident here. And the attorneys who claim to be their friends while secretly going their own way was a wake-up call as well.Best scene had said attorneys deciding whether to prosecute. That's when you saw who his real friends were.This is a cop drama with brilliant performances all around. Like most of Sid's films. Unlike most, this is lost in the shuffle. Time for a rediscovery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just hope my English is good enough to write a review. Anyway, this film is so big and overwhelming I could not resist. The film tells the story on a group of policemen who are chasing drug dealers. They're successful and sometimes they offer themselves extra pleasure with the drug money they confiscated. But one of the policemen, Danny Ciello (Treat Williams), has some doubts about the way they're doing their job. And when an officer of Internal Affairs contacts him about corruption inside the NYPD, he starts to talk. Just about some small affairs in the beginning. Danny Ciello gets wired and tapes conversations with gang members who talk about their contacts with policemen. Ciello hopes to redeem himself and the members of his group. But once the ball is rolling, there's no stopping it. And Ciello ends alone, protected by the officers of Internal Affairs, who can't give him the comradeship he used to have. The very last scene of this movie is really heartbreaking. But in such a way, that I'm still grateful to Sidney Lumet and Treat Williams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The awards won and nominated by this movie were deserved. Treat Williams is fine as the top young cop who gets thrown to the wolves by the authorities.Criticism regarding the film's length is a little misplaced - this is a long tragic story that needs to foment slowly. His various friends and colleagues are given complex characters, and they all go through individually tough consequences of his decision to try to use powerful city - and ultimately federal - legal arms to bring down the international money men behind the burgeoning drug epidemic in New York.The feel is as good as Serpico, gritty, brooding, but I prefer it to Serpico; as Lumet's movies go, it's his best. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, a bit like the much earlier French Connection movies, as a heroic concept turns into a tale of survival and betrayal. The ensemble playing is magnificent - you really feel these cops' support and trust for each other is tested to the limit, but in the end no-one in authority wants to know about the problems of the front-line..Jerry Orbach should have got a best supporting actor Oscar nomination - he is outstanding as Gus Levy, Ciello's closest cop friend and mentor.I can't get this on DVD anywhere, or UK VHS. Why??? It's insane. If anyone does know please let me know nick.slater@bt.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and this film contains some of his best work in that regard....I'm speaking not so much of Treat Williams, who though in the main superb, occasionally chews the scenery, but of the myriad ensemble of lesser known actors who knit together in this piece like a well oiled machine...I love it when you leave a film saying, "I don't know where he found these people, but..." To me a superb ensemble of virtually unknown faces provides a verisimilitude unattainable in any other way, and this movie is one of the best examples of that you'll ever see. The "junkies" are especially realistic; there's a great performance by old vet Lee Richardson as a particularly oily, maleficent prosecutor. And somehow all the actors portraying the Federal attorneys and D.A.'s pull off their nuts and bolts dialogue with superb aplomb,(the hardest kind of acting to pull off)I would say that along with "The Fugitive Kind", this is Lumet's most harrowing, compelling work...I found the original, badly worn VHS release of this in a video store whose owner is too stubborn to sell off his vintage collection; God bless him. Is it really possible that this is the only way to obtain this film??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great True Life Crime Drama!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the summer of 1981 when I was all but 19, I saw this movie on a matinee saturday afternoon. Back in those days in Brooklyn, certain theatres still showed a double feature for the price of one. So I gave up seeing the 1st Sugar-Ray Leonard vs Thomas Hearns fight on ABC to see the Prince of the City and Arthur (Dudley Moore). I kind of regret not seeing the fight, but I LOVED the Prince of the City. This was an acting tour-de-force for Treat Williams and he should have gotten the Oscar for best actor. If your in the mood for a good crime drama on a rainy saturday, go rent this movie. And for all you Sex-in-the-City fans, watch for a 15-year-old Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) in a bit part as a junkie's girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2nd Greatest Movie Ever Made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until Pulp Fiction came along, this little gem was my favorite movie of all time. If you appreciate great acting this film is a feast. Treat Williams gives the performance of a lifetime as Danny Ciello, a cop up to his neck in corruption, who decides he must come clean. But in cleansing his own conscience, many lives are ultimately affected. Every scene is riveting as we watch his "fall" from Prince of the City to drug addicted stool pidgeon. There is a scene near the end where Danny's fate is being decided, that is as suspenseful and well written as any I've ever seen. Jerry Orbach &amp; James Tolkan stand out in the supporting cast. When I used to tell people that this was my favorite picture the typical response was "Prince of the what", so it was very gratifying when just last year Premiere magazine named it "One of the 50 greatest movies you've never heard of". Do yourself a favor and rent this masterpiece - better yet buy it so you can watch it more than once!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really impressed by this 1981 film that seemed like it came out yesterday. It is realistic, intellectual and operates on many different levels. One of the morals learned here could be the old saying, "It takes a thousand lies to support one lie." We also get to see Jerry Orbach perfect his sarcastic cop role made famous in the hit TV series "Law and Order". Fans of Lance Henriksen, who has been of the small screen recently in "Millennium", will get to see him play a small but well done role as that of Danny's (Treat Williams) lawyer. Superb actors, great writing and masterful direction make this film a delight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film which is a logical followup to 'Serpico' concerns a true story about a cop who agrees to testify about corruption as long as he doesn't have to testify against his fellow officers in the detective unit he is part of. Of course his world falls apart the minute he agrees. In this era of superficial filmmaking, a film this detailed is a rarity(although it is a little long)and the huge cast is uniformly excellent. Lumet's fine eye and ear for the complexities of being a nypd cop was never better.A 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Tallywhacker caught in a crack"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story, "The Prince of the City" is about this NYPD Detective working narcotics, and how he turned crooked because he believed everybody else was doing it anyway, and then how he wound up fighting corruption or something and all the stuff that happened to him because of that. Anyhow, that's how they presented it in the movie. What really happened was that this cop got his tallywhacker caught in a crack, and then he got himself out of this tight place by turning in a bunch of other cops who weren't nearly as dirty as he was. There wasn't a damned bit of altruism in it--but Hell, you know Hollywood.After reading Robert Leuci's [ the real prince of the city] new book "All The Centurions" which came out this July 2005, I've had a change of heart as to how I feel about him. I find him to be an idealist man that cares about people, and was once a good cop that tried to do the right thing, but was pulled into a cesspool of a corrupt legal system. As a young street cop he could relate to those that lived in the ghetto, and never looked down on them as if he were better... This is something he learned from his Italian father. He was not one to use the word spic or the N-word when dealing with those of other ethnic background, as some white cops--not all-- at times would do. As a young rookie cop in the mean streets of the concrete jungle, he felt as I once felt as a cop: a prince in shining armor protecting the innocent against a predator that would devour them. Read his book and see what I mean. PS: Tallywhacker is slang for penis. Also hope my new added comments are updated to the present page -Joe Sanchez Picon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A multi-layered masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The extraordinarily complex "Prince of the City" (1981) is one of the greatest achievements of master director Sidney Lumet ("12 Angry Men", "Dog Day Afternoon", "Network", "Running on Empty") and one of his most typical films. The cop Danny Ciello (powerfully played by Treat Williams) agrees to give information about the police corruption in New York City, but only if he won't have to betray his partners in his unit... The film is not only about police corruption. In his informative book "Making Movies" Sidney Lumet describes "Prince of the City" in the following way: "When we try to control everything, everything winds up controlling us. Nothing is what it seems." The movie is also about friendship, about values and about drug addiction. "Prince of the City" is the greatest of Lumet's police films, which are all fine (see also "Serpico" (1973), "Q &amp; A" (1990) and "Night Falls on Manhattan" (1996)). Lumet deservedly won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for his brilliant direction. (When will he finally get the Oscar he has deserved since his debut "12 Angry Men"?) Jerry Orbach (who plays one of Danny's police partners) stands out in a fine supporting cast. And pay attention to Andrzej Bartkowiak's impressive cinematography!**** out of **** (A++)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The law doesn't know the streets."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The law doesn't know the streets." But that doesn't mean that blurring the lines of the law is necessarily a good thing. Many law officials criticized this film during its release, perceiving it as glorifying its corrupt cops and vilifying the prosecutors who toiled to convict them. That is not what the film does. There are no black and white hats here. The story divides its characters into two sides, yes, but they are all struggling throughout to assert a concrete ideology within the oceanic gray area that is the law, and the good and evil it represents.The axis of the film is that Danny Ciello will not inform on his partners. Outside of his wife and kids, who know them like uncles, they are the only people who care about him. He will make the deal to talk about the involvement of narcotics in the corrupt activities of other cops, but not his dear and implicitly loyal friends. As we watch this movie, it is about narcs and New York City crime, but Sidney Lumet wants the underpinnings to be just as visible, how in a corrupt world, one cannot go straight without burning cherished bridges.Lumet gets to the heart of the war on drugs. And we see how it is, was, and will continue to be an utter failure. Addicts depend on the drug. Police depend on the continuation of the trade to uphold their status, and if not their status, their basic living condition. They know that if addicts are going to cooperate with them, they need their drugs. They know that if the courts are going to cooperate with them, drugs must be confiscated and accounted for. They know why they became cops, but they also know more than anyone else on their theoretical side of the law how miserable life is for a junkie. This is a lonely, dangerous and thankless dichotomy of a 24-7 job that's never finished, and if they want to skim a little drug money, that's their way of making it feel more worthwhile.Because Danny Ciello, based on New York cop Bob Leuci, who cooperated in a 1971 internal affairs investigation, is such a demanding and grueling role, almost always on screen in stressful, tiresome and emotional situations, I spent a good deal of the movie having trouble with the casting of Treat Williams. He was a no-name at the time, and that is what Lumet wanted, but there is something incongruously theatrical about Williams that is inconsistent with the rest of the actors. But he does convince us in the latter half of the film that he is falling to bits on account of his job, his testimony and the inextricable fate of the two that he will eventually have no choice but to rat on his friends.Prince of the City is a crime film, about cops, drug dealing, set in New York, and Lumet captures the gritty NYC streets of the 1970s that he encapsulated in Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon as if the era had never left. But it's not a violent film at all. There are many characters, hardly any of whom we really get to know beyond their legal and moral standpoints in the story. There is a later scene wherein a meeting of prosecutors debate whether or not a charge of perjury is justified. Its ethical issues are passionate and effective to us, but the verdict is a coin toss in the political climate. The movie answers none of the gray questions posed. It only threatens with possible scenarios.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****warning spoilers ahead ****This is a flawless movie. A tear-jerker for men. Real men. About integrity and its cost. How people that tries to do the right thing are punished, and how hypocrites are the only ones getting out of it unharmed. It's the same old story of the Scorpio and the frog. (the prosecutors being the Scorpio in this example).Etiher you come totally clean or you lie every step of the way. This movie shows that what's even more important than choosing to be clean or dirty, is the choosing to be consequent. To stick with what you are no matter what. Even if its not who you really are. Once you have made your choice there is no turning back. If you are going to judge bad guys you will have to be able to do the same with yourself and the ones closest to you. Watching a well intentioned but naive Ciello having to destroy the lives of everybody he knows and loves the most, is a sad, honorable and at the same time bittersweet journey. But along the way the honor gets lost in the overwhelming suffering. And no honor in the world can cure that. To me the morality of the tale is brave in its inmorality; It's not worth it. You don't have to be selfish or bad to consider that it's more important to save human beings of flesh and blood than to uphold a system that still even without your testimony is being compromised every day. Maybe that's why this movie couldn't get more recognition Oscar-wise. It's too morally daring. And you can't reward a movie that basically says that sometimes lying is the right thing to do. At least that was my interpretation of it. The last scene sort of tells me: this was what he got out of it. It wasn't worth it. The best of its kind. "Insider" with Russel Crowe /Al Pacino tried to do something similar, but never came close to this. So intelligent, intriguing and moving. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every cop in this movie is corrupt and a young guy named danny ciello played by treat williams decides to put a stop to it. He gets a lot more than he bargained for. The movie never really explains why danny went squealer but i suspect he realized that he was on the take too, and somebody would eventually turn rat and then he himself would go to prison. Better to be the rat and avoid prison and then make money off the book sales, i suppose he figured. Whole cast is great but esp treat williams in the lead role. I remember treat playing the boxer jack dempsey in a movie and i thought he was a big guy, but here he looks small. Whatever, he was great in this film. MILD SPOILER.

		<fullReview>This film made a complete mockery of New Yorks finest, depicting them as greasy -see a word I can't use here-maybe with justification, I wonder. I can't even tell if that was the film makers intention. The dialogue is probably realistic at least where the gangster types in the film are concerned, and maybe for that reason alone it is worth a look. I know that the lead cop character comes off like a shake and bake job ready for a rubber room about half a dozen times in the movie, which is a far cry from the same type of character in the film Serpico. Tough is lacking in this portrayal of a cop on the way to juggling candy canes. Long also, at almost two and one half hours. Maybe inspired by the film The Godfather, nowhere near as well done as that film. Maybe I am being too harsh, but I wasn't all that impressed with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made in 1981, this movie might have been compelling at the time. Watching this in 2010 is a struggle. And I'm not some gamer who's concentration has been compromised by Much Music videos. This movie is tedious. There are endless lawyers, endless perps with similar sounding Italian names, endless talk of 'indictment', 'perjury', 'feds'...If you were born after 1975 and you make it through this movie you probably have what it takes to make it through law school. There are some action scenes but not a whole lot of suspense. Just a whole lot of dialogue - all done up in the slang of cops, robbers, and legalese... There are a couple of compelling scenes but within the entire timeframe of this movie there really isn't enough to say it was worth the experience. Go into this expecting a three hour episode of Law and Order without the reward of an entirely positive or negative ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Overly long and ponderous crime drama involving an elite squad of New York City detectives who take the law into their own hands in fighting the drug epidemic that pledged the Big Apple back in the 1970's. The way these elite cops fight crime is by ripping off the drug dealers that they bust and then, being illegal aliens, ship them off on the first boat or plane back to their native country.With the Chase Commission breathing down corrupt cops necks one of the members of this elite group of law enforcers Danny Ciello, Treat Williams, seeing the writing on the wall decides to come clean. Danny will talk and use a wire but only on dirty politicians and lawyers, as well as D.A's, but not cops especially those cops, or partners, that he works with. This very "high and noble" effort on Danny's part, which was really to save his own hide, has him record hundreds of conversations between him as well as lawyers hoodlums and junkies that in the end would result in some 30 convictions. Danny also gets all of the members of his elite squad indited with the exception of the weak willed and suicidal Officer Bill Mayo ( Don Billett), who ended up blowing his brains out, for crimes that Danny himself committed!It's hard to work up any sympathy for the cops in the movie "Prince of the City" in not only how greedy corrupt as well as, when they's riding high, arrogant they are but how totally lacking and unwilling their in taking their punishment when caught! This to the point of giving up their best friends or partners to the Chase Commission inquisitors in order to save themselves.Danny who's supposed to be the hero in the movie is so gutless and wimpy when he's caught with his hand in the cookie jar, by perjuring himself 40 times after he supposedly came clean, that it seems like the biggest crime in the movie is him getting off Scot-free in the end! Were told by the D.A's office that the only reason that Danny was sprung was that by inditing and convicting him after ratting on his own fellow cops, as well as other members of the law enforcement community, no one like him, a corrupt cop who gets nabbed, will come forward in the future to do the very same thing! Way to go Danny Boy!The movie goes into the sleazy business of cops being drug suppliers to junkies to get information on their suppliers which in fact is who the police are! We see a number of hair-rising scenes of junkies going into convulsions and almost dropping dead because they can't get their fix that are as disturbing as anything you'll see in a slasher horror movie. Danny who's arrogance and false bravado in showing how tough, as well as stupid, he is has him expose himself to his fellow cops as well as the hoodlums that he's secretly recording. This, with his cover now completely blown, has Danny become such a crying sorry a** of a man that even his old lady Clara,Lindsay Crouse, has in the end far more male testosterone's then he does. The at first macho, where things were going his way, Danny Ciello turns into a Valium popping crybaby by the time the movie is just about over when he gets his big moment testifying in open court. Danny by then afraid of his own shadow needs to get himself up to testify by downing at least three Valium tablets, chased down with a couple shots of scotch, just to get on the stand!The most telling scene in the movie has to do with Danny having a talk with his Mafia Uncle Nick's, Ronald Maccone, good friend Mafia soldier Rocky Gazzo, Tony Munafo, who incidentally Danny was setting up by secretly recording their conversation. Rocky somehow sensing what a back-stabbing wimp Danny is tells him right to his face what he, which the movie proves, never would dream of doing. Do you think I'm afraid of going to jail! I spent half may life behind bars and most of the time I spent there was for keeping my mouth shut and not ratting out my friends Rocky tells Danny. That's something that Danny as well as the sh*t-kicking elite members of his drug-busting unit would never have the guts, even to spend one day behind bars, to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I have heard that Sidney Lumet's "Prince Of The City" was a lost classic, a sleeper hit that was under-appreciated, a gem. I was very disappointed when I finally watched it- it's two hours and forty minutes of the most numbing, predictable, incessant over-acting and cringe-worthy clichés.The first forty minutes of the movie are good enough to suck you in, as Treat Williams plays a crooked, guilt-ridden cop who decides to cooperate with Internal Affairs to nab other crooked cops. "I won't rat on my partners," he vows, and the rest of the movie is spent watching him rat on his partners. Treat Williams' performance is embarrassing, and he spends the movie screaming tough-guy monologues too dumb for Acting 101. He genuinely looks clueless in certain parts of the movie, going over-the-top and practically begging for an Oscar nomination. It's pathetic.But it's not all his fault: Director Sidney Lumet makes this the kitchen sink of cop dramas. The movie features 22 lawyer characters that could have easily been condensed down to 3... there are too many cops and way too much dialogue, so much redundancy and so much extraneous information that by the second half of the movie I simply stopped keeping score. Williams' character is either incredibly naive or incredibly stupid if he believes he's going to get out of this situation cleanly... watching him rant and rave over the inevitabilities that come with turning state's evidence is infuriating: "How the HELL did I get here?!?"You volunteered.There is an odd homosexual undertone to the movie as the male characters all touch and hug one another far too long and far too often. The "protection" of Williams' character by Federal Agents is laughable: he's allowed to get out of the car in strange neighborhoods and approach crime lords and only then do the two sixty-something bodyguards run up to make sure no one tries to off him. Ridiculous. When the Uncle Nick character is whacked and his body discovered in a garbage can the actor clearly blinks and breathes- not once but twice during a sloppy, lingering shot. Subplots about Williams' brother and father are dropped without any resolution. Lindsay Crouse as Carla is in an entirely different movie, and her character makes little or no sense within the film we're watching. Characters have absurd and exaggerated names, with occasionally hilarious results: "We're gonna bring in Marinaro and Mayo" can easily be confused with mayonnaise and tomato sauce.I always like to find one good thing in a film and here it is Ron Karabatsos as DeBennedeto. The man is an absolute natural on screen, and one of those actors you never doubt for a split second as the character he's playing. It's a shame the direction lets him go to waste. Why Sidney Lumet didn't edit this film down to its core is beyond me... it's endless bureaucratic talking heads broken up by Treat's screeching and the promise of action that Never arrives.I think Sidney Lumet's "Dog Day Afternoon" is one of the greatest movies ever made- it's in my Top Twenty all-time. I also think "Serpico" is great, but I have to call 'em like I see 'em... "Prince Of The City" is a ponderous bore, a turgid slog through the most insignificant and grating aspects of police informants and legal technicalities. It's a disaster- like a movie stitched together from deleted scenes of the worst episodes of "Law &amp; Order." At one point in the movie a federal attorney who we've never seen before- and will never see again- asks to speak to Treat Williams for a moment. Treat stands up and puts down his sandwich, but the lawyer assures him he can bring the sandwich with him for this particular meeting. He does, and neither the scene, the lawyer or the sandwich is ever mentioned again. For me this sums up the entire movie: too many details, too many characters, and way too much talking without any payoff at all.GRADE: D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far too long and basically boring drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Police officer Daniel Ciello (Treat Williams) is talked into helping a commission that's investigating police corruption. Naturally things go wrong, he starts to have strong doubts about what he's doing and he starts to fall apart.Rightfully forgotten drama. I saw it in a mostly empty theatre back in 1981. I knew Lumet was a great director and I thought Williams was a good actor (I had seen him in "Hair"). It starts off OK but then quickly falls apart. There are WAY too many characters to keep track of and a bewildering amount of dialogue. SOME of the dialogue is needed for the story but most isn't. Characters and situations are bought up seemingly at random and then disappear. The almost three hour running time is unnecessary. This could have easily been done in two hours. I got bored and annoyed by the slow-moving script and all the pointless characters and situations. I completely gave up trying to understand the story and I ended up having trouble staying awake by the last hour! I only stayed in the vain hope that it would make sense and improve. It didn't. Also Williams was terrible in his role. He chewed the scenery so much it got embarrassing! Most critics loved this film (for some reason) but a few pointed out that it was way too long and a few outright hated it. It was a bomb at the box office and quickly forgotten. You can safely skip this one.</fullReview>

Based on a best selling book, the film fails to adequately develop a reason for the cops decision to expose those involved in the system he helped perpetuate. It also fails to show the characters as the outstanding detectives they are alleged to be. Overall the film fails to show much of anything other than a lot of talking about "the system."
