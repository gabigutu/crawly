		<shortDescription>One of the Most Overlooked Films in History For Good and For Bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a mystery THE LAST TYCOON has been. This is a large-scale film with perhaps the greatest cast of male actors in history and nary a mention is made of it. Most critics bash it, the common viewer may dismiss it, but you cannot deny its place in history. It is not often you will find such a pool of talent AND a movie with both Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson on screen together. They even FIGHT! By the way, THE LAST TYCOON also happens to be an excellent, if flawed, work of art.Director Elia Kazan (GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT, ON THE WATERFRONT) and company have taken F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel about the politics and personal conflicts of 1930's Hollywood and put forth an off-beat, unusual picture. Kazan is one of only three directors to successfully direct motion pictures between the 1940's on through the 1970's (the other 2 being Hitchcock and Huston). A staggeringly legendary cast play their parts effectively instead of just calling in their performances, which easily could have happened. Perhaps there was some competition between the old school actors and their methods (Mitchum, Milland, Andrews, Curtis, Pleasence to name a few) and the "method" actors like De Niro or Nicholson who symbolically take the torch in this film. This is especially true of De Niro's extraordinary lead as "Monroe Stahr" (based on Irving Thalberg). Kazan helped to create the "method" acting concept, so who better to direct such a crossroad of talent."Monroe Stahr" is a no nonsense "Studio Chief" who I'm sure Fitzgerald encountered while a hack writer in Hollywood during his final years. De Niro as "Stahr" orders cuts here and fires directors there and caters to what he thinks audiences want. He is actually a noble character, something Fitzgerald may not have meant to express. He must deal with Robert Mitchum and Ray Milland, who represent the corporate, artless side of the picture business and later the writer's wing (represented by Mr. Nicholson). As expected, there are many conflicts of interest but the movie's magic lies in the amazing contrast Kazan and company make between the dream world of an old black and white movie and what happened when the director yelled "CUT".I love classic black and white films and one of the aspects that made them so great was the world you were thrust into. Fake backdrops, miniatures, and grand sets surrounded the actors in most of them, but the dream-like quality of a black and white film kept you involved. With this film, some curiously familiar "fictional" film clips are used for screening purposes where the studio executives would clap or claw at what was projected (They were filmed specifically for this film). Kazan and co. create scenes from supposed films (one was CASABLANCA turned inside out) to add some realism to it all. We get to see an actor from the movies-within-the-movie "on" and "off-screen". Tony Curtis has some good early scenes as a perfect screen presence, but an awfully inept star "off-screen" when he meets with De Niro to confess his sexual confusion in real life. You'll know what I mean if you see the flick for yourself.LAST TYCOON is a love story more than anything. Many people may dismiss the love angle as a distraction. I found it slightly hypnotic and mysterious. The love interest, played by a beautiful actress named Ingrid Boulting, is great at exuding an elusive quality, something the De Niro character can't put his finger on. It all leads up to a somewhat vague climax and ending, but perhaps the filmmakers were unable to come up with the final stamp Fitzgerald failed to accomplish himself.This is a film for discerning and patient film-goers only. It is unlike anything I have ever seen before. That is why I see movies. Why the film has been so looked over is bizarre. Even if you consider it a complete flop, it deserves recognition, if only for the great cast. If you like classic films and know a thing or two about film history, you may know why THE LAST TYCOON is so captivating.RATING: 8 1/2 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tour-de-force performance by De Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert De Niro arguably gave the most critically acclaimed performances during the 1970's in movies like "Mean Streets", "Bang the Drum Slowly", "The Godfather, Part II", "Taxi Driver, "The Deer Hunter", etc.,. Little has been said, however, about his turn as Monroe Stahr in "The Last Tycoon" - quite possibly De Niro's most underrated and most uncharacteristic performance on screen. "The Last Tycoon", itself, was a mixed bag among the critics. Some liked it. Some didn't. In my view, "The Last Tycoon" was a movie that deserves a place in film history for exploring Hollywood in the inside. This movie, however, provides only a small glimpse into this which was why the critics were divided. Shortly put, "The Last Tycoon" deals with a top producer's (De Niro) everyday life and the conflict that arises when he sees a lost loved one - albeit in a different way.The movie boasts of several big names of the past as well as the present. Robert Mitchum, Jeanne Moreau, Anjelica Huston (in a cameo), Tony Curtis, John Carradine, etc., were few of the key players. Jack Nicholson makes a late appearance in the film providing for some brilliant, electric scenes with De Niro. In fact their scenes together (undoubtedly the highlight of the movie) make the one scene that De Niro and Al Pacino shared in Michael Mann's "Heat" seem pedestrian. De Niro and Nicholson, two of the greatest actors American film has even seen, will most likely never work together again considering their stature today which makes their scenes together in "The Last Tycoon" that much more priceless. Ingrid Boutling, a British model, is cast opposite De Niro and gives a wooden performance. She is the only weak link of the picture. A young Theresa Russell also gives an able supporting performance. Ultimately, however, "The Last Tycoon" lies solely on De Niro's shoulders and he makes full use of the opportunity and then some. De Niro's interpretation of a movie mogul (reportedly based on Irving G. Thalberg) is absolutely genuine and original. Looking trim and handsome, De Niro gives a towering, commanding performance as Monroe Stahr and it is his work here that holds the picture together. Though the critics were split down the middle in their opinion regarding this film, there was one thing they agreed upon. Robert De Niro gives an authentic, striking performance in the central role. In my opinion, a performance which deserved an Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Niro was an unexpected surprise as Monroe Starr in this brilliant adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished last novel. He gives a thoughtful, sensitive, and intelligent performance as this character, who was modeled on MGM producer, Irving Thalberg. Fitzgerald wrote about Hollywood from the inside, and from the perspective of someone who was destroying himself by being inside. He could ask for nothing better than to have English playwright Harold Pinter create this stark, human screenplay and then have Elia Kazan realize it.In addition to De Niro's definitive performance, we get a series of perfect cameos (usually an impossibility) from Tony Curtis, Jeanne Moreau, Robert Mitchum, and others. We also get two screen debuts of merit -- Angelica Huston (in a small, but memorable scene) and an excellent Teresa Russell as Starr's would-be sweetheart. The critics hated the movie, and it did poorly in box offices, but it was truly, like Fitzgerald himself, an American masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed, uneven, and strangely memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kazan and Pinter's THE LAST TYCOON is disjointed, uneven, and strangely memorable -- rather like an oddly unsettling, hazily recalled dream.Robert De Niro, in a quietly amazing performance, disappears into the title character of Monroe Stahr, a workaholic Hollywood producer who is, in Keats's phrase, "half in love with easeful death." (This understated movie is from the same year as De Niro's flashy bravura turn in Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER.)Most of the supporting cast is excellent, including Robert Mitchum and Ray Milland as a couple of Shakespearean-knavish villains, Jack Nicholson, Donald Pleasence, Theresa Russell, and Dana Andrews.Ingrid Boulting is beautiful but somewhat less satisfactory as Stahr's love interest, Kathleen Moore. In fairness, however, her role is deliberately written as something of an enigma: Kathleen Moore is a blank movie screen onto which Stahr, a near-solipsist, projects fantasies and memories of his deceased wife.The various elements of THE LAST TYCOON never quite cohere into a whole, but several scenes have stuck in my memory ever since I first saw it years ago. Among them:- Stahr's mock-lecture to the misfit screenwriter Boxley (Donald Pleasence), beginning: "You've been fighting duels all day..."- Kathleen Moore telling Stahr, over the insistent crash of the surf at his unfinished ocean-front mansion, "I want ... a quiet life"- Stahr's informal evening meeting with a labor-union organizer (Jack Nicholson), during which the privately despondent movie producer grows increasingly drunk and belligerent; and ...- The closing ten minutes or so of the film, which take on an almost surreal quality: Disembodied lines of dialogue from earlier scenes recur; Stahr repeats his earlier speech to Boxley, only now as a soliloquy addressed directly to the camera; and then -- murmuring "I don't want to lose you" -- he seems to hallucinate a vision of Kathleen as she moves on to a new life without him.Only Jeanne Moreau and Tony Curtis struck me as jarringly miscast in their parts. They -- and their comic-pathetic scenes as insecure movie idols -- seemed to belong to another movie entirely.THE LAST TYCOON is an uneven work but most assuredly has its merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fitzgerald's romance turned arctic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fitzgerald's unfinished novel about the romantic yearnings of an Irving Thalberg-like mogul (Robert DeNiro) is turned into the screenwriter Harold Pinter's stock in trade: a sphinxlike ballet of omitted information. The mixture of Pinter's ellipsis-strewn dialogue rhythms and the coarseness of the Old Hollywood setting gives the picture a strange, detached mood--cryptic, teasing, vaguely dislikable. DeNiro would nail this sewed-up-kingpin character two decades later in Scorsese's CASINO; here, whether through youthful inexperience or Pinter's deletions, he's remote and untantalizing. The punch of Fitzgerald's story--the hyperefficient chief's destruction through a search for the love he never found--never lands, because Pinter has drawn the character as a pinched, uncommunicative stick who seems to have no inner life. (It doesn't help that the director, Elia Kazan, seems unsure if he wants to communicate that DeNiro's love interest, Ingrid Boulting, is either a vapid lump or a pornographic doll.) Pinter designs most of the scenes to have anti-payoffs; in one--DeNiro's counsel to a panicky, impotent movie star (Tony Curtis)--he seems to have carefully tailored a joke with no punchline. With Theresa Russell, who gives the best performance as the Big Boss' daughter, and Jack Nicholson, in one of his finest tiny-role performances as a strangely fastidious union organizer. Also with Robert Mitchum, Ray Milland, Donald Pleasence, Seymour Cassel, Jeff Corey, and an extremely young, haunted-looking Anjelica Huston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>frustrating but valuable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the book (and Fitzgerald's notes about how he saw the story progressing) I expected high quality from Kazan's film treatment. Much has been made of his decision to have an almost comatose Monroe Stahr, unable to express emotion on anything but movies, and in this I think he partly succeeded. But the film as a whole irritates me. It's one I've gone back to several times and I can't work out why it has that effect. It just does. In relation to the book, some scenes are pretty much verbatim, some are added to, some are ditched altogether, there just seems no reasoning behind it. The plusses - it has an interesting ending and an equally interesting supporting cast of old timers, most of whom are always worth watching. It has a certain amount of style and character of its own. It's just not that easy to enjoy, IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although there are flashes of goodness, The Last Tycoon falls short of being anything rich.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films about the film industry tend to be self-mocking at the best of times. Singin' in the Rain poked fun at the coming of sound and outlined the difficulties it brought to the industry amongst a love story and a few other things. Additionaly,the more contemporary The Player brought to our attention the trials and tribulations of a Hollywood film producer as he struggles to balance everything at once, complete with disgruntled rejected writers. So it's sort of a shame as well as a surprise that The Last Tycoon does not hit as many spots as I thought it might with it ending up as a slow burning but ultimately unrewarding experience.The film adopts an approach that makes it come across as more of a love story than anything else, but there is a sub-narrative involved that revolves around De Niro's character of Monroe Stahr gradually getting more and more confused with his life and things around him. The primary problem here is the film is not involving enough to warrant it an interesting or touching love story and the dedication to the focus of a man slowly getting more and more overwhelmed is undercooked ? both are there and done reasonably well but both feel anti-climatic. Along with this and like I said in the opening paragraph, the film does not poke fun at and nor does it reference enough the industry in which it's set so it doesn't feel particularly clever, something Singin' in the Rain and The Player were because they did it very well and to good comic effect.There is a definite study going on here with some substance in the sense it is about Stahr and his struggles with his current life and his love for newly acquired girlfriend Kathleen Moore (Boulting) but nothing much else. Is it a romance? Probably, but is it a good romance? Not really. Ingrid Boulting is shot in an extremely objective manner with lots of brightly lit shots and compositions that reveal enough of her body at particularly nicely timed incidences in the film. This is twinned with several close ups of De Niro's facial expressions in which the lust and desire is very much apparent. It would be easy to argue that these objective and obvious set ups revolving around a gaze of some sort are deliberate given the film is about film-making and that very early on there is a scene involving a man and woman shooting a romantic scene of some sort. But the concentration on a genuine romance between two characters in the story we're watching is clearly trying to come across as serious and thus; being self-aware of its own compositions is an idea the film fails to get across.But before this romantic distraction gets involved, the film begins in a light-hearted but intriguing style. An individual answers a question on how difficult it must be to shoot an earthquake scene and they laugh, replying that shaking the camera usually works and insulting the idea as a cheap effect. Sure enough about ten minutes later, there is an earthquake within the universe of The Last Tycoon and we realise the film is poking fun at itself. Then there is the other concentrated dig early on that, unfortunately, isn't played on an awful lot and that involves Tony Curtis' character Rodriguez and Tony Curtis as a whole. The character name of Rodriguez is short and sharp ? it is exotic in the sense it sounds 'Latino' and we all know that 'Latinos' in Hollywood cinema are usually scorching hot in their appearance (at least the women are). Rodriguez is an actor who appears in lots of films about love and making love; he appears topless in the scenes within the scenes that Tony Curtis is filming. The point here being that Curtis himself is (or was) a bit of a pin-up and his public figure is being spoofed through him playing the part of a romantic lead in a film within a film.When all is said and done, The Last Tycoon is a study of one man and his issues. It is not as engrossing as De Niro's own Taxi Driver from the same year and nor is it as interesting or disturbing as more contemporary examples like American Psycho and One Hour Photo. The film substitutes daily rigmarole and movie set interaction for the introduction of Boulting as the dull love interest and shoots her body accordingly. Twinned with this is a visit from Brimmer, played by Jack Nicholson, which is ill timed and feels out of place given the route the film had gone down at that point. While the film isn't particularly bad, it feels underdone and somewhat one dimensional. Its study of love and stress is alright but it does not demonise the film industry in ways it could've and nor does it feel particularly urgent. This could revolve around anyone, in any industry, at any time and that said, The Last Tycoon is pretty ordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Elia Kazan's highly underrated masterwork of cinematic art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Tycoon, Elia Kazan's swan song based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's final, unfinished novel of the same name, is an important work of cinematic art. The Last Tycoon can be approached in different ways depending purely on the viewer's taste and his level of understanding.First, at its most basic level, it is a film about films and people who make them: writers, directors, actors, producers and studio bosses, not in the increasing order of their creative importance but in terms of their actual influence as prevalent during the Golden Age of Hollywood.Second way to approach it is to look upon it as a tale of unrequited love. Third, as a film about the fall of a man from omnipotence to oblivion. Fourth, The Last Tycoon is about the inflated human ego and the Lear-like grand operatic collapse it so often triggers. Fifth and the most complex way to approach it would be as a surrealistic expression of an artist working at the height of his powers and desperate to make the most of the final few opportunities left with him.The Last Tycoon features quite a few memorable performances including cameos from Tony Curtis, Jeanne Moreau and Jack Nicholson. The film revolves around a Hollywood movie producer, named Monroe Stahr, slowly working himself to death. Robert De Niro is absolutely breathtaking to watch as Stahr?a role fashioned upon Irving Thalberg, the production chief at MGM during the late '20s and '30s. The scenes that he shares with Jack Nicholson?the only ones that the two legendary actors ever shared on the celluloid?are pure gold. De Niro shares great chemistry with the two female leads who complement him really well. While Ingrid Boulting is delectable to watch in her enigmatic portrayal of Kathleen Moore, Theresa Russell creates a strong impact in the limited screen time she gets. The Last Tycoon, as underrated as it is, deserves much more attention than what it has received over the last four decades. The movie succeeds in breaking the glittery image of the Tinsel Town, which is often portrayed as some kind of a Shangri-La for the young and upcoming artists, by presenting a caricature that's far more realistic. The movie may lack the refinement of a work of commercial art but its unfinished crudeness definitely makes it more lifelike. It's a movie that hasn't lost its relevance with time and perhaps that's what makes it a timeless gem of cinema. The restless viewers can afford to stay put, but those with patience must check it out, for they would be thoroughly rewarded.For more, please visit my film blogsite:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Swan Songs in One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmaking has always been a business, an industry, and movie companies showed a profit by working under the studio system. The foremost studios kept thousands of people on salary, actors, producers, directors, writers, stunt men, designers, technicians. And they possessed hundreds of theaters across America that played their films and were forever reliant on new ones. MPAA President Will Hays also instituted a Code he named after himself, which adhered to censorship rules and went into effect after government coercion expanded by 1930. However it took awhile for the code to be imposed, after the Legion of Decency threatened a boycott of picture shows if it didn't go into effect, and those that didn't get a seal of approval had to pay a $25,000 fine and could not make money in the theaters, as the MPAA owned every theater in the country through the Big Five.Enemies of organizing---in the case of The Last Tycoon the labor union of the Writers' Guild---largely in administration and big business, did and will frequently disseminate horror stories about plant closures and vindictive firings to hinder union action and uptake among the workers.This masterfully lateral succession of dramatic character-driven events in an intriguing time and place features a kind of hero, Monroe Stahr, a character thick with overtones of Irving Thalberg, MGM production chief between the late '20s and 30s. The backdrop is Golden Age Hollywood, when studios churned out 30 to 40 productions a year and every backlot could at the same time control pictures set in New York, Africa, the South Pole and Montmartre. The film's setting has a marked tie to stories of Hollywood in the era, over and above to Fitzgerald's own life and career. Thalberg, a wunderkind until his death at 37, was revered within and outside Hollywood, as he seemed capable of discovering successful material ceaselessly. Seeing in his mind's eye how much a particular sort of picture would total, which then told him how much could be gainfully spent on it. Stahr, played with restrained enthusiasm by Robert De Niro, whose sinewy, swarthy looks look like an admiration of Thalberg's, has the same mysterious talent, but ultimately becomes a victim of the "new" Hollywood of shareholders that Fitzgerald could see forthcoming. Thalberg died before being engulfed by loss, while in the film, Stahr doesn't.The theme of uncompleted aspirations and the unrequited love of the youthful and gorgeous in Hollywood, personified by the beach house, have huge importance for both the novelist and director at the end of their astounding careers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>veers towards being TOO subtle and stuffy, but remains a good view into coldness of 1930s Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a little while as I watched the Last Tycoon, I thought I could understand what the critics said of this film when it first came out (the majority of them I mean). The screenplay, written by Harold Pinter from what is supposedly a much richer (albeit incomplete) text from F. Scott Fitzgerald, stages many scenes like how one would see on a theater stage, with only one or two little directional differences with Elia Kazan's take on the material. This, plus its slightly 'dry' style (i.e. very little musical score, limited camera movement, performances kept without much, if at all, improvisation), makes things seem almost too much in the realm of the naturalistic, of drama kept to a minimum of interaction.But as the film went along like this, I started to notice something: the sort of coldness, almost a loneliness, with the character of Monroe Stahr, is what actually makes a lot of the movie work for all its intents and purposes. It has the veneer of being a little distanced, of not having the full driving force of drama and comedy (although it does have both of those in bits and pieces, more as little familial or romantic drama or one-line throwaways) like an 8 1/2 or the Player with dealing in the problems of a professional in the film industry. But because of Stahr's method of practices, of being as Mitchum's character describes "like a priest or a rabbi, 'this is how it will be'", when he's told 'no' it shatters him. As a film about loss, and the very calculated realization that his code in business spills over into the personal, the Last Tycoon does work.Maybe not very well, but work it does, as storytelling and as a character piece. Sure, it might not be De Niro's best, but he does deliver subtle like it's as second nature as breathing (kind of a twist on his other 1976 character, Travis Bickle, whom he played subtle but also crazy, where as here it's subtle and empty), and he's got plenty of backup. There was some critical flack for the actress Ingrid Boutling, playing the nearly obscure object of Monroe's desire-cum-demand, but she too is better than she was given credit for, at least within the range she's allowed to work in (which, granted, isn't as much as one might think, but she's seen not as a fully-fleshed person but as someone with hints of a reality she needs and a fantasy world of movies she doesn't).Then there's Nicholson, showing up in the final reels for a couple of amazing scenes sparring with De Niro, barely ever raising voices for a low-key one-on-one as a movie exec and communist writer organizer. Not to forget Mitchum, in maybe his last good performance, and Theresa Russell in also an underrated turn as a woman grown up way past her years. Did I mention Jeanne Moreau? She's Moreau, that's about it, playing a completely self-absorbed star for all its one dimension is worth. Only Tony Curtis, with his libido problems isn't par for the course, and Donald Pleasance has a shaky (if darkly funny) scene as a scorned writer.Does the Last Tycoon have some problems as feeling like compelling historical drama? Sure. But does it somehow get into the atmosphere of its character in the context of his profession, revealing all that's absent for him every day coming home to his Asian butler? Absolutely. It's a mix and match that will disappoint some, and for those who want to take the chance on a somewhat forgotten 70s film- Kazan's last and Spiegel's final ego-tickler- might be even more impressed than I was. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfinished Inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one time a film that had Robert Mitchum, Ray Milland, Tony Curtis, and Dana Andrews all in the same cast would have blown some studio's budget. But all of these guys who were leading men in the past are in support of a young Robert DeNiro in F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished, The Last Tycoon.This film was one of the few failures of Robert DeNiro's career. I don't think he was able to get inside his character mainly because I don't think F. Scott Fitzgerald ever really fleshed him out in the first place. In fact as legend has it, Monroe Stahr is based on Fitzgerald's friend, movie executive Irving Thalberg. But I think there's just as much on that other boy genius over at MGM, David O. Selznick. There's no way Irving Thalberg would have ever gotten drunk and try to duke it out with the bargaining agent for the newly formed Writer's Guild. But Selznick was perfectly capable of that. Selznick was also the guy who did marry the boss's daughter, Louis B. Mayer's daughter Irene was his first wife whom he left for Jennifer Jones.This was Elia Kazan's last film and sad that he went out on a career note of middle C. Theresa Russell made a nice debut as the Irene Selznick character here. The real Irene was not quite the naive school girl that we meet in The Last Tycoon. I liked also what Tony Curtis and Jeanne Moreau did as a pair of neurotic married stars.Best in the film however is Jack Nicholson who is the agent from New York organizing the Writer's Guild. Remember Elia Kazan's background as a friendly witness at the House Un-American Activities Committee. Believe it or not, there really were Communist party members trying to organize in the labor movement back in the day. This was Kazan's last attempt at explaining his actions. Anyway Nicholson who only comes in for the last 10 minutes of the film, makes his brief scenes with DeNiro really count.The Last Tycoon did get an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design and the film certainly did look like the Thirties in Hollywood. Maybe if Fitzgerald had ever finished his story, The Last Tycoon might have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elia Kazan methodically directs Harold Pinter's limp adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's last (and unfinished) novel about a workaholic movie mogul (named Monroe Stahr, who bears a literary resemblance to Irving Thalberg) under pressure in 1930s Hollywood. As played by the gaunt, still-green Robert De Niro, this tycoon never comes to life, and since he is at the center of the piece, it simply plods along to a soulless conclusion. Great supporting players (including Jack Nicholson, Tony Curtis, Robert Mitchum, Jeanne Moreau, Dana Andrews, and Anjelica Huston) end up just standing around, while the film's period-flavor disappoints and the golden-toned cinematography never envelopes us (nothing in the film is visually lyrical, which may be why Kazan resorted to some 'classy' nude shots to spike the action). One may sense the production is a heady one, with a great deal of prestige behind it, but it never builds a head of steam and is mainly aloof and alienating. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Tough A Task To Tackle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is beautiful, very lyrical but his character's words are not to be taken at face value. His description is vivid though he does not use fancy - or too many - words. He has a clear point of view or opinion about the people he writes about. But if his writing appears matter-of-fact, fly-on-the-wall, etc. it is anything but that. In THE LAST TYCOON he wants to tell us about his problems with alcohol and women, the effect of communists unionizing Hollywood writers, and - like always - the unique agonies of the very wealthy class. Like his other fiction, dialog is a minor inconvenience serving to support the overall description of what's happening - better conveyed by mood, atmosphere and pretense. Not in spite of but as a result of FSF's talent, his writing can simply put blunt description in his characters mouth and allow it to melt with his narration. His ability to convey mood is that compelling.Translating such to film creates a problem. The scenes in TLT are comically bad. Irony is given new definition when Stahr rejects a scene on the basis that 'People don't talk that way". People don't talk like the characters in TLT. Allow me to suggest that a successful adaptation of an FSF story would contain limited dialog, even to the extent such requires omitting what dialog the novel or short story contains. Sometimes a literal interpretation is not necessarily faithful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incomplete Fitzgerald and indifferent Kazan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I recall correctly, this was the last movie to be directed by Elia Kazan, who had an illustrious career in American show business as an acclaimed stage writer and director on Broadway as well as a successful Hollywood director. 'The Last Tycoon' was meant to be his swan song, of sorts. I saw this movie at the cinema when it was first released in 1976 with an old boyfriend and I don't think that either of us knew what to make of it. I then read the novel by Scott Fitzgerald. It was Fitzgerald's last notable work, noted most of all because he died before he could complete it. Comparisons to 'The Great Gatsby' are sadly inevitable, and I didn't find 'The Last Tycoon' to be as good. (But what book ever is?) I hired the movie on rental many years later and thought it was stilted and too impressed by its original source material and couldn't understand why I might have recalled something so (un)memorable.Anyway, the story concerns the rise and fall of Monroe Stahr, a movie mogul whom Fitzgerald based upon the legendary Hollywood figure of Irving G Thalberg. The usual Hollywood generic characters make a showing, the gruff studio head, minions looking to get ahead etc, played by some famous names in miniscule parts (ie Dana Andrews, Tony Curtis), as if it was a mark of status to take part in Kazan's last project for the screen. Robert de Niro looking very young, I think was miscast by Kazan to play Stahr; his performance is strictly one-note and not very lively. A young ingénue making her film debut, Ingrid Boulting, who plays a woman that Stahr becomes obsessed with, got the thumbs down from audiences and critics for being too beautiful to act, whilst a feisty turn from Angelica Huston before she became well known, got a lion's share of the attention. Robert Mitchum, and Ray Milland also have supporting parts but like Andrews and Curtis, it seems a waste of time - dare I say it, a gimmick of casting, to have them in the film at all.Theresa Russell appears as Robert Mitchum's daughter, and she is the Nick Carraway of this story, observing the tragic predicaments of those around her and vowing that she has learned something about life's pitfalls, from carefully observing the mistakes Monroe Stahr and others in the story have made. Since the original source material was never finished, I actually cannot remember the kind of ending they had to tack onto 'The Last Tycoon'. I think Stahr, after his unhappy love affair leaves the studio never to return. In reality, Thalberg was in ill-health for most of his life and died young after being married to actress Norma Shearer - his Hollywood reputation is legendary but you would never know why after not knowing anything about him, and then watching this film.This is one of those films that one finds difficult to get involved with as you cannot see the point of why it has been made. In this case it is unfortunate because the project had everything going for it, but it did not turn out as well as either audiences or critics had anticipated, and sadly comes off as an unnecessary vanity project on behalf of Kazan reaching the sunset of his illustrious career in movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast can't save boring story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Tycoon" is based on the last unfinished novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Harold Pinter took on the task of trying to "finish" the story and adapt it to the screen. Unfortunately, it does not work."The Last Tycoon" has a lot of polish and hard work behind it, but it ultimately falls flat from boredom. Which is a shame, because the cast is absolutely first rate and Elia Kazan does a serviceable job on his last picture.DeNiro plays a mogul/producer based on Irving Thalberg, boy wonder of the 1920/30's movie industry. DeNiro is excellent as the driven genius who's live is empty due to the death of his movie star wife. This is one of DeNiro's most under-appreciated performances. Along with "Guilty by Suspicion", this performance is underplayed, and seemingly simple, but, after viewing it several times, you appreciate the complexity of the performance.Other good performances are turned in by Tony Curtis, Ray Milland and Robert Mitchum as the President of the studio. Donald Pleasence and Jeanne Moreau are also wonderful in their small roles.I believe another miscue in this film is the casting of Ingrid Boulting as Kathleen, the woman that DeNiro pursues throughout the film. To me, although she is quite beautiful, there is nothing interesting about her performance. Kathleen should be mysterious in an ethereal way, but Boulting makes her unapproachable, to the point where you don't know why this man is pursuing her.And while it is nice to see Jack Nicholson and DeNiro on screen together, it feels like a gimmick. The scenes are not brilliantly written, and Nicholson's character is not that interesting.It's always unfortunate when a movie with such high expectations, and so much going for it, is less than it should be. I'm glad I watched this movie, but like Munroe Stahr, I feel empty after having seen it.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong, overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one scene where Stahr and others are watching the final cut of a movie in a showing room. When the movie is over and everybody gets up to leave one man remains sitting. It is the editor who has died quite suddenly. Editor Richard Marks has worked on a lot of well known movies but I guess he would rather forget this one. And the editing is one of the problems with The Last Tycoon, we get to see a lot of people opening doors, closing doors, walking up stairs or down stairs. No wonder the movie clocks in at 122 minutes. Another problem with the pacing is that people talk slowly. In a movie people must talk much faster than in real life, a movie is not radio and the audience is waiting for things to happen.Another problem is that I never understand where the movie is heading. Not because the movie constantly surprises me, it is simply heading nowhere. A very young Robert de Niro is simply gliding around, going where the situation takes him. The little love story between Stahr and Kathleen remains pointless. At least with a good old war movie you know it will end with a big explosion and the nazi bad guys killed. Director Elia Kazan was very aware of how vague the love story was scripted but couldn't do much about it.The only memorable is Jack Nicholson's five minutes as a union organizer but his and others talents are wasted in this overlong and overrated drama. Unless you are trying to see all of Robert de Niro's movies you better stay away from this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Then here's your chance! I continued watching this movie to see if it continued to be as bad as the early scenes were. It was. Awkward dialog was rampant throughout the film. De Niro -- an actor I highly respect -- was wooden. The plot...once you figured out that it had one...meandered along. Elia Kazan was a great director, with the emphasis being on "was". He was beginning to lose his touch, and although he had some nice cinematic shots, the story stumbled along.If you're wondering if I didn't find anything good about the movie...well, it's a very lavish production. visually, the film looks great.Among the other actors, Tony Curtis was fine as a star with tremendous insecurities. Robert Mitchum and Ray Milland were fine as studio executives, though some of their dialog was questionable. Jeanne Moreau...a great actress...in other films. Jack Nicholson was interesting in a smaller role. Donald Pleasence was good as a misplaced screen writer. It was good to see Dana Andrews (as a floundering director), Peter Strauss, and John Carradine (as an old tour guide).This film had potential, but Elia Kazan flubbed it. It's never good when you watch a film to see just how bad it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert De Niro is handsome, slim, and elegant as "The Last Tycoon," a 1976 film with a screenplay by Harold Pinter and directed by Elia Kazan. The original story is by F. Scott Fitzgerald.Some background: After Norma Shearer retired, she wanted Tyrone Power to film "The Last Tycoon," which she planned to produce. Fitzgerald modeled the main character, Monroe Stahr, after Shearer's late husband, Irving Thalberg. The film never happened.Like Hemingway, Fitzgerald is difficult to put on film, though for different reasons. Fitzgerald was a true poet, and his words did everything. There's not much action. Thus is the case in "The Last Tycoon," where nothing happens for what seems like hours.The film sports a fabulous cast of old-timers: Robert Mitchum, Tony Curtis, Jeanne Moreau, Ray Milland, Dana Andrews, and John Carradine; and it introduces us to Theresa Russell, Angelica Huston, and Ingrid Boulting, who now teaches yoga in Ojai California and looks exactly the same as she does in this film. Don't ask me how. Jack Nicholson has a small role, as does everyone except De Niro and Boulting. The rest jump in and out like pop tarts.This is a somewhat fictionalized version of Thalberg's life at MGM. He is involved in a romance with Kathleen Moore (Ingrid Boulting) who seems to be playing mind games with him. She says goodbye when she means hello, tells him that she can't see him again and then shows up, writes him farewell letters five minutes after she sees him, that kind of thing. Cecilia (Theresa Russell), the daughter of the studio head Pat Brady (Mitchum) is madly in love with him, but he doesn't even notice as he's so fixated on Kathleen, who is engaged to someone else but keeps coming around.Brady, modeled on Louis B. Mayer, resents Stahr, as Mayer resented Thalberg, but Brady only says he resents him. We never see him REALLY resent him. No one really does much interacting. Tony Curtis sports a mustache as Rodriguez, a sexually confused leading man who is playing opposite the temperamental Didi (Jeanne Moreau) in a Casablance ripoff that has Moreau in Ingrid Bergman's same hat and coat, and Curtis playing the piano. P.S. Moreau can sing about as well as Ingrid Bergman hummed "As Time Goes By" -- not well. There is a moment of humor when, as the film ends with Moreau saying 'Nor do I,'there is a moment of silence. Then Brady says, "The French actresses are so...compelling." Silence. Stahr says, "'Nor do I. Nor do I.' When has anyone ever said to you, 'nor do I?' The scene has to be completely reshot, it's awful. I want four writers assigned to it tonight." De Niro is perfection as Monroe Stahr, from the way he sits at his desk wearing his horn-rimmed glasses, to his posture. Boulting is exceedingly dull. I never thought Theresa Russell could act her way out of a phone booth, though she had a few decent moments in "Black Widow." Most of the actors are completely wasted. One interesting thing: Viewing this film today, one becomes aware of how un-used we are now seeing older actors sans face lifts, big lips, and botox.All in all, I found this film disappointing. Pinter's script is slow and long, there's no excitement, let alone much story. Elia Kazan was a great director, but there probably wasn't much that he could do."The Last Tycoon" has been lauded by some as an unappreciated masterpiece, but one of the reviewers on IMDb also felt Theresa Russell gave a brilliant performance. I didn't see what some of these enlightened viewers saw, nor have I been haunted by the movie. In fact, I find it easy to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro makes love on screen alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, while watching "The Last Tycoon", I wondered how such a short book could wind up being so long a movie. The first forty minutes are fine- De Niro as Monroe Stahr, matching wits with his fellow producers, summarizing preview screenings with a snap tight judgements, keeping writers in line and then, BOOM! the romance thread begins and the whole thing falls flat. There's a running joke in the film where Stahr's fellow producers keep saying "you're right Stahr; (the film) is twenty minutes too long and just cut that out and it will be a fine picture." Well, the joke's on Speigel and Kazan; "The Last Tycoon" is something like *forty* minutes too long, and I'm not so sure trimming it down would've saved it... De Niro, in 1976 trim and every inch the appearence of Fitzgerald's character, reportedly based on Irving Thalberg, does a fine job making the part read and maintaining the necessary composure and dignity the Stahr role demands. And there are other fine performances as well, especially from the veterans in the cast and then-newcomer Theresa Russell as Cecelia Brady, in the book the first-person narrator of the story. But hers is cut to a small, pop-in and pop-out role, and it appears that Pinter in his adaptation has retained little to nothing of Fitzgerald's novel. While "The Last Tycoon" has a strong start, as the film progresses you get a sense that there isn't going to be a payoff for watching all the down time in the love scenes, and as Fitzgerald didn't finish his story, the movie likewise dissipates without resolution. But Fitzgerald did leave a clear enough indication as to where he expected it to go, and some ending could've been contrived, that is, if Pinter had cared to follow his source a little more closely. Ingrid Boulting makes one of her two filmed performances in this film, and though she looks great, she depends far too much on direction and interaction with other actors, particularly De Niro, to carry her through her scenes. What should read as icy mystery comes off as inept vapidity. I wonder if De Niro felt as though he was doing the love scenes by himself? This film is a good example how a good cast, respected director, and an inventive producer as Spiegel certainly was can take on a good property and produce an almost unwatchable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mix of stars past and present</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Tycoon revolves around a 1930s movie mogul Monroe Stahr (Robert De Niro) and gives an insight into the studio system of the time. De Niro gives a subtle and sensitive performance as Stahr who becomes distracted following a chance sighting which reminds him of a love from his past. The ensuing budding romance is accompanied by a haunting Maurice Jarre score and beautiful cinematography. At times, though, this part of the film feels drawn out and not enough time is given to the star-studded supporting cast - especially Jack Nicholson, who has great scenes at the end of the film with De Niro. There are plenty of familiar faces, including Robert Mitchum, Tony Curtis, Ray Milland, Dana Andrews and Anjelica Huston, who mainly appear in cameo roles. The film as a whole is richly detailed and absorbing and is a compelling portrait of Stahr's work and love - a love invoked from the past that gradually unravels his grip on the present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kazan's only embarrassment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is best forgotten.I doubt if there is anyone who is a greater fan of Kazan than I, and it pains me to write this, but this film is simply horrible. I don't blame just Kazan; the story and characters are illogical and very boring. The sub-plot of Curtis, Andrews and Moreau adds nothing, in fact, is a negative. The point of DeNiro's role is never made. The important theme evident in Kazan's films (Pinky, Gentleman's Agreement, Waterfront, Panic in the Streets, etc.) is completely missing in this film. The greatest fault lies with Fitzgerald, one of most overrated American authors and with Pinter, also overrated. These two, loved by critics, have given this film a halo. If the screenplay was written by John Smith based on a book by Fred Jones, the movie would be rated 2 stars out of ten, if the raters were generous.DeNiro and Russel are good (Although Russel's character is very annoying.) and Nicholson is Nicholson. The rest of the cast is mediocre. Boulting is not good at all, and in fact, she never went anywhere in her career after this film.Kazan didn't do a bad job, considering with what he was given to work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elia Kazan's Last Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Tycoon is a dramatic film based on Harold Pinter's screenplay adaptation of F.Scott Fitzgerald's last and unfinished novel of the same title. It stars Robert De Niro together with Tony Curtis, Robert Mitchum, Jack Nicholson, Donald Pleasence, Jeanne Moreau, Theresa Russell and Ingrid Boulting.This was the last film of Elia Kazan,a popular film director during the 50's after more than a 42-year career.The movie revolves around the story of Monroe Stahr,a young production chief of one of the biggest studios during the Golden Age Of Hollywood during the 1930's.As he grows ambitious and lusts for more power,he works harder than ever.In addition to that,he also becomes obsessed with a young woman who is engaged to be married in Kathleen Moore and another woman,Cecilia Brady, the young daughter of a studio board member, tries in vain to make Monroe see how she truly feels.Things even become more complicated when Monroe's health goes on a decline due to hard work and the limited rest that he is getting.This film was based on the late MGM Chairman Irving Thalberg,who is known as the Golden Boy of movie production during the 1930's. Robert De Niro's looks and slender figure provides realism as it is similar to the said MGM chairman.Also,the performances of the cast were great especially De Niro,who is able to carry the movie from beginning to end.Too bad that the movie somewhat lacked spontaneity due to probably Kazan's old directorial methods.But nevertheless, it is still a nice film to watch despite the fact that it could probably be dated by today's standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Is the Antonym of Synergy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F. Scott Fitzgerald's time in Hollywood inspired him to write "The Last Tycoon", his final novel. Fitzgerald had a tendency to model his heroes on men he admired and then infuse them with a lot of himself. In this case he choose Irving Thalberg, who for a brief period in the late 20's and 30's was the "boy genius" production chief at M-G-M, until his death at the age of 37 in 1936. Thalberg was second to none in his instinctive feel for what would make a successful film but he only provided the bones for Fitzgerald's protagonist, the author fleshed the character out with little or no attempt to incorporate Thalberg's personality or private life. Instead Fitzgerald opted for Abraham Lincoln as the model for much of what was Monroe Stahr - including his novel's title, as Lincoln was frequently referred to by contemporary media as "The Tycoon" and like Stahr was fighting a war on many fronts.As a film, the "The Last Tycoon" (1976) is far less than the sum of its generally excellent parts, which could also be said of its unfinished source novel. It is full of structural discord that many viewers will find quite frustrating. A relatively large budget, excellent production design, fine performances by a cast nicely matched to the characters they play, clever editing, and first-class cinematography. Then throw in a screenplay that is true to its unfinished source novel. Yet instead of box office and critical success you get one of the more expensive flops in movie history. But you also get a very ambitious film that is about as interesting as any you will find, with a cutting edge story that is no less powerful for its extremely small target audience; all nicely matched by the ambitious, paternalistically cast, and expensive film-within-a-film that the title character is pushing though despite it being an obvious money-loser for the studio.The adaptation's trouble lies almost solely with the film's love interest, Kathleen Moore, played by Ingrid Boulting. Kathleen is all Fitzgerald, an Irish will-of-the-wisp given to irresponsible self-indulgences and beguiling frankness. Woman such as Kathleen were central to Fitzgerald's world view, he believed that they inspired and tortured any man cerebral and imaginative enough to appreciate them. While such a relationship can be translated to the screen (often easier than in a book because film is a visual medium), it will only connect with a small segment of viewers, most others will find it puzzling.The most interesting detail of the entire production is the way Boulting is costumed, lit, and filmed in her scenes. She glows in these shots because Kathleen is even more of an ethereal character than Gatsby's "Daisy", Monroe sees her as extremely delicate and light in a way that seems too perfect for his world. She is elusive to him, almost translucent, which only makes her all the more precious. Three years later this concept would be carried to its extreme in "All That Jazz" with Jessica Lange's "Angelique" who literally had no physical substance. The point from a "language of film" perspective is that a filmmaker presents a character in this manner to immediately clue viewers into that character representing an all-consuming motivational force that will drive the hero throughout the story - often to doom.Kathleen makes her entrance in one of the best scenes in cinema history; with the post-earthquake chaos of the flooding studio lot looking like 'thirty acres of fairyland' at night, a radiant mystery woman climbs down from a gigantic floating head (fabricated to be used by the studio as a prop the following week) and smiles at Monroe Stahr, the last of the great Hollywood princes.To its credit, the screenplay is true to Fitzgerald's vision and Boulting and DeNiro effectively bring their relationship dynamic to the big screen. But potential viewers should understand that their often nonverbal relationship is the core element of the entire film, the rest of the story is simply a backdrop. Fitzgerald struggled with "The Last Tycoon" because he was in effect writing two books in one: a "psychological" novel about Stahr and a social commentary about Hollywood. Harold Pinter's difficulties with the screenplay stemmed from the same issue Fitzgerald had been unable to resolve, just where to strike the balance between the two stories.The emphasize on Stahr means that the excellent supporting cast, from Tony Curtis as a troubled movie star to Robert Mitchum as a cynical studio head to Donald Pleasence as a perplexed English writer, do not get any substantial screen time; but are relegated to insubstantial supporting parts in the service of giving DeNiro the room to showcase his character's roller coaster of elation and sadness. The only exception is Teresa Russell's Cecilia (the story's Nick Carraway) whose sense of right and wrong helps to elevate her above the others.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Lost Tycoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fitzgerald died while working on "The Love of the Last Tycoon". It was finished by Edmund Wilson, who took a disjointed series of chapters and paragraphs and a lot of notes and make a coherent novel out of it: "The Last Tycoon." Thus, the script of this film does not have a canonical story to adapt. With this leeway, a lot more could have been done. This film is betrayed by an incoherent script and uneven direction. The movie can be as slow as molasses pouring out in the Alaskan winter or so fast that major events whirl past the viewer. I saw it when it was first released and I left the theater feeling as if I had been cheated.The performances are not the problem. Some performances are great. Theresa Russell is uncanny as a bright college student. DeNiro and Nicholson shine, and Angelica Huston is intriguing in a small role. The problem is that many scenes play out-or peter out-to nothing. No point is made, the story is not advanced. For example, there is a famous Hollywood story of an underling who suffered a heart attack in an executive screening room, and rather than call for help, he remained silent so as to not disturb his bosses. He died. In this movie, he is discovered dead. No point is made. Later, like Teresa Russell, we wait with high expectations to hear the exchange between DeNiro and Nicholson vis-a-vis a writers strike. The gist of their conflict is never even touched on and the scene ends in a silly way.The basic plot is that the tycoon is brought down by his love for a NO NO YES MAYBE NO MAYBE GOODBYE woman. She is meant to be a mysterious cauldron of seething conflicting emotions. Instead, this character comes across as rather a fool who believes anything a man tells her, as long as the man is not DeNiro. Thus, he is not a tragic hero, destroyed by love, but rather a bewildered jerk. There is great stuff here. DeNiro instructing a British writer on the techniques of movie making. Teresa Russell in all her scenes and a satiric take on romantic movies with Tony Curtis and Jeanne Moreau. However, ultimately, there is great potential which goes unfulfilled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Elia Kazan, although by the 70's he'd pretty much had it. In the same year as TAXI DRIVER, Mr. DeNiro gave another career-launching performance in this F. Scott Fitzgerald story which doesn't play out on the screen that well. All of this work is tough to adapt to the cinema. Theresa Russell (in her first role) is young and delightful. Tony Curtis is marvelous as a paranoid movie star and Jeanne Moreau is starting to slide. Robert Mitchum, Dana Andrews, and Donald Pleasance play established Hollywood types.An valiant attempt at Fitzgerald, but comes up short (with no blame put on DeNiro). At least films like this were attempted in the 70's, unlike the dreaded '80's where junk prevailed for years. Seeing this may prod you into reading the novel (his last/unfinished work).

		<fullReview>Wow. I don't know if I've ever been as disappointed with a film as I was with this one. Maybe it was a bad idea for Hollywood to try and finish something Fitzgerald did not, but I'll leave that to the literary buffs. Fitzgerald aside, what is presented in The Last Tycoon is what I consider to be a brilliant portrayal of Irving Thalberg by Robert De Niro. I've always thought, based on what I've read about Thalberg and the Studio System of the 30s/40s, that he was a remarkable and fascinating individual. I had a picture painted in my mind as to how I thought Thalberg "looked", acted, and generally carried himself as he patrolled the MGM lots. In my opinion, De Niro nailed it. He played him EXACTLY as I had pictured him. From this perspective, I was enthralled by the film for about a half hour. Then, I guess the Fitzgerald element had to come in. Stahr, De Niro's character, becomes obsessed with a girl he sees on the lot that sort of kind of reminds him of someone he may or may not have had some sort of relationship with, it's not really clear. It doesn't matter anyway, because the story REEKS. As a self proclaimed film buff, I hate to express myself so simple mindedly, but there it is.I'm not going to dwell on the stench of the love story of this film. It's bad, and badly done. It's one of those films (The original Getaway is another) where I sit there watching particular scenes and wonder what the hell was going through the screenwriter's mind when he wrote it. Particularly the entire character of Cecilia, played by Jeanne Moreau. I just can't help but lament over what could have been. Irving Thalberg was a fascinating individual and there are countless stories that could be written about him for the silver screen. Why did they have to take this route? They had the dollars in production to recreate the Hollywood of the 30s, a couple of screen legends (Curtis and Mitchum) and most importantly, Thalberg reincarnated in De Niro. And they flat out blew it.It's just too bad Thalberg wasn't around to screen this before it was released.</fullReview>

Well watch this and you will see a perfect example of how not to make a film.As hard as the actors work, they could never overcome such an achingly dull and banal script. Add to that Kazan's flat and uninspiring, pedestrian direction and a dreadful score from Maurice Jarre you have possibly one of the worst "quality" movies I have ever watched.I just had to ask the question "why", and I think you can perhaps argue that Kazan hadn't really done much since the early sixties, and the movie business had changed. The New Hollwood of Coppola, Scorcese, Polanski, Spielberg et al was making inroads; Movies like Chinatown, The Godfather, Taxi Driver and Jaws were taking movie making in a new direction. The story, script, direction and soundtrack of The Last Tychoon were old Hollywood.Definitely one to miss. Even though, as I read somewhere, this is a mess of a movie with a classic struggling to get out, it really isn't worth investing the time to find out where that classic has gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A faint impression of a fine novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Tycoon", as an unfinished novel, offers more legitimate room for remodelling on screen than most literary classics. But one can't feel that adaptor Harold Pinter and director Kazan did their best with the mass of material, some of it sketchy, that Scott Fitzgerald bequeathed.Pinter may have seemed suitable to sculpt the rat-tat-tat exchanges of the largely Jewish studio chiefs, having made his name dramatising the similarly menacing wisecracks of East End Jews. Pinter copes, but his recurrent failure as a screenwriter- failing to get pace and contrast of moods right- means that the film unfolds on one soporific plane, with no tragic impetus, as if six inches under water. Pinter is no more adept than Fitzgerald in deciding whether to make Cecilia's narration the spectator's mediator; Theresa Russell, too hard and knowing for a Bennington junior, comes and goes. In a long central sequence of Stahr's wooing of Kathleen, we forget Cecilia altogether.Kazan's catastrophic lack of period sensibility can only be explained by supposing that he subconsciously relived his own time in the Hollywood sun, the 1940s, instead of the early 1930s of the novel. The monochrome film within a film is a noir product, obviously a skit on "Casablanca"; it looks (lots of pans, deep focus) and sounds (continuous syrupy music) out of its time. Early talkies were often silent between speeches, and the camera moved little in "King Mike"'s heyday. Besides which, it's irritatingly unclear whether Jeanne Moreau- as maladroit as most French actresses visiting Hollywood- and Tony Curtis are supposed to be lousy actors or not. Since this is the only example we see of Stahr's magic touch, it's a worry.One turns with relief to Mitchum's gruff competence in the small part of the villainous Pat Brady, Pleasence's able cameo as the snobbish English novelist who despairs of learning to write movies (though in the book he responds to Stahr's tutelage) and above all to De Niro. I say this as no admirer of today's most overblown acting reputation, but for once he is dead right: a strutting little bantam whom you can believe has older and bigger men scared, envious and vengeful. The scene when this celluloid Napoleon yanks Dana Andrews's Red Ridingwood off the direction of a picture in mid-take is superbly crisp. So is his defence of the loss-leader prestige production, though here, as usual, Pinter replaces Fitzgerald's atmospheric and authentic detail with pregnant pauses.Kathleen (Ingrid Boulting) is barely more than a saccharine-flavoured hole in the air, with much of her acting lost in semi-darkness. But the poor thing has little to work with: Fitzgerald's romantic heroines did tend to be ethereal elves or princesses, like the silent movies' child-women."The Last Tycoon" concentrates too much on Stahr as wistful lover, omitting all the key preliminaries on the airliner with Cecilia, Wylie White the cynical writer and Manny Schwartz, the washed-up executive who kills himself at President Andrew Jackson's preserved house because Stahr lost faith in him. This death at the novel's outset balances Stahr's own at the end. Fitzgerald wanted it to occur in a plane crash (fixed by Brady) and possibly be followed by the plundering of Stahr's corpse- as if to expiate his carelessness with other folk's lives when ruthlessly pursuing his picture-making visions.No such closure for this production, which fades into emptiness as Stahr wanders into the dark of a deserted shooting stage, presumably to expire later of his illness. The film needs a more apocalyptic climax- like the fans' riot in John Schlesinger's version of the other great Thirties novel of Hollywood, "The Day of the Locust".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This tycoon's gone broke...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's impossible to describe just how bad THE LAST TYCOON is. Elia Kazan's last film is an empty-headed, snail-paced version of F. Scott Fitzgerald unfinished novel. Working from Harold Pinter's ice-cold, overly wordy screenplay, Kazan's direction is, at best, inert. Robert DeNiro is an Irving Thalberg-like studio wunderkind with women troubles. In a role screaming for the likes of Catherine Deneuve or Isabelle Adjani, Kazan cast Ingrid Boulting, an actress whose lack of talent is challenged only by her lack of personality. The complete absence of chemistry between DeNiro and Boulting destroys the film. To make matters worse, Kazan cast Jack Nicholson, Robert Mitchum and Ray Milland and has nothing for them to do. The casting of Jeanne Moreau and Tony Curtis as movie stars is borderline camp. They're both way past their prime and look silly. Curtis in particular proves definitively that he can't act. Two bright spots: Theresa Russell as Mitchum's carefree daughter and a brief appearance by John Carridine as a studio guide. Unfortunately, they're not enough to compensate for all that is wrong with THE LAST TYCOON. It's a terrible movie. One is tempted to think that Fitzgerald's unfinished novel should have remained an unmade movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marginal adaptation of Fitzgerald</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not, nor have I ever been, a fan of Scott Fitzgerald's work, either his novels or the adaptations for film. However, The Last Tycoon is about as good as you're going to get it. The story gives us the working and private lives of Monroe Stahr, the boy genius Hollywood producer of the 1930s. The parallels to Irving Thalberg are fairly obvious, and, in fact, Robert DeNiro, in contrast to his preparation for Raging Bull, actually looks as if he lost a significant amount of weight to play the role (the real Thalberg was a slight man and a chronic overworker as well). Despite an all-star cast, it is DeNiro who absolutely carries the picture from beginning to end in a marvelously underplayed performance. Trouble is, he has little support from his fellow players. Tony Curtis in a Clark Gable moustache looks about as washed-up and desperate as he really was in 1976, and Ingrid Boulting as DeNiro's great lost love is painfully dull. The others, Ray Milland, Robert Mitchum, etc. seem interchangeable and without much impact. The only other thing worth watching in it is a late-in-the-film appearance by Jack Nicholson, who is terrific as a writers' union agitator. The scenes with Jack and DeNiro are about the best in the movie. But it is DeNiro's superb performance throughout that saves the film from being another well-costumed Fitzgerald period piece. 2 1/2 ** out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loving Not Wisely But Too Well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stopped reading Fitzgerald's novel about half way through because it was embarrassingly bad, coming as it did after his masterpiece, "The Great Gatsby," and left unedited. The film isn't much of an advance as far as plot is concerned. It's more of a character sketch than a gripping story. A man only loves two things and loses them both.But what a cast and crew! Elia Kazan directs De Niro, Mitchum, Curtis, Moreau, Nicholson, Theresa Russell, Donald Pleasance, Ray Milland, Jeff Corey, Dana Andrews, Angelica Huston, and other familiar presences in a screenplay by Harold Pinter from a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. What a pedigree.De Niro has never been better, not even as an Italian-American hood. He's thrown himself into the role, altering his appearance so that he's hardly recognizable -- pale, very thin, perceptive, sensitive, taciturn, blunt.As the Thalberg figure at MGM, he loves making movies. He's as demanding with himself as he is with everyone else. He has no genuine social life until he falls in love at first sight with Ingrid Boulting. That's the second thing he loves. And after she has a brief fling with him, she ditches him to marry another man. Boulting, alas, isn't much of an actress. She has a fine figure but the overall impression she generates in the viewer is that of some kind of animated, life-sized kewpie doll. The other recognizable names in the cast don't really have much to do, while Boulting has too much screen time.The final scene, after De Niro is fired, is pretty stylized. He repeats an earlier scene, this time speaking directly to the camera, and the last we see of him is when his figure disappears into the vast, black maw of an empty sound stage. The real Thalberg died of a heart ailment while still in his thirties. Sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "The last tycoon" is not one of Kazan's best movies, it is well worth seeing, if nothing else, for the all around great performances of a great cast, including a young Robert de Niro, and a nicely aging Jeanne Moreau.The story, as the title suggests, deals with a Holywood movie producer of the 30ths with a huge ego, the kind of people who knows everything best. When he is confronted with the rejection of a young starlet and the challenge of a union organizer, he eventually loses everything as he cannot comprehend that some people would not bow to everything he wants.It is extremely well directed by Elia Kazan and the period is superbly recreated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scott Fitzgerald loses out while De Niro triumphs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F. Scott Fitzgerald has not been served well by the movies. Despite it faults Jack Claytons' "Great Gatsby" certainly had moments where one felt that justice was being done to the author. Harold Pinter, with his legendary plays and respectable screenplay resume may have seemed an interesting choice as screenplay writer, but he seems to have not really connected with the spirit of Fitzgerald in the way he succeeded with the British novelists whose works he adapted for the screen, (John Fowles, L.P. Hartley, Penelope Mortimer).On paper it looks tremendously promising with a wealth of reputable talent in the form of Kazan, Pinter, De Niro, Nicholson, Moreau, Curtis, and Mitchum. Yet the end result is a remarkably forgettable movie. The blame would seem to rest with Pinter's screenplay. There are a couple of good scenes here and there, but there is an overall ambling, directionless feel to the entire work, which has a dulling effect on the viewer.Kazan who in his time has elicited a number of legendary screen performances, expectedly does well with his top notch cast. Robert Mitchum turns in a terrific performance in a small role while Nicholson as always delivers the goods, but Jeanne Moreau in particular, seems greatly out of place and her scenes with Tony Curtis, (an odd coupling indeed) are wasted. Theresa Russell in her debut role is superb, (in retrospect one may have expected greater things from her). But the script simply bogs down these players.The casting of an unknown in a central role can be dicey. Ingrid Boulting manages well; her anonymity adding much to the role which in itself is enigmatic in that little is known about her, or indeed her past.Robert de Niro in the wake of "Godfather",. "Taxi Driver" and "1900" was simply at his peak and nothing, not even this uneven script, could get in his way. He turns in a brilliant performance. The multi faceted character which is Monroe Stahr, is completely in his grasp. He is smart, tough, while vulnerable and enigmatic in a particularly Fitzgerald vein. It's a virtuoso turn, up there with De Nero's finest work. It's the one redeeming feature of "The Last Tycoon" and possibly the only justifiable reasons for making a effort to see the movie.Ultimately a great disappointment in yet another failed effort in a Scott Fitzgerald screen adaptation, but fans of De Niro will get their satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie's absurd rating of 6 stars proves the golden cow of Hollywood is still worshiped at the IMDB. When Hollywood takes itself seriously, I think of this movie. It is in fact, the worst movie ever made. Imagine putting the finest ingredients into a recipe only to find that even maggots find it nauseating. They had Elia Kazan, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Harold Pinter, Robert De Niro, and Jack Nicholson and they did nothing. This story is not only void of a protagonist, a pulse, or direction; it's also painful to watch. It is undoubtedly Hollywood's greatest waste of talent. I heard KGB interrogators used this movie to extract information. I'll talk! I'll talk! Just stop the movie!Stop it please!

Every character has a great actor that fits their role perfectly... Robert Mitchum plays a non-typecast role as a studio executive, Jack Nicholson's short butsweet performance is stunning, and all the female roles hit you with grace.While this film looks GREAT production and cinematography-wise, it's thesubdued acting that gets me here. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*The Last Tycoon*Before I watched this movie I had never heard of it. I had no idea who was in it, who directed it, or if it won any awards. What first drew me into watching it was I saw Robert De Niro was in it. He's my second favorite actor (second only to Brando). And my cable system gave it 3.5/4 stars. So I figured what the heck, why not. At first it seemed kind of dull and dragged on. But than it becomes quite interesting, there is a little mystery in the romance. There are a few things that don't add up though.The acting in this movie is good. De Niro didn't give his best performance, but I never really think of him as a romantic. It had an all star cast and seeing the familiar faces that kept popping up was fun. Tony Curtis received second billing, though he didn't have many scenes. I'm told Anjelica Huston was in it... who did she play? I didn't catch her. When Jack Nicholson made a brief cameo I was taken by surprise. He's my third favorite actor! It did come rather late in the movie though.The romance in it was... different. Who does Robert De Niro end up with? Why did Kathleen lie so much? Did De Niro realize Cecilia liked him? Did Cecilia really like him? I don't know the answers to these questions. I've never read the book.When the credits rolled I noticed who directed it. Elia Kazan! One of my favorite directors. He made great films like On the Waterfront and Streetcar Named Desire. Without him I doubt we would have Brando! I suppose he does a good job of directing. I loved the scene where Robert De Niro explains why people watch movies was fabulous. All in all this movie could have been shorter, but it's still decent.*7/10*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The few comments I've read here about the movie seem to refer quite a bit to Fitzgerald's book. I happen to believe that a movie should be judged on its own merits. The Last Tycoon, then, is probably one of those many movies that pales in comparison to the book. Nonetheless, this movie is an excellent work. De Niro is excellent as Monroe Stahr, the reclusive studio head who concerns himself more with the quality of a film rather than the revenue it would generate, an aspect that ultimately leads to his demise. Movies are a passion of his, soon superseded by an interest in a woman (Moore) who reminds him of a lost love. Ultimately, Stahr loses everything, his career and Moore, shattering his dreams of happiness with a disheartening realism.This is the only Kazan movie I've ever seen, breaking a vow that I would never see one of his films after learning about his aggressively anti-communist (anti-freedom) history. Kazan does a wonderful job of directing, however, helped not in the least by an extremely talented cast (particularly noteworthy is De Niro's performance in his early Taxi Driver Raging Bull acting days). The woman who plays Moore could've done a better job, having this elusive, ethereal beauty at some points in the film, then an annoying vapidness in other parts. The movie portrays love and ambition in a humanizing light, without the gut wrenching sentimentality of many movies of this genre. Particularly wonderful was Stahr's acting of a certain scene twice (one to motivate a screenwriter named Boxley, and the other in the end of the film, a desperate coming to terms of a love lost twice). Also beautiful was the role movies played in Stahr's life; in one sense he vicariously experiences love in the films (and loses his love in the above-mentioned scene he acts out), and in another sense, movies mark the rise and fall of his power, as he fades into a dark, empty movie lot in the end.Wonderful film... don't read the book, it'll only ruin it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Mistake ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... was in attempting to film this great unfinished novel in the first place, the second was employing an English writer and the third was casting Robert de Niro in the lead. DeNiro's definition of 'Acting' is to shout at the top of his voice and behave like a sociopath. Unfortunately lots of people - some of them influential - who should know better have applauded this and encouraged him to continue. Monroe Stahr is diametrically opposite DeNiro, a thoughtful, quiet intellectual light years away from DeNiro's wise guy whose solution to problems on the studio floor would be to kick the director to death and throw acid into the faces of the actors. Even Gadg can't do anything with this so he elected to shoot it as though everyone were under water wading through molasses. Virtually no one relates to anyone else least of all Stahr and Kathleen. Scott must be turning in his grave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible film. We get two hours of droning conversations about how evil the big Hollywood studios are and how gallant the communist writer's unions are. And I don't use the term communists as a jab, because in this film the screenwriter's union leader, played by Jack Nicholson, is a proud "open" communist (who probably makes a lot of money) and he gets to punch the evil tycoon, played by DeNiro, in the face and then say "I always wanted to hit ten million dollars." Hurray for the little guy! Oh silly Hollywood, you always choose your champions and it's just amazing that this kind of drivel gets green-lighted. And it's such a shame that the only time we get two legends, DeNiro and Nicholson on screen together, it's for a propaganda film that only shows one side of the coin clearly. Which is the only side Hollywood likes to show, and when it shows, it glistens. This movie was a waste of time. It was horrible. I never read the novel and I don't even want to. Sam Speigel produced it and Sam, so I've read, was liken to a tycoon; Kazan directed it and didn't he "rat" on actors who were interested in communism, or who were accused of attending meetings? Maybe there's some guilt going on; two big-wigs "giving a little back to the working class", so to speak. Oh just avoid this hog-wash of a film. And the saddest part is, DeNiro sleepwalks through the role. He's boring, uninteresting, and in my opinion much too young looking for the part. Horrible. Horrible.</fullReview>
