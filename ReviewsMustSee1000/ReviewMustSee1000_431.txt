		<shortDescription>Simply a fantastic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics, nit-pickers and historical pedants who've trashed this superb piece of truly cinematic movie-making have totally missed the point.So what if Johnny Depp's English accent isn't exactly "right" for his character? (English accents have always been problematic for all but the most skilled of American actors: Depp pulls it off entirely passably, way way better than - say - Keanu Reeves, risible in Coppola's Dracula. Think of Kevin Costner, who didn't even bother trying in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.) I'm a Londoner by birth, and for me the accent in no way detracted from Depp's excellent performance.As for history, again, who cares if the filmmakers have employed a degree of dramatic licence? This is a movie, not a documentary. Nobody knows for sure who Jack the Ripper was, and in order to make the film interesting and enjoyable the writers have speculated a little. Fine by me.OK, so Heather Graham was impossibly glamorous, but movies with big budgets need a little bit of star appeal. The notion of the "tart with a heart" is a cliché, sure, but nevertheless her character works in the context of the film. (Contrast the depiction of prostitution generally in this film with the utter garbage that is Pretty Woman.)What's so great about this film? The quirky, literate script; the performances (all, with the possible exception of Graham, excellent); the wonderful photography and production design; the depiction of the murders themselves - elliptical, shocking, mesmerising; and above all the aura of brooding menace, gloom, cruelty, darkness, melancholy and downright despair running through it as deeply as the veins through a block of marble. This is marvellously thoughtful, evocative film-making, very bold and brave. No happy Hollywood ending, no phoney saccharine or cheap laughs to satisfy the popcorn brigade. This is a proper grown-ups movie that probes some of the darkest regions of the human psyche, places mainstream filmmakers like Lucas, Spielberg, James Cameron and their ilk don't dare to go, or couldn't go even if they wanted to. To me it appeals almost on a subconscious level, forcing us to confront our deepest fears and taboos - death, pain, suffering, human wickedness. I can't think of a recent major release that is so relentlessly downbeat.Don't let the detractors put you off. It's hardly surprising a generation weened on MTV - folk with the the attention span of a gnat and the emotional depth of a paper cup - didn't like it. They've got their Screams and their Scary Movies, and they're welcome to them. This is super stuff, and the Hughes brothers and their collaborators should be heartily congratulated for it.A classic, not so much for the plot, which is a little contrived, but for its sure command of cinema as a visual storytelling medium.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychotropic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many things in media that have nearly insurmountable preconceptions that lead to generic truisms. One of these is 'comic books are pure fluff,' and another is 'no good movie is ever based on a comic book'. From Hell is a project that takes both of those truisms and tosses them completely out the window. Based on an ambitious graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Eddie Campbell, From Hell (named for the signature on the Jack the Ripper letters written to the police), is one man's carefully researched theory into the eternal mystery surrounding the Whitechapel murders of 1888. This is not a factual display of guilt or innocence, as many of the answers behind these crimes will never be known, but as theory mixed with fact, it creates with chilling detail the mood of lower-class London in the late nineteenth century, where life was cheap, bloody and oftentimes short.The Hughes brothers, noted for their stylish direction, do a very good job of creating the mood here, involving all the grunginess and hopelessness of the streets, and combining the more mystical elements of Moore's story into the crime tale. Johnny Depp is Inspector Abberline - an opium-smoking criminal investigator that often follows up on hunches he receives during moments of hallucinatory revelation.The style of the film - dripping with violent murder of prostitutes in alleyways - leaves more to the imagination than it reveals, although the gore level is by no means light. The vicious throat-slashes and bloody crime scenes are definitely grotesque, but most of the time we are shown the crime after the fact, letting the viewer decide how horrible the murder itself was. All the performances are strong, fitting together into an ensemble piece, with Depp being as much a chameleon as ever as Abberline, and Robbie Coltrane equally strong as his colleague Godfrey. Ian Holm, Heather Graham, and Ian Richardson also provide good supporting roles. For an historical perspective of the Jack the Ripper crimes, best to watch an A&amp;E documentary. But for a theoretical description of the crimes, and an artful depiction of a carefully constructed tale, definitely check out the very chilling, very calculated, and very good From Hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkly stylish--not based on reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about an enduring mystery is that people can feel free to take all sorts of liberties with the facts and create interesting "what if" scenarios. FROM HELL is a perfect example. For the record, the theory behind the killings is pretty much right out of JACK THE RIPPER: THE FINAL SOLUTION by Stephen Knight, and it's been pretty well discredited since it first came out twenty years ago, even though it makes a hell of an entertaining piece of fiction.I completely discount any criticisms of the movie where people say "it didn't happen that way". Of course it didn't; that's why this is a fictional film and not a documentary. It's very loosely based on the Alan Moore graphic novel, and about all it retains of it is the Duke of Clarence theory and the stylish look of the architecture. It's enough to make the film beautiful to watch.Yes, I know that four of the five victims of Jack the Ripper were women in their late 40's, which on the streets of Victorian London would mean that they would resemble crones in their late 60's or early 70's. Just try to make that fly past a Hollywood studio boss; the casting at least had women who looked fairly human rather than like fallen glamour girls. I've read a couple of comments disparaging the accents. Actually, Cockney accents were the norm in the street because people tried to blend in and often weren't eager to advertise Scottish or Irish origins. I call special attention to the performance of Jason Flemyng in the role of Netley, the coachman, arguably the most fascinating and believable character in the whole production. Most of his best scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, unfortunately, and yet he still manages to pull the movie together into a cohesive whole just by his presence. (It must have been a heck of a fun role to play!) As well, Sir Ian Holm deserves special mention for stepping in when the original choice for his role, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, tragically became ill and died just before the film went into production. I have never seen Sir Ian in any role that I didn't find completely believable, and that ranges all the way from KING LEAR to his role in ALIEN, for heaven's sake.My interest in the whole Jack the Ripper case has been reawakened thanks to this movie, and I'm trying to hunt down a copy of Alan Moore's graphic novel (which is very difficult to find). No, it's not even close to an approximation of what really happened; nobody will ever know the truth, Patricia Cornwell's arrogant claims notwithstanding. It's still worth renting, if only for the beautifully ominous score and the fascinating transformation of Prague into Victorian London. I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"FROM HELL is a dark, compelling horror film... that will stay in your mind for days after watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always been fascinated by the story of Jack the Ripper, but surprisingly this was my first film based on the story. From Hell is an outstanding mystery and a dark, moody film. This is the type of film that sticks in your mind days after seeing it. You'll have the image of old Whitechaple in your head. You'll have the terrific murder scenes stuck in your head, but most of all you'll have the image of Jack the Ripper in your head. From Hell will disturb you. It might scare you, and it might even bore you (action fans will not enjoy this film). From Hell is certainly not for everyone, but it certainly was for me.Johnny Depp is fantastic. He is one of my favorite actors, and certainly delivers the goods in From Hell. His performance is perfect, and one of his bests yet. Heather Graham also does a fine job in From Hell. I was surprised with her performance. I'll admit, when I heard she was going to be in the film, I was worried. I mean who doesn't get worried when they find out the same actress who was in Austin Powers 2 is going to be in a Jack the Ripper film. But she did surprise me, although I still think she could have done better.The Hughes brothers direct this film with such style. The use of colors in the film is beautiful, as is the use of lighting. The camera angles are crazy, and the film turns out a beauty. Trevor Jones' score is great (As a matter of fact, I'm listening to it now), and fits the film perfectly. The music is eerie, creepy, and scary. It's flawless.The murder mystery is also great. It keeps you guessing the whole way through (I was not successful in guessing who Jack was), and when the killer is revealed, it all makes sense. And let me tell you, From Hell is violent! Although not as gory as I expected it to be, it'll still make you cringe (that throat slash!). A lot of the violence takes place off screen, which lets your imagination run wild, and mine did just that(My head was filled with tons of gory images).A lot of people call From Hell boring. I can see how they think that, but I disagree completely with that. Sure the film is slow moving, but how fast can a murder mystery movie be? I didn't get bored with the film at all... I was completely absorbed in the film. Another problem people found with this film was the love story, which I have to agree with. Had the love story been more developed, the ending would have been much more depressing, as we would have felt for the characters more (This could be what kept the film from an A+ rating).As I said before From Hell is great. It is my 3rd favorite film of the year, and my second favorite horror film (this year). It's a dark, compelling film, that is NOT FUN! There is no comic relief, it's all horror. Had it been a little more scary, and had the love story been more developed this film would be an A+. I highly recommend fans stay away, because you'll hate it.this film to fans of Jack the Ripper, and horror fans with patience. ActionFrom Hell: 9.5/10, A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting spin on the tale, if not particularly memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Hell" is an interesting spin on the familiar Jack the Ripper tale, using the iconic cultural image of the cloaked man with the top hat as the source for a spin-off not of history, but of a graphic novel.The lead performance by Johnny Depp as Inspector Abberline (who really existed in 1888 at the time of the murders and really was an authority on the case) is wonderful. Depp nails the cockney accent perfectly. Unfortunately, Heather Graham -- as the prostitute Mary Kelley -- is not as fortunate. Although her accent seems to improve throughout the film at various intervals, for most of "From Hell's" duration her British voice is quite stiff and the American twang is audible. The Hughes Brothers did not choose Graham for her acting abilities.That said, the set design on this production is magnificent. 1880s London is brought to life and Whitechapel has never looked more realistic. The film is an odd hybrid of genres because it maintains the look and feel of a slasher film whilst presenting historical elements and painstaking recreations of actual murders. Robbie Coltrane, as one of the police officers involved in the case, has a lot of fun with his character and is fun to watch, and similarly as convincing as the scenery.This is a very gritty and gory film -- more so than I ever expected. It's quite a strange beast with hallucinogenic visuals, horror elements and history thrown in for good measure, on top of some slightly modernized techniques. All in all this film kept me entertained because it was unique, and very different, and not particularly because it was "great." I didn't expect a whole lot, but I felt that the movie was directed as ably as it could (or should) have been and the performance by Johnny Depp was deserving of a better film. The ending got a bit carried away, but it still presents a pretty cool twist on the whole Jack the Ripper scenario without totally insulting the intelligence or even upsetting one's sense of history. (Like Disney's "Pocahontas.") The respect the filmmakers have for their material shines through and elevates this above what it could have been. Definitely worth seeing, if only for its originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish film, but has little to offer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dark and meticulous tale, based around the murders of Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel, London. The films look is no more than what you would expect from a one based on Jack the Ripper. Dark shadows loom over the characters as the satanic nature of The Ripper is emphasised. It's such an intriguing story and character that every time I watch a film based on this story I come away slightly disappointed. This time was no exception. While the acting was good (minus some quite unconvincing cockney accents - Heather Graham and Johnny Depp, I'm talking to you) and the direction assured, the script seemed a little reserved. There was no great insight into any of the characters, and much of it played out like a simple murder mystery. But this didn't stop me from enjoying the 120 or so minutes. Why did I enjoy this film, I hear you ask? For a start, the direction was superb - the streets of London looked grimy, while the `unfortunates' (i.e., prostitutes) wandered around in squalor awaiting their fate. This produced a wonderful atmosphere, creating murder scenes that were much more terrifying and shocking (and very gruesome). Johnny Depp's performance (as the detective Abberline), as always, was hugely enjoyable to watch. He played his character in a very subtle way - halfway between comic and serious. He portrays a desperate man, constantly resorting to drugs so he can pass through the day. Depp and the filmmakers see him as a version of Sherlock Holmes, constantly finding clues that other police officers have overlooked (cliched, yes, but somehow Depp provides a little bit of originality). Abberline even suggests that the killer must be a learned man! How could this be?! While dismissed by all the other characters in the film (for a learned man would never commit acts of such debauchery), we as an audience know better not to trust a detective like this - their preposterous ideas are usually right. Another actor to praise in this is the wonderful Ian Holm. He plays his character with a wry little smile, seemingly enjoying every line he says. His interactions with Depp are great to watch.While the film provides little to ponder on once the credits have rolled, you can leave satisfied that you have seen a stylish and enjoyable film. The Hughes brothers seem to be a talented pair of directors.For those that care I gave this film 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly effective Gothic horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much from this movie. The critics passed it over rather quickly, saying a few kind words but without a strong recommendation. The couple of people I knew who saw this said that it was "good," but never cared to say much more than that and have never brought it up again. As I sat down to watch it, I thought it looked nice but moved too fast, was a little dumb. But by the end, I was astounded. I think it's one of the best films of 2001. Sure, it's a triumph of style over substance, but I think we need a couple of good films like this every year. I love style.I would compare From Hell most closely to Alex Proyas' 1997 triumph Dark City, which, like From Hell, made almost nothing at the box office. I hope, like Dark City, that From Hell will win a larger audience on video. It's not as intelligent as Dark City, which was brilliant in nearly every way, but From Hell equals it in visual virtuosity. Its story, while sometimes lapsing into silliness, is enormously gripping. It's also one of the few horror films to succeed at inducing a sense of dread in the audience. A Scotland Yard detective (played well by Johnny Depp) is on the case of Jack the Ripper, who is himself on the trail of a group of five prostitutes. On the way, Depp discovers that the ritualistic murders are part of a larger conspiracy. The film is full of great twists, the biggest one being simply hilarious in its level of audacity. The end is quite unpredictable (although the climax is a little too predictable).There are several minor flaws in the film. It does go a bit too fast, but its breathless pace ends up paying off well in the end. Many people will be turned off at the level of gore in the film. Seriously, avoid it at all costs if you have a weak stomach. But if you could take it in Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, or Sleepy Hollow, you'll be fine. I actually felt that those three particular films flaunted their gore and were tremendously ineffective in their horror. Yes, even (and perhaps especially) Silence of the Lambs. I don't know why, but I didn't feel that way about From Hell. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack the Ripper is the ostensible subject of Albert and Allen Hughes' From Hell, but this legendary figure is more a point of departure, an obviously sensational hook, than the film's focus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>30 Second Bottom Line: The infamous Jack the Ripper serial killer mystery unfolds in Victorian England as a stylistic who dun it.From Hell is an exciting murder mystery with a number of hints about who dun it to keep things interesting every step of the way. Depp gives his expected, outstanding and other worldly performance. Ian Holm, Katrin Cartlidge, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Richardson and some of the unnamed prostitutes give the film an edge that takes us back a century in time. Heather Graham is OK and I'm pleased to see her doing something beyond Say it Isn't So and more along the lines of Sidewalks of New York. She is, however, a little too pretty, sophisticated, charming and clean for a street ho. Katrin Cartlidge would have been a better Mary. It's a little bit of a stretch to envision the Inspector and the whore Mary falling in love, but stranger things have happened.It's always gratifying to see actors, writers and directors grow; and certainly the Hughes Brothers are doing that. They have not made a lot of films but each one is very good. The two could be a Stanley Kubrick in the making, as he only made 13 films during a long, respected and controversial career. Since 1993, they've made Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp. From Hell is more sophisticated while still retaining a dark tone that is not depressing. Peter Deming as cinematographer has outdone himself with From Hell and Mulholland Drive. It's clearly Oscar caliber work.Although From Hell is based on a comprehensive novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, with the focus on a real killer in 1888, the film is not trying to be a JFK and convince us how it really happened. That said, when you realize who the killer is you are faced with an interesting hypothesis.Jack the Ripper may have been crazy, but he was acting out of logic (his own to be sure) and for a reason other than wanting to kill a few prostitutes. The fog in London finally is lifted on the murder mystery and on the Hughes Brothers being great directors.Message on the movie: We can't always have what we want from life. Evil exists. Victorian England was a very unpleasant place and era.So the conclusion is that this movie is a fair movie althouht actually it hadn't got a very clear ending, it is fantastic thriller to watch and remember don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloomy, down beat Victorian thriller that doesn't quite make the kill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Hell" is another Jack-the-Ripper yarn. This time around Johnny Depp plays Inspector Frederick George Abberline, who is investigating the work of a killer carving up the bodies of prostitutes in Whitechapel, London."From Hell" is a borderline horror/thriller. There is a fantastical element to the story as Depp receives visions of the killings, when "chasing the dragon" (or, in simpler terms, when doped up to his eye-balls). These visions are used to make mad-intuitive leaps on Abberline's parts to help push along the story-line, as the bodies begin to pile up. Unfortunately the killer is quite obvious as the script provides "red herrings" which are set up in a manner that you know they're going to be false, so the viewer is "surprised" (or not) when the real killer is revealed. That's a shame as it removes some of the mystery from the movie when you realise you got it right. There's also a rather interesting take on the murderer's reasoning, which is not entirely unwelcome, but does feel somewhat as if they need to pad out the story and distinguish it from other Ripper yarns.Depp is, as usual, good. His accent appears a bit muddled however - where is he supposed to be from? But, as Hollywood standards go, it's better than average. Robbie Coltrane provides the humour (such as there is) by being Abberline's quipping side-kick, making dry observations of the situations he finds himself in. Coltrane has shown his acting skills in the TV series "Cracker" and he doesn't strain himself here, nor does he outshine himself. The rest of the cast are grand but Heather Graham, as the whore whom Depp falls for, is unconvincing as she looks far too pretty, and well mannered, to be a "lady of the night".The direction is alright. The Hughes' brothers manage to convey a generally, downbeat and sombre tone to the proceedings. The vision sequences however come across as slightly comic-booky, a reminder of movies of the 60s/70s where they went overboard on filters and camera distortions in order to depict insanity. Far more effective is the bleak visions used in the TV show "Millennium" - here it tends to detract from the seriousness of the moment. Some of the scenes are fairly gory - it features a quite gruesome throat slashing - while other times the violence is seen purely in the reactions of others, without having to expose the viewer to it. Both of these work well. All in all the Hughes' acquit themselves because they fail to actually show a bright, clear image until the very very end of the movie, where the image is accompanied by one of the darkest in the movie. Thus they effectively capture the mood of the city and the times."From Hell" suffers from having a lack of tension and a script where characters tend to take on almost caricature tones (some of the prostitutes and the Nickel's gang in particular come across as ham-fisted). Nevertheless there's a mood to the movie, and Depp's performance is convincing enough to keep you watching until the decidedly downbeat end. Recommended for fans of the Victorian thriller/horror genre and those seeking a half-decent movie. 6.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moulin Beige</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.For a very long time, it has been a staple of storytelling to ambiguously mix the teller with the characters in the story. One persistent formula is to have a `psychic' character who unknowingly creates the future in his teller role and sees it as prescience in his role as character. Often that character is a drug user and runs into an equally strong opposing creative force based on ritual projection. That opposing force can be religion, the drama of monarchy, or theater. Also normal in the formula is that the sense of his visions becomes entangled with the sensuousness of sex in the person of a temptress.We last saw this formula in the amazing `Moulin Rouge' where the narrator/participant was an absynthe user who drives/creates the story. His visions are opposed by an alliance of aristocracy and theater, and confused by his attraction to a prostitute. That film was a remarkable artistic success because the filmmaker completely understood what he was doing. One could follow him as he related one of the forces at work (sex, aristocratic power, the strength of performance, drugs) to the various ironies and uses of the manner of presentation. Very intelligent, very powerful. In this very month, `Frailty' appeared as a slight variation of the formula.Here we have the same formula, but completely messed up because of the plain dumbness of the filmmakers. In this case, the narrator/explorer is a detective not a writer, reverting to the original mode. As with Rouge, he uses absynthe but here together with opiates (see `Edwin Drood' for a similar opium-smoker from the same era and place). He is played by Johnny Depp who thoroughly understands this storytelling device (see `Ninth Gate').His sex temptress is the prostitute Heather Graham -- being Irish carries extra significance to the formula because the Irish invented this device (see the pooka `Harvey'). Together, they are involved in a struggle with an apparently impossibly force. In Rouge that force was the ritual power of theater backed by aristocracy. Here it is the ritual power of the Masons backed by aristocracy.In Rouge, we had debauched Paris, here it is London, which has the extra patina of Sherlock Holmes. That introduction of the detective (read `Darwinistic explainer') as `inventor' of the world revolutionized this formula and drives perhaps half of all storytelling today.So we have a very well thought out story, with at least one master actor in the most important role. The graphic novel understood what it was about and exploited the formula expertly. But these guys, the Hughes, are completely oblivious to what this is all about and the project collapses into a juvenile, melodramatic jelly. That's too bad, because they are African American. Since Spike Lee is so remarkably outspoken and also so embarrassingly thick and stupid, we really don't need to reinforce the notion that it is impossible for some sectors of the society to deal with even moderately sophisticated material. African-influenced story-telling is the most evolved set of traditions anywhere, which makes this a particular shame.Not only that, but the extras on the DVD include a segment on absynthe which is largely inaccurate.</fullReview>

I wasn't expecting a documentary with a factual plot like some, just a good story and that is what I got. Indeed, you feel like you're in White Chapel, the visuals in this film are so well done. The ending is brilliant! If you're see this film expecting to be entertained, you will be. If you see this film to seek validation of your Ripper theories, you may not like it!

		<fullReview>This film was aired on a French channel a few days ago, in its French dubbed version.I absolutely wanted to watch it. First, because as a fan of the UK and anything related to this country, Jack the Ripper is part of this country's history. Second, because I wanted to watch Johnny Depp's performance.I have watched many reports about Jack the Ripper and based on these TV reports, I can say that the film is fairly true to the reality, at least, what we are told about it.It's like travelling back through the years to this Victorian era and living the life of the most poor people.It's an interesting but also very dark and somewhat shocking film, the kind of films that remains printed in your mind. It's a film that grabs you, that you can't watch lightly. It makes you think, imagine, it also frightens you.Something worth watching anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dateline: 1888, the London, slum of Whitechapel. Harassed by thugs and pimps, streetwalkers Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) and her companions meet daily misery until their friend Ann (Poppy Rogers) whose marriage to a budding artist (Mark Dexter) has rescued her and her daughter from the mean streets is mysteriously kidnapped in broad daylight and prostitutes disappear in a series of gruesome murders. To ferret out the fiend who delights in gore, Police officials summon Inspector Fred Abberline, (Johnny Depp) a brilliant though erratic detective lost in the haze of cocaine addiction hiding from his terrifying psychic ability on one hand and the recent loss of his wife on the other. The film's focus on the infamous Jack the Ripper caper of Victorian times cuts an exciting murder mystery with just the right number of hints to keep the breathless pace compelling at every turn through the twisted back alleys of Whitechapel. Depp gives an other worldly performance entirely appropriate to the subject matter. Ian Holm, Katrin Cartlidge, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Richardson recreate change of century London in a dark though not totally depressing tone. As Abberline becomes immersed in the case, he is aided by a retired physician (Ian Holm) whose hands are no longer steady enough to hold the knife. At the same time, the recently widowed Abberline is falling in love with Mary. To lift the London fog, Abberline frames an interesting hypothesis. His nemesis Jack the Ripper might have been crazy, but still acted logically in his own perverted way to be sure but for purpose larger than killing social undesirables, a handful of expendable prostitutes. But as Abberline breaks through the slippery cordon of roadblocks put in his way, Whitechappel becomes more perilous for Abberline, Mary, and the other girls. Will Satan dance in delight or will Abberline turn back the minions of evil to Hell from whence they came? The Gates of Hell The ripper has overshadowed his competitors for gruesome honor because of his methodical MO: delightfully dissecting his victims with the care worthy of a devoted physician. That the Ripper operated with impunity in the heart of the world's most crowded city of the era and that high police officials ordered destruction of evidence suggests the protection of an highly placed person, the Crown Prince perhaps? Did a wealthy fraternity with influence in the higher levels of power in the police and the ministries of the baroque world empire shield the culprit? Very well shot with stylish backdrops lending a Gothic, creepy touch, From Hell is based on a comprehensive novel by Alan Moore. Directors excelled in attention to period detail and costuming. They may not have been the first to see a royal cabal. But the murders ended when the Crown Prince disappeared from public view into a sanitarium. WHO WERE THE FREEMASONS? Could Lucifer in concert with bedlam have devised a more fiendish plot? The Freemasons have been the villains of many versions of the Ripper Saga. From Hell is extraordinarily candid in portraying supposed Masonic rituals. Yet their role in From Hell is ambivalent. Was a rogue Knight Templar implicated in the Ripper caper? Did the brotherhood punish him for the atrocity itself or for failure in attaining the ultimate goal? The Masons will never say. The Freemasons in the 18th and 19th centuries saw the flowering of their fraternity not only in reactionary Britain but in Republican France, Italy and the United States and even in the Austro-Hungarian Holy Roman Empire. Masons included princes and presidents, police and military officials as well as common tradesmen. Masons were noteworthy figures not only in politics, both democratic and reactionary as well as the arts, sciences and literature. They promoted public education, endowed hospitals and performed acts of charity and benevolence in a time when public and private charity was regarded as fostering excessive growth of a dependent class. As a matter of policy, Masons neither take nor seek credit for their good works nor rebut their critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another (average) filmization of the Jack the Ripper tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the makers of "Menace II Society" comes a stylized tale of terror and conspiracy in 19th century London... I don't think so. It is evident from the cast and the look that a fair amount of money has been gone into this, but visually the movie isn't as good as the money put into it should have achieved. The mood isn't as somber and real as the directors were going for. The Hughes brothers? I don't think so. I smell a bit of affirmative action; perhaps not as much as with Spike Lee, but something's there. These guys are not that talented.Once again Americans are cast to play Brits (or vice versa) and this is a mystery to me. Depp's accent is acceptable but why should the viewer even bother getting used to Depp with an atypical accent when a British actor would have been just as fine? Heather Graham is much more problematic, but because of her miscasting: there is almost nothing about her appearance that connects her in any way with either a prostitute or a ragged 19th century British woman - let alone both. Otherwise the casting and the cast is good (including Depp, once you get used to the accent). There was something bogus about the scene with the Elephant Man; it seemed fake and out-of-place. Besides, why should a Jack the Ripper tale include the Elephant Man in any way at all? It would be like making a drama about a Spanish family and the father is a matador, while the mother is a flamenco dancer. Why the clichés? An absurd character is the pathologist who is so grossed out at looking at Ripper's victims that he even vomits in one scene - as does his assistant! What pathologist would vomit upon seeing a butchered body?! They're used to all sorts of s***! And if the pathologist vomits then Coltrane and Depp should be puking for hours.Just the idea of doing Jack the Ripper is problematic: too much is known about the case (even though it hasn't been solved), therefore the element of surprise is gone in many ways. I don't really have a problem with the plot that was devised: basically the writers came up with a huge conspiracy theory, a major cover-up of the Ripper's evil doings; everyone is in on it: the masons, the top policemen, the medical community - and even Queen Victoria herself! (Basically, the entire British elite.) Still, the inclusion of masons is rare in films so that was okay. It was predictable that Holm was the Ripper: I recognized his voice during the first (or second) murder, way before his identity is revealed. I thought it was far-fetched that Depp didn't go to visit Graham and the child, even after years had passed; surely he wouldn't have to be worried that he'd be followed non-stop for years by the masons. Because the details of the Ripper tale are so familiar the first half of the movie is weaker than the second half, in which more of the newer ideas and unknown things occur. All in all solid, but elements of predictability and the lack of real style make it less interesting.http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/johnny_depp__a_biography</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is a real masterpiece. Everything is fabulous and quite convincing. I think nobody showed London like this with the blue fog (It was really blue not white as mistakingly thought), that you could smell the dirt and tremble for cold. I think evaluation of movies depends on mood very much. You can watch the same movie twice, feeling it's a masterpiece on first time, then feeling it's lousy second time, all depending on your state of mind. I can say I watched this movie in my best mental and physical condition and I insist it's a masterpiece. What I hated most was those funny large contact lenses that the killer wears during killing. This is no supernatural horror I guess, so no basis for shape changes. Is there a historical basis for queen Victoria being involved in masonic rites, and Prince Albert getting married to a prostitute ? If not, then It's a crime specially for foreigners like me, who may learn history from movies.</fullReview>

I did actually like this film very much - the period is interesting and well depicted and the story is gripping. The whole theory exposed here about the identity of Jack the ripper is fascinating and all. But I can't help asking myself what on earth Heather Graham was doing in this film? She didn't sound very Irish to me, and she just isn't an actress of the right caliber.

		<shortDescription>The Neverending Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess we'll continue to get ever more implausible solutions to the mystery of Jack the Ripper. We don't seem to be getting any about Dr. Palmer, but Jack soldiers on. Maybe it's the name -- "Jack the Ripper," or his location, "from hell." It must also be the sex and the gore. Here's a guy slicing and dicing, and poisoning isn't a patch on butchery. It's probably also because, after all, the crimes were never explained. And the human mind has a tendency to recall uncompleted tasks better than completed ones. (In psychology it's called somewhat grandly, "the Zeigarnik effect.") Anyway, if we don't know the real answer, then ANY answer can be proffered.This one's fairly routine in its general outline -- something to do with syphilis and marriage beneath one's station among the Royals -- but to tell the truth, I got some of the characters a little mixed up. The hookers, for instance, were hard to tell apart except for Mary Kelly (Graham) with her mane of gloriously curly Irish red hair. The others didn't seem well differentiated, possibly because so much of the movie takes place in the dark.The elaborate set that represents Whitechapel in 1888 was built on the outskirts of Prague. The art direction is quite good, as far as a viewer can tell, but again, the sets might have been half as well done without most people realizing it because the shooting doesn't give us much in the way of grand sweep. There isn't enough fog, either. Or -- let's call a spade a spade -- not enough industrial smoke because that's what it was. I wish the director had taken more care to give us a sense of place. The murder scenes, including the positions of the bodies, are accurately reconstructed, but -- well, take for instance victim number three, I think it was, the one who died in the back yard of a scruffy tenement, positioned next to a fence made of boards. This barren tiny yard was reached through a passageway that ran under a crummy building. Several windows opened onto that back yard. A door led from the tenement to the outhouse at the yard's far end. (I feel I know this place well because it's the stuff my nightmares are made of, and it's always tinted a dull orange for some reason.) But none of this dismal atmosphere is brought on screen. We aren't prompted to wonder why none of the windows were opened by the tenants, or why there were no screams heard, or why on earth the Ripper would entice his victim to stand against a fence that anyone wanting to visit the loo would have to walk past. Part of the popular appeal of Jack the Ripper goes beyond the homicidal maniac and his victims. It includes all of Victorian London as well, especially the East End, its delapidated brick buildings, its toxic air, its blurry streetlights, its rain, its gin-soaked whores, its ordinary pedestrians, its entire physicality, its eidos as well as its ethos. And that's what's missing. Most of the scenes are shot from middle distance, and a lot of the circumstances are lost for this reason. The setting isn't really SCARY enough.As if to compensate for this, there are many cuts to dripping blood, scintillating knife blades, and gurgling cut throats. There are several blazing frames of women screaming. And when a knife is shown you can be sure there is the "slinkkk" of blade against blade even when there is no other knife in sight. (What a cliché.) Inspector Aberlinne's use of opium and booze gives the director and editor a chance for yet more confusing fuzzy quick shots of events which may or may not have happened, be happening, or will happen. There is quite a bit of blood on screen without the murders being all that graphic. The producers didn't seem to mind the blood but they insisted that the horse manure be cleared from the cobblestone streets so the family audience wouldn't be offended. Note: you can show throats being cut, but you can't show horse s**t.While we're at it, the movie is based on what is now called a "graphic novel" but which we used to call comic books. (Actually, it was "funny books" where I grew up.) When "The Man Who Would Be King" was released thirty years ago, it was accompanied by the release of a "novelization" of the film -- as if the original story by Kipling were too demanding. I thought that was pretty insulting. Now, with dozens of books in print on Jack the Ripper, we have a movie for adults based on a comic book. The speech balloons are limited to a few words in each panel. Sometimes just one word -- a shriek or imprecation. A generation ago it seemed that a story by Kipling might be too demanding. Now it's prose itself that is endangered. And I can see the logic behind the trend. Why demand more effort of the consumer than he is prepared to offer? Why ask him, for instance, to walk a few blocks to a store when he can harness the three thousand horsepower engine in his SUV and DRIVE back and forth? Why ask him to learn that the expression "a lot" consists of two words, an indefinite article and a common noun, instead of just one word, "alot"? This raises a question that is at least as interesting as who committed those murders 120 years ago. The question is, exactly how lacking in curiosity and cognitive stamina can consumers be, and exactly how dumbed down the demands made on those consumers, before a civilization collapses of its own ignorance?Geez, will somebody help me down off this soap box? It's so high my nose is beginning to bleed. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Hell.As you will have read from the other reviews ?From Hell' tells the story of London police inspector Abberline (Depp) and his investigation of Jack the Ripper in Victorian times. Based on a series of graphic novels by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, ?From Hell' manages to incorporate a lot of genuine Ripper theories and suspects before settling on the most grandiose as its final resolution. This well may prove to be an unpopular view but I did not enjoy ?From Hell'. My main criticism of ?From Hell' is that it is so tedious. I would consider myself to be a film viewer of reasonable intelligence, I do not feel that ?From Hell' would be better with a series of action scenes. But let's not go too far in the opposite direction and confuse an intelligent approach with being boring. And lets not beat around the bush, ?From Hell' is boring.It is not without its plus points. Depp is watchable as Abberline although Abberline is far less interesting than Depp's similar character in Sleepy Hollow. The accents are not as noticeably bad as in the trailer.But these points are far outweighed by the poorer aspects. For most of these, I am afraid we must look to the directors. Brave as though the Hughes boys were to move into a new field of film making, for the most part the film is never terribly interesting to look at and worse, often treats the viewer as an idiot by showing us close ups and reminders of things that happened moments ago. The sliding realities that occur to Abberline and to the Ripper are cliched and often seem to make little sense.Reading the other reviews on IMDB Andrew Johnson hits the nail on the head when he says there is no emotional involvement with any of the characters, especially the Unfortunates (whores), and it is this dis-attachment that finally kills ?From Hell' off.The reveal of who the ripper is, will come of no surprise to anyone, although the depth of the conspiracy is interesting. I am not wishing to show off but I had a fairly good idea from the trailer.There is one theory that none of ?From Hell' actually takes place, it is all the opium fantasy of Abberline. If this was the case then why on earth is it such a lifeless, uneventful time.</fullReview>

I am not saying I know who is, many theories abound, but the 'Queen Victoria sending her personal physician out to kill the prostitutes that gave her son VD' is one of the more laughable. Secondly, Johnny Depp simply could not emit a convincing British accent.

		<fullReview>Why is it Americans have a laughably ethnocentric view of Britain ? They seem to be under the impression that each and every person of the United Kingdom is a cockney who says " Cor blimey Guv " a lot and works as a chimney sweep . In fact the only people we see in American movies who aren`t cockneys are the royal family ! Even BAND OF BROTHERS suffers from this flaw and that was a BBC co-production ! I must admit that it was nice to see the producers FROM HELL did their homework on 19th century London - By watching MARY POPPINS over and over againNot having a time machine I`ve never been to 1888 London but can`t help thinking the ethnic make of the city is all wrong with everyone talking with a cockney accent , wouldn`t London be full of Scots and Irish swapping their Scottish and Irish slums for one in London ? Just curious because everyone with the exception of Robbie Coltrane`s character is either a cockney or a former public schoolboy , and of course by casting a bunch of native Brits you can`t help notice how bad the accents coming from Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are . Depp especially is abysmalAs the film continues you still notice the annoying accents but other irritants force their way into the movie . Despite having characters that existed in real life they`re written beyond all recognition , for instance Inspector Abberline had visions of the killings like some sort of psychic ? I don`t think so , oh and that bit with the diversion at Special Branch didn`t happen either and there`s no evidence he had a relationship with Mary Kelly or that any of the victims knew each other . Talking of Mary Kelly I was going to point out that , physically at least , that the real life Mary Kelly does not in any way resemble the one seen here but being an American film you`ve got to excuse some artistic license where glamour is involvedActually this glamour jars with the opening of the film which shows the London of 1888 being a human hell hole with drunkeness and drug addiction being the norm . Strangely this actually correct , in those days drugs weren`t outlawed and a great many people took all types of drugs that would now be called " Class A drugs "( Including Queen Victoria ) though there`s no evidence Inspector Abberline was a user , so once again it`s disappointing to see so much historical inaccuracy involved especially The Rippers motivations . I can`t disprove the theories put forward but do empires collapse like this ? In my opinion - No . Oh and talking of The Ripper it`s very very obvious who he is when he first opens his mouth about twenty minutes into the movie because you`ll be able to recognise the actor`s voice straight awaySo FROM HELL could have been a very good movie , but alas it`s not</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has too much going on and lacks suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the killer of five street hookers had been arrested in 1888 his name would not have been anything more than a foot note in criminology. Our fascination with Jack the Ripper has less to do with his bloody handy work than with the simple question of who he was. Countless books have been written, countless theories posed. Like the conspiracy theory which places Jack in the middle of British royalty and which is the focus of From Hell.In From Hell the conspiracy is discovered by Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), who is portrayed as having visions of the killer while high on opium. It's a mystical plot element which is totally irrelevant to the story, as is a cameo by the Elephant Man himself. With an overstuffed screenplay, based on the graphic novel, From Hell just has too much going on and makes too little of the actual plot. It has one plus though: the movie looks great, with a convincingly filthy Whitechapel full of equally filthy prostitutes with bad teeth and greasy hair. Except, of course, for Mary Kelly as played by Heather Graham who gets Abberline's juices flowing with her beautiful head of fiery red hair.The Hughes brothers make the most of the production design and they know how to suggest a bloody murder without showing too much. But they lack any feel for suspense. Not once do they make you squeeze your arm chair.</fullReview>

Where it ultimately fails is in the story itself.Fictionalizing the characters and events surrounding the White Chapel murders to the point of absurdity, it then delves into an outlandish conspiracy involving everything from the Royal Family to the Freemasons. This only serves to undermine the horrific events, and as a result the movie is never once frightening despite copious amounts of gore. Also absent is the hysteria that gripped White Chapel and sensationalistic press coverage that fueled it.Though watchable thanks to some fine performances by Depp, Coletrane and Holm, 'From Hell' lacks the tension and scares necessary to make it all that it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ripper!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legendary bewhiskered comic creator Alan Moore has famously distanced himself from all cinematic adaptations of his work, never happy with the end results. It's a pattern that started in 2001 with From Hell, a speculative account of the infamous Jack The Ripper case, directed by The Hughes Brothers and starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. In bringing the graphic novel to life, alterations were made by the film-makers to both characters and plot?changes that were substantial enough to incur the wrath of Mr. Moore.However, while I can fully appreciate how Moore feels (no artist likes to have their work messed around with), I believe that the film is still a very accomplished and entertaining piece that more than warrants merit. A wonderfully realised, bold and bloody take on an oft-told tale, From Hell benefits from confident direction, great production values, and solid performances from a terrific cast, with Hollywood stars Depp and Graham both taking a good stab (pun intended) at the London accent (while they're not perfect, they're more than serviceable) while Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm, Jason Flemyng and a whole raft of other talented players do their utmost to ensure an authentic East End flavour overall.The plot, although heavily revised, holds together very nicely and remains utterly fascinating, pointing the finger of suspicion at both the Freemasons and the Royal Family, making the whole thing a blast for conspiracy theorists and republicans alike. To Moore, I say 'so what if this isn't exactly what you had in mind?at least it's not as bad as what Snyder did to 300'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm pretty much a fan of Johnny Depp, as I usually appreciate his performance regardless of my ultimate opinion of the movie itself. Sleepy Hollow was a masterful re-envisioning of the classic story of Ichabod Crane, featuring a nice blend of mystery &amp; horror. From Hell seemed like a natural extension of this character archetype, with a loosely-based historical inspiration, adding weight to the horrific scenarios that it depicts. With that in mind, I decided to check it out.There are many things that are done right in this movie, number one being the atmosphere. London is gray, rainy, &amp; dark, and its desperate citizens reflect this foreboding setting well. The women whore themselves out for an extra cent, while the men retain control through intimidation &amp; violence. Racial tensions, corrupt officials, and secret societies complicate the picture, and the actors in their elaborate costumes capture the unrest perfectly. As the film is a work of historical fiction, it takes liberties in the portrayal of certain events/facts, but only for the purpose of increasing the dramatic potential of the plot. In fact, these little deviations in historical accuracy felt very creative, and mostly fit in with the ambiguous nature of one the most infamous unsolved mysteries.The faults, while noticeable, are not disqualifying. The characters are played well, despite being mostly unremarkable to begin with. Depp's Inspector Abberline is likable, though his behavior is inconsistent. As an opium addict, he seems content to waste away his life in an altered state, yet jumps into action without hesitation, and utterly dedicates himself to risk life and limb tracking down a vicious serial killer &amp; sifting through the lies that keep him so elusive. This also serves to make his relationship with Heather Graham, as the female lead, seem slightly artificial. The visionary, opium-induced haze that enables him to keep pace with the killer was an interesting touch, but wasn't utilized to its full potential, in my opinion. Also, the killer's character is not developed enough, and so comes across as "cartoonishly" scary, lacking in realism.Ultimately, this is a tense thriller that will captivate your attention, with a unique interpretation of the Jack the Ripper mythos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Hell" is very grim and ultra stylish filmmaking, most impressive for the way it depicts late 19th century London. It's a bleak image of Hell on Earth, an environment in which a maniac dubbed Jack the Ripper is able to flourish. Bloody Jack is carving up prostitutes in horrific fashion, and the weary inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) is on the case. A haunted individual who uses drugs and experiences psychic visions, Abberline develops an attraction to Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), one of the Whitechapel whores whom he encounters. He soon discovers that there are secrets that important people want to keep secret, and that Jacks' motive might be more complex than he believes.Depp delivers a particularly solid, if somewhat eccentric, performance as Abberline, and receives excellent support from a mostly British cast. Graham manages to be somewhat convincing and not stick out too much. Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson, Jason Flemyng, Katrin Cartlidge, Terence Harvey, Susan Lynch, Paul Rhys, and Lesley Sharp co-star. Holm and Flemyng have particularly interesting roles. The story, adapted by Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, is intricately plotted and involving, and it keeps the viewer guessing and on their toes, wondering who will be revealed as the Ripper and it may even catch them off guard when the end does come. Technically, the film is a marvel, with top notch direction by Allen and Albert Hughes, and eye catching production design (by Martin Childs) and cinematography (by Peter Deming). The period recreation is strong, with location filming done in the Czech Republic. There's also a wonderfully ominous score composed by Trevor Jones.The film doesn't really trend on unfamiliar ground, at least not to "Ripperphiles", but it's quite good and entertaining, and a worthy viewing for horror fans.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp, as Inspector Abberline has the daunting task of finding Jack the Ripper, who has killed five or more females who live in the impoverished Whitechapel District of London in 1885.Victorian England is believably well-constructed here. The film evinces the streets, dark and dank 'doss houses', and the wretched lives on the East End of Whitechapel. It's not glamorized, it was a slum (I have visited London and Mitre Square, while now surrounded by business and banks, is indeed a sad parking area,and a tourist sign still demarcates the victim who was found there.There are several theories hinted at here, Sir William Gull (excellently portrayed by Ian Holm) the physician to Queen Victoria and her grandson, who was afflicted with a social disease. Sir William was an experienced surgeon and also a Freemason. The Masonic Lodge plays into theories here as well, as the area where several female victims were found mutilated was close by.However, there are other theories also.The visuals of this film are noteworthy. The red sky and Westminter Chapel, the cold brutality of winters in an era of workhouses and little options for the impoverished.While not a solution to the mystery (we may never have one), Depp , Holm and the performance of Heather Graham as Irish street walker and victim "Mary Kelly" is worth watching. You will get a feel for the era.Sir Ian Holm, as he teaches an anatomy class and states : "the heart is a stubborn muscle, like mahogany, it is almost impossible to burn", as we see the visual in his mind of throwing a victims heart into the boiling kettle in his fireplace.It is a pastiche of events, but does give one a sense of the murders, and what life must have felt like for those who were not born into royalty in Victorian England. Highly recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

Some blood and gore is absent during the film's violent murder scenes as seen through the visions of Johnny Depp as Inspector Abberline. Johnny's performance is quite interesting with him playing an opium- addicted London detective on the case of the infamous Jack the Ripper. Heather Graham as Mary Kelly (a real-life Ripper victim)is a fine foil to Depp's addled Abberline, but the chemistry that develops could take a hike; it's a tacky angle to turn the two character's motives on their heads. The film lacks some real mystery to the Ripper's identity by the finale of the picture since the directors eventually give away who is involved in the case. Nonetheless, this film is a decent horror film with some interesting portrayals of the victims of the Ripper's infamous rampage.</fullReview>

We can just thank The Hughes Brothers up front for directing this masterpiece, be it that their entire theory on Jack The Ripper was false or not, is arbitrary to the fact that 'From Hell' is well-made, well-acted, and very highly underrated. This probably got lost for many people in a flush of Johnny Depp films that would invade popular culture for the next decade to come, but fresh off the heels of making Tim Burton's 1999 'Sleepy Hollow', Johnny Depp plays this Sherlock Holmes-esque character well, and intriguingly, even if the accent might seem a little over-the-top, a decade later.The art direction is also highly notable, based on the graphic novel, which I haven't read, I can just imagine that there are plenty of panels in the comic depicting the ominous blood red London skyline. Beautiful. The costumes and set pieces are all very nicely done as well. Robbie Coltrane is great as Depp's sidekick, and underrated also much of the time. Heather Graham isn't anything spectacular, and she's no Christina Ricci, but she fills her shoes well. Ian Holm is spectacular, and this was probably my first real introduction to him.You will probably have to watch this film several times to really get the entire gist of it, because the plot could seem complicated if you aren't familiar with the theory The Hughes Brothers used. Indeed, I hope one day Depp can possibly conjure up an idea with someone as visionary as The Hughes Brothers yet again and bring us another true classic type, such as films like 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'From Hell' are. In my opinion, this is an absolute forgotten masterpiece of recent cinema, and highly overlooked.FROM HELL -----9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine piece of modern Gothic Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the darkest parts of culture, the serial killer, is also one of the most fascinating. These degenerates have been around for who knows how long and the frightening thing is there are many active killers today. They're written about, documented in film, and discussed in classes all over. One of the most notorious is of course Jack the Ripper, whom we all know was never identified. Oh there were many suspects, but no one has ever been able to find the one truly responsible. There have been a few films made about him (or her? them?), some good and some not so much. Between 1991 and 1996 writer Alan Moore wrote a series of comics about the infamous murderer that became very popular. This film adaptation was in capable hands, so one would hope that it would be something for the books.Pros: Excellent cast and performances. Rich production and costume designs. Beautifully photographed. Engrossing and suspenseful story. Great brooding atmosphere. Moody score. Perfectly paced. The Hughes Brothers infuse the film with much style, but do so gracefully. Some chilling sequences and imagery. Impressive make-up and gore effects, the latter of which look very real.Cons: Heather Graham isn't bad here, but compared to the rest she stands out as the weaker player. So many characters to keep track of that it becomes a little overwhelming. The love story angle isn't developed enough.Final thoughts: This film is quite a ride that'll stay with you long after it's over. It's dark atmosphere and scary imagery are hard to shake, but in the case of this film that's a good thing. It's harder to find a Hollywood Horror movie like this that works so well. But with this talent involved it's not hard to see why it turned out as brilliantly as it did. Even if you're not interested in or familiar with the serial killer depicted here this is a must see.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Displaying the social relevance the remarkable move From Hell deserves in a review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Was Indeed Along Those Lines(Displaying the social relevance the remarkable movie, From Hell, deserves in a review)Perhaps few episodes in history have had more entwining attempts at interpretation than the carnage practiced upon London's underworld by the ignoble "Jack the Ripper". This writer can think of one at present, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Be as it may, though differences are stark, these two events are both ignoble, made much more so, by the complicity of authorities, in both the progress towards their culmination and the cover-up of evidence, even to the extent of the murder of witnesses. Again, the ramifications go much further, even deep within the social fabric. For they touch upon the use of secrecy to hide misdeed and secret societies to commit them. The movie, From Hell is excellent, venturing into areas of high probability to weave a likely scenario with the established facts at hand, making sense of the puzzling anomalies so carefully avoided historically. So well does it succeed, we might wonder when the JFK assassination will be visited in similar fashion. The significance becomes imperative when society's own prerogatives are becoming more and more constrained to the privileged few.Excellent use of casting talent, the best job I've seen Depp perform, sets and camera work exquisitely utilized. Hope this exceptional film reaches the clarity threshold with you it did with this reviewer. JCH</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the darkest films that I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Hell" takes place in our worst nightmares, a place so dark and scary that even walking around is enough to drive someone mad. This is a very, VERY dark film. It's so dark that it makes "Seven" look like "The Wizard of Oz." Then again, you wouldn't expect a movie based on Jack the Ripper to be light and cheery, now would you?London, 1888. A young prostitute was murdered in the Whitechapel district. The police enlist the help of Fredrick Abberline (Johnny Depp) because of the savagery of the murder and because his opium hallucinations help him solve crimes. But more victims fall, Abberline begins to realize that these murders are connected.The film has a brilliantly dark atmosphere. You know that odd creepy feeling you get when you read about haunted mental asylums, and images of demented doctors performing horrific experiments come to mind? That's what "From Hell" feels like. It's an unsettling feeling, and the Hughes Brothers are skillful in their employment of this unnerving feeling.The acting is solid, although the film's best hand is the atmosphere. Johnny Depp, who according to his IMDb bio is fascinated by Jack the Ripper, plays things straight (as far as Depp can go in that direction). Heather Graham is also solid as Mary Kelly, the prostitute that Abberline develops feelings for. She speaks with a credible Cockney accent, and tones down the perkiness that she's known for to a very low level. Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane provide good support as well.The problem with the film is the story. Whether it was in the scripting stage or in production, the story is confusing at times, particularly at the end. This is one of those movies where you have to pay attention, or else you will get lost (which is quite possible, considering how strong the atmosphere is).Let me make myself clear: this is a very dark and disturbing film. Most of the violence and gore are left to the imagination (which will be on overkill due to grisly descriptions of the murders), but there is no doubt that this movie deserves as hard of an R rating as can be found. Definitely not for the faint of heart or the blood-phobic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ripping yarn? Or a schizophrenic tale?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get if you mix Edward Elgar, Take That and Ministry of Sound at Ibiza? You get "From Hell". This film is a mix of historical fact ( Elgar), urban legend ( Take That) and surreal drama ( MOS Ibiza) coming together to form a strange yet enjoyable dance.The film is set in Victorian London when the poorer classes of London's Whitechapel area lived in fear of the most infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper. Directed by the Hughes Brothers, much is made of Inspector Abeline's opium, Absynth and strychnine addiction, something associated more with Sherlock Holmes than Abeline although historically accurate as the drugs of choice for the Victorian gent in London .Johnny Depp, an actor who seems to pick roles which allow him to showcase his versatility is convincing as Abeline, the unfortunate detective who became a sacrificial scapegoat offered up to the frustrated and furious Londoners by a powerful Masonic order. His London accent varies through the film and is reminiscent of his Jack Sparrow. Choosing to understate the role and not to go over the top with the drug scenes or action, but play it in the calm controlled way expected of a Victorian gent. It's tempting to compare Depp's Inspector Abeline with Robert Downey Jr's Holmes but one should remember Holmes was fictional allowing RDJ to go over the top, where as Abeline is real and Depp plays it more so.The tale of Jack the Ripper is well known, this version however explores a particular belief that Jack had royal connections and was protected by the Masonic order. The film is filled with factual aspects such as the pressure put upon Abeline to find a Jew butcher as the murderer, the chalk writing being washed off the wall and the intentional misspelling of Juwes. Equally it's full of assumptions, however I couldn't help feeling it's the closest any film has come to the truth. No one has ever sufficiently answered how Jack the Ripper was able to get in and out of east London unseen and un stopped, and the murders, swift and brutal over a short period seemed to end as quickly as they had begun without reason or answer.The plot is simple to follow and unfolds with ease as the film progresses, there are no surprises or ridiculous unbelievable twists but there are some problems with the film. You're repeatedly bombarded with surreal drug influenced moments, expected to believe in a miss fitting romance subplot, asked not to question set and costume design which is accurately Victorian but seems too clean and bright for the age. Perhaps the directors felt Abeline's drug induced visions were important and purposely avoided the classic Victorian smog and squalor we think of to give a bright and fresh feel . Additionally, less is made of Jack the Ripper's acts themselves. Given that the film is titled "From Hell" which is how the genuine Ripper letters were addressed, surprisingly the letters and body parts he sent to the newspapers and Scotland Yard is hardly touched upon as the film seems to concern itself more with Abeline and the Masons rather than Jack and his actions. We shouldn't forget how disturbed the mind of Jack the Ripper was and perhaps the fact that somehow these events were indeed covered up, even to this day, the directors were perhaps right to focus on those who sought to perpetrate the cover up than remake a story told so many times before. That said all these things do leave you feeling that the film is not sure of it's own identity and is somewhat confused, schizophrenic even. Enjoyable none the less.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Detective VS. Conspiracy Cult?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hell is one of the more famous movie about Jack the Ripper, the series murderer who gutted several prostitutes in London, and left disturbing messages. The reason that his story is highly fascinating, is because this is an unsolved case, and until today, Jack the Ripper is still at large, if you can say so.The movie boasted technical achievements on several levels. The extremely gritty and bleak portrait of London slums is more than an eye candy, if you can say so. That is to say the art decoration of From Hell is literally from baroque era and Balzac. Compared to more recent productions like Sweeny Todd, who also aimed the camera on the slums and dirty gritty side of British glory, From Hell is really more disturbing and depressing to watch because of the social scope and context it examined.It's horrifying because it has a more realistic tone and accuracy on certain levels. When you see the prostitutes being constricted by a rope in a row in a church sleeping, while waiting for their nightfall to work and be killed, you really can't help but feel bad.All the special make-up effects just added more edge to its poignancy and trivial features. Coincidentally and ironically, this movie also stars the brilliant Johnny Depp in the leading role. I can only imagine inspector Abberline chasing down Sweeny Todd in a bloodier scenario. Cheers! However, From Hell's view on a series killer at large is also very stereotypical and intentionally romantic. The way they examine each character and each motivation is full of post-modern skepticism except for the leading role played by Depp. Jack the Ripper is not only a high-ranking royal officer, but essentially a leading conspirator in a cult that controlled England for centuries. If only the decisive historical evidence for this theory can be found, the whole world will shake. Every character who has even a bit of connection to the villains group would ended up a co-conspirator or someone with extremely ugly motivations(even the queen didn't escape this). Perceived by inspector Abberline who is the closest thing to a hero in this movie, everything and every attempt to solve the case is pointless, not only because the case would be covered up consequently but also because the result of his efforts will have nothing to do with him. When he died in the opium house at the end, the movie nailed nothing but the desolation of humanism and faith into our mindset, which is already bleak and hopeless enough. So, allow me to call the movie a elongated depiction of destruction of human souls.Modern skepticism about Christianity is often based on people's perception that churches(or the church if you are catholic) is that this religious group is only one of the many "players" in the society who strive for survival, identity and consensus. Yes, no denying that ever since there was a church, there was a corruption in the church, not to mention later eras only brought more power and corruption to it. We really can't ask a person to prove his/her faith is untouched like virgin Mary, but we may still need to have a more balanced perception and thinking of the reality in order to see the original messages in this faith. From Hell provided us with a "bigger picture" which is based on many speculations and if considered seriously, insults on certain historic figures. Yet, it holds a "hero of the humanity" in the core of its story and spirit, giving people more reasons to adore themselves and the heroism they have each day in fighting their bosses or lifting up an elder citizen from snow. It is only a matter of time until people come to realize that the capital From Hell to "cushion" their morality standpoint is a broken one and leads to deeper darkness.Not to mention those nature-born pessimists. Anyway, giving a movie a more romantic undertone doesn't make it worthy your time and emotion. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkly set but lacking the passion and tension of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1888 London psychic detective Fred Abberline (Depp) seeks to solve the mystery of Jack the Ripper.There have numerous critics slating this movie for its inaccurate depiction of the legend murderer and the poor adapting of English accents from the two leads.But From Hell is, when you watch it for the first time, undeniably intriguing with a passion and an interior motive to tell the tale of one of the mythical tales of Victorian era.Johnny Depp stars as Frederick Abberline, a worn down detective with a tendency to see the future. Depp's English accent is one to be scrutinized and whilst the critics may have a point on this matter, it doesn't shy away from the fact Depp is arguably miscast in the central role. The bravado of Captain Jack is missing, the surprise and imagination of Edward has disappeared and in the place is a stone coloured mask that denotes misery and lack of enthusiasm that is hard to see the balance of the character when considering the dialogue. For example the eventuality of Mary leaves Depp looking confused rather than surprised and amazed not to forget his expressionless and passionate responds to the constant murders of the womenfolk.Depp's far from on form here but do not be discouraged as come the end of the film we see his character thrive out of the darkness to see some much needed passion that wraps up the political incorrectness of the time and reflect on what has been a startling story.The plot revolves around The Ripper with each murder seemingly brutal with its use of powerful blood and gore to give Sweeney Todd a run for its money. Each murder adds spice and tension to the plot with some conscientious mystery that will baffle and intrigue right up until the revealing identity. Seeing the identity of The Ripper kind of spoilt the flowing mystery of the film and you may be wondering who and why had the film finished with a sharper climax considering the last murder.From Hell is a sharp period drama with a good sense of costume and setting to justify the times and issues that contained within them. The dark lighting and the sharp colours of the sky are worthy mentions to give that extra edge and a feeling of misery to the dark narrative, particularly considering the involvements. From murder to sex, this isn't afraid of shying away from realistic activities of past life, and with the political incorrectness regarding the force and the Monarch it may be seen as controversial.Where From Hell fails is with Depp unfortunately. Had there been a bit more spice and vigour in his dialogue then the plot may have been more engaging, a tad more passionate to really entice the viewer into the dramatic proceedings. The direction by the Hughes brothers leaves a lot to be answered for as some of the sex scenes are awkward rather than fiery and when the Ripper sits down on the bed, you wonder why. Worth a look</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth 2 hours of your time, but it could have been so much more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting, if not totally successful variation on the Jack The Ripper story, blighted by Hollywood yet again assuming that anyone in London says "cor blimey" a lot, and speaks in the same exaggerated "cock-er-ney" manner. This is a shame, as the film actually has a lot of good things going for it. Some genuinely chilling set pieces and a suitably grim visual style make for some scary moments. Sadly, particularly in the first half of the film, the Hughes Brothers (directing) seem to spend too much time trying to be visually clever when they should be putting more effort into getting on with the story. When they dispense with the visual gimmickry and the action is allowed to take off, the film is extremely gripping. On another level, the ending is particularly moving. A previous reviewer referred to the film's historical inaccuracies in depth, so I won't retread the same ground, but suffice to say that anyone familiar with the events will be distracted by these, although anyone new to the story wouldn't be affected. Performances are generally good, if not quite the principal performers' best work - in my book, the honours go to the ever reliable Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane. Overall, this film is well worth a couple of hours of your time, but it could have been so much more...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read a lot of negative comments about "From Hell". I guess they were expecting a lot more bloodletting then they received. I haven't seen any of the other Hughes Brothers films so I'm going to have to leave those comments alone.What the Hughes brothers did was to recreate (at least on film) the atmosphere of the Whitechappel District of London, UK. Having once taken the "Jack the Ripper" tour of Whitechappel their film agreed pretty much with what I was told.The overall acting was pretty good. Johnny Depp did his usual job of performing on the stage much like he did in "Ed Woods" and other films. Heather Graham and the others made for great window dressing.I won't get into the other details of the film except to say that it reminded me of a much earlier film which starred Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes and James Mason as Dr. Watson. It was called "Murder By Decree" and it came to pretty much the same conclusions as "From Hell": the Royal Physician did it with the help of the Masons. I missed the Holmes and Watson interplay in THIS film.</fullReview>

Now, don't get me wrong, he gave a great performance and was almost believable as Jack, almost. Why? Because the man is 70 years old (and looks 70 years old). I mean, today I can accept a 70 year-old man to be still fit (Charles Bronson at that age could still move smoothly, run and take a few punches, as he does in Death Wish 5) but in 1888, when Gold's Gym wasn't there and come on, a Royal surgeon ain't gonna jog around every morning, there was no way a 70 year old could run around, grab and kill 5 women and get away without beeing seen. Please. If he had being played by a 50 year old actor (old enough to be a top class and famous surgeon and still strong enough to engage in serial killing and police eluding)...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Hell is a gruesome portrait of murder in London during the reign of Queen Victoria. It tells the story of Jack the Ripper, a psychotic individual who murdered 5 prostitutes. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the inspector who tries to hunt him down and delivers one of the best performances of his career. The story is well written by the Hughes Brothers and is a truly enjoyable film for anyone who loves the horror genre. However, it is the predictability of this film and the performance of Heather Graham which provides From Hell with a downfall. The spoken dialogue between Depp and a good doctor lets you easily figure out who the murderer is. It does not supply the audience with a surprise or twist. Heather Graham's performance is purely simple and does not illustrate her capable talent. She does not deliver a well-rounded performance as Mary Kelly (also a prostitute) because she does not show essential emotion (i.e. fear) in order to fulfill her role. However, the film is an exceptional horror picture and should not be overlooked by any fan of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old yarn, appallingly made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rehash of The Royal Conspiracy theory, thoroughly debunked by serious Ripperologists (in particular Donald Rumbelow in his Jack the Ripper: The Complete Casebook). The theme has been used in many previous Ripper movies, in particular the 1988 made-for-TV "Jack the Ripper" with Michael Caine as Inspector Abberline and "Murder by Decree" with Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes ...This 2001 version is similar, but whereas the two aforementioned films are terribly enjoyable (the 1988 TV movie particularly so) despite being inaccurate in their historical details, the new movie is simply terrible. Abberline (Johnny Depp) is a druggie, who uses opium to "see" details of brutal murders, and solves the case. Good job, because he doesn't do any real police work at any stage in the movie, even by 1888 standards ...Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) is the whore with a heart of gold, who is sober and pretty right through the movie, with her make-up perfect, even when languishing at the Ten Bells. She never actually plies her trade, though, do the stage is all set for the fairy tale ending. And so on and so forth.I won't even bother to point out the many, many, many factual inaccuracies and plain untruths in the film. That would fill too many pages on its own.Most of the acting throughout is hammy and way over-the-top. The dialogue is appalling, and the directors haven't really read their own script. For example, it is clearly stated in the film that the murders were committed in the dark. Well, they were.There were few gas lights in Whitechapel in 1888. The place was pitch-black as soon as night fell, hence the real Jack could get away with his slayings. Of course, in the movie, the stage - and it is clearly a sound stage, this is not art direction of the highest order - is nicely lit all the way, gas lights as far as the eye can see. But heck, this is the Hollywood version. Except this is not "Bram Stoker's Dracula" Hollywood. That was nicely done. This is day-time TV Hollywood, as regards plot, dialogue, character developement, cinematography and direction ...Small bonus points in this shammy film: Ian Holm splendid as usual as Sir William Gull, Robbie Coltrane fine as Sergeant Godley, Ian Richardson splendid as always. Otherwise a really bad film. Stay clear. Or rent the 1988 version on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I say old chap, the British accent IS a bit of a sticky wicket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amazed (and a bit perplexed) to hear so many of the previous commenters on IMDb ? namely, those from the British Isles ? make such pointed comments on the (apparently) scarcely believable accents of American actors Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. As for me, being a Yank and all, I neither noticed nor cared too much whether either Depp or Graham turned out a spotless British, Cockney, Irish or what-have-you accent? because ultimately I don't know enough about those accents to be able to make an informed opinion. So in that respect I was rather neutral on the whole accent business throughout the film.Yes, I know what an authentic B-C-I accent sounds like, and I too noticed that these weren't flawless, but I never gave it much thought, as both of them seemed at least realistic and convincing enough to allow me to enjoy the overall atmospheric "look and feel" of the movie, which was far more important.That being said, I can see where you are coming from. It would be the equivalent of watching a movie, say, featuring Medieval warriors doing battle, where everything in the battle scenes ? the weapons, battle flags, helmets, spears, horses, etc.- are just spot-on accurately depicted, but (horror!) here and there you notice that a few of the foot soldiers are seen to be wearing modern-day wrist watches and sunglasses, or sporting the latest pair of Nike running shoes on their feet. Distracting, to say the least ? and potentially ruinous to the whole "magic" of the movie experience.I get the same reaction, I guess, when I see American actors who were born north of the Mason-Dixon line attempting to do a realistic- sounding Southern accent. My own mother was born and raised in the Deep South; I've personally traveled throughout much of the South, and as such I can spot a real Southern accent from a fake one from at least a mile away. (Good example of a non-Suthnah' doing an incredible Southern accent: Fred Gwynne (born/raised in NY-NY) as Judge Chamberlain Haller in 1992's "My Cousin Vinny").But these comments about accents do raise some interesting critical questions. Namely, should Gollywood try to make more of an effort in casting the most appropriate (and realistic) actor or actress in every cast opening? Hmm, let's see, Inspector Abberline was from Dorset... perhaps the producers of this film could have or should have found an actor born and bred in Dorset to fill the role of Inspector Abberline? (Sorry, I don't right off hand know any actors originally from Dorset, so you'll have to provide me a name, if you know of one!). But on the other hand (and we all know this stubborn little fact of filmdom)... yes, that's right, they have to sell those tickets, they have to fill those seats in the theaters, folks. And Johnny Depp ? say what you will about him ? he *does* at least have that "fill the seats" sort of box-office magnetism.I have always admired Johnny Depp, and I like much of his body of work. And I hurry to say that I was not disappointed with his work in this film. I regret that, for many of you, he didn't make the grade as a convincing enough Inspector Abberline, so much so that it ruined an otherwise absorbing and atmospheric film. I can only point out that, given the realities and mysteries of casting, it could have been worse. I mean, thank God it wasn't Bill Murray playing the Inspector! (Danny DeVito, anyone?)With the possible exception of calling the good folks at Central Casting, I don't know what the answer is, I don't know what we can do about it... (Sorry, I don't know their number, but I know it ISN'T "1-800-GET-REAL".) But let me just close by saying that movies DO require a certain contribution of suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. Until the folks at Central Casting can come up with perfect matches for every cast part, or until actors and actresses can effortlessly adopt themselves to the subtleties of a regional or foreign dialect, well, we will just have to deal with it, won't we?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Impressive. . . .Stylewise that is.It seems my assumption couldn't have been more wrong about the Hughes Brothers. Okay I know I might sound discriminative about the fact that since making Menace II Society I thought this is the type of "Hood" films they'd be only used to doing. . .BOY WAS I WRONG.Not a bad comeback I might add, Johnny Depp as usual gives his best at playing unusual characters like that of "Sleep Hollow". Here he more or less does the same only presenting a more somber mood as the inspector in charge of the Ripper case. Performances are good all round (especially to the two stars Catrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp last seen togethor in the Mike Leigh classic 'Naked'). Very well shot and stylish backdrops helped provide the movie's gothic setting giving London a truly creepy touch.My only disspointment was that the murders weren't so shocking and brutal as I'd come to expect (maybe the Hughes Brothers should've looked at some Giallos of Lamberto Bava or Dario Argento in order to help gain more reference to the blood and gore portrayed).Overall not a bad attempt, though it was a tad bit dissapointed. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't get myself to like "From Hell" entirely. Unfortunately the story isn't as gripping as I thought it would be. I mean, hey, this is a JACK THE RIPPER story! A *mystery* unsolved since the 1880s ... Visually the film is great, the performances are great either but somehow I expected more, more, more ... I don't know what. More suspense? More dark alleyways and shadows? More hints instead of explanations? More mystery for the mind to digest? But this film gave me no puzzle, no riddles to solve, no heated discussions at the end about some details that just can't be explained ... But then again it was good fun to watch, it just shouldn't have been so clear and stylised and ... simple. Maybe I knew too much about the story beforehand.---MAJOR SPOILER! DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE FILM!--- You can't expect a film to be true to the facts but anybody who is interested in the real facts knows that the theory about Dr Gull being Jack the Ripper doesn't hold up (I was surprised to see that Donald Rubelow, author of a great book on the real Jack, was involved in the making of the film if you believe the credits--he must have told the Hughes that the theory was nonsense).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Hell Without Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminds me of the impact created by 'The Others'. It's difficult to fault the mood, tone, feel, and acting.(I did not have a problem with the Cockney accents). Yet, in spite of the lack of grounds for criticism, I didn't think it was as good as I was hoping. Like 'Hannibal', another suitably gory story, it lacked suspense. Even where the story is known, suspense should still be created, but I thought that the early murders were clumsily handled. The film looks good, and the music was complimentary, but somehow it lacked that vital ingredient. Mind you, what do I know - I thought the 'Glass House' was a taut thriller, whereas most critics slammed it. To me, it was almost as if Johnny Depp KNEW that it lacked a spark. As always, he was very watchable, but his performance was not as compelling as usual. I don't think his heart was in it. Did he need Christina Ricci playing the part of Mary Kelly? I'm willing to bet that if she had, 'From Hell' would have packed a bigger punch. Heather Graham is just too nice to play a salt-of-the-earth prostitute. Christina Ricci would have had that edge in the part, and Depp would then have excelled. Robbie Coltrane was underused, but helped matters when he was on screen. Overall, I enjoyed it, but if it had to be an '18' certificate, I think that the menace could have been better employed by more graphic violence, to engineer in the audience an uneasy suspense, which it definitely lacked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well overall, I have no ambitions to own this film but enjoyed it nonetheless. I'd like to see it again, and I would go out of my way to do it. In my book, that's three-and-a-half stars, or 8 out of 10.That said, most of this film is a painstakingly true-to-life - I don't know what the right noun is. "Documentary" isn't it. It falls just short of that. The more I research JTR, the more impressed I am with the authenticity of the movie. I wish I took the time to read-up about the subject before I saw this.This movie is for people who are familiar with JTR 101. Check out casebook.org, read up on it until you've memorized the victims' names, where they were killed, dates the bodies were found, and God help you, the method &amp; extent of the mutilation. Also do your homework on local geography. These are "canonical" victims, of which there are only five.Then, you'll be able to enjoy this movie much better. But once that's done, on having the ending revealed you will be burdened with a conspiracy theory that is barely even ponderable, let alone plausible.In my opinion, that is the one glaring flaw of "From Hell." What was the point here? The sets are authentic down to, I'd believe, the square foot; and then the surprise ending can be easily debunked in a variety of ways. It's obviously not supposed to be believed by anyone who knows anything about the case.So by the time you educate yourself enough to enjoy this to the fullest potential, you're already taking the subject more seriously than they want you to. Other than that, this was very well done. The movies I've really liked, in the last ten years or so, I can count on one hand. This is one of them.</fullReview>

However, if you know a little of Jack the Ripper's history then you are not going to be surprised by to much in the film. Also be prepared for what they had to do to make it a big hollywood film which is to give it a somewhat happy ending and over dramatize some of the characters involved.

		<fullReview>As Jack the Ripper boasted (in the film) that he gave birth to the 20th Century. The horror of the human mind is the hell into which we see here. It is a truly unsettling view of the monstrousness of twisted thought, something far more terrifying than any physical deformity.The imagery and atmosphere are excellent to create a dark underworld hidden by the prim and proper veneer of the Victorian world. Insanity, drugs, power, misguided loyalty, and religious fanaticism -- all things we see in our own time -- are played out in this unnervingly dark mystery that would have Sherlock Holmes stunned and gasping.Depp gives a spooky, restrained performance, and Holm is wonderful in all elements of his presentation. The eyes of death have never been more dramatically revealed. And the real horror is that this story is based on one theory of what actually happened in the notorious Ripper crimes.If the Ripper gave birth to the 20th Century, what more horrors await in the 21st?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I hadn't read large quantities of Anne Perry's books (Pitt &amp; Monk Mysteries) set in this time period, I might have found the blatant class discrimination in the investigation of the Ripper Case appalling. Also, she has exposed the warfare between the Monarchists/Masons and everybody else who wanted change.If she hadn't already exposed the class discrimination that led decent women to have no choice to stay alive but to prostitute themselves and their horrific treatment in general let alone at the hands of the Ripper, I might also have found this shocking.But the addition of Johnny Depp's psychic detective was wasted which is way too bad because he is generally better than this. Robbie Coltrane was wasted too and the substitution of Shakespearian quotes for his dialogue just got annoying after awhile.This confused retelling of the theory that one of the Royal Sons of Queen Victoria was the ripper or the cover up blah blah mixed with the supposed secret Catholic marriage (which I was under the impression was the rumour about George IV when he was still the Prince of Wales and Maria Fitzherbert during the Regency period) doesn't make any sense.To make matters weirder they say that the Prince used the name Albert Sickert and the disguise of being a painter which is a nod to the alternate major ripper theory that the ripper was Walter Sickert, an established painter and amateur thespian with a mutilated penis from a childhood botched surgery and a major grudge against women who represented sexuality (hookers) because he couldn't actually have sex.Heather Graham did a better job with the accent than I thought she would although when she went home to Ireland you would think she would let her Irish accent come out rather than stick to cockney.This movie might be considered a needed dose of historically accurate social class prejudice revelation for those who didn't already know (which includes most Americans) but if I want me some real Depp action I will just watch Johnny in the brilliant "Ninth Gate" again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this comment does include spoilers technically, there's nothing in here that reveals more than a short movie premise...I watched this film many years ago but recently saw it again and felt a strong tendency to write this comment. In 1999 I was only eleven years old and I feel I can really appreciate it more now that I'm older. Don't get me wrong, I liked it when I was a kid, but mainly because I was into horror movies and this movie really scared me.Now, some time later, I do not feel the same way anymore, but instead can appreciate the other things about this film like the colors used, the acting and the various stylish elements applied(the great costumes, etc.)As most of you will know, 'From Hell' tells the semi-fictionalized story of Jack The Ripper, the worlds most notorious serial killer and also one of the first ones and most brutal ones to date. He's known not so much for the quantity of murders, he 'only' made five victims in that dark fall of 1888, but for the brutal way he slaughtered them and the whole mystery that surrounds the murders. The popular rumor that went around London faster than a running fire back then and still lives on today, is that a secret organization called 'the freemasons' was behind the killings, an organization comparable to 'The Skulls' the, let's say, American equivalent. There's no real hard proof for this presumption, but there are some strong leads in the direction. Of course, people like to believe that the magistrates and aristocracy is evil so they are likely to accept this hypothesis without much proof.Now about the movie itself, it has the benefit of a very strong lead cast, with the exception of the unfortunate choice for Heather Graham. She doesn't quite live up to the other actors, but she's not horrible either. I especially dug Robbie Coltrane, but Johnny Depp was fantastic too of course. He proves ones again that he is probably the most versatile actor of his generation, that he's not just 'Jack Sparow' like so many believe. That's a sad thing really, because he's been in some jewels like 'Donnie Brasco' and 'Blow'. What immediately got my attention was the very dark look given to the film, lensed with very intense dark bloody reds, poisonous greens and yellows and a variety of mahogany-ish brown colors. The city of Prague never looked so evil and ominous. Of course Prague is a beautiful setting that lends itself easily to great film-making. Still, I found Prague to be one of the most gorgeous cities of the world, very charming and sweet. To make it look like an evil harbor for the wicked and twisted is really the director's great achievement. It really looked like hell sometimes. There are some other elements that can't be left unmentioned: the repetitive use of the metal stairs of the carriage(the click sounds horrifying for some reason) and the great way in which the first murder is filmed. This proves once again the strength of the power of suggestion. You really make the most horrifying images in your brain, which is so much more frightening than if we'd actually seen the gory images. Of course, later on in the film it gets pretty hard for the weak stomached, but I never had a problem with that.Another great thing about this film, is the fact that it really is a multi-genre one, which is a rare quality these days (I mean this in the best way possible). It's not a horror film, not a pure thriller either, and not a drama. It's a little of all three and that is what makes the film so memorable in my opinion.For those of you who may not have seen it when reading this comment, even though I included a spoiler warning, you might be interested to know that this film is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore, the very same Alan Moore who created the fantastic 'V For Vendetta'. If you loved that, I can almost guarantee that you will like this too...So that's it for my comment, if you're not shocked by the bad quality of this comment than please check 'useful'. I'd appreciate it.A new review in a lil' while, keep track of them if you like, there are 75 now. This film gets 7.7 from me, well deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with many films based on true historical events, there have been a few liberties with the film plot. But the character of Frederick Aberline was very much real, and was the lead investigator of the Jack the Ripper murders. I just finished watching "Murder By Decree" a 1979 film on the ripper murder subject with Sherlock Holmes as the protagonist, and many of the critics of that film ran down this movie as be too far fetched, or Aberline as a second rate invention. But in fact Abeline (Johnny Depp) was very real, just as was Robert Lees the noted medium of the 1890's who worked with the police on several cases. I enjoyed "Murder by Decree" for it's style and cast but this film for it's more accurate portrayal of the events of the White Chapel murders. Depp and Coltrrane are excellent and well portrayed with their warts as well as their good qualities. This film stands well on it's own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Hollywood tries to pretend that the past never happened.Although uncredited, this film is a direct remake of a Sherlock Holmes film from 1979, "Murder by Decree", starring Christopher Plummer as Holmes. Even some of the camera set-ups and editing are the same."From Hell" adds more sex and a little more gore; also, its ending is depressingly negative.However, the original "Decree" was also pretty darn depressing. The detective, however brilliant, cannot move the mountains of society through the practice of reason and civility. The rich and the powerful, sick as they are, have some ability to reconstruct the world according to their own psychoses.No doubt. That was why the Plummer-Holmes film is not well remembered, and it is one of the elements in the present film that makes it, too, difficult to watch."From Hell", though depressing, is well made; the acting is solid; the mystery elements are handled well - although in place of Holmes' deductive powers, the case is solved more through some kind of magic or ESP (this was very unclear to me). Overall, the level of suspense keeping us watching is maintained.But I confess I am weary that we get these regurgitations presented to us as though they were brand new. In an era when the Government threatens to arrest working-class kids for downloading mp3s, the rich and the powerful seem to be able to bootleg and plagiarize all they choose.Dam' depressing, indeed.</fullReview>

There are some signs that point to the Queen and/or someone close to her being involved in the murders...The Hughes Brothers have managed to make a gripping movie (I haven't read the source material - a graphic novel - so I can't vouch for a perfect adaptation), not static and interested in long, boredom-filled scenes, but fast paced, intriguing and, especially true to how the Whitechapel murder scenes really were (they recreated Whitechapel in Hungary - or was it Romania? - to be as accurate as possible).And Depp, as usual, soars above his very good colleagues, making his Abberline as human as he can be, a man of words and action at the same time.From Hell: 10/10.</fullReview>

I would call it a thriller and not a horror. To me a thriller will always be a horror with a plot. From Hell had a good plot that kept you intrigued and guessing the whole way through. Of course the fact that Johnny Depp is one of the most attractive men on earth always helps bump the ratings. This movie is great to watch with a group of friends.

Was particularly impressed with Victorian scenes, costumes and true success with following actual story line of Jack the Ripper. Murder scenes as purportedly committed by The Ripper were somewhat gruesome, but after all, isn't that what happened? Still, I would follow the age limit rating due to scenes of violence and some of sexual connotation as well as drug use. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the clairvoyant/police inspector/opium addict was well-played and convincing. Supporting cast, (especially actress who portrayed Mary Kelly) was also well-chosen. Heart-wrenching and surprising ending made this film worthy of seeing at least twice. Favorite line? "Chasing the dragon" -- watch and enjoy!</fullReview>

It keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours, not to mention it looks beautiful.Heather Graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance, showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the Victorian era, and Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual, although (as others have pointed out) his English accent may be a little off, which I wouldn't know about since I'm American.This film is great entertainment and I would highly recommend buying the DVD (if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway, it's that good). From Hell makes a great addition to any movie collection.Also, buying it will help support the "WE WANT MORE R-RATED HORROR MOVIES" campaign!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London, 1888. Jack the Ripper.In the streets of White Chapel, there's the working classes, filth, grime, dirt, drunks, and prostitutes. The movie focuses in on a group of prostitutes. Heather Graham is Mary Kelly, a member of the group and the Ripper's last victim. Another one of them, Anne, has happily gotten out of the life by marrying a wealthy artist and having a child together. Her perfect life is shattered when strange men burst in (during the middle of a very steamy sex scene) and separate her from her husband and child. They disappear. Anne is diagnosed with dementia and is treated (a.k.a - 3 holes are hammered into her skull).From then all, the remaining girls are killed off one by one (by the Ripper of course). Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) investigates the murders as they occur. His opening scene is one in which he is having one of his "visions" while "chasing the dragon" (smoking opium) in an opium den. He "sees" the murders before or as they're occurring. Of course we all know of the Ripper, however, the movie is from the perspective that everything that happened, is happening as we watch. We are a part of Victorian London.Jack the Ripper is one of those mysteries. Numerous documentaries and movies have been made on the subject and various theories and conspiracies have been created, because of the lack of a information and a resolution. This movie resides happily within those folds. Just like the real investigation, the movie naturally has holes in it. It fills those hole with atmosphere and style. The murders are very graphics and gets progressively more graphic as the movie wears on. The mood is dark. London is in a perpetual coal fog and everything is black, brown, gray or covered with soot. Color is a sparse commodity, but when it shows is strangely captivating (mainly in the volume of fake blood used). I will not get into the various elements that make for an intriguing mystery as this might ruin the plot and the fun. There is romantic connection between Mary Kelly and Abberline, but it is subtle and is cut short by the plot. There is definitely a class struggle, but that is evident from Dickens and the period. This movie has always stood out in my mind because of its style and atmosphere. I didn't find it scary but at the same time I never feel quite comfortable. It is like your leg starting to fall asleep, yet you are unable to do anything about it. Abberline's ritualistic smoking of opium and his bathtub Absinthe preparation are classic. I can safely say Johnny Depp taught me about and how to drink Absinthe. All in all, this is an intriguing movie worthy of at least a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is the definition of the Hughes brother's style!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was really good, but throughout that next week, images and the look of the film stayed with me. The Hughes Brother's depiction of 19th century England is as I have always imagined; the peasantry and the upper class being so separated, the look of the buildings, people, cobblestone roads, fog, and lastly the Legend of Jack the Ripper. Also, keep an eye out for the Hughes brother's use of the camera.This is my favorite Johnny Depp role; he is an addict, genius, poet, and is constantly haunted by the visions he receives. Johnny Depp has amazing versatility as an actor. His English accent was very surprising.I hope any history buff or person that is interested in the Jack the Ripper case watches this film. It is truly wonderful to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fairly good film and Johnny Depp is, as always, good in it. What got me to write any comment was some of the "supposed" goofs as reported here. The main one is about the surgeon "Ferral" being called "Doctor". We are informed that a surgeon would have then and would be now called "Mister" not "Doctor" in England. This is almost but not quiet correct. In PROPER British usage he WOULD, as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, be called Mister. In general and lay usage, however, he is very likely to be called "Doctor" even though he isn't one. Witness Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (1901) in which James Mortimer, MRCS is referred to as DOCTOR Mortimer pretty much throughout even though he himself tells Holmes "Mister, sir, Mister, a humble MRCS." This craze for finding so-called goofs gets out of hand, sometimes, and, as in this case, sometimes the goofs aren't true goofs at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie a little bit ago and I think I was able to confirm this as my favorite Johnny Depp film. He's always been hit and miss for me. I tend to like him in his more serious roles(Secret Window,Sleepy Hollow,From Hell) and I do have a fondness for Edward Scissorhands. But you can't pay me to try and sit through Benny and Joon or Cry Baby. Mr. Depp really hit the spot for me on this one. I believed in his character who albeit in a constant depressive state, or just plain jacked on opium, he was on his game in his hunt for the legendary Jack the Ripper.But he also had a good supporting cast,however, Ill omit Heather Graham. I don't know, I just didn't think she brought much to the movie and quite frankly I just thought she was just the whore with the most lines. But one of the final scenes took it home just based on sheer acting as Johnny Depp finally confronted who he believed was the madman.The scares are there people and so is the gore so if you want a fine-tuned re-telling of the most famous serial killer known, plus being led by a veteran who can do it all, then go grab the nachos and watch From Hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bold and splendidly tense adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel. In order of not to offend the viewer's intelligence. A very rare example of adult movie, despite of three decades of infantilization of the movie market. Some curious shots of the UGLE's Masonic Temple, and an very resumed Initiation on the York(Emulation) Rite. The mysteries involved The Ripper's crimes were, of course, linked on freemasonry matters, only because of the equal 'discreption' of the noble fraternity, but, otherwise, the disposition of corpses, in the sequence of killings indeed makes a pentacle star. An accurate detail that Mr. Moore and the screenwriters had kept intact of the original crime scenes. Let us remember that the Whitechapel District were, at the late 19th century, crowded of British Caballah students, for the Jewish neighborhood and for any occultist, or even for a free mason, or Rosicrucian, a Pentacle Star IS truly a symbol of the man in evolutionary ascendant state, and, the same star, in reverse, the 'Baphomet', or 'Sophia'(greek word for Wisdom), in ATBACH system of Hebrew language conversion, makes the analogue image of the 'Goat of Mendes', or, the Devil, in symbolic compilation. Those are some newly added details that could make us give another look on the Ripper's murders. Otherwise, one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Latest Favorite Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kept saying when this movie came out in theaters, that I would see it, but I never did. It just was not a priority as I underestimated the ability of the Hughes brothers to direct a period piece. Well I rented it and from the very beginning I was rooting for this film but didn't expect much, and 10 minutes into the film, I knew I was watching a brilliant movie. At first I tried to find flaws, but became so engrossed in the story that I soon just allowed myself to enjoy it. As far as the accents, they may not have been true cockney, but I often have have trouble understanding the real thing! I rented Snatch which seemed funny during the trailers but after 5 minutes the accents drove me buggers!!! I found the acting delightful, with excellent and believable performers. The movie was so visually stimulating that I had to watch it several times just to capture all the nuances of the extra's! I noticed a lot of people criticized the story line, the direction etc. Don't people go to the movies to be entertained anymore? Or does everybody now seek higher education. I was very impressed that the Hughes brothers known for their "hood" movies successfully directed an all "White period piece" proving that the world is really getting smaller and more familiar. This movie is a triumph on so many levels. Who cares that the theory the movie was based on is in my opinion, one of the least likely. But boy what a great story. And for some of us who still care about such things, a great story is all we ultimately care about. I highly recommend this movie to anyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exploring the almost mythic story of Jack the Ripper, this movie gets your right down in the slums with the victims of the story. Depp's character is a bit hard to relate to because he spends a lot of time in a drug-induced haze, even though he is lucid enough while on the job. He'd be nowhere without the friendship of his sidekick played by Coltrane Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is it is hard to see Inspector Abberline's (Depp) motivation to solve the murders, at least until he develops some interest in one of the potential victims, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). Even then he seems so lightweight that he could just be blown away. An atypical hero.A very good choice for a weekend rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was excellent! Depp's cockney accent is great...but I don't think Abberline was from the East End of London. Johnny has charisma and played it extremely well. I think he should have been nominated for an award. Heather Graham is gorgeous...and her accent could have used a little more work. Her acting was good, better than I have seen in any of her films. The actress that played Catherine Eddows should have been a thin brunette...that was a mistake.And the latest findings on Jack the Ripper (from the author Patricia Cornwell) show that the British painter, Walter Sickert was really Jack the Ripper...and yes, he did kill 5 women and maybe even some young children. Patricia Cornwell spent 3 million dollars on a new investigation with Scotland Yard and she came up with new DNA evidence that links a letter to Walter Sickert, the famous British painter. So as entertaining as this movie is...the new Sickert theory is the most convincing Jack the Ripper so far. I was disappointed that they didn't use this new theory. The real Mary Kelly was young and beautiful...the rest of the victims were in their forties and homely. . Bravo From Hell...best Ripper movie yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if the Jack the Ripper scenario scares you or bores you, this film (sorely under-appreciated) throws ANOTHER door open on possibilities ..beside all the "Jack" theories in books or legend. The Hughes Brothers (filming in Warsaw) create that dark, dank, and badly-lit with smells that would curl your hair WORLD that inhabits the future..mostly.J. Depp (great actor) is a marvel as Inspector Abbeline (loner, sensitive, addict, idealist/skeptic/hunter) and I'm surprised the bashing some people gave Heather Graham (not a great actress, but fine in this..and others) for her performance and ACCENT. Are you kidding me? Her accent was actually truer, but her white teeth made people uncomfortable as an 1880's street girl, ..plus MOST people think she can't act. Spare me the details. Ian Holm (one of the great "Supporting English Actors" since the 60's and they're) is sublime as a doctor. Throw in John Merrick (famous East End character - also under-appreciated) and Caitlyn who recently died as one of Graham's street family and what have you got? A politically incorrect, somewhat "old" theory about JACK and the 21st century is too hip and modern to buy SOME of these grievous tale of woe and horror.The best film (in my opinion) of a decent year that doesn't sell soap. Robby Coltrane is also believable as a Depp cohort. Great sets, cinematography a bit TOO dark (lighting-wise), and a compelling guessing game that the mystery will never solve. Check out this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thriller I've seen in long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in 1988 in whitechappel, London, this film follows the story of Jack the Ripper, and the detective that is assigned to the case, inspector Albiline (johnny Depp). The whole film is incredibly stylistic, using a mix of filming techniques, including dreams, hallucinations and the more common types. The sound track is great, and the plot is good and easy to understand, even a child could understand this film! The length is fine, some think it is too long but if it had been shorter then they would have had to miss stuff out, which is what can spoil a good film (think Harry potter).This film is shot in a similar style to Baz Luhrmann's moulin rouge, its is full of color, with great detail given to the style and color of each scene. The only think that really lets this film down is the end credits, they are done in a style that makes a film look dated even 4 years after it is made. The actors try their best, depp is great, as is Coltrane, who plays depps sidekick. Heather Graham is average, but the accent isn't fooling anyone! A great film with a great twist, a lovely insight into Victorian London, whilst the style it was shot in will keep film students going for years! Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

The movie is well made and Johnny Depp plays his character flawlessly, with the exception of the occasional slip on the British accent.

		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe movie, "From Hell" starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham is about the investigations of a young detective (Johnny Depp) as he tries to track the infamous Jack the Ripper. Along the way he falls in love with a young prostitute (Heather Graham)who is one of the Ripper's targets and is torn between his commitment to the case and his desire to protect his sexed crazed lover.There's only one thing that keeps me from recommending this film: it's strange plot. The film has characters running all over the place and in my humble opinion often dosen't explain why they're doing what they are. Especially that strange brotherhood crap we find out the Ripper belongs to. Another that vexes me is the fact that the film tries to get you to beleive that some old geezer is the one commiting these crimes. Correct me if I'm wrong, but we haven't ever figured out who the real Ripper was. We only have our assumptions. I'm not one to beleive that some fat elderly dude was killing all these hookers. Other than the that, the film wasn't to bad. The gore is on and the overall idea of the film is noble. It's just the confusing plot and that damn old geezer...5/10 stars- JESSE BEDELL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Hell = Murder By Decree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Hell" is an excellent Jack the Ripper film, really well produced with good solid acting. For me the most disturbing fact was that the idea of why the Ripper murders happened is extremely close to the film "Murder By Decree" in which Sherlock Holmes goes after old Jack. It is a plausible idea and one that could easily be the answer to the whole puzzle.Johnny Depp's Abberline, while using the name of the real detective, is not what the actual Abberline was. In one of the many books devoted to this first serial killer, Abberline is quoted as stating that they did know who the Ripper was but could do nothing because of who he was. This certainly fits the solution in both "Murder By Decree" and "From Hell".The producers are to be commended for not turning this into a "slasher" film. Yes, there are some disturbing sections, but they are shown quickly and not in graphic detail. The bodies are shown in brief shots that give the idea of the mutilations, but now great detail. The reactions of the coroner, his assistants and the detectives give the idea of how horrible the situation is better than any picture. The bittersweet ending is perfect for the film, but what happens to Abberline is far from the history of the actual man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victorian London via Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this film, I had to realize that I am a great fan of the graphic novel; I consider it to be one of the great works of graphic storytelling, along with "The Dark Knight Returns" and "Watchmen". It is, therefore, somewhat difficult to put aside any bias I might have had toward this film from the beginning. I did try, but it certainly didn't make it easy.First, just to start off light, for the good points: the film is visually quite arresting. The sets, the cinematography, the camera work, all work together to create a very interesting vision of 1880's London. It isn't what you'd call a realistic vision, but it is interesting nonetheless. Unfortunately, visually stylistic films are a dime a dozen these days. It takes more than that to impress.Sadly, the film doesn't have much else. The Hughes brothers are obviously quite familiar with the novel, but sadly, they've only picked out the seedy trappings of it, and left out what really made it work. Where the novel extensively examined the world in which Jack went about his work, the film ditches all of that and settles instead on a standard murder mystery. We've seen this story a hundred times in countless modern serial killer thrillers. By keeping the identity of Jack a mystery, and following the investigations of Inspector Abberline, they have reduced the story to something very drab and unoriginal.Among the worst touches is Abberline's psychic ability. The "vision" sequences are more annoyingly modern than creepy, and really don't seem to help him much in his investigations, or aid the story in its journey. They simply add an unwelcome supernatural element to events based (however loosely) on reality. I can only imagine that the film-makers' intention was to combine two characters from the novel. However, the novel's "psychic" admitted to being a fraud. So why is this here?A Hollywood product mentality is found throughout the production. While the supporting whore roles are filled out very believably, Heather Graham is instead cast in the role of the "Friday The 13th" virgin who is immune to harm because we never see her engaging in sex. She stands out like a sore thumb among the grime with her colorful dress and pretty hair and makeup. They've done away with Abberline's marriage in order to make way for a romance with Heather Graham's "whore". And the mistaken-identity ending sets up a conclusion so saccharine as to belong in a Shirley Temple movie.In the end "From Hell" turns out to be nothing more than a standard Hollywood serial killer movie with the words "Jack the Ripper" inserted into it. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Mary Kelly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, loosely based on the graphic novel of the same name, does not offer an accurate account of the events in Whitechapel, autumn 1888, and it doesn't pretend that it does, so folks preoccupied with the Ripper-case don't have to rush and fill the goof-section with corrections regarding the actual ongoings. It also doesn't rely much on the graphic novel, with the exception of the choice for the perpetrator and all this would imply, although different from the novel keeps it a who-dunnit till the end. The movie is a Hollywood action-horror-romance populated with historical figures who underwent even more liberty, ranging from shallow drafting over purpose-posing to audacious character-alteration. In this sense, recreating parts of Whitechapel in Prague, and this still way too clean, was with all the inaccuracy probably not necessary. But OK, it's a show, and the real background story remains captivating enough, as well as Depp's acquired accent and Coltrane's presence.Too many things strangle the effort, however, starting with the main weakness of Heather Graham being cast and outfitted as Mary Kelly. While the other victims, struggling prostitutes in the most ragged quarters of London, were all made up to more or less look that way, torn clothes, unmade hair, bad teeth and no make-up, not to mention the required acting, Graham's Mary Kelly sticks out the way Cinderella would if arriving in Whitechapel after the ball: hair perfect, careful make-up, tidy, clean, unharmed dresses, and Miss Graham is ready for the cast- party. Needless to say, we never see her getting drunk or even just attempting to go after her trade like the others. But then she's the love-interest, of course. Which is another very ill-advised idea, and we see virtually all cliché Hollywood-rules unfolding, a killer when it comes to this particular crime-case.The movie superficially shines with a cast of very able actors, Depp, Richardson, Holm, Coltrane, the late wonderful Katrin Cartlidge, to name a few, and yet, although the fantasy- and horror-genre ever so often tickles surprising performances out of well known stars, nothing breathtaking happens here, with the exception of Holm's play (although watch, he's doing the chin-thing again), too deep the tracks of expectation in character-behaviour are, and too dominant.Fusing an inspector and a self acclaimed medium, who both had been involved, to a clairvoyant inspector might have, with some tolerance, given this re-telling of the story some spice, but the idea went out in a puff in the end. The choice to stick to the graphic novel's conspiracy-take and involvement of the Freemasonry, which Moore himself, with good reason, didn't insist on being the most promising one, decides a course, of course, one that had already been taken once with 'Murder By Decree', and by taking it a lot of rather interesting theories, indicators and characters have to go out the window, but here we go.'From Hell' is pure entertainment, shallow, spotless, with a camera-work good for the eye, lines that fit together and no claim for authenticity. It kept me watching, mainly for the never ceasing fascination with the Whitechapel-murders, leaning back for the ride. It's not a very good movie, though. I'd give it a well-meaning 4, but the Graham-Kelly, so present throughout and in favour over a chance for an interesting Mary Kelly, spoils it. Hence a 3.And: will there ever be a truly engaging, good movie about the subject?</fullReview>

So exit some brilliant ideas (the mystic London, the ingenious plot, the royal family scandal, the scapegoat, the false clairvoyant, ...) and welcome stupid innovations (the stoned detective, the Spanish doctor, ?). I am sure that if they could, they would have changed London for New York and replaced the ripper by a butcher! Now, the beginning of the movie and the murders appear more stupid than my first viewing!

		<fullReview>"From Hell", yet another "Jack the Ripper" flick, is somewhat over wrought with lavish cinematography imbuing what we'd like to believe is a bleak and dank Whitechapel District of London with richness; a street whore protagonist (Graham) somehow insulting in her sweetness; and a Scotland Yard sleuth (Depp) uncharacteristically dashing considering his beginning and his end. In spite of these and many other foibles, the Hughes bros and company have breathed life into the old and moldy "Ripper" lore with a film which propagates still another hypothesis, a somewhat interesting and entertaining story though more of a curiosity and a conquest. Worth a look especially for those who are unfamiliar with good ol' "Jack's" tall tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No No No.....what have the Hughes Brothers done to this factual historical story, it`s awful....there are so many bad points, l think it is dreadful that a story like this can maline people so much...The good points...the atmosphere was good, the sets were good, the acting (apart from Johnny Depp-mind you his accent was superb)...The BAD points...(l have studied the Ripper Case-this is the known truth)Fred Aberline was not a drug addict, he did like his drink though... Fred Aberline was not a psychic...Rober Lees was the Queens Medium and had dreams that he imparted that information to Fred Aberline... Fred Aberline did not fall in love with a prostitute...(this was a silly side of the film) Johnny Depp was totally the wrong age...Fred Aberline was an much older person....Johnny Depps age in this film would mean that he would not be in such a high position...I think it is completely wrong from directors/writers to take some factual character and bend it to their way just to make money, my advice to anyone wanting to watch a good film about Jack the Ripper should see Michael Caine in "Jack the Ripper" or Chris Plummer in "Murder by Decree"My mark out of 10....3</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BARF Is the only word that can describe this movie. I think what happend is this; Two people were walking up some stairs and they bumped into each other causing the two scripts to fall out of there hands, thus emerging the two into one. I know this was based on a novel but I cant believe it was this horrible. The movie lacked clarity and oh yeah a plot that made any sense!!!!! While I was watching the movie I was not scared of the ripper,and I felt the opposite i wished he would come do me too, so that I would be put out of the misery from watching FROM HELL. This is a good title because it was agony to watch the movie, and I felt like I was in hell for it's enterity. I think even Jack the Ripper himself would be rolling in his grave( whom ever he may be.) I would not recommend this movie to anyone I liked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> After watching this movie, I think the tag-line should have been, "Got Grapes?" (Got Milk?) or "Ah, The Power of Grapes" (Ah, the Power of Cheese). The hero is an opium addict who has ability to envision tomorrows murder, today. He is supposed to be very smart. At one point he is drawing locations of different spots where bodies were recovered, and based on that he figures out that this has some significance in terms of some cult and predicts the location of next murder. At that point he had a good idea that the reason those women were being murdered was that they were witness to a wedding of some loser prince and somebody wanted them to be eliminated. My question is, why didn't he post all the idiot cops right outside that ONE room where all of those women lived? Wouldn't it be easy to just ask a pair of cops to FOLLOW the remaining two or three women in that ONE room? He knew who was getting killed, and why, yet there were cops everywhere but outside that one spot. This is level of idiocy not seen before in any crime movie. Another question: Shouldn't the hero have told the remaining women, NOT TO TALK TO STRANGERS WHO GIVE YOU GRAPES? How about questioning couple of fruit vendors? He also knew the killer was rich and educated, and there were more than one suspect at hand. Yet Jack-The-Rip-OFF gallops through those narrow streets in his carriage, and no one seemed to take a note. The dialogue, the acting, the sets, the cast, the characters, were so horrible, that I found myself rooting for Jack! His acting was best in whole movie, but could not save it from being one of the worst movies ever made. Instead of buying a ticket for this movie, I would have been better off if I had bought grapes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****Right into the 19th century in the heart of England. The accents, the people and the city gives a breath of the time. Nice little touch with a man giving illegal protection to prostitutes, instead of being the ordinary coupler. Being true to both the age and the country (speaking of the language) raises the bar both for what may come in the movie and also creates the precise and trustworthy frame to "From hell". Joyce Gallie and Sally Osoba has been able to gather true British talent in seeking of the authentic expression; Ian Holm, Ian McNiece and Robbie Coltrane is just a few there.As of many movies that Johnny Depp is both involved in and also acts in, there is an vast theatrical sense going right through the screen in here. Maybe it fits the 19th century as the story is rolling out into, and maybe it fits anyway. It made me wonder, even so. Interesting to watch with those clear and explicit expressions and acting.The way Jack The Ripper is presented shows what way the producers, the writers and the entire team behind the motion picture wanted to go. The criminal killer is embedded in a gentle costume that has a solitude feeling of a sophisticated count, with the black cape, pure white gloves and the black hat. Add the little toolbox by velvet with knifes and such that is treated with a careful hand, being clean, in order and structured... then you have "The Ripper" in here... as a terrifying and hidden monster growing for more... As if being displayed on stage as theatre. Appreciated!Some special effects blended with dark orchestral music creates moments here and there that pushes this film upwards both in entertainment and quality, besides the planning of the mentioned. A picture is taken of the photographer; flash, and a black and white second is being displayed. 28 min and 30 seconds, a blood red sky gives the impression of the pure grit that grips hold of the situation. Astonishing! At 41 minutes, the fast cuts as knifes cuts through the air showing the instruments of dissect, and a filter of strange colour for the screen. The colour of red is recurring here and there, just to underline the stream of blood that is important for the "refined gentleman that has drops of blood in the wine and eats rare steaks", Mr. Ripper himself. A delicate touch of art, there.Underneath all this theatrical undertones, expressed acting and the story itself, there lies a clear social question mark; how far will the human being go for the sake of science? Can it be any good in killing innocent people to receive and get the answer for important breakthroughs in medical and scientific matters? Can it be any good in showing horrible diseases as in the old freak shows and circuses, to get the mentioned breakthroughs? Just look at about 46 minutes into "From hell". Interesting how Joyce Gallie and Sally Osoba gets the whole storyline together, indeed. Raw brutality and effective and close detective work, plus the atmosphere that it all brings into "From hell". In "The Silence Of The Lambs", it's "I ate his liver with a can of beans and a bottle of Chianti". In "From hell"; "I send you half the kidney I took from one woman, preserved for you. The other piece, I fried and ate. It was very nice!". Psychological frightening. And then, the title being mentioned in its fully state: 1 hour and 15 minutes.Sadly, "From hell" only reaches a little above a good movie. To reach for the high and excellent rate, they should have pushed more into the actors, pushed more into the written dialogue both in timing and social expressions as for a more vast and appropriate vocabulary (as some expressions is over used, such as "these unfortunates" and "whores"), more well written screenplay, worked harder for the extras/the figurants to be better, dug deeper for the special effects, pushed harder for the realism and the authentic feeling of the blood and the gore, a more believable and distanced relationship between Abberline and Mary, and created a better soundtrack. Then, "From hell" would have taken a better place in movie history.I really want to give this film a higher rate. And.. again, sadly, I will settle with around 6-7.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made! Costumes, the era of the century, the society... then some little vague production speaking of let's say the blood. - The actors : Some good, some just above approved. This kind of movie maybe sort the acting out by itself, leaving an experience of art for the viewer. Robbie Coltrane gives a solid touch of the sophisticated yet straightforward English man; nice to see. Heather Grahams attempts to give the character some depth is dearly missed, I might say. They should have gone with some other actress there (to get the innocent prostitute with working moral and social ambition) to grow and be displayed. - Entertainment : Yes. - Age : 15 or maybe even 18. This is due to the grotesque art that the story gives, and also the cruelty, the harsh environment and much nasty gore. Add Jack The Ripper, some horror elements and a mysterious form of script line, and maybe 18.6,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you dislike this movie. Then, don't know Jack! In my opinion, From Hell is a killer horror movie, even with its flaws!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the fall of 1888, a series of five brutal murders shocks Victorian London. The victims, all poor female prostitutes, are murdered and then mutilated, by an unidentified serial killer, only known to the public, as Jack the Ripper. It became known as the White Chapel Murders. Ever since then, the unsolved mystery of the identity of the killer has been intrigue, both historians, scholars, and normal people for over a century now. It seems like everybody has a theory on who is the killer. One of those people, was writer Alan Moore. Taking its name from a letter, supposedly sent by the killer to the White Chapel Vigilance Committee, Alan Moore wrote the graphic novel 'From Hell' from 1989 to 1996 with cartoonist, Eddie Campbell. He wrote that the murders were part of a conspiracy to conceal the birth of an illegitimate royal baby fathered by then-Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence (Mark Dexter). While, this plot sound realistic interesting. It's fictional as hell. Also, their 'Royal Conspiracy' theory wasn't that original. In truth, the 'Royal Conspiracy" theory, was taken from author, Stephen Knight's 1976's 'Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution' book. Unfortunately, this book is not a historically accurate one. It's riddled with historical errors, coincidences, and fabrications. Like the book, the film doesn't know that in real life, that the royal scandal was more about the prince's hidden homosexual than his fathering of an illegitimate son. Nor did they knew that the Freemasons at the time was nearly powerless, due to the height of anti-masonry due to mobile economically during the Industrial Revolution, plus the weakening of longstanding family and community ties. It doesn't help, that film directed by the Hughes Brother is only a loose adaptation of the comic, often taking a different approach. While, I did like the building on the mystery &amp; allowing the police inspector, Fredrick Abberline (Johnny Depp) to be the main character. Others things about the film kinda irritate me. I hate that the huge changes, involving the character of painter, Walter Sickert (Max Dexter). The idea that Sickert and the Prince are the same person is a bit much. Very off-putting, seeing how way different, these two men were in real-life. Plus, the killer's depth is reduced and much of the sophistical themes were also lost. Another thing, the idea of mixing the two characters of Inspector Frederick Abberline with fraudulent psychic, Robert James Lees into one, was a bit jarring. It doesn't make sense that he would be the head of the police department with such clairvoyant views. Another thing, the radical changes to Abberline from an older, gritty overweight conservative detective to a young drug addict inspector was just as puzzling. What type of police would allow a known-opium user to be the head of it!? I have to say; while Johnny Depp is a fine actor, and was alright in the role; I thought, his on-screen American Boy Scout good-looks and lack of British accent was a bit distracting. Also, the force love story between him and the lead prostitute, Mary Kelley (Heather Graham) was just as improbably. Heather Graham is alright, but it's nothing to write about. The supporting cast is also great, the women that play the victims, were memorable, however, it's Ian Holms as Sir William Gull &amp; Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Peter Godley that steals the movie, even if they were a bit hammy. From Hell is also one of the most beautifully atmospheric and visually gruesome period films about that era. In many ways, the film was very true to life, particularly in its recreation of Whitechapel and its portrayal of the everyday lives of its inhabitants. I really did felt like I step back into the haunting, yet wonderful world of Victorian England. It's so authentic. I even like the cameo of the Elephant Man, himself; John Merrick (Anthony Parker). The make-up work is also decent. I like how well, the gore effects look. The music of Trevor Jones was just as haunting. Overall: While, this movie does have some faults, it really didn't hurt the film, too much. I still somewhat enjoy the film. I have to say, the movie wasn't as predictable as some critics think it is. While, the order and names of the victims are well-known, the film still have time to show some twist and turns with the story. Yet, the film should certainly not be viewed as an authentic representation of the Ripper crimes as a whole. Still, the film serves as a good introduction to new viewers to the case and bring a new unique spin to those who know its history. It's fictional as hell, but entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This period-piece adaptation of Alan Moore's work better than I expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this having only seen 'The Book of Eli' by these directors, The Hughes Brothers. I quite liked that film, although I did feel their vivacious stylizations interfered with the telling of the story. Seeing this earlier film of theirs confirmed that suspicion, though it's still a fine film. Though Johnny Depp (the brothers' 5th choice for the lead) does a fine job as the film's protagonist (I haven't read Alan Moore's graphic novel yet, so I can't say how this filmic adaptation compares), it certainly would have been interesting to see how any of their previous choices would have done (in order of their preference): Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Connery, Jude Law and Brad Pitt (but especially either of the first two). It has a fine supporting cast, is beautiful to look at and is consistently intriguing. I especially liked Heather Graham (I think this is solidly amongst her best work), Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane and, most significantly, Katlin Cartlidge. Boy, do I ever miss her in films made ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The grisliest Jack the Ripper yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Jack the Ripper has long been of interest in the horror cinema. Right back in the creaky old days of the silents he made his appearances in the likes of 1926's WAXWORKS and Hitchcock's THE LODGER. An infamous black and white British version of the tale, made in 1959 by a cheap rival to Hammer, has fallen into obscurity but is still best remembered for the final reel, in which the killer is caught beneath a lift and the screen turns to glorious blood red colour for an instant to capture his gory demise. In the 1970s, European horror veteran Jess Franco gave us his typically sleazy variant with 1976's nasty JACK THE RIPPER, with Klaus Kinski in the leading role, whilst Spanish stalwart Paul Naschy made his own variant. In 1988, to mark the centenary of the Ripper murders, a supposedly definitive television miniseries was made in America starring Michael Caine as the investigating policeman. It's a good but flawed telling of the story marred only by the TV-movie level it never rises above. And now, to mark the new millennium, two brothers best known for their gangster rap movies have given the world FROM HELL, which is for a change based on a graphic novel (which I haven't read) of the Ripper story rather than the real-life murder investigation itself.As a horror film, it works. Everything about this film screams style and class. For a change the gory murders and surgical operations that Jack carries out on his deeply unfortunate victims are shown in graphic detail, rather than only being spoken of like in previous versions of the tale, and no expense is spared in giving us graphic, stomach-churning scenes of the cloaked Ripper calmly sawing out the internal organs of his female victims, kneeling above their prone bodies. Entrails are torn out and wrapped around necks and throats are slashed emitting geysers of crimson gore. Police surgeons repeatedly vomit at the sight of the mutilated corpses and quick flash cuts show us all we need to know about the severity of the crimes, so on a visceral level at least FROM HELL offers pure horror, sometimes nausea-inducing and all the more effective for it. Scenes of the victims being stalked at night by the cruel killer are highly suspenseful, heightened by the dark, baroque music that accompanies them and a high class of acting from all concerned.Attention to detail also contributes to this movie's success and I would go so far as to say that this is the most authentic-looking Jack the Ripper film that I've yet to see. Although some of the choice language is a little too modern to be that convincing the rest of the dialogue, the sets, the scenery and the costumes are spot-on. You have to love the brief appearance of the Elephant Man into the thick of the action and the secret society of Freemasons who operate below ground. Characters sport lived-in clothes rather than the off-the-shelf garb of the Caine miniseries and the London setting is brilliantly portrayed as a rancid den of sleaze and open depravity, packed with opium dens, pubs full of drunken angry men, and streets littered with filth and beggars.The cinematography is spot-on and helps to transport you back to 1888, putting you into the realism of the action as we watch drug-induced nightmares of the Ripper slicing up his victims and taking them to pieces. After the initial half hour which bluntly introduces Jack's figure into the depressing London streets the film takes the form of a detective tale as policeman Johnny Depp searches for clues to find the identity of the killer. Once again the film takes the well-worn conspiracy route of there being a royal connection to the killer, so whilst it lacks the element of surprise (aside from those who are complete Ripper novices) the final unmasking of the villain is still a fine piece of shock cinema and the last reel very exciting, incorporating a violent cab ride and the most gruesome murder saved for last into the proceedings.The cast is bolstered by a host of familiar British faces like Ian Richardson who bring a touch of class to the production although ironically the two leads are American (though you wouldn't guess it, as they do sport impeccable accents as is the norm these days). Johnny Depp once again proves he can do no wrong and it's fair to say that he's become a mini-horror star in recent years with all the genre productions he keeps making. Depp's opium-addicted young policeman makes a nice change from the decent, elder investigators (like Michael Caine in the 1988 miniseries) and he plays a charming, interesting central figure and one which the audience can thankfully emphasise with. Robbie Coltrane plays it tough as Depp's sergeant and basically acts as the comic relief of the production (and boy, does this horrific outing need it). Heather Graham (BOOGIE NIGHTS) is also delightful as Mary Kelly, a would-be victim of the Ripper, and as well as looking spot-on in the role, all flowing red locks and heaving bosoms just like in one of the old Hammer films, plays her part with some skill.I don't have an unpleasant word to say about anyone else, but special kudos goes to Ian Holm who plays a kindly retired surgeon in one of his last major roles. Subtle use of black contact lenses turn the killer into a deeply scary-looking man and the actor playing Jack really does deserve an Oscar for his role here - the final murder in which he believes he is teaching a class is magnificently-evoked stuff and very clever indeed. FROM HELL is a quality production and one of the better versions of the tale and it will certainly take some doing to better this in the future; for now be content in watching what is a well-paced, scary, sometimes disturbing modern horror yarn.</fullReview>

Pretty sure it never happened like in From Hell but it doesn't matter. It's an entertaining movie and that's all we want. Johnny Depp as Inspector Frederick Abberline is of course the main character and does a good job like we are used from him. The other actors are all good as well. It might not be the best story I ever saw from Jack The Ripper but it keeps you interested till the end. It's a dark movie, everything I would expect from London Whitechapel in that period. And for that alone you should give credit to this movie. Nice filming with nice sound effects and with good actors. What else do we need?</fullReview>

Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) is a physician to the Royals and a respected medical teacher.I love the dark, murky, brutal style. It's fitting for the times and the subject matter.

Which I can only say about maybe a few dozen movies, and I've seen at least 500 if not more.Depp and Graham both nail the accents, no keanu reeve Dracula gaffs here, and we actually care about them which is refreshing in a who-done-it where the tendency is to let your characters serve as simplistic symbols.The production design should have won an Oscar, and the scoring likewise was splendid. I couldn't believe the hughes brothers directed this, Dead presidents was at best a tepid experience, Menace to Society better but still basically just an above average genre pic. This on the other hand is a classic, better than anything spike lee or singleton ever even thought about making. They're use of hip hop montage against the backdrop of a history piece was truly genius. Of all the mystery horror films I've seen from hell ranks number 1 in visual innovation and in the top 5 over all. A definite must see</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie of a "great" killer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, directed by The Hughes Brothers, has Johnny Depp in the main role and deals with the story of Jack the Ripper, probably one of the most successful killers of all time, as not only was never caught and tried as, even today, we don't know what their true identity. The film plays with this situation to show us one of the most famous theories about the killer's identity: that would be a figure of British royalty or someone close to the ruling circles. The film also shows us the misery and poverty in which the lower classes of London lived, in a time when being poor often meant to live in the limits of the law to survive, and numb the pain of life in abuse of drugs or alcohol. Depp plays one of the inspectors highlighted by Scotland Yard to investigate and arrest the mysterious killer, who only kills prostitutes but that is so fierce and so meticulously bloody that quickly spread terror through the streets of Whitechapell. The actor shone in the role, managing to give the character a contradictory personality, spread in their desire to do justice, in the way he falls in love and in the addictions he feeds.A film recommended for all who enjoy a good cop movie, with a minimum expenditure of bullets and bloodshed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vibrant, gorgeous horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hugh's Brothers From Hell may play havoc with the facts of the actual Jack the Ripper case, and sometimes veers into syrupy sentiment, but for the most part it's a sumptuous, wonderfully spooky shocker with an austere, gloom and doom vibe and some genuinely horrifying murder scenes. I consider it a companion piece to Sleepy Hollow, as they both positively drip with atmosphere, and share the same star in Johnny Depp, as a troubled Inspector attempting to solve equally chilling homicides. Granted Sleepy Hollow is the fun one, while From Hell has almost no sense of humour and a sense of grave danger from right out of the gate. Johnny Depp plays Frederick Abberline, an opium addicted Scotland Yard inspector who's roped into an obsessive search for Jack The Ripper, aided by his sergeant Peter Godley (always nice to see Hagrid- I mean Robbie Coltrane). He gets embroiled in aristocratic corruption, and attempts to protect beautiful prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham with red hair!) who fears she may be next on old Jack's list. He begins to suspect that his opium induced nightmares may provide a conduit to the killers actions, and give him something to go on. Is he losing it? Or are the drugs actually giving him metaphysical clues? Depp plays him with a forlorn, world weary malaise that's a nice front for the razor sharp intellect that made Abberline famous (he also took down the Wolfman earlier in life). Bilbo Bagg- I mean Ian Holm shows up as a renowned doctor who assists him, and Jason Flemyng as a no good coach driver, with Sophia Myles, Katrin Kartlidge and David Schofield as a grinning, evil east end pimp rounding out the roster. Now, because in real life it's an unsolved case, the Brother's Hugh's feel like they have to complete full circle, and give us a nice tidy resolution. I feel like the film should have left it open ended and never given us a who in the whodunit. It would have made the film so much more effective and eerie, but alas the studio heads must be babysat through a generic narrative to appease their financial anxiety. No matter, it's still a rich, gorgeous, bloody genre piece with an evocative, smoky London palette for this ghostly predator to stalk and slay, and for hard nosed law dogs to pursue him through the fog. Definitely a piece to check out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite nice Victorian drama although the ending is quite tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot say that I am an outright fan of old era British crime stories but I do fancy them now and then. This one is a rather dark, grim and gloomy story perfectly suitable as a evening movie at this time of the year when darkness already starts to come quickly and matches the candlelight mood of Victorian London.I found this a quite nice movie. Well up to its very end which I have to admit is way too tragic for my taste. The voyage to the end was well worth watching though. The dark scenery is very well done. Beautiful and depressing at the same time. It is yet another Jack the Ripper based story and it is pretty much pure fiction loosely based on the character of Jack the Ripper. It is a good and well implemented story though and it was enjoyable to follow Inspector Abelard unravel to true reason behind the murders.As far as I am concerned the acting was without any major faults and generally of high standard although it is perhaps a bit sad that Johnny Depp again proves that he plays best in roles that portrays a more or less crazy, even insane, character.The movie is not as gory as one perhaps and it certainly would not classify as a horror movie. Most of the violence is hidden from the viewer although there are a couple of scenes which are a wee bit "splattery" but only if you really have a weak stomach for these things and if you do perhaps you should not watch serial killer movies in the first place.The ending took a star or two off this movies rating but otherwise it was surprisingly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining little movie. Nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed learning about Jack The Ripper, mainly because I thought it was interesting. I am not really one of those people who read on serial killers (my brother is, and so is my mother) but I read on these killings (and was even taught it in school when I was fourteen) and I personally find Jack The Ripper the most interesting serial killer.Now the acting is great. Some of the best performances are Ian Holm (but if you've seen him in a few movies you'd know that) as well as Johnny Depp and Heather Graham.The basic plot is that a drug-addicted psychic cop (played by Depp) investigated the Jack The Ripper murders and finds out that it's an educated man with surgical knowledge. Soon the cop and Mary Kelly start to fall in love. Then we find out that she, and the other victims were all witnesses to another prostitutes wedding to the heir to the English throne and that they knew that he had a child with her. Then we are also pointed a finger to the killer (which very much kills it if you ask me) William Gull, the Royal Family's surgeon. After Mary dies the Drug addicted cop kills himself and Gull is secretly put on trial and lobotomized.I honestly thought it was decent enough entertainment for a mindless watch. If you want historical accuracy then don't even bother with this one, because you will hate it. If however what you're looking for is a mindless watch, nothing special then this is good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does no justice to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over Christmas being a fan of Alan Moore's "V for Vendetta" my parents got me one of his mos influential graphic novels, "From Hell". A brilliantly illustrated and written novel that created a story around the Whitechapel murders. I'd love to talk more about it but I'm not here to talk about the book... I'm here to talk about the movie. For the record, I have nothing against the Hughes brother. Personally, I think they're very good directors and they use camera skills to illustrate good story lines. However, this movie... really, just sucked and here's why. To begin, Abberline was not a drug addict. A major flaw which begins the domino effect of the movies failure. Abberline was one of many character to be incorrectly illustrated in this movie. However, my biggest problem with this movie... IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE SPOILER ALERTS BEGIN BELOW was the fact that the writers tried to make the murderer a mystery. he second chapter of the book explains who the murderer is and his back story. I wont say who the murderer is because some of you may want to watch this movie but even if you do you'll know the minute the character is introduced. The killer has the same exact voice, height and skill. Anyway, I would not recommend this movie to anyone who loved the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever but lacks tension; Grim and gruesome yet interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hughes duo walks out of their zone and decides to tell the iconic Jack the Ripper case and the result is a good piece of cinematic art if not an excellent movie. The movie captures the dark alleys of 19th century London well and the production design has to be appreciated. The part where the movie disappoints most is its plot which is slow, tension free and involves too many characters. A murder mystery is expected to have lots of drama, thrill and twists but From Hell delivers little on that regard and the initial build up leads to no real surprises in the end. The story telling seems flawed at times as it lets the murders take a backseat and instead focuses on a blossoming romance between the leads.Over the years Johnny Depp has carved a niche for himself playing dark and damaged characters with amazing deft. This time too he does whatever that is required of him with an amazing screen presence. Depp's Inspector Abberline has a strange accent, is always high, has futuristic visions and also has to balance these with his romantic inclinations. Heather Graham (Mary Kelly) portrays her part decently but she looks too pretty and gentle to be branded a "bang tail" after all. The other girls of the pack seemed equally lackluster and could not evoke any sympathy in the minds of the audience. A couple of performances stand out among the rest ? the first one being Ian Holm's Royal surgeon (William Gull) whose speeches are articulate and emotes well with his expressions, the second one has to be Robbie Coltrane's Sergeant Godley who is the flabby and quirky sidekick of Abberline and complements Depp well in their scenes together. The rest of the characters do not leave any impression or were simply not required. The background score supports the dark tone of the movie well and fills the atmosphere with horror.If you're in search of a movie which is nice to look at, you can try this but if you expect a whodunit type of chilling thriller then you're likely to be disappointed. Depp fans can still go to see their opium-addict detective strolling around the streets of London to solve a famous case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memo to Hughes Brothers' analyst: Discuss woman problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hughes brothers' adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novelabout Jack the Ripper is crudely compelling but hard to respect.Even seemingly-misogynistic directors like Dario Argento andBrian DePalma build into their thrillers an awareness of thetaboo-breaking power held by images of vulnerable women beingphysically harmed. Their set pieces are not just displays ofvirtuosity, but have seismic emotional power. For Albert and AllanHughes, the slicing-up of prostitutes is just an opportunity foranother effect, a stick-on decal, an expensive sound cue. Thesound of surgical instruments on raw bone waltzes with strobe-cutflashes of bloody flesh, staring dead eyeballs, flies rubbing theirhands before dipping into a human feast. The total effect is thesame as that of the brothers' last movie, AMERICAN PIMP--there isno directorial point of view save that of, "Wow, cool!" The pictureoften suggests the souped-up dopiness of Francis Coppola'sDRACULA--though the dialogue often plunges to the level of abottom-drawer TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE. Heather Graham,as the Main Hooker, and Johnny Depp, as a coolio, absinthe-sipping Sherlock Holmes, are made to look like two ofthe most beautiful people in the world, which no doubt they are. IanHolm, as Queen Victoria's "ordinary physician," gives aperformance of dazzling accomplishment, especially when youconsider he's given lines that would disgrace a Hammer horrormovie. And say a quiet prayer for the marvellous Robbie Coltraneas the hero's Fat Best Friend: the words he's forced to say areworse--a hundred times worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Hell With This Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hell (2001): Dir: Albert Hughes, Allen Hughes / Cast: Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson: Based upon the legend of Jack the Ripper and couldn't be any more dull than if it was read in history class. And what the title means is a mystery since the villain is human. It opens in the late 1800's London where prostitutes are murdered with slashed throats and grape stems in their hands. Perhaps if Mr. Ripper was more flamboyant he could have left an entire fruit salad and a glass of wine with lemon wedged on the edge. Johnny Depp is brought in as an inspector and the rest is a bloody mess right up to its stupid climax. Directed by Albert and Allen Hughes with repetitious storytelling. They previous made Menace to Society. Here they present a complete menace to one's intelligence. Depp is reciting Sleepy Hallow and despite that film's appeal, his role lacks ambition here. Heather Graham plays one of the brainless prostitutes. These hookers are warned not to venture out after dark but that doesn't seem to sink in. Also with Ian Holm, Ian Richardson and Robbie Coltrane who have both done far better films than this. For a scarier film starring Depp, I recommend Tim Burton's ravishing version of Sleepy Hollow. As for this film, it has superb art direction but blood and guts are strewn with the sound of swishing blades. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too bad ending. Nonsense crap movie. The actor could have returned to that woman village after some years. Or could have visited her occasionally. It was difficult to understand the logic of the movie. The name of movie shows there would be some horror, but there was no bit of horror.Abberline deduces that Freemason influence is definitely present in these crimes. His superior, a high ranking Freemason himself, then makes direct intervention and suspends Abberline. It is then revealed that Gull is the killer. He has been killing the witnesses to painter Albert Sickert (Mark Dexter)'s forbidden Catholic marriage to Crook (Joanna Page), who bore his legitimate daughter Alice. Sickert is actually Prince Edward, grandson of reigning Queen Victoria (Liz Moscrop), and therefore Alice is heiress to the British throne. Gull himself is a Freemason and his increasingly sinister behavior lends an insight into his murderous, but calculated, mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An account of the Jack the Ripper case of 1888, "From Hell" is not a credible film for true crime buffs. The film's script contains too many major inaccuracies, and its conclusions are preposterous. Aside from false presentation of various real people, including Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), the film proceeds to "solve" the case with a solution that has been discredited for decades. Indeed, among serious "ripperologists", there still is no consensus on who Jack the Ripper was. A recently published book lists no fewer than 27 possible suspects, the surnames of which include: Druitt, Ostrog, Chapman, Cohen, Sickert, Gibson, Dodgson, Deeming, Thompson, and Williams.As a fictional whodunit, with suitable red herrings, the film offers a little more, but it still contains problems. Characters are not adequately defined by name early on. The Abberline / Sergeant Godley relationship is a formulaic continuation of the Holmes / Watson relationship. And the film identifies the killer too soon; after which, the plot trends anticlimactic.This film can be described most accurately as a fictional period piece thriller, with an emphasis on the lives of poor London prostitutes, known as "unfortunates", a social class counterpoint to the rich and privileged. In this context the story's theme would pertain to the inherent hypocrisy of the rich, amid strict, 19th century Victorian values.Visually, the film looks good, as we would expect for a big-budget Hollywood production. Sets and period costumes seem realistic. Highly saturated colors convey a dingy, sooty London, again probably accurate. But ambient sounds are unrealistic. And the background music is horrible. Not only is it too loud and manipulative, it's too synthesized and modern. It's the kind of music we would expect in some modern dark zombie movie. Casting is acceptable. Robbie Coltrane gives a fine performance as Sergeant Godley. But Depp seems bored.Melodramatic in tone, "From Hell" offers viewers an interesting, and reasonably accurate, interpretation of prostitutes and their environment in London's Whitechapel district of the late 19th century. But as a viable, authoritative account of Jack the Ripper and his crimes, the film, typical of Hollywood, cannot be taken seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 'Jack the Ripper' murders endure for no other reason than that the man himself was never identified. There have been equally as brutal murders the world over, but these are different because not having anyone to finger, we can finger anyone. And that is exactly what writers, playwrights and movie-makers have done ever since. Actually, 'Jack the Ripper' was as much an invention of the then nascent tabloid Press as anything else. The name is supposedly derived from a letter the murderer is said to have sent to the Press, but the received wisdom is that it was, in fact, dreamed up by some sub-editor with one eye on a good headline to a cracking story. (One of the first and most useful pieces of advice I and more or less every young reporter is given when starting out on our careers of discovering and unearthing the truth wherever it might lurk is: 'Don't let a couple of facts stand in the way of a good story.' I am pleased to report that I haven't, ever.) There is even very credible doubt that there even was a Jack the Ripper. Around the time his alleged victims were butchered, another six or seven other working girls in the neighbourhood were also murdered. The Ripper murders were attributed to the one killer merely because of the particularly gruesome manner five of the victims were mutilated and disembowelled. So these deaths have always been a fertile ground for artists of most kind (and one artist, the celebrated Walter Sickert, has also been named as the 'definitive Jack the Ripper). Here 'the Hughes Brothers' of whom I had never heard until tonight ? are they, too, perhaps the invention of some overwrought sub-editor's imagination? ? rework the story and interweave the gruesome end of the five prostitutes with a conspiracy which, as we subs are apt to proclaim in our sub-heads, 'goes right to the very top'. As stories and conspiracies go, it isn't half bad. Unfortunately, a previous Ripper film got in there first more than 20 years earlier, but From Hell is none the worse for that. The cast plays it rather well, especially Johnny Depp, whose lower-class London accent has been criticised by some, but it didn't offend me, and if that is the worst criticism that could be aimed at From Hell, the fabled 'Hughes Brothers' have little to worry about. Depp, as usual (well, in these viewers eyes, at least) again seems to ham it up, but very subtly, that is, not so you'd notice. In fact, the man can play this kind of part with his eyes closed, and I, for one, would like to see him in a far more challenging role where real acting is demanded rather than simply not forgetting his lines and not bumping into the furniture. I like to think we wouldn't be disappointed. I wasn't particularly convinced by Heather Graham who must be one of the cleanest whores working the streets in Whitechapel. Apart from these two Yanks, each more or less successfully adopting English accents ? which rather begs the question: why cast Yanks? ? the rest of the cast are all old familiar faces, lead from the front by the ever dependable Ian Holm and Ian Richardson, who can also both turn in the required performance with their eyes shut and still be home in good time for supper. Prague doubled up as East London, and a rather clean and sanitised East London it was, too. But I mustn't grumble: From Hell provides an entertaining two hours of rather good hokum, doesn't descend to the rather cheap depths of a slasher movie and will get you and your friends discussing the identity of the Ripper and the conspiracy behind it for, oh, at least six minutes before you find something better to do. Oh, and the usual caveat: elsewhere in these member's reviews you will find the standard hyperbole of From Hell being the best film ever made ever. Why do they bother?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a semi fictional account about the serial murderer in London, the mysterious Jack the Ripper.Acting is excellent in the film. The unfortunate women are convincingly tough and street like. The characters are engaging and well developed. The dark and gruesome atmosphere is portrayed well in the film. The suspense is kept throughout, and leaves viewers wanting more to unfold. The gory parts of the film are toned down a lot by using blurry shots, but they are still rather graphic. I would have liked more clairvoyance from Inspector Abberline, as this new part of the plot deserves more development to set From Hell aside from the other Jack the Ripper movies.</fullReview>

In my opinion movie was a bit too hard to follow even though the plot itself isn't very complicated. Robbie Coltrane also succeeds to be in good shape in this one. But in general the stage is set for Depp and other performances tend go just in a side. The visual presentation of this movie is also interesting and exciting, although being quite dark, as said. But if you have seen a lot of movies like I, this one really doesn't offer anything new. The ones who liked Sleepy Hollow or The Ninth Gate will probably like this also. I liked both, but because I had seen them before watching this I was quite ready what to expect. But if you want spent an hour and a half with visually great Johnny Depp movie then this one to choose from many good ones. This movie is straight from hell... :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adapted from a comic book, The Hughes' brothers film 'From Hell' is arguably more faithful to its origins than any other of its type. That is to say, the whole movie unfolds like a series of storyboards, the scenes may technically be animated but you can mentally crystallise each one into a handful of definitive images. Darkly Gothic, ultra-violent yet also quiet, the film has also a very well defined aesthetic sense, one arguably more pervasive than that in any of the movies of Tim Burton (with which some stylistic comparison can be made, although 'From Hell', unlike Burton's movies, is utterly lacking in whimsy). It also has a stellar British cast (Ian Holm is especially good value) supporting its leading (American) actors; who, sadly, cannot quite manage the cockney accent as required. Moreover, the usually charismatic Johnny Depp for once fails to leave sufficient impression, and his double act with sidekick Robbie Coltrane is surprisingly lacking in fire on both sides. Additionally, a little of the dialogue is anachronistic or just plain odd. Overall, 'From Hell' doesn't really add up to more than series of pictures, some are individually horrific but there's no wider sense of terror beyond the individual moments of gore. Perhaps it should have stayed as a comic book (as such, it would have at least the elegance of economy); but no-one can deny that the translation is beautifully done.</fullReview>

Even worse, it was essential in the novel to know who Jack the Ripper was from the beginning in order for the action to work as an examination of the criminal - here it is turned into a cheap whodunnit. Furthermore, psychic phenomenon is dispensed of in the graphic novel - here, it is a cheap plot device. It seems obvious to me that the screenwriters did not understand what they were adapting.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp plays a wonderful Aberline, who is searching for Jack the Ripper, and battling his own depression and drug use at the same time. Some really fine performances, very authentic looking for the time period, well written and directed. One of Depp's finest rolls, his acting improves with each movie, and this one is not a disappointing performance. As you can tell I enjoyed this movie and even added it to my own collection.

		<shortDescription>Pretty good story, but it's a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that the Jack the Ripper story involves prostitutes. So there's going to have to be sexual references. But any movie can convey the idea of prostitution without showing what goes on during prostitution. All we need to see is the woman hitting on the guy, and her taking him off to some place alone. We don't need to see a woman giving a guy a hand job and him banging her into a fence. We don't need to see what goes on in the bedroom. We don't need to see sickly "girl-kissing-girl" crap. The idea of prostitution can be conveyed much more subtlety, which in my opinion would be more effective in this film since it's not a film about prostitution. It's a film about Jack the Ripper who kills prostitutes. Showing so many sexual obscenities didn't help the film. It just made it disgusting to watch.I did like the actual story when it actually got around to telling it about a half hour or so into it (after the first half hour being basically a tame porno flick). I like how they involved the Freemasons, and how we eventually came to understand who Jack the Ripper was and why he was the way he was. Johnny Deep and Heather Graham were good in this film. The story had a decent mystery to it that at least kept me watching until the end to see the mystery solved......but the film was just too hard to watch with all the obscenity in it, and I don't think I'll ever watch it again. It's too bad, because it really had the potential of being a great film had it not been directed by a couple of perverts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a bawdy tale of sex, drugs and satanism when syphilis was the AIDS of its day (antibiotics wouldn't be discovered for another 40 years or so).This is actually a pretty good serial killer procedural come social and historic commentary of London society at the height of Empire. And even the plot does get pulled together in the end.The Hughes Brothers have produced an ok movie. They always seem to be on the edge of greatness, without actually getting there. Their "Dead Presidents" would have been outstanding, if it wasn't for the last 20 minutes.Anyway, the problem with casting American actors with British accents is that they are faced with the double task of getting the tone and pitch right, while at the same time having to act. Some are great at this, while some never get it. Johnny Depp was good. Heather Graham on the other hand succeeded 60% of the way, but her restrained accent is contradicted by her overblown facial expressions. That's as precise as I can put it. She had been better off affecting an Irish accent, which is probably easier to do. Robbie Coltrane never lets go of his Scottish brogue, which of course never gets in the way of anything. London was a very international place at the time, and still is. Having gotten that off my chest, this is a pretty bloody movie, that also gives some insight into the lives of the prostitutes of the Whitechapel area. Also, the long running English obsession with the Freemasons is touched upon.</fullReview>

I didn't even finish watching it, and I ask myself why I didn't follow my gut and avoided it for good.I feel sorry for Mr Moore, because if this is what screen writers do to his stories, few, if any, will read the graphic novels...

		<fullReview>Perhaps it's because I didn't catch the whole film, but there didn't seem to be a whole heckuva lot new in this film that hasn't been said in other movies, and in better ways. I like Depp, Holm, Coltrane and the other major performers for the most part, but I found Heather Graham too pretty to be playing a prostitute in Victorian England. The thought that they were beautiful, relatively naive women is rather misleading.The film I found that handled many of the same theories, and in a lot better fashion, was Murder By Decree with Christopher Plummer and James Mason. The whole angle of the Freemasons was pursued there, as well as the theory that the Royal Physician was the real Ripper. The comments about the "Juwes" was also given, connecting them directly to the Masons. The thing is, Freemasonry was not (and still isn't) as well known as it appears to be in From Hell--it's preposterous that in that day, without the amount of knowledge and information as available as it is now, that every cop on the beat would know about it. Also, the film seems to have also read most of the same source material as Murder By Decree with Annie Crook and the illegitimate child fathered by the Royal family member. The ending was confusing, though perhaps as I said it was because I didn't see the beginning.Overall, I suppose I need to see the film from the start, but if there wasn't any significant revelations in the 2/3 of the film that I saw, I would say that seeing Murder By Decree again would be preferable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember reading the original book by Stephen Knight and wondering if it was true, but then I read all I could about the Ripper, and after reading the files (opened in '88 - the Knight's book came out in '76) I could see that it could not be true. When this movie came out, I wanted to see it, but a friend told me the solution and I was disgusted. ANOTHER movie based on this tired theory? Aren't movies based on historical events supposed to try and work in the known facts? I finally got the movie (free) and was appalled. They worked in enough facts to prove to me they did some research, but then ignored things like what these women did prior to their deaths, who they were, what their lives were like. These women were not a clique of "unfortunates" who hung around together, though they might have known one another. I mean, they did the same thing and lived in the same area! But are we supposed to believe the police were stupid enough to miss something like a group of friends being killed off one by one? If there had been that connection, wouldn't that be the MAIN thing known about the Ripper?It just bothers me that they are still doing Ripper movies with the same tired solution in this day and age. This looks it was done just to take advantage of the ability to show blood and gore. Why can't we start with the Ripper Files and fit the story around it? If you keep harping on the Royal solution, people will believe it that is what happened, because not everyone can read Jack the Ripper A to Z (great book!) I am sure that if you ask anyone they will swear the Royal solution is the truth, because that is all they ever see.Johnny Depp is eye candy and they might have impressed some with the blood and gore, but I'd be far more impressed by a serious attempt to tell it like it *might* have happened. This theory has been discounted LONG ago; it's time for something else, please! I know they were going to do a Maybrick movie, then suddenly they didn't - I assumed it was because they decided the diary was a fake. Hey, fake or not, it would have made an interesting story, and something DIFFERENT. Are they afraid someone might have taken it seriously? If that's the case, then why are they still promoting this obvious fiction? I don't see how it is any different. Except this one's already been done. Do it too much, and it becomes accepted as being true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny D stars in this tale based on a true story alongside Lesley Sharp and Heather Graham .The story is based on the murders by Jack The Ripper.I had high hopes for this film before seeing this film i thought it was going to be a hit,but sadly i was wrong.The all star cast try their hardest to make the film interesting but sadly the efforts do not work,after a while the film is boring,tired and predictable all at the same time. If you like olden day tales and gory killings this is the film for you but if you do not then i advise you not to watch it because you will be disappointed with the whole film and if thats not enough the ending is a whole other story.The writers in this film appear not to have put any effort in the ending at all leaving on a real down point.Movie Rating: 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moderate 'Jack the Ripper' horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atmospheric Jack the Ripper flick that not only provided plenty of gore, but food for thought too, about the role the Masons and the Royal Family had to play in the Ripper's brutal killings in Victorian London.Johnny Depp's cockney accent made me wince at times, (it's much improved in 'Pirates of the Caribbean'!). But the sets were realistic enough and I got a 'feel' of how the poorer areas of London might have been in that era. But the characters weren't developed enough for me to empathize with any of them in any capacity. Any film featuring Johnny Depp is always worth a look in my opinion &lt;g&gt; but I wouldn't bother watching it twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film could have been soooo good. A fascinating story, two brilliant leads- Johnny Depp and Heather Graham, and plenty of scares. Unfortunatly it wasn't like that. Johnny and Heather are great, with brilliant Cockney accents (I don't know why their accents seem to come under such critism, I know what a cockney accent should sound like, and they do the accent great) but the film is badly put together, and lacks substance, and somehow I just couldn't care for either Depps or Grahams characters. (Depps other Cockney, Jack Sparrow, knocks the stuffings out of his detective in this one)It's not even scary..... SUCH a shame, as this film looked like it could have been very good.</fullReview>

The whole Britishaccent thing annoys me to begin with, despite the historical factthat this story took place in London. But other than that, the moviewas well filmed, but sometimes things got to be too dark and drab.Heather Graham's hair color was obviously dyed and didn't makesense how hair dye could have been perfected way back in theOlden Days. If you enjoy films with no direction, boring acting, andannoyingly long running times, check this title out. Otherwise, you'llbe clawing your eyes out and sticking pencils in your ears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad stab.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting - and more importantly - entertaining film, which attempts to weave together the varying mythologies surrounding the Jack the Ripper legend, whilst at the same time, presenting us with a cross-section of Hollywood game-playing. This however, is the film's eventual undoing.Here we get a horror story, a detective thriller, a social-comment, a black comedy, and a romantic mystery all jostling for our attention. A more intelligent filmmaker may have been able to blend these over-lapping genres so that the audience was engrossed, without being distracted. Sadly the Hughes Brothers bite off more than they can chew, and instead of gliding seamlessly from one scene to the next, end up stumbling around with little interest or clue as to where the characters are taking them. Imagine if someone like Kieslowski had lived to direct this... the effect would surely have been magical.Luckily for us, the production design and cinematography are exquisite, and even if the Polish exteriors sometimes fail at mirroring the real-life streets of Victorian London, we at least get some wonderful moments of cinematic-colour. The script by Hayes and Yglesias keeps us guessing in a Hollywood kind of way, meaning that the film is enjoyable while it lasts, but gives us little to ponder as an after-thought. Dialog is of a standard... giving us the correct amount of narrative information and just enough character development to satisfy the more learned of cineastes. Acting is fairly impressive, with Depp once again delivering a charming performance as our lead-protagonist Inspector Aberline? the only criticism being his woeful Michael Caine impression, which is, I suppose, meant to convincingly pass as a real-life London dialect. However, he is nowhere near as dire as Ms Graham, lovelier than ever with dyed red curls, yet totally inept at conveying any sense of emotion... and what in the name of sweet baby James was that accent supposed to be. We also have support from Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and the late Katrin Cartlidge, all of whom are very impressive in their respective roles.It is rare for a Hollywood thriller to display a large amount of visual imagination, accuracy and an interest in Historical politics... so it is doubly disappointing that none of the film's separate elements come together as successfully as they should. Still, this is an enjoyable little romp, defiantly worth a viewing... and maybe even a few repeats. 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than I Was Led To Believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having only seen this movie after hearing critics trash it for 2 years, I was surprised by how much I liked it. I was expecting to be impressed with Depp's performance, and I wasn't disappointed, but I was also impressed by the execution of the story and the attention to detail by the directors. I haven't read the graphic novel (I plan to) but from what I heard about the deviations from it made for the movie, I think they were done to good effect. I think adding the death of Abberline's wife and baby, and his opium addiction, made his character that much more compelling, as a flawed and unhappy man who nevertheless forces himself to pursue justice. The opium and absinthe seem to be a natural response to the burden of clairvoyance that he must bear. The re-creation of the lower underbelly of Victorian London was well done, I thought. Not too squalid as to be distracting, but definitely not romanticized. Altogether, a very solid movie.</fullReview>

He attempts to keep an English accent but doesn't realize he sounds nowhere near that tonality. The movie, for the most part, is quite boring and doesn't offer anything significant except loud music, gory MTV style editing and too many whores in the streets of London to look at.

		<shortDescription>pretty and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This misguided attempt to bring a beautiful graphic novel to the screen hopes that viewers will be so blown away by its visual richness, they will forgive its weak execution of story. Not to be confused with plot - which, from the graphic novel, is unique and intriguing - story is the execution of the plot, and in this film it fails miserably.Perhaps the Hughes Brothers felt they had to write down to a level below their own intellect, or feared their film would be disliked if the average moviegoer didn't understand what was going on before the characters reached the same conclusions. But this dumbing down amounts to a film with no character-centered surprises, and a surprise based on what feels like a red herring plot twist leaves me very cold indeed.Within the first twenty minutes I had deduced the identity of the man Fred Abberline was hunting, and I literally spent the next two hours waiting to be proven wrong. My disappointment at finding that the big surprise was not who, but rather why, knew no bounds. If this is the device by which to save an already-solved murder mystery, it must resonate as a shock and a means to empathize with the murderer. It is the fault of the screenriters' and directors' execution that this ending, which is so shocking and powerful in the graphic novel, falls flat and feels unfinished here.Johnny Depp's layered portrayals can save nearly any film from the wasteland of 5-and-below ratings, but here he is powerless to resurrect the story. He is not given enough to do, though what he does, he does well. Unfortunately, the filmmakers set him up as a fool, which the character clearly is not, and this takes the legs out from under Depp's redeeming power.Spoilers follow:By limiting the history, background, and purpose of the Freemasons to a couple of pretty but empty scenes, the viewer is robbed of any investment in the institution as a character in its own right. Moore's twist on Jack the Ripper as a politically motivated murderer, rather than the first modern serial killer, is a truly unique perspective deserving of a read. But the graphic novel, though you may know the ending of the film, will still surprise you, and I recommend it as an antidote to any disappointment you experienced here. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Admirable Effort by the visually brilliant Hughes brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 6.7 (out of 10)"From Hell" is one movie that, while I don't really enjoy it, I do intensly admire it. The Hughes brothers have, at least in intention, created a visually brilliant piece of crowd-pleasing cinema based on the graphic novel of the same name. "From Hell" takes real accounts of the historical mystery of the investigation of Jack the Ripper and pieces them together in the style of a modern Hollywood slasher flick. Or is it a Hollywood slasher flick well spun into cinematic art?Unfortunently, not all of that plays out in "From Hell"'s dissapointingly routine execution. I'll just say it: the big problem with the film is Johnny Depp's character, the investigator on the case Abberline. Abberline is like a combination of Depp's investigator from "Sleepy Hollow" and his usual burned out pot smoker role. Hepped up on dope, again. All that I can deal with - he's typecast. But the real crime in "From Hell" is that Abberline is clairvoyant. An investigator that sees the murders before they happen. It's the laziest screenwriting technique in the book and it really drags down the movie. On the other end we have Heather Graham in her usual role as "the slut". This time a troubled prostitute. One of a group whom Jack picked off one by one. Neither Depp or Graham's characters are very interesting in the least and as the leads that really pulls us away. It's hard to fault the script and some of the choppy ways it plays out because of the attention to historical accuracy the Hughes brothers weave through their story. They do what they can - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The ending, in particular does not work. They come to a crossroads where there Hollywood characters and the history collide. The boys struggle admirably but can't quite hold the reigns together and all the tension and fun of the film has the wind completely knocked out of it in the final few scenes.The movie is at it's artistic and entertaining high in nearly every scene involving Jack. He is kept in shadow, little more then a powerful, seductive voice until the 3rd act murder mystery revelation of his identity. Complete with top hat, cape, and what has got to be the Batmobile of Victorian era stagecoaches, "Jack" is a delicious villain. My favorite scene in the movie is a brief shot from under the stagecoach as Jack heads toward it for a night of killing and a little silver set of stairs flip out, almost automatically, for him. Very cool. While the script faulters, as directors the Hughes brothers have a grand achievement here. They should be proud. "From Hell" can make for a great transition into the mainstream - it retains some of the qualities of the Hughes brothers more independent films and yet is radically different from anything they have ever done.The movie has a look that is unmatched in it's gothic beauty and clever cinematography. Even those dreaded turn-off-your-brain falshbacks have an intriguing and original style to them. It's a visual masterwork. So in the end I admire the film, and the daring departure it is for the Hughes brothers. I would even recommend "From Hell" as a terrific work of stylish cinema - but with a caution that the story is empty, the characters are cliche and the result is ultimately dissatisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Hell. SPOILERS DON"T READ IF YOU DON"T WANT TO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1888 was changed by one man. One man that crime experts and many historians spend their life on. Why does the story of Jack the ripper seem so interesting to most of us? The reason is simple. This man did what no one had ever seen before. He would go out even when London police were at their highest alert and still mutilate these woman. Now 115years later 3 to 4 movies have been made. From Hell takes the theory that the 5 woman knew to much about a scandle in the kingdom and some people sent a man to kill them off. This is a OK theory but it was just put in so the movie wouldn't be a slasher. For a hollywood film it was very good but i would like to know if the real Freddie Abberline was really a drug addict. I also didn't like the outcome of who was Jack the ripper, I mean through the whole movie he sounds evil and has a very deep voice but in the end we find out its a very short and very nice sounding doctor. It did bring to life the story but it very incorrect but like i said "Hollywood story". Oh well it still is worth seeing if you are interested in the subject. If you aren't then i tell you that it is very graphic.</fullReview>

After watching about half the movie, I simply forgot about the plot and just enjoyed the dark, moody atmosphere and the strangely enjoyable gory moments. If you want to see an interesting mood piece with some suspenseful moments, check out this movie. If you want to see a movie that actually offers a sensible story in addition to everything this movie has to offer, check out the far superior "Sleepy Hollow". ** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The actual Ripper events make a pretty exciting mystery in themselves, so why play with historical facts? This film is so full of deliberate inaccuracies and unintended anachronisms that they become distracting, and the alterations do nothing to advance the story. I didn't mind the Freemason theme - though it's part of an old and improbable theory, it is dramatically effective - but I thoroughly disliked making Inspector Abberline (who in real life was a much-decorated and respectably married cop of 45 in 1888) 20 years younger, a drug addict, and the lover of one of the women concerned in the case. Indeed, that last touch tended to drag the film's pace down to a crawl. As for the performances, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm, and the great Ian Richardson stole the show, but Johnny Depp and Heather Graham were just cardboard characters, flawed action hero and flawed damsel in distress, and I honestly didn't care what happened to them. One excellent touch: the sound of the metal coach steps being let down, like knives clanking against each other. The murderer's fantasy during the last murder was also well done. Other than that, a rather lame account.</fullReview>

He holds his own up against Sir Holm, P.I. to MD, each equally dedicated and touched by their situations. Graham is very good here and manages to convey sex appeal merely by heaving her cleavage, not exposing it. In fact there is little in the way of graphic gore, only nightmare flashes.

		<fullReview>"From Hell" is a wonderfully evocative movie and, as the identity of the Ripper will never be known, the makers are at liberty to speculate. But why do they have to alter the facts and add pointless embellishments when the real facts of the case are so dramatic?Grape stalks were not found by the bodies of any of the victims. The women killed by the Ripper did not need the incentive of a few grapes - they were so desperately poor that they had to earn a few pence for a bed in a cheap lodging house.What dramatic point is served by making Inspector Abberline an opium addict, who dies young from his addiction? The real Abberline lived to 86! And, while Johnny Depp does a reasonable cockney accent (for an American), Abberline was born and brought up in Dorset and would have had a very distinctive accent, far removed from cockney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I like Johnny Depp, I love suspense movies and don't mind a little blood. But this film left me disappointed. Let me just comment a few things:1) Johnnys accent. On the dvd version, the directors gave compliments to the fact that he was able to switch from Irish to Cockney to posh English, and they were so impressed that they didn't think he needed much coaching. What can you do but laugh. They're American, I guess everything with an intrusive R sounds English to them. Let the specialists be the judge of whether Johnny's accent was British or not, and let him get the help he really needs. I'm a native Swede, and I thought it was was terrible. And that says a lot. (I especially hated his mock Sean Connery thing, pronouncing "s" as "sh".)2) London in the 1800s was dirty and smelly. Why are the streets so clean, and especially: why is Heather so squeaky clean? And another comment: Heather's character is so obviously much more pretty than the other prostitutes. This could be credible, if only someone would have commented upon it. At least her friends should have teased her about it or something. Or she would be making more money than the others. It doesn't make sense.3) Johnny is supposed to be investigating a murder. I understand that the methods are much more refined today, but come on... Most of the time he just wanders around looking sad, alternatively surprised.4) When I heard the directors' comments on the film, I lost whatever respect I may have had for them. Laughing, one of them said he'd cast one of the girls because she had such darn sexy collarbones. Duh. And all of you looking for nudity: on the dvd version, one scene which was cut out can be seen, where a very well shaped and beautiful female body lowers herself into a bath. I agree, she looks terrific. So why was she cut out? The answer is obvious. She was only there as a decoration, had nothing to do with the film, and I found that fact a bit offensive. Needless to say, the directors disagreed with the test audience, who wanted her out. Are we talking Hollywood directors or teenage boys here, everybody??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched a superb documentary on BBC (or maybe Channel4) about the true identity of "Jack the Ripper", where it made it clear (he wrote letters to a friend revealing his inclinations etc) that he was a frustrated homosexual doctor from America, who collected body parts from prostitutes to revenge his frustration. After he went back to America, then the police in England were so embarrassed that they had basically let him get away that they didn't pursue him.After watching that, I was biased against this film from the word go.The accusations about the Royal Family/Freemasons being involved seemed farfetched when I first read them, and even more ridiculous when you look at the evidence.Having said that, and if you ignore the fact that the plot is spurious at best, then this is a moderately effective shocker.

		<fullReview>Hey guess what, this crime is officially still UNSOLVED. You did not just watch a documentary, but a fairy tale. Got it? I sure hope so. Let me back up and start with the good elements. It's a triumph of atmosphere that really put the polish on the Michael Caine TV movie, which is quite similar to a point, especially in naming the same culprit as this bomb does. The suspense and the murders are done without going overboard on the red red krovvy. And for a movie I hate, I did love the scene in Mary Kelly's room, showing the Ripper composing himself just before he strikes his final and most brutally butchered victim. If you haven't yet had a chance, go to your local library and take a look at the actual police photograph of the crime scene. It will haunt your slumbers! Slick and thought provoking visually, but oh how terribly Stupid story and otherwise. Once again, the British Empire plays whipping boy to the Hollywood loonies, who know full well the Brits will just sit and take it. The only thing factual is that there really was a Jack the Ripper, and a Queen of England named Victoria. The rest, straight out of a heroin daze. The topper, the scene with Victoria showing she had full knowledge of the crimes. Right out of Python, sans the humor. Eventually we'll see a version where Victoria herself actually does the killing. Think this movie gets popped into the Palace VCR on Sunday afternoons? "Hey, throw that flicker in where great great great great grandmamma orders that Ripper chap to kill all those tarts."

Also, all of the victims are acquaintances, who seem to have something in common with their pasts.

		<shortDescription>This film isn't good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FROM HELL is an elaboration on film based on the graphic novel elaboration by Alan Moore on a very silly book by Stephen Knight entitled Jack the Ripper, the Final Solution, in which the author fantasizes a ridiculously elaborate explanation for the Ripper killings of 1888 based on no evidence whatsoever.This is not a story, it's a point by point "explanation" of Knight's foolish theory which is historically impossible, logically nonsensical, and possesses no dramatic value at all apart from ONE shot at the very end of the film which is absolutely heartbreaking. That's it, though. That's all you get. After seeing this shot, which is the only free, improvised moment in a completely expositional film, you get the idea that the film has just (finally) begun, then, surprise!, the end credits roll. Shots of the soapy unbelievable backstory (concerning those who were responsible for making the baby which figures into the solution of the case) aren't even given to us. You watch 2 hours and get nothing of genuine historical value and only one moment that makes any kind of dramatic sense. This is not a drama, it's a pseudo-documentary in which we are TOLD what to think, and that information makes no sense. Grapes are rare in Whitechapel, one victim had a grape stalk in her hand, therefore the killer must be a recognized high society gentleman? Jack the Ripper removed some of his victims' organs therefore he "must" be a medical doctor? (These are not spoilers, they are actual conclusions drawn by our hero early on in the film) Give me a break. We have as much reason to conclude positively from this information that he "must" be a cannibalistic fruit stand owner. It would be very nice to see someone try to make a film about the Ripper murders that was free of Royal Conspiracy horse-hockey and truly did try to portray a realistic picture of the place and time which would help explain why these murders really happened. I suppose since so many have embraced Knight's ridiculous fanciful glop as truth we will never see such a thing. Pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering this movie was based on a graphic novel, I was expecting a lot of blood and gore. But, there isn't much of it. The camera pans over the crime scenes quickly and never lets you have a good view. You do get to see a couple of throat slashings. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are miscast. The director really made a mistake by making all the other prostitutes trashy and filthy looking, while Heather Graham has pretty combed hair and clean looking. Toward the end, the scene where they reveal "Jack" and make him have these cold, big black eyes was chilling. But, most of this movie is slow and boring.FINAL VERDICT: Don't watch this if you are sleepy because there is not enough action to keep you awake. I do not recommend this movie unless you just want to criticize all the historical inaccuracies and the miscast actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many don't realize just how hard life was in Victorian England. This movie brought so many of those instances to horrible and demonic light. I'm impressed that the Hughes Brothers jumped out of their usual genre of film to make such an incredibly evil and wonderfully dark movie. They remained so true to the graphic novel and true to the historical era it was based in. I saw an interview with the Bros. about this they truly saw it was more of a period piece and less of a horror film. Nice angle. If you've seen and enjoyed this movie and/or read the graphic novel, pick up a copy of the novel The Alienist, by Caleb Carr.I'm a bit of a Jack the Ripper buff and I have to say that a great deal of the random facts and evidence that surrounded the case were in the movie (and the graphic novel). Those that weren't are wonderful adaptations and worked perfectly in the movie. The acting was excellent - Johnny Depp is becoming a wonderful actor... a far cry from his 21 Jump Street days. The English accents of both Heather Graham and Depp weren't ~that~ bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i haven't found anyone's mention of this, so i thought i might make one. anyone who has a problem with this movie's script, and especially those who have naysayed it due to knowledge of its genesis in comic book form, you're all considered to me numb from the neck up unless you actually read the comic before uttering such statements. the comic itself, though, grantedly, nothing altogether new, is a brilliant meditation on the ripper murders. the concept that held the comic strong, for some reason, was lost in the transition to film, namely William Gull's hallucinations of our society, and Abberline was not an absinthe addict. watching the movie, you can tell they threw a lot of what's in there simply to create an eyepleasing nineteenth century gothic video shawl. the actual people (remember, these are actually supposed to be real people, not fictional characters) don't look two clicks like depp or graham. holm is class, but the character's a miss. if filmmakers who were more devoted to the story had actually spearheaded this effort, they would have had something special.as the film was, it was mostly decent. i remember leaving the theater entertained but hardly impressed. but again, you all should read the comic before you mock it. if you do, you'll find a challenging tale, often too practical to be mere mythwriting. the worthwhile Alan Moore penned it, and fellow brit Eddie Campbell laid down some clean, methodical artwork, that at times turns grisly and disconcerting. it's really a fine example of contemporary literature. basically, what all this gabbing is trying to say, is don't knock it till you try it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7 out of 10Whatever happened to movies about little kids and their animals? You know-`Black Beauty,' `Free Willy,' `My Dog Skip'-that sort of thing. I remember coming home from school as a kid to my little sister watching `My Little Pony: The Movie' and thinking, you know, the world's an okay place. I could leave the screen door unlocked and go sip a lemonade on the back porch without a care in the world.Now everywhere you go people are killing each other and making movies about it. I figured at first that this was just a modern trend since, you know, the world's going to hell (or is it from hell? No, to hell) anyway. But apparently this sort of thing's been going on for a while. It's just that they didn't have movies back then.So I guess a movie about Jack the Ripper has been a long time coming. Now growing up, I always just understood Jack to be someone else's dad who coached t-ball and worked at a factory and lurked around elementary school playgrounds ripping little girls' clothes off. Hell, it made sense at the time. Needless to say, I never included myself in Jack's exclusive victim demographic. If anything I envied him and tried to emulate his work during my playground fare.After seeing `From Hell,' I am now much more scared of Jack the Ripper. Yeah, I know, he's dead (or is he?-I smell a sequel. No, he's actually dead.) But what's to stop little Tommy now from becoming Tommy the Ripper or little Susie from becoming Susie the Ripperess? I am truly scared for all of us.I suppose that's the mark of a good film (or is it?-I smell a trick ending. Yeah, it's a good film.) Allen and Albert Hughes (`Menace II Society,' `Dead Presidents') have taken a rather unusual spin on their usual theme of violent suburban life in `From Hell,' and for the most part it is a glorious one. It took keen eyes to recognize that the victimization of prostitutes, or `unfortunates,' in late 19th Century England was merely a derivative form of the inner city chaos that many live with still a hundred years later.`From Hell' stars Johnny Depp (`Ed Wood,' `Dead Man,' `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas') as the laudanum/absinthe addict Inspector Frederick Abberline who has been pulled out from the opium den just in time to star in the new Hughes Brothers' film `From Hell.' Just kidding-I love Johnny Depp. Actually they need him to fry Jack the Ripper's gourd. And since all the drugs he takes give him magical powers and a British accent, this is not the exact same movie as `Sleepy Hollow.'Abberline is quick to fall in love with one of the unfortunates, or `sluts,' Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, `Boogie Nights') because she is the only one of them with box office appeal (sorry guys, no naked here-or is there? I won't say-or will I? Read on.) and has the least dirt applied to her face in the makeup room. He is quick to get the help of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm, `The Sweet Hereafter,' `Brazil'), physician to the royal family, to aid in tracking a killer who appears to be an educated man with a thorough knowledge of human anatomy (Jack the Ripper). And a budget for grapes.But Jack the Ripper is quicker at killing them all-or is he? I won't say. As opposed to the graphic novel on which it is based, `From Hell' wisely chooses to conceal the identity of Jack until the end, so it has the same effect as Christopher Walken's appearance in `Sleepy Hollow.' Come to think of it, just replace Walken as Jack, Christina Ricci for Heather Graham, and Johnny Depp for Johnny Depp and it's the same damn movie. Aw man.Actually, Depp was better as Ichabod Crane, but `From Hell' is probably a better movie. Granted, it's sort of a one note film-Jack kills a prostitute, her friends wince, Depp warms up the opium cooker, rinse and repeat. But it's reasonably well written, even better acted (by Heather Graham of all people), and even still better filmed-it looks like something between `Moulin Rouge' and `Requiem for a Dream.' Of course, `From Hell' is strictly entertainment for all you gore- and Heather Graham (keep reading) skin- hounds. But the restraint of the gore (compared to such recent fare as `Hannibal'), as well as the allusions to 19th Century medicine and freemasonry make this film creepy and disturbing as hell. Or is it from hell? Dammit, I've got to stop doing that.So, in conclusion, if you want to know if Heather Graham gets naked in this movie, you'll just have to see it for yourself. Hahahahahaha. (And I disappear in a flash of smoke).</fullReview>

Though I will not reveal the suggested identity of the Ripper and in turn ruin the mystique of the film, I will say that for people who really enjoy murder mystery films, this is definitely for you.

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many things wrong with this take on the Ripper legend, but many things that are right too. First I'll start with the things that are wrong...The most obvious component of the movie that lets it down is Heather Graham. Her performance is below par at best and downright terrible at worst. Her accent is all over the place and she never seems at ease with the material or her role in the film. She's also far too clean and well scrubbed when compared to the other prostitutes in the film. She doesn't look like a streetwalker. I wish they would have got Samantha Morton to play the role instead...The film's other major problem is another accent; Johhny Depp's. To be honest, I think his performance is pretty good. He certainly conveys the weary, tired emotions that Abberline feels, but the cockney accent is more mockney than anything else. I'm not sure what it's meant to be. However, apart from that, he's excellent in the role...To the film's strengths though. The sense of atmosphere is superb. The production design, costumes and photography give the film tangible quality. It is truly, despite the horrid events that take place, a beautiful film to look at. It's also to the Hughes brothers' credit that the visual stylings that could have ended up as excessive indulgencies really add to the film. Lapse time photography is used, colours are changed, underwater shots are used, short flashes are spliced in, and all of them work. They give the film a vibrancy and energy.The rest of the cast also add greatly to the film. Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm in particular are superb. Both give performances that eclipse the leads and both appear to be working effortlessly...The script is also pretty good. It's a fictionalised take on the events, so there's no question of squabbling about authenticity. All that matters is that as a story, in my opinion, it works. It twists, it turns, and it provides a few surprises along the way. It certainly could have been better, but it could have been a lot worse too...All in all, I think From Hell is a pretty decent attempt. It doesn't indulge in the vacuous blood letting of teenage slasher films and provides the viewer with a decent interpretation of the Ripper myth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, but strangely un-involving (and a lesser copy of "Murder by decree")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached this movie with great expectations. But only in one field was I rewarded: the technical credits are impeccible. Victorian London is atmospherically recreated and cinematography is above reproach. However, basically this is a remake of the 1979 film "Murder by decree" with minor alterations (mostly concerning the Mary Kelly/Heather Graham-part). And in a comparison this movie is the lesser one almost in every aspect. Don't get me wrong: I really enjoyed "From Hell" and thought it was quite a good movie.But somehow it never moved me at all. I admired it to be sure, but never really liked it. First of all, the casting has it flaws. Heather Graham is a good actress, but is totally wrong here, looking like a whore who spends all her sparetime at Vidal Sassoon. The other "girls" looked more the part and I thought Geena Davis-lookalike Susan Lynch did a good job.Johnny Depp is quite good actually but doesn't compare to Christopher Plummer in "Murder by decree". The only parts I really liked was Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm. Especially Holm manages to be very convincing and deliver a surprise or two. The story tries to get away with some surprises and twists also, but you spot them a mile away unfortunately. You get some of the advantages from a big budget here, but also a lot of the disadvantages. The scenery looks just like a scenery and I was never once convinced about the dirt and filth in Victorian Whitechapel.And, finally, this film didn't have Genevieve Bujold who in "Murder by decree", despite very limited screentime, alone managed to bring more pathos and emotion into that picture than every castmember in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never expect much from movies made by Hollywood about events in the UK but with this title I was pleasantly surprised. Johnny Depp's "Mockney" accent leaves a lot to be desired but his acting, as usual, is flawless. Based largely on fact this film makes interesting viewing, particularly as a somewhat new and untested "theory" as to the identity of the Ripper was chosen. The portrayal of Fred Abberline as a drug addict is somewhat unusual and frankly somewhat ridiculous but it lends a certain atmosphere to the proceedings, giving the whole movie that "nightmare" feel. If you can stomach some incredibly accurate, anatomically correct "gore" then you're in for a treat.</fullReview>

From Johnny Depp on down, the acting is solid, with special mention to Ian Holm (Sir William Gull) and Robbie Coltrane (Peter Godley), who were both magnetic on film. The grit and darkness of Victorian London is at times, stifling and oppressive, serving as a perfect backdrop to this tale. I'd recommend it to anyone intrigued by mysteries, especially those who are curious by nature and like me, went home after the film and gorged themselves on what I could find of the given topic. there's certainly no lack of information for this drama from a historic perspective..

		<fullReview>If you've seen and liked "Se7en" or "Sleepy Hallow" you most likely will enjoy "From Hell". I viewed it on it's region 1 DVD with the DTS sound track. The first thing I noticed was the sound. It puts you right in the middle of an eerie environment that can only get more creepy. It really gives your surround speakers something to play with. Then there is the film. The scenes that stuck out to me best were the flickers of grainy, distorted flashbacks that i can best describe as "Something out of a Marlin Manson Video". The whole ambience fits both the story of a serial killer and the slums of old London. The makers of this "almost epic" did a good job making it hard for the viewer to figure out who was Jack the Ripper. It was a relief to me since in the past couple years most crime stories end up being predictable. I've been told that this movie is based on a book. I haven't read it so i can't judge the film based on how well it fallows the book.I give it 9/10 I was looking for a good old' crime story and it ended up killing more then just a couple of hours.</fullReview>

However, it did not hinder my understanding of the story. Johnny Depp is a cool actor, who seems to be almost typecast as the federal investigator (think Sleepy Hollow), but manages to bring a strong a unique performance to the screen every time. I'm not exactly sure why Heather Graham was a crucial component to the story, but it certainly didn't harm it. Ian Holm - ha hah. incredible performance, and no less what you'd expect from one of the best actors of the last thirty years. He is very dynamic, and the character he brings to a role just jumps off the screen. Powerful, dark, tense, and riveting, this is a must see for Depp/Holm fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie for Halloween as I was looking for something with a horror feel to it. Some parts of this movie lived up to that but I'm glad I had my remote to fast-forward through some of the slower parts. I especially liked the stylized shooting of the first murder - the flashes of the knife in the night. Very striking!What I did not like was what nearly everyone else mentioned: 1) Heather Graham - that red hair - sheesh! Even my dye jobs don't look that bad! And don't get me started on the accents - ech! And how nice that her character seems to be the only streetwalker who doesn't actually sleep with anyone? (a la 'Pretty Woman') 2) Johnny Depp's laudanum chugging 'visionary' detective work - please. Who'd listen to a druggy cop in any era?I did enjoy the commendable attention to detail to the Londoners and the background scenery. I could get into the feel of turn of the century London life the longer I watched the movie. Some scenes were humorous - like poor people having to sleep sitting up (and tied up) instead of sleeping in beds. Side note - the women couldn't find enough money to pay the gang but they found enough to bury their friend? Unlikely.The photography is what makes this film worth watching. The brilliant orange colored skies, the dark and forbidding streets ... I'll definitely check out the graphic novel this was based on.6/10</fullReview>

Johnny Depp makes himself a bigger legend with every single movie: "Ed Wood", "Don Juan DeMarco", "Dead man", "Donnie Brasco", "Fear and loathing in Las Vegas", "The Ninth gate", "Blow"...the list seems almost endless. His charisma, style, devotion and talent is unique and he has really made himself one of the greatest actors of our time...and he's still under 40! "From Hell" is another feather in his cap and another proof that he very rarely appears in a bad movies and practically never has a bad performance."From Hell" is a pressuring, bloodcurdling, gloomy and ultra-violent thriller and very likely the best movie that has ever been filmed about the true story of Jack the ripper. Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm are both excellent and the twisted, chilly atmosphere of "From Hell" that takes place in the damp, dark and foggy London at the end of the 1880's is something truly special. Watch this film if your stomach can handle it, like I said this film is extremely cruel and violent. I did ate during "From Hell" but I guess that tells more about me than the movie. 9/10.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp is great as always but the story is so flawed that it holds no suspense at all.SPOILERSThe whole crux of the story, i.e. Prince Albert marrying and having a child with a catholic is rubbish. For starters, Annie Crook was NOT a catholic and the marriage was not legal as the Prince would have required the permission of the Queen to wed so that knocks that one on the head.Not sure what the previous reviewers meant about victims dying in the wrong order. They all died as they did in 1888.Notwithstanding all that, the sets are one of the films strong points as are Depp and Coltrane. The prostitutes nearly look as bad as they should - except of course for Kelly!Like I said catch "Murder By Decree" (1979) with Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes on Jack's trail instead....................</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbingly scary Ripper-movie, badly fact-based. Heather Graham did well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie pulls off some disturbingly scaring scenes; it's been a long time since I've actually been genuinely scared by a movie, but this one did it.. using very little actual footage of "gore", but mainly ear-piercing sound, silhouettes and ghastly descriptions of the murders, it clearly gets the message through to us in a sickening way..Johnny Depp is a good actor indeed, and makes an interesting character. I don't agree that Heather Graham is a bad actress here, but her role is a bit "off" to start with. She is supposed to be some sort of virginal, pure prostitute-character resembling a more known "Mary"-figure.. you know which one ;) Actually, it looks like she's even been given separate lighting and makeup-effects, making her stand out as white-skinned, angelic and pure. I agree this doesn't work that well here.It's completely untrue, as many of the reviewers here claim, that Heather Graham can't play these sexualised roles, and that she gives off a "prudish" vibe. Check out her other roles.. It is, though, a bit cheesy to see these two american actors (Depp &amp; Graham) have conversations in obvious fake british accents. :)Anyway, The Plot, as you've probably heard, is down the conspiratory alley, which, from a Ripperologists POV, seems to be only averagely original. Actually, the movie fails at this point, trying to portray a quasi-occult, quasi-psychotic, quasi-conspiratory explanation for the killings. All in all, the good, old "cake &amp; eat it too"-scenario. Shortly put, I was a bit disappointed about the plot-part of it.The ending was also pretty shabby, and it seemed a bit "forced" away from the Hollywoodian happy ending(as happy as that can be in a movie like this).After having checked out Ripper-dedicated for, it became pretty obvious how inaccurate this movie actually is, fact-wise. For instance, one thing I wondered about: There is no indication that the prostitutes in question knew each other (it's actually pretty unlikely), and this is a very important basis of "From Hell"'s plot. I almost think this film would've been better if it had gone out of the complex Ripper universe.I recommend seeing this movie as a HORROR MOVIE, not as an actual attempt to reveal what might have happened - and you'll enjoy it greatly.. or maybe not.. mohahaha!! :)</fullReview>

If you have read my review of the Michael Caine drama Jack the Ripper(1988), this is not a whole lot different.Why are Hollywood so obsessed with bending the truth? If you going to make a good Jack the Ripper film, based on ACTUAL events, for a start off, STOP using good looking actresses to play the roles of the Prostitutes. In reality, the Prostitutes were toothless, unbelivably ugly, and fat.At least get the murders in the right order! Not even the police were as handsome as Johnny Depp. Abberline was a short stout man, balding, with a beard. On the whole, the film would probably pass a few hours away, if you had nothing to do. I wont be seeing it again for sure.I have yet to come across a Jack the Ripper Film/TV Series that is true to the actual events of 1888. Michael Caine's 1988 version is probably the one I would recommend. In this one, Lysette Anthony played Mary Jane Kelly (played in this one by Heather Graham).If you have ever seen a painting of Mary Kelly, Lysette bears a remarkable resembelance to her. Graham looks NOTHING like her.Forget this one, and see the Michael Caine TV Film. Although, still not acurate, it is the only one closest to the truth.JRB.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Manson and before Gein and before Burkowitz there was Jack the Ripper. There is something about serial killers that fascinate me but there is something about this film that sits horribly unwell with me, maybe that's half the fun of it. Where Helter Skelter and Summer of Sam gave us a biographical accout (although fictionalized in Summer of Sam) of our well known killers, this film puts us into a time frame where these events happened and tells us not what actually happened but what could have happened. For all those who have not followed the story of Jack the Ripper should know that the case never got the proper explanation it deserved and has gone unsolved all these years. It is 1888 and a madman is killing off prostitutes in a ritualistic fashion. It is up to Scotland Yard inspector, Fred Abberline (a riviting Johnny Depp) who is sent to track down the killer because he posses a power to visualize the crimes in his dreams before they happen. The killers methods are that of an educated man as he always pursuades the girls with grapes and something to drink, then he slits their throat and steals some of their intestines. Heather Graham is the uninteresting, yet important Mary Kelly, on of the whores who seems to be marked for death and also begins a romance with Abberline that is probably unlikly considering the time frame but thats debatable. Ripper followers won't get anything new from the film but is still interesting to watch nevertheless. It is clear that the Hughes Brothers have directional talent. The remind me here of a cross between Tim Burton and David Lynch and must be given credit for not reducing the film to a mindless slasher flick. The film playes more like a dense, atmospheric character study rather than the tense thriller the trailer suggested even though there is no lack of violence and and plenty of gore and did I mention several are very chilling. Where most films like this try to hard to provide vibrent costumes and elegant landscapes this film delievers both but never strays away from the task at hand, it's not out to proove a point, but trying to at least get one across. The only flaw I can visably point out is that the most effective scenes are the ones that feature Jack the Ripper himself, just to bad the film tries harder to portray Depp's drug problems and relationship with Graham that the Ripper seems to be put on a side note than a major plot point like one would expect, loosing a bit of the overall power and effect, but with strong scripting and psychidelic direction this one, although very hard to stomach, is well worth the while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mary Poppins with ultraviolence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you remember that scene from 'Time Bandits' which was set in Sherwood Forest? In keeping with an accurate portrayal of the era, everyone is dressed in muslin sacks and covered in filth. Suddenly Robin Hood, played by John Cleese, appears in full Pantomime regalia. Right down to the bright green tights... and that's exactly what Heather Graham looks like in this film. While all the other whores have bad complexions, bad hair and have dirty sex in the corners of dark alleys, Heather swans through the film like..well, John Cleese in a pair of green tights.It seems that the only source of information about Victorian history that the two young American directors had came from comic books. It shows. It may have all the modern day trappings of graphic violence, language, drugs and sex, but it's still only Mary Poppins with knobs on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Words cannot describe my loathing of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler!!! Only non-English people could possibly have anything good to say about this travesty of a film that takes our history and tears it apart. These murders ACTUALLY HAPPENED, PEOPLE - it's one of the terrible human tragedies of our history and films like these just DON'T CARE. Half the script is simply made up - Abberline was not an opium addict, he was about 20 years older than Johnny Depp (admirable though his performance is considering the material he's working with) and (SPOILER) he didn't die straight after the murders!!There is absolutely no evidence that the murdered prostitutes even knew each other, and Abberline and Kelly probably never even met, let alone fell in love. It;s another indication of Hollywood's stagnation that it simply can't bear to have a story featuring a male and a female without twisting the plot out of all reality just so the two leads can shag - it's appalling. Heather Graham looks like an angel with her beautifully coiffured hair and perfectly made up face - she's also the only prostitute not seen having sex in an alleyway. She looks absolutely ludicrous and totally unbelievable (not to mention the accent!) in amongst the filth and mire of Victorin London, the haunting and clever depiction of which is the only good thing in this film.The multitude of incredibly gifted British actors who are all well known and loved over here have their parts withered to nothing just so the two glamourous American leads can shine. Katrin Cartilidge, Robbie Coltrane, Lesley Sharp, Jason Fleming - all shamelessly wasted.(MAJOR SPOILERS) The voice of Jack is SO OBVIOUSLY Ian Holm's that only a moron could possibly have been surprised when he is revealed to be the Ripper. The fact that this film uses the old hackneyed and disproved-years-ago theory of Dr Gull having been the Ripper shows the depths of non-intelligence it has sunk to. And the idea of Queen Victoria having masterminded the killings is so silly I can't even comment on it.I'm too annoyed to continue listing the errors and faults this film has - like just making up the grape stalks being found by the bodies. It simply didn't happen and i don't know how the writers could have the audacity to commit such travesties. Oh, and don't listen to anyone who says it's gory because it's not AT ALL.AVOID THIS APPALLING FILM AT ALL COSTS IF YOU HAVE EVEN A SINGLE BRAIN CELL!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently, Whitechapel prostitutes were all pretty, clear-skinned young women with hearts of gold. Apparently, Fred Abberline was an opium addict who committed suicide after the Ripper murders (NB: he wasn't, and he didn't - he lived until 1929). Johnny Depp, fine actor though he is, was hilariously miscast in this film - about 20 years too young for a start. Also, why do all American actors playing British characters feel they need to put on awful cockney accents? The real Abberline was born in Dorset and would almost certainly not have spoken with an "'ullo guvnor" accent. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham's character) was born in Ireland, raised in Wales and did not move to London until the age of 21. Leaving aside the constellation of factual errors, this was a really poor, and quite dull, film. Far too long, overly melodramatic, and quite ridiculous in parts (the romance between Abberline and Mary Kelly, for example). It's also interesting that the filmmakers based their work on Alan Moore's graphic novel, but did not bother to go back to the original source: Stephen Knight's speculative, but well-researched, "Jack the Ripper: the Final Solution".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful gothic horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When From Hell premiered in the States I knew I had to see it. I read about its story and it seemed like a really good horror movie. Too bad it wasn´t much of a hit. Nonetheless, when it premiered here in Finland I went see it and I wasn´t disappointed at all. On the contrary. European critics also seemed to like the movie more than their American colleagues. Our local newspaper, for example, gave the movie a pretty good review. From Hell is actually quite similar to Tim Burton´s gothic masterpiece Sleepy Hollow which also starred Johnny Depp. Both movies are dark and old-fashioned horror movies. Like Sleepy Hollow, From Hell has a solid cast lead by Depp, Robbie Coltrane and Heather Graham. This time heads won´t roll, but scares are guaranteed. From Hell gets 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite acceptable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as thrillers go, there haven't been many worth watching in recent times. I'm pleased to say that "From Hell", although not perfect, is a neatly crafted and entertaining horror/drama/period piece.I was a little surprised when this film was first released to find out that it was directed by the Hughes brothers of "Dead Presidents" fame. Although competent film-makers and better-than-average storytellers, I wasn't particularly convinced that they could recreate 19th century England and the time of Jack the Ripper without at least some American overtones.Fortunately, they have reproduced this era in a very credible manner, with thanks to a number of their cast and crew. Cinematographer Peter Deming has created a claustrophobic and grimy London enveloped in sleaze and darkness and a sky that rarely seems to be anything but dull, even in the daytime shots. Veteran actors in the cast, particularly Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane, add class to the production and Johnny Depp is probably the best choice out of Hollywood's younger male stars to play someone other than an American.The only slightly negative thread is the casting of Heather Graham as a young English prostitute. She just doesn't feel that convincing in the part (especially beside her more experienced costars) but thankfully her role doesn't overshadow proceedings."From Hell" tells the tale of Jack the Ripper, who in London 1888, became one of the world's first serial killers, murdering a number of prostitutes on the east side of town. Inspector Johnny Depp, who has clairvoyant powers courtesy of his drug addiction, is hauled onto the case by baffled sergeant Robbie Coltrane. In his investigation, he is aided by prostitute Heather Graham, whose coworkers on the street seem to be turning up gruesomely murdered at an alarming rate. What follows is a dissection through the ranks of both lower and upper class London to eventually trace out the killer and his motives. Saying much more about the plotline would reveal too much, but similar to David Fincher's "Seven", it is nice to see a serial killer actually given a personality and a reason (even if quite skewed) for their actions. On the downside, I was able to pick who Jack the Ripper was very early on and the ending does come across as somewhat contrived.However, in a season of disappointing thrillers, "From Hell" is a welcome addition to the box-office. Although not a pure shock-fest (it is quite graphic and couldn't have been too far off an Australian R18+ certificate) it is a reasonably intelligent serial killer film for adults and certainly a change from all of the teenage slasher-flick clones which seem to be flooding the market.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hear you thinking;"Oh no, not another movie about Jack the Ripper." But this film gives you a good look of Jack and the mysterie around him. Because nobody can tell for sure that Jack has really lived his life with killing people. So any film about him is pure guessing about what happened.After you've seen from hell, you can tell people a little bit more about jack, but on the other side you can tell people nothing new about jack. So why is this film then so good? Well first of all the atmosphere they've captured in this film is taking you right back into the past. beside that there is a scene in the film where you see Johnny depp taking drugs with sugar and absint, besides that there is also a lot of opium involved. but all with all it is a very good movie. so if you haven't seen him this is absolute a must see film.go and check it out. see ya Gijs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film adaptation by the Hughes Brothers, though cinematically stylish and darkly brooding, runs immediately into predictable territory within the first 10 minutes. The casting itself is passable with Heather Graham, and Depp and Holm have good chemistry together; however, the only truly believable characters were the whores themselves...disgusting, pathetic, derelicts of society who use their womanhood as their livelihood- constantly striving for absolution from their sentences to poverty, and only receiving it in horrific deaths.Overall, it's too much of a "whodunit" pipe-dream. Ol' Jack would have turned his nose up at a tale that is so uninspired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty standard costumer with a mystery motif, and tons o' gore to keep the adolescents enthralled. Directed by the Hughes Brothers, FROM HELL has much going for it, however the writing tended to be poor and the plot really held no surprises. Johnny Depp rose above the material more than once, and he usually does. Robbie Coltrane was wasted as not much more than a flunky for Depp. Anyone who has seen Coltrane in the British series CRACKER knows this man can act. Heather Graham did a great job, and was wholly believable. Those "oh so terrible" British actors, naturally play the baddies. Ian Holm, a mesmerizing actor, takes center stage here and clearly relishes the role. The script really sinks the ship. The unsustained and at times, complete lack of suspense brings FROM HELL down to the level of a "game show," in terms of tension. Gratuitous violence never takes the place of suspense, but that doesn't stop screenwriters and directors from trying. Nice try...no cookie. Yes, the crimes of Jack the Ripper were indeed grotesque, however more was spent on faithfully rendering these scenes out, than the effort to peel away the layers of the story and where it was going.The conclusion bordered on the silly and camp (HM Queen Victoria makes a couple of cameos...good grief!), making the preceding time spent not really worth the while. My conclusion is that FROM HELL is a good costumer, but the overall effect is razzle-dazzle to disguise a stilted and clumsy script.NOT RECOMMENDED.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satisfying Consideration of the "Ripper" Case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The case of Jack the Ripper has long been, and continues to be, one of the great unsolved mysteries of all time, and as such has been the subject of numerous treatments in film. Of them all, however, none has advanced a more logical or plausible theory in explanation of the who, whys and wherefores of the infamous serial killer than `From Hell,' directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, which attempts to solve the mystery that has by consensus long been deemed `unsolvable.' But-- cinematically speaking, at any rate-- the Hughes Brothers make a decidedly solid case of it.It's 1888, London; in the Whitechapel district prostitutes are being systematically slaughtered in a precise and grisly manner. Scotland Yard is at a loss to solve or stop the murders, and Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is assigned to investigate. Abberline is somewhat unique in his approach, as he is invested with certain prescient abilities, which he enhances through the use of opium, laudanum and absinthe; not the usual methods employed by the police, but it does effect the desired results. Abberline discovers a link between the victims, and along the way becomes involved with one of the `girls,' Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who may be in danger because of something she knows. But as Abberline gets closer to a solution, he very well may be in danger also; he knows too much, and there is one, especially, who would find ease if he were to just disappear. And by any means necessary.The proper atmosphere is, of course, a requirement if one is to tell this story convincingly, and the Hughes Brothers succeed nicely in this regard. But it would be hard to find a movie about the Ripper that did NOT achieve a proper mood; it's kind of a common link that ties all of the previous offerings together, up to and including this one. This film differs from the rest in one important respect, however, and it's a big one-- that being the story itself. Whereas the others are good at leading you down the path and taking you nowhere, the Hughes Brothers go out on a limb and actually deliver a satisfying ending, and moreover, one that solves the mystery. It's all speculation, of course, but this film will leave you feeling closer to the truth than ever before. It's well crafted and executed, and they manage to keep the air fairly heavy with menace and suspense, from the beginning right up to the very end, which ultimately defines it as something of a `fable-noir.'Johnny Depp gives a solid, convincing performance as Abberline, who is something of the antithesis of another of his creations, Constable Ichabod Crane, of Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow.' It's a challenge for an actor to take on two roles somewhat similar in nature to begin with, and successfully manage to make them quite the opposite of one another in the end, which is what Depp has done with these respective portrayals. The events surrounding Crane may have been dark, but Ichabod was not; here, however, Deep finds a dark side of his character, Abberline, that is as enigmatic as the case with which he is dealing, and it is that to which Depp plays, approaching from the depths and looking up, rather than observing from a position of light, as he did in `Hollow.' And it demonstrates that Depp is endowed with that same kind of chameleon-like quality that serves such actors as De Niro and Billy Bob Thornton so well; it's a matter of being able to transform oneself from the inside out, which comparably few actors can do with any real success.Heather Graham does a good job with her role of Mary; she's convincing for the most part, but there are moments when it's something of a challenge for the viewer to totally believe that she is a `lady of the night.' Her appearance seems almost a bit too polished, especially compared to the other girls. It's a minor complaint, however, as overall, though her performance may not necessarily be one of the strengths of the film, it certainly does nothing to detract from the effectiveness of it.The performance turned in by Ian Holm, on the other hand, is definitely one of the film's strengths. As Sir William Gull, he is quite believable, with a probing portrayal that does much for the credibility of the story. Also helping things along substantially, are Robbie Coltrane (who has since become known, and will forever after be, `Harry Potter's' Hagrid), as Abberline's colleague, Peter Godley, and Susan Lynch (who previously gave such a remarkable performance as Nora Barnacle in `Nora,' opposite Ewan McGregor), as Liz Stride.The supporting cast includes Ian Richardson (Sir Charles Warren), Jason Flemyng (Netley), Katrin Cartlidge (Dark Annie), Terence Harvey (Ben Kidney), Paul Rhys (Dr. Ferral) and Lesley Sharp (Kate). Arguably the best and, without question the most satisfying of all the `Ripper' movies, `From Hell' is a well made, graphic and thought provoking consideration of the Whitechapel killings, which for quite some time held all of London in the grip of fear and terror. The conclusions offered here may just be as close to the truth as anyone will ever get; in the event that it is pure fiction, however,it is decidedly good fiction that makes for a couple of hours of riveting entertainment and speculation. Be forewarned, this one is not going to be for everyone, as many of the mental, as well as visual images it presents are extremely disconcerting. Definitely not for the squeamish, but for those who are so disposed, this one will prove to be quite an experience. It's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 8/10.  </fullReview>

Along with that came a another good performance by Johnny Deep, but I felt the supporting performance of Heather Graham could have been played better by a British actress or a lesser unknown. I just couldn't picture Heather in anything less then a peppy gorgeous blond role (ie Austin Powers), although I have to say she surprised me in this role as the 19th century whore with the tender heart.

		<fullReview>The movie From Hell seemed high on visuals, but it did not grip me on the edge of my seat through any part of the film. I guess it was a mostly follow the trail type of movie instead of a murder mystery/suspense.The who dunnit part was mildly interesting, but the intersection of the perpetrator and inspector made the assumption that he was the one somewhat obvious because there were so few other character's personalities or traits revealed that it's as if there was a neon sign pointing to him in the whole scene. We were lead to believe it was constantly somebody else, but when the murderer was revealed, the thought of "I don't know why, but I had a feeling it was him" keeps popping up.Maybe the hallucinations should have been more intertwined with the investigation as opposed to a after the fact confirmation of what the inspector imagined in his mind.Hether Grahm should stick to her usual happy spacy roles, since she seems out of place compared to the other hoarse prostitutes, acting and character-wise. The rest of the British casts seems to fit right in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now where have I seen this kind of thing before...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know at the time that "From Hell" is based on a comic book, but in retrospect, it's obvious. It's imbued throughout with what I call "comicbook darkness".You know the kind of thing I mean. Whenever you pick up a modern comic book (which, admittedly, isn't often in my case) it turns out to have been written by someone obsessed with trying to capture the same rich characterisations one encounters in literature and cinema. But rich characters are only possible in literature because of such things as internal monologues, and because the author is free to simply TELL us - taking as much time about it as he needs to - whatever it is he wants us to know. Rich characters are possible in cinema because we get to see actual actors with actual human faces, and because directors have almost continuous control over the degree to which any given detail may be stressed.These devices aren't available to comic book artists, who, as it happens, CAN'T create rich characters, by ANY means. It's just one of the limitations of their craft. It's a limitation they share with oral storytellers, librettists, animators, composers and choreographers, so there's no reason whatever for them to be ashamed of it - but for some reason, they ARE ashamed, and so while they continue to draw clear, flat, action characters, they make a ghastly attempt to ape Dostoyevsky by having these characters brood all the time. In an attempt to create "depth" they give their heroes artificial flaws and cover their world with artificial grime.That's what we have here. The hero is addicted to opium not because he would be but because it's the kind of comicbook detail designed to let us know that the authors are being all adult and sophisticated. Characters are cynical not because it's in their nature but because it's not - because when a character acts or speaks against his or her nature, it is (so the theory goes) "layered". I'll admit I'm having a hard time coming up with instances. You've either noticed the kind of phoney, unearned darkness of modern comic books, or you haven't. If you've noticed it you'll find the film is saturated with it. But it's in the spirit in which the story is told rather than in any particular detail.No complaints about the plot, and in the final half hour or so, it actually starts to work as a film. The trouble is it hadn't done so AT ALL until then.</fullReview>

The basic idea is neat - a police inspector tracks the notorious Jack the Ripper before he kills again. This is all very well and fine, but in true Hollywood style they couldn't leave it there. We get a gold-hearted prostitute whom the inspector falls in love with. We get the secret love child of the Prince of Wales and another gold-hearted prostitute. We get a ridiculous conspiracy and we're supposed to believe it's all historically accurate? Give me a break. Johnny Depp, as usual, is excellent, Heather Graham is indifferent. Possibly an entertaining movie for those who haven't studied the Ripper case much or don't care about the glaring historical errors and omissions.</fullReview>

Still, I hoped it might be a little atmospheric, spooky diversion. Sadly, no. I'd imagine you have to work pretty hard to make the Ripper story NOT scary, but the Hughes brothers manage it. First of all, as another viewer noted, this particular take on the story has been done (and better) in Murder by Decree. I suppose you have to credit the boldness (?) of any film that suggests that Queen Victoria was involved in a murder conspiracy, but it really just comes off as a cheap bit of class vindictiveness. She represents everything that is oppressive and wrong in that society, right? So it only follows that she wouldn't stop at a bit of homicide. Ye gad. Another minor (yet distracting) detail is the color of Heather Graham's hair. I couldn't decide if they were trying to make her appear more "Irish," or if that stunningly unnatural color was meant to look like just that (colored to attract customers?). My fear was that someone in makeup thought this looked appropriate, or heaven help us, "real." Implicating the Masons in murderous rituals is a nice touch, too; maybe they can replace Nazis as the one group filmmakers can villify without repercussion. Sigh. All woefully inept at every level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Hell - or somewhere worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film came From Hell - or somewhere worse. And I'll tell you why...The direction - by clever, clever duo the Hughes brothers, who film fans usually love - is too clever, clever by half, and the speeded up moments and endless/ totally boring opium den shots just grate after the third or fourth time you get to see them. Maybe these shots also annoy because it's just so dull to see that also too clever, clever by half supercool actor Johnny Depp look really spaced out - again. And again. Yep - and again.I've never much cared for Johnny Depp, and this isn't just because he's bedded both Kate Moss and Vanessa Paradis. Well - OK, maybe a little bit because of this.Honestly though, respected actor he might well be, but he's TERRIBLE in this film throughout. I laughed, out loud. I never do that normally - not even when watching a good comedy. All pouting, posing and terribly bad cockerney accent worthy of a Michael Caine impersonator crossed with an Eastenders actor straight out of drama school.The story - based on the graphic novel - hardly has an original theory as to who Jack The Ripper really is, but when you find out you don't really care anyway as the guilty suspect's acting is so straight-out-of-the-theatre annoying that it has been grating on you throughout, numbing you beyond caring. Actually, most of the actors in this film act as if they've just stepped out of a terribly English theatre role at the Old Vic. Posh or Cockney - Hollywood has two sides of the coin when portraying us Londoners.And the horror - the horror is so tame that it's laughable. The gore is so blandly directed, despite wannabe explicit moments, with so little real obvious love of the genre that it makes an episode of Buffy look like out-takes from Wes Craven's Last House On The Left.All the prostitutes look down and out and dirty, and that's fair enough - except for leading lady prostitute Heather Graham as Mary Kelly with her fashion model make-up and glamorous, shampoo-ad red hair. No 'woman of the night' ever looked like this back then. Lucky boys if one did. Even Kate Moss and Vanessa Paradis look less well-manicured and scrubbed-up than this 'lady'.Whoops - there I go again. Johnny Depp - the lucky....Oh, I nearly forgot, Robbie Coltane is really good in this. Good thing he acts Scottish throughout then and doesn't even try to be a 'cockerney sparrah'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nonsense from beginning to end.Johnny Depp's miscasting,from being the wrong age to having the wrong accent (Abberline was born in Dorset) wasn't helped at all by the insane fictionalising of his life and the case.Abberline was a happily-married family man.He was a fine detective operating within a culture of shoddy and morally dubious policework.There's no record of his being a junkie.He died in 1929,aged 86.The flights of fancy in the case shown are too numerous to mention.A few points:There's no evidence that the victims knew one another.The "Royal Jack" theory has been disproven many times over.The "pentagram" story falls apart if one actually tries marking the murder sites on a street map.Sir William Gull,by 1888,was almost entirely incapacitated by a severe stroke.(And he didn't die in the asylum following a lobotomy!)Sir Charles Warren resigned prior to the final murder.There's precious little evidence that the killer had anything but the most rudimentary anatomical evidence.Etc,etc,etc...Once again,we get Hollywood using its financial muscle to produce such a lavish version of events that unquestioning audiences will accept it as soothe and the subject will be off limits to other filmmakers for years to come.What a great shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, surrealistic journey into Victorian England</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not too excited to see this movie when it originally came out, but recently rented it and found that it was surprisingly good. It takes a played-out story and gives it fresh twist and even goes one step further than usual and solves the crime! AND the solution makes sense!Johnny Depp, using an authentic Cockney accent, does a great job in the lead as a demoralized inspector seeking the truth about these gruesome sex crimes. Heather Graham finally gives up her kittenish image and also comes through in her role as one of the "unfortunates" or prostitutes of the London streets.The dark, moody atmosphere is created through camerawork, sets and the editing, which has a dreamy, surrealistic edge to it inspired by Depp's opium hazes and "intuitions". Though these visions are not crucial to the plot, they take us a little more into the horror of what these crimes were.If you are squeamish about blood, DO NOT see this movie, because these filmmakers want you to experience these acts even from the point of view of "The Ripper", but if you are a fan of the horror genre, I would say that "From Hell" is a must-see.</fullReview>

Now they have moved on to a different ghetto, the mean streets of london and they prove they are not just a one trick pony. They tell a fascinating story about murder, conspiracy, and betrayal. Johnny Depp is great in the film, Robbie Cultrain is very entertaining and Heather Grahm gives a very steady performance as well.

		<fullReview>I wasn´t expecting this to be very good, in fact I expected an over-stylized Hollywood version of Alan Moore´s great and horrific Ripper-tale. The Hughes brothers previous DEAD PRESIDENTS, I found to be overlong, overexplicit and illogic. So I was (un)pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a very tough, realistic and unflinching tale. Not since SE7EN, have I squirmed in my seat so much. What´s impressive is among other things, Peter Demings cinematography and the brilliant sets which really transports you back in time. The stylized visions and scene transitions work very well and never become overly flashy. I also didn´t find Johnny Depps Cockney-accent irritating, which I also was expecting, he´s done another great role here. As for Heather Graham, she´s been criticized of being too pretty for this part, and maybe that´s true, but on the other hand, wouldn´t it have been just as unrealistic if every prostitute of that time was ugly-lookin´? Very effective score and sound design also. This is the best work of the Hughes Brothers thus far. A nice touch was also the very "unflashy" main titles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and intriguing--one hell of a ride!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the previews my first thought was "The Hughes Brothers directed this?" No offense, they're great at what they do. "Menace 2 Society" and "Dead Presidents" are both very good movies, but how are they gonna pan out directing a period piece? Well, this isn't a period piece in the conventional sense. Most of the time when you think "period piece" you think about something along the lines of "Sense and Sensibility." "From Hell" is more like a modern day crime thriller/horror flick taking place in the late 1800's. The sets and costumes fit the period, but the style is modern. I knew nothing about the Jack the Ripper murders previous to viewing the movie, so I found this movie entertaining as well as informative. And the DVD contains a couple of documentaries about the real Ripper murders. Like many historians said, there were many suspects, but they never really found out who was the real Jack the Ripper. So the Hughes Brothers had a little bit of artistic liberty in creating the story. The plot twist is really neat, I never expected *namesake* to be the killer. But other than the Ripper's true identity, the Hughes stayed strict to how the rest of the murders were committed. I was surprised to find out that there are in fact a lot of historical inaccuracies present--at least that's what it says in the "goofs" section, they could be wrong. According to the featurette, the Hughes Brothers were sticklers for detail. But who cares anyway? So what if they did get a few things wrong? Is there anybody watching this movie that was actually around during the 19th century? The sets look magnificent and so do the costumes. That's all I care about. I'm glad the Hughes cast Johnny Depp in the lead role. He's absolutely perfect at anything he does, never failing to give a vibrant, Oscar-worthy performance. So him being the star was one of my main motivations for seeing this movie. I read that actors like Brad Pitt and Sean Connery were considered for the role. Well, no one can fit the part better than Johnny Depp. His English accent is perfect, but I wasn't worried he wouldn't be able to pull it off--he's Johnny Depp, he can pull off anything! Who I was surprised about was Heather Graham. Though she's often good at what she does, she usually does fluff films and I was surprised that she was able to fluently pull off the English accent as well as deliver a fully convincing performance. When I rented the movie, the clerk said to me "Just to let you know: There are certain historical flaws in the movie...like there were no prostitutes back then who looked like Heather Graham. In fact, they didn't even look like women." Well, Heather did seem a little misplaced among the rest of the prostitutes, who did in fact look as ugly as the real prostitutes during the period, but I was willing to suspend disbelief. Despite that mild casting error, her performance was convincing. Robbie Coltrane is amusing as Depp's sidekick, and they have an interesting chemistry. Also among the great cast of English actors are Ian Holm and Ian Richardson. The effects are gory, but not gratuitous. The Hughes Brothers did leave enough to the audience's imagination. If you have an extremely weak stomach, you'll definitely cringe and maybe hurl, but if not you should be fine. But I didn't really look at it as a horror film perse. I thought of it more as a murder mystery, though many will probably think of it more along the lines of horror. But even if you think of it as horror, it's not slice-and-dice "Friday the 13th" horror. It's horror with a story--a very good one. I was intrigued throughout, especially since I knew nothing about the Ripper murders. And there are some nice touches of comic relief. I love the scene in which The Ripper says, "One day people will look back and say I gave birth to the 20th century." Johnny Depp pulls out a gun and replies, "You're not going to see the 20th century." Those who know a lot about The Ripper murders will probably complain about the littlest of details, and be very cynical in approaching the movie, but I found it to be a wild ride. It's intriguing, it's stylish and extremely well-acted. I'm not asking for much more! My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a hot film, not a cold one.... From Limbo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A clarvoyant inspector works on the famed Jack the Ripper murder cases in Victorian era London. Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) can best be described as troubled, as he is haunted both by his own psychic abilities and his dependence on absinthe. As destitute prostitutes are murdered and eviscerated, disemboweled, and worse on the streets of the extremely poor Whitechapel section of the city, Abberline tries to discern the culprit - it's a learned man, he concludes, one with a distinct knowledge of medicine. Smart lad, that. As Abberline becomes more and more involved with the case, he also becomes more involved with one prostitute in particular whose group seems to have been targeted, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). From the start, one can tell that Mary and Abberline will hook up, because she is the only prostitute who does not look downtrodden and, well, like a bucket of mud. (As a point of fact, love interests never look like buckets of mud, unless the story is about a cure for looking like a bucket of mud, or something.)At any rate, as Abberline investigates further, he runs into his ultraconservative, image-conscious boss, who even asks him to destroy evidence and suspends him (how come so few police chiefs and the like actually act in concert with their detectives and officers on the screen? How come the cop has to go beyond regulations to get at the truth?). Abberline does have the help of his colleague Peter Godley (the always-reliable Robbie Coltrane), but in general he's on his own. Can he solve the crimes?Depp attempts to disappear into the role, and for the most part he succeeds, right down to what sounds to me like an authentic Cockney accent (but what do I know?). The problem is, the story's weak, and when the lead actor's just trying to blend in, the movie comes off as rather pedestrian. In other words, folks, you've already seen this movie in one form or another. There are some twists, but they're minor ones. It's a rainy, cold, dark, dreary movie, much like I imagine London itself was back then (and perhaps still is, at times). There's simply not much unique with this movie, and it could have been just as well done with lesser-known stars. Graham, in particular, is wasted here - she's a fine actress, but she's left to do little more than be a victim. In addition, the ending is pretty unsatisfying, although the killer is named. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie, but I think that the opportunity of a great movie was missed. It has logic all over, it is not badly acted, and succeeds to recreate something of the London Victorian atmosphere. A quite sophisticated explanation of the Ripper cases bought me in, and I am sure many will be in my situation. There are some tough scenes, but it is about Jack the Ripper after all. Word is out that the film authors will join the Cohens and the Tavianis in the gallery of great brother directing couples. I think that it is too early to say - there was a big subject our there, but the general outcome is too conventional. Almost each 'surprise' could be anticipated one scene earlier, the red and black cinematography and the sets smelled Hollywood, there is good acting but no unforgettable act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT a documentary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSI must say I completely enjoyed this film from beginning to end. It is the only film the Hughes Brothers have made that I enjoyed. I have never enjoyed "slasher" films or anything in that genre, but From Hell I enjoyed so much I bought it on DVD. People have complained that this film doesn't follow the facts of history and so on. I rush to the film's defense, reminding everyone that this movie is not, nor has it ever claimed to be, a documentary. This is a Hollywood adaptation of a graphic novel, basically a long and more adult-oriented comic book. There has never been a more realistic and stylish representation of Victorian London and the ghetto that is Whitechapel. But style alone does not a great movie make. Johnny Depp is outstanding in this film, as is Robbie Coltrane who is good in everything it seems. Ian Holm is a great Jack the Ripper, not at all overacted and his smaller stature seems to add something to his performance as a believable psychotic. The only problem I have with the whole film is Heather Graham, who plays the part reasonably well, but she's so much better looking than her fellow prostitutes that she sticks out like a massive sore thumb. There isn't as much graphic violence in this as I thought there would be. In fact, you don't see too much gore until the final two murders, which are admittedly brutal. You do HEAR the killings, but for the most part you don't see them. I am NOT a fan of gore so if I say this film wasn't too disturbing than probably you won't either, though this is by no means a film to be watched in the presence of children. If you would prefer a film that sticks to facts, don't see From Hell, but if you like a stylish thriller with some rather disturbing moments and a whodunnit, this is a great film</fullReview>

But extremly, extremly gross. Very gross. Very, very gory and gross, but good. Johnny Depp is good in this, Heather Graham is surprisingly good, and the all around presentation of this movie was great. The disturbing picture of Victorian England. The story, involving a possible who Jack the Ripper was scenerio, is also well executed, with the exceptions of one or two scenes not being so great. The intertwined love story is also very, surprisingly good in this. So, I give From Hell two thumbs up, a good movie, but very VERY gross, the slashing noises and throat cuttings are very disturbing and graphic. All in all a very good, delivering thriller.</fullReview>

The time and place are presented more convincingly than many other films set in the same era. The mystery is well-plotted and paced, and matches the real life events with a more than plausible explanation for their occurrence. There is a paranormal aspect to this interpretation, but it does not detract from the plot or stray off needlessly into either laborious exposition or lala-land new agey stoner mysticism.

		<fullReview>The movie "From Hell", although well directed/acted/filmed, seems strangely underrated to me for some reason. It could be the fact that the viewer doesn't realize all the historical accurateness that was inserted into this film, with the exception of the ending (in real life Jack the Ripper did not get discovered and "nailed" as he did in the film). Now I'm not trying to advertise the selling of its Digital Versatile Disc version but I do strongly suggest you watch it (disc 2 of "From Hell"), and then watch or rewatch the actual flick "From Hell," to gain the full appreciation of all the details put in the movie. The "Special Features" disc covers everything from the making of the film, to its historical details (i.e.- the exact position of the bodies in both the movie, and in the 1888 case, and actual case files from the Jack the Ripper case used), and for some reason the history of absenthe. So look twice and notice the little things, you might be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, you can't possibly expect to see a movie from the year 2001 about Jack the Ripper, without sickening scenes. It's strange however how this graphic violence has become common in many mainstream films nowadays. And its getting worse all the time."From Hell" is better than one did imagine. Most credit goes to the East End environment (filmed in Prague actually). But not just the environment, but also the make-up, the clothing, the mood of this area is to be believed as authentical.But Johnny Depp isn't good. He goes through the whole film with the same expression, even while "chasing the dragon" in the opium dens. Better acting comes from Heather Graham and many things have been said about her being too pretty, but that's not important She is believeable and so is definitely Robbie Coltrane as the police sergeant.Two hours don't appear to be too long. It is entertaining all the time, if you can take cut throats and ripped out hearts. Does the story hold together? Well, the end is surprising. And somewhat happy, despite of everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had serious problems trying to enjoy this movie as it obviously suffers from "Sleepy Hollow Syndrome" (SHS). I'll try to explain what I mean: The most important fact that made me dislike this Hollywood production was the more than clumsily written script.... simply put: it was LAME. Throughout the whole 2 hours I did not give a damn about what would happen to the characters or who the killer really was. Just as in "SH", none of the characters were able to draw the viewer's attention for more than 5 minutes. And, also a trademark of the SHS, the ending was completely unsatisfying since it made the impression as if it were hastily put together only to reveal that the murderer ***SPOILER*** was someone that you didn't give s***t about at all. ***end of SPOILER*** Well, I would still prefer SH over this bore of a movie any day. I haven't read any of the graphic novels this film is supposedly based on but if the storyline therein is as dull as what the viewer is offered here, then I doubt it would have ever been adapted for the silver screen. The plot has many holes that were seemingly just put in there to make the whole thing longer (115 minutes!!! there was enough plot for about 60).***SPOILERS AHEAD*** Why is this whole drug-addiction-vision thing so important anyway?!! It doesn't add to the suspense and the sequences aren't even interesting to watch when you're ON drugs.... I think that says a lot. What meaning or possible plot relevancy is there behind the odd lesbian relationship between some of the whores?!? I DID NOT GET IT! If anyone did, then please take the time to explain it to me!! I'd really appreciate it: ;) Why Oh Why did it have to end like this?!!! It's the ending that I had been expecting since the first 30 minutes or so!!! I knew who he was all along!!! That's not what a thriller is supposed to be like! I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHO JTR WAS!!!! At least it shouldn't be someone like the killer portrayed in "From Hell".Well what else is there to say? The pathetic acting (with the cheesiest part delivered by good ol' Heather G.) was not helped by the poor accents.... and usually I'm very generous when it comes to accents. The whole drama thing was about as involving as an episode of "Denver Clan" and Johnny D. couldn't convince me that he really wanted to make a good movie. I like many of Johnny Depp's works (especially Dead Man and Fear And Loathing... ;-) ) but I believe that he should've just skipped this one (and a few others, mind you).Ok, so to sum it up: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It may have some (very little) gore but it's not enough to keep slasher-fans interested. There's no historical correctness either, so anyone interested in the Jack the Ripper story will be very disappointed as well. And there isn't enough original plot, almost no good acting and only fairly impressive camerawork.... so it won't be a treat for any of you moviemaniacs out there either. Don't say I didn't warn you!The Elephant Man?!?! .... for what reason I ask!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well,what can I say? I like horror,mystery,thriller and slasher movies,as well as a good drama,but this film is none of them. It starts off moody enough but soon becomes kind of boring,the last 30 minutes or so are ok again. I don't know why it's not a good movie,the pictures are nice,acting is good,maybe it's the lack of a good soundtrack? It's still a mystery to me what makes a film an excellent one. Fact is,this isn't a movie that you want to see till the end! Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this film. Johnny Depp in another gothic thriller, what's not to like? Unfortunately, this is no Sleepy Hollow or Ninth Gate. I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong with the story. It was intelligent and detailed. I for one didn't guess who the Ripper was, though that probably says more about me than about the screenwriter's skill. For some reason I just didn't get involved. Neither couls Depp since he was acting on autopilot here (though a Depp on autopilot is still better then a lot of today's actors in top form). His romance with graham feels forced, these two are together because the script says so, not because they belonged. On the upside, there was some great looking Art direction and nice music, but that couldn't make up for the fact that From Hell feels empty and soulless, probably much like the Ripper himself. And am I the only one who hated the ending? Tim Burton could have had a field day directing this..Rating: 6,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack the Ripper is one of the world's greatest mysteries. A serial killer, whose spate of gruesome murders within London during the autumn of 1888 lasted for ten weeks, and remains unsolved. 'From Hell' is yet another filmic inclusion based on this notorious and infamous killer. Johnny Depp plays Inspector Abberline, a drug-induced physic detective, who finds himself the head investigator in solving the bizarre and violent murders of prostitutes within the Whitechapel district of inner London. Assisted by his sergeant, Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane), Abberline manages to examine the brutal crime scenes, and can even foresee the events during his opium-induced dream states. Together, they discover that the ritualistic killings are targeted at a certain group of prostitutes. This leads Abberline to Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a nineteenth century prostitute who assists him in finding clues, while she and her friends remain a target of what the media now dub "Jack the Ripper". As more murders occur, Abberline finds himself desperate to solve these crimes, and soon suspects that the killer is someone from the London?s Upper class.The Hughes Brothers attempt a different genre than their previous ghetto films, 'Menace II Society' and 'Dead Presidents'. They manage to capture the feel of a nineteenth century London, and create a visually interesting film in 'From Hell'. Based on the 600 page graphic novel by Alan Moore with same title, this film version contains the stylistic colours and haunting eeriness that embodies the era. The first half of 'From Hell' is excellent, with it?s relentless pacing and cleverly structured murder scenes. The film slows down significantly in the second half, as Abberline gathers information from respected surgeon Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) in relating the crimes to someone with medical knowledge. There is also an unconvincing romance between Abberline and Mary Kelly, as he discovers clues from her that create a complicated web of leads. It's so complex in fact, that this whodunit takes it's time- where you may have already figured out who the killer is long before Abberline's drug addled perceptions and meticulous examinations finish.Johnny Depp manages to convey Inspector Abberline extremely well with a convincing Cockney accent. Heather Graham is miscast as Mary Kelly, especially when she is surrounded by her fellow prostitutes- played more convincingly by Lesley Sharp and Katrin Cartlidge. It seems the producers wanted a popular star in Graham rather than casting a more authentic actress. Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and Ian Richardson are all adequate in their roles respectively. 'From Hell' is a film that I wanted to like more, but unfortunately it doesn't become the essential Jack the Ripper film. It?s too intelligent to be simply a slasher film, yet too glamorised and glossy to become an authentic period piece. 'From Hell' is quite graphic and very gritty in parts, yet it lacks the suspense and involvement with the main characters. Although, many aspects of the story lead to complicated ground, the characters themselves are quite shallow and therefore uninteresting. I rarely felt fear for them, and by the climax I just wanted the film to finish. The Hughes brothers have created a part horror and part whodunit film in exploring the history surrounding Jack the Ripper, but it lacks emotion within its characters and gets sidetracked by a silly romance angle. Some interesting themes of class are explored, and an interesting theory behind the legend of Jack the Ripper, but 'From Hell' never quite becomes the essential suspense-horror piece or the riveting historical drama. I would recommend this film to die-hard slasher fans and those who enjoy watching the always-formidable Johnny Depp. *** out of *****. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very pedestrian re-tread of the Jack the Ripper story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to wonder why the studio bought the rights to Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's thoughtful graphic novel to then make a very pedestrian re-tread of the Jack the Ripper story. Despite their supposed poverty every one of the prostitutes had gleaming white teeth, the ending felt like and was a tacked on dreadful joke and the film bore no resemblance to (or respect for) the graphic novel. Oh yeah, evil is black contact lenses and didn't anyone else recognise the voice of Jack the Ripper? Some elements of the book remain (ie the bits that were in the superior TV movie with Michael Caine) but this is standard damsel-in-distress, love story, horror by-the-numbers fare. A waste of time by all involved. Depp's character a pot-headed psychic could never have held the position he did at that time, he'd have been the prime suspect if he's started going on about "seeing the bodies" while Robbie Coltrane adds buddy movie bits (why?). The whole thing was rubbish. This must surely make Moore even more cautious about allowing any of his other properties to reach the big screen if this kind of tripe is the result of the enormous effort by himself and Campbell. Read the comic (but prepare to need a strong stomach) and watch Sleepy Hollow if you want to see a quality performance by Depp.Joe Middleton http://joe-middleton.web-page.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Speaking as a one who has researched Jack The Ripper for some time I was disappointed with this Film. Although it does not make out to be an accurate retelling of the events it did leave a lot to be desired in the way of facts. For example Abberline played by Jonny Depp was portrayed as a Cockney who was addicted to opium in reality Abberline was from Dorset and retired to Bournemouth after he left The Police Force. This is just one of many flaws in the script. Although superbly acted by the entire cast, I felt more could've been gleamed from the Graphic Novel on which the film is based. Alan Moore's and Eddie Campbell's work was far superior in providing Background, Reason for Conspiracy and Motivation of the Villain. Instead the film left us with many questions unanswered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently I read an interview with the Hughes brothers in a Sunday supplement, which described their disadvantaged childhood and how they triumphed eventually thanks to their incredibly supportive mother. (For example: they were bought only 2 pairs of trousers per year yet when she found out they were interested in film-making, she bought them $500 worth of video equipment.) Also I have read the graphic novel this year and was suitably blown away by it's passion for the subject, it's imagination and it's intricate form-reinventing structure.So despite the horrendous trailers ("If you think you know evil, you don't know Jack ")and casting of Hollywood stars who look like everything thats ever passed their lips has been molecularly examined, as downtrodden 'unfortunates', I went along to 'From Hell' expecting something special.Instead it lived up to the trailers, being a sub mediocre thriller tacked onto Romantic Storyline No.63, with overblown visuals in the style of Francis Ford Copella's 'Dracula', that could have been directed by any of a thousand Hollywood hacks. And it's not even fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are both johnny depp fans and admire his willingness to take on quirky, but fascinating parts but this was a big letdown.I have seen his accent etc compared to Dick van Dyke (in Chitty, Chitty Bang Bang), both here and elsewhere and I can only agree. Why do highly paid actors and directors turn in such poor performances. Out of principle, I feel that it is important to try to be realistic. For instance, we used to be shown westerns that had nice,neat towns, with friendly saloon girls. Hey, do you believe the 'wild' west was like that. Or were the towns muddy, filthy, smelled and were the saloon girls pox ridden whores?So we come to the London of Jack the Ripper. Gin cost a penny a pint, what do you think the whores did? Did they have condoms and penicillin? Yes they bought and drank gin by the pint. So what do you think they looked like?And Heather Graham, the beautiful whore with the heart of gold? Yeh, go to the Minneapolis St Paul arrests page and look at the street whores arrested today. Is it likely that they have improved? The girls in the Ripper's day would have been approaching the end of their days, literally, so lets have some realism, don't romanticise it, it makes for a much better, really moving movie.And Abbeline, well he was a country boy, from the backwoods of England, was he an opium addict? he did not die in an opium den. He died of natural causes, in a village in Dorset, in retirement.The Ripper - lots of theories, very romantic some of them, as shown in this movie, very speculative, no factual evidence has been produced to point to his (or her) identity and the mode of slaughter does not match masonic ritual - there are no female masons so the removal of the vagina etc cannot be defined as a masonic punishment.The victims - this is the first intimation that I have seen that they knew one another and were a close group.A rogue mason - interesting, but remember that the freemason vows to support the laws of the land, not to blindly support the monarch, so the blinded rogue as portrayed here would be quickly brought to justice..The Hughes brothers and Johnny Depp, have let themselves down with this flawed production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy From Hell as a fictional romp....but what a shame it offers us nothing new on the murders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since Michael Caine donned the garb of a Victorian police inspector for a 1988 mini-series has there been a decent stab at a Jack the Ripper film.So quite why the Hughes brothers decided to remake the old ITV version is a mystery to me. While From Hell successfully creates the requisite dark and foreboding atmosphere, it lazily relies on the generation old and long-discredited Stephen Knight theory as to the killer's identity. Anyone with a passing familiarity with the case has heard whodoneit according to this legend, so it would have been a refreshing change to see the production team plump for a different suspect altogether, preferably one whose candidacy wasn't disproved nearly thirty years ago.Because lest anyone leave the cinema thinking that the Ripper might indeed have been the tall-hatted, caped figure who descends elegantly from a coach in From Hell, be assured that Stephen Knight was found to have fabricated the only, tenuous evidence for his fantasies the moment serious researchers starting investigating his work. And although fairly credible suspects such as Tumblety and William Bury have been identified, our best guess as to the killer's identity is still that he was a nameless, psychotic misfit who lived somewhere in the East of London, though not necessarily on the doorstep of the murders, and who managed to escape the attentions of the contemporary police, who were not used to dealing with the modern serial killer: the murderer of strangers.Nevertheless, there are some strong things in the favour of this movie. The performances of Depp, and indeed Heather Graham, for one. (I only noticed one brief moment when Graham's accent faltered, although it is interesting to think that the real Mary Kelly was brought up in Wales - try wrapping your tongue round that accent, Heather.) I also enjoyed Robbie Coltrane's turn as the phlegmatic Sergeant Godley, and each of the circle of "unfortunates" picked off by the Ripper gives us an acting masterclass. The relationship between the whores (as they refer to themselves) seems genuine and warm, even if the characters they play did not in fact know one another, and I also really believed that Inspector Abberline and his Sergeant had a solid relationship and cared about each other, making for a poignant moment at the close of events. The effort to recreate the actual sites of the murders is another thing From Hell has going for it, and it would be churlish to note that the brothers have taken certain liberties when it comes to the details of the killings.Take From Hell for what it is, then, and enjoy it as a fictional romp. But what a shame then the careful attention displayed in the production values of this film could not have been lavished on a script that offered the cinema-going public something new to excite them about this curious chapter of criminal history. Three stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sorry mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hell has plenty of acting talent, and the sets look nice, but the Hughes brothers are clearly out of their depth.It is obvious from the early scene of the prostitutes talking in the street that they are badly in need of an English director to say `once more, but this time make it sound real'. It is a feature of directors working outside their own culture that they can't see beyond the accent, to whether the actor is giving a good performance.The two greatest failings for me are:Johnny Depp's accent. Why would a police inspector in Victorian London have a cockney accent? A man of any standing, even a bobby on the beat, would adopt a refined accent, no matter what his background.His `detective' work. The inspector makes the most ludicrous logical jumps, which somehow lead him in the right direction. Because he finds grapes on the victims, he deduces that the Jack the Ripper is a wealthy man, because `no-one in Whitechapel would be able to afford grapes'. No chance, then, that the grapes might be stolen, a present from a rich person to the murderer, fell off the back of a lorry, etc etc.In all, I felt this film was a badly-researched mess, with very little logic, and no suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started out in a very promising way. It used some very intersting direction and cinematography to illustrate the "dreams" that Johnny Depp's character has while smoking opium. It was very effective and gripping film work. I was very excited when these scenes were shown. Unfortunately, those scenes turned out to be few and far between. From a director's point of view, I believe they were used as an instrument to catch the audience's attention.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't follow up with with that momentum. Instead, the plot gets rather murky and dark. Although this is understandable considering the subject matter, it produces some very boring and long scenes.

		<fullReview>The Jack the Ripper case fascinates me. I lived in England for a total of 6 months during the past 2 years, 2 months of which was spent in London. I've been on the London Walks "Jack the Ripper Haunts" walking tour. I've also been on a walking tour of East London and the Whitechapel district, lead by Donald Rumbelow himself (author of "The Complete Jack the Ripper", which he autographed for me). I've stood on the very spot where 2 of the bodies were found (Polly Nichols in Bucks Row, and Catherine Eddowes in Mitre Square). I've had a pint of beer in the Ten Bells pub -- the same pub at least one of the Ripper's victims was known to frequent, and where it's suspected he may have even visited himself while stalking his prey.Why do I tell you all this? So that you know I have some intimate familiarity with the people, places, and events that took place. "From Hell" portrays some things very nicely -- the overall look and feel of Victorian East London is largely how I'd imagine it appeared then (although highly stylized, to be sure). Other little details were a treat to those who are familiar with this time and place: the "rope" the unfortunates who could not afford a bed had to sleep leaning against, the term "doss" money, little details about each murder such as the piece of leather apron found nearby one victim, or the proximity of the broken window to the doorknob in Mary Kelly's room. All very nice details that I found exciting to see.But then they messed up so many other details, or fabricated them completely, or didn't explain them at all that I was left feeling betrayed. I mean, grapes? Where did they get that idea? And laudanum? And although they had the broken window in Mary Kelly's room correct, the WAY it was broken was complete nonsense (it was broken during a fight she had with her common-law husband).What about the fact that this case changed the way police investigated murders? Fingerprinting was controversial and had yet to be proved reliable as a method of identification. This case was the turning point. But no historical mention is made of this during the movie, which would have been fascinating and enlightening for those not in the know.And not a single suspect is every caught or questioned during this movie! In reality, many people were suspected and questioned -- too many, in fact. But this movie makes it look like the police are just following the killer around, wondering whom he is and why he's doing all this killing. Sheesh.They didn't follow up on the leather apron bit (they just threw it in there, so people not familiar with the case would be like, "huh"?) I'd imagine people not familiar at all with this case will either like the movie because they will see it on a different level than I did, or else they'll be so confused that they won't know what's going on half the time.My favorite "Hollywoodism": the Ripper riding in a horse-drawn carriage, wearing a cape and top hat and lugging around a box of medical instruments! Come on guys -- the Ripper was seen speaking to his victims on several occasions by several witnesses. But nobody ever got a real good look at him, and the ones who did came up with differing descriptions. That just adds to the intrigue of the case.And if you think there were any prostitutes in 1888 East London that looked like Heather Graham, I've got news for you! These women were filthy, their clothes ragged, they were smelly, diseased, missing teeth, and wore everything they owned. Heather Graham they were not.There are so many loose ends and things thrown in that are never followed up in this movie. Like the Elephant Man -- what the hell did he have to do with anything? Or the lynch mob briefly seen running through the streets with torches, apparently looking for Jews, who are seen closing up their shops -- I'm familiar with the case and even I didn't have a clue what that was all about! (And the movie doesn't bother to explain itself). And how about the letter that arrives with a piece of victim's kidney -- the letter sent "From Hell". We never get to see the damn letter! The movie title is BASED on that letter, it derives its identity from that letter... and we NEVER GET TO SEE IT! They don't even read it completely! They don't even say whether they believe it's authentic or not! They just get the letter and kidney, read part of it, and then it's on with the story. How utterly disappointing.Last (and perhaps least), they didn't even get the message the Ripper wrote on the wall right! The movie says it was "The Juwes are the men who will not be blamed for nothing". My "Complete Jack the Ripper" book has it as: "The Juwes are not The men that Will be Blamed for nothing". Minor point, perhaps, but why would the filmmakers not make an effort to get something like this right?I hate to criticize a movie for not staying true to reality, when I know movies have to take certain liberties with their subject matter. But some things were just too much to swallow, like Inspector Abberline being a hallucinating opium addict (although Johnny Depp's cockney accent is very convincing), or all the lobotomy stuff (let alone the people who receive the lobotomies, and for what reasons)."What were they thinking?" is what I'd like to know. One of those movies that isn't so bad while you're watching it, but that you dislike more and more as you think about it later. A major let-down for me. I give it *1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful picture, a powerful plot, a disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Hell" is another Jack the ripper movie. It is the 4th movie of the Hughes brothers (after Menace II Society in 93, Dead President in 95 and American Pimp in 99). It is also the most accomplished one from a technical stand point. Finally it is a fairly good adaptation of the novel by Alan Moore. The movie match the pace, the atmosphere and the style of the novel. The only good difference is that in the movie, you follow the investigation through inspector Frederick George Abberline's eyes (Johnny Depp), meaning you don't know who Jack the ripper is until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The picture of "From Hell" is very well set. The lightning and the shadows of London streets (even though it was filmed in Prague) are a piece of work. The realization is almost perfect: from the authenticity of this White Chapel district down to the very detail of the costumes, the work achieved here is truly impressive. The overall atmosphere is tainted with Gothic effects which ad to the power of some scenes. The sound of the movie is also very well worked, from the carriages wheels to the sound of the footstep over London's pavement. However the movie remain disappointing. The acting and the dynamic of the characters are superficially done. If Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow, 1999)was pretty descent and Ian Holm (remember him as Ash in Alien 1979 or in the Chariots of Fire in 1981) gave (almost as usual) a great performance, Heather Graham (Austin Powers, 1999) never emerged from the plot. She should have become the obsession of both Jack the ripper and inspector Abberline. Unfortunately most of this dynamic is underplayed. As a result the movie suffers from a lack of suspense (you just never get scared). There is almost no tension and little by little the movie becomes a pure artistic exercise leaving the cinematographic experience being a minor objectives (it should be the other way around!!!). The Hughes brothers managed to make a beautiful movie, unfortunately they also manage to make a scary movie non-scary and a powerful story unpowerful. I guess it is just another Jack the ripper movie, not the best one.</fullReview>

What makes a good thriller is not knowing who is going to get killed next. In this movie, it was very easy to tell who was going to get killed next. There is some gore in the movie, but really not too much. Johnny Depp is okay, but far from Oscar caliber. The other actors (especially the five whores) left something to be desired. All in all, a lackluster effort. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted effort ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had an interest in the Jack the Ripper case since childhood and also being a huge fan of historical thrillers, I approached the Hughes brothers' "From Hell" with a great deal of anticipation and perhaps, in retrospect, unfairly high expectations. Helmed by talented directors, starring a spectacular cast of actors, and fueled by an obviously unrestrained budget, this lavish production was, to my mind, a can't-miss proposition, its contribution to the edification of horror cinema, a foregone conclusion. How, then, did such tremendous potential so perfectly derail itself, to crash miserably into mediocrity and unfulfilled promise? The answer to that burning question can be answered in one word: Script. "From Hell" is the beautiful flesh of gorgeous--often breathtaking--visuals, hung on the decayed skeleton of a rickety story that seems to have been thought out with all the care and craftiness of a grocery list. Indeed, "From Hell" is much like an enumeration of items that appear to have been checked off one by one, included for the sake of pretentious display, that never form any sort of cohesiveness. This story is simply an overwrought, underdeveloped series of set-pieces that trades suspense for graphic violence, characterization for idiosyncrasy, and narrative for sensationalism. I was thoroughly disappointed--as well as shocked--by the way the Hughes brothers neglected to provide this film with complete, logical, and interconnected scenes that would propel the story and give the viewer a sense that the events taking place on screen were a cumulative progression of action. Ignored were the basic principles of storytelling such as building tension, arc, climax, resolution, and, especially, denouement. Yes, these elements were present in a deconstructed form, but never were they explored or executed with any proficiency or insight. Johnny Depp, I will concede, gave a suitably terse performance as the drug-addled Inspector Frederick Abberline, the main character through whose eyes the audience vicariously experiences the very real horror of the unfolding events. Depp's accent was undeniably credible and his character's growing realizations believably portrayed. Ian Holm's performance was, in my opinion, absolutely crucial to the success of the story, yet I do not feel that he accurately captured the essence of his character--often resorting to melodrama when restraint would have served the proceedings much more effectively. Robbie Coltrane's character was a generic sidekick that could have been played by any number of contemporary actors, his contribution to the story completely forgettable. However, I found the supporting portrayals of the doomed prostitutes to be well-done in comparison. Which brings me to Heather Graham. With an obviously ersatz British accent and a palette of blank emotions on her colorless face, her performance fell completely flat, reducing an essential character within the story to a two-dimensional caricature. Though the acting was, on the whole, a mixed bag, let us now rejoice in what is perhaps some of the most extraordinary production design and cinematography of any film of 2001. "From Hell" is an absolutely gorgeous film ... from the exacting authenticity of the smallest period details, to the blood red sky hovering over the silhouetted peaks of an almost Medieval London (though filmed in Prague), to the echoing click-clack of horse-drawn carriages over the cobblestone thoroughfares, to the faithfully-reproduced historical costumes, nary an image was overlooked in building this dark, foreboding universe from the ground up. I was consistently impressed, amazed, and delighted by the powerful imagery presented on screen, and found the entire film to be visually faultless. Unfortunately, those lavish images fail to breathe life into the meandering story they strive to support. Of note, is the film's graphic violence. Though I believe it would have been exquisite had the story developed the suspense, urgency, and tension inherent in the subject matter, I will allow that the brutality of the killings in this movie is appropriately diabolic and filmed in an exceedingly stylized fashion. It was necessary that the murders be disturbing, and, without a doubt, the Hughes brothers accomplished this task. That said, I now must assert that the story's lack of historical accuracy in regards to the actual events of 1888 is among its major undoings. Had the movie's creators adhered to the cold, harsh facts of the case and kept the revisionist fiction to a minimum, the overall story would have benefited tremendously, and may have, as a result, partially overcome some of its other deficiencies. As it is, the ending of this movie is not only a profound disappointment, but also ignores important historical details. "From Hell" is not a worthless film by any stretch of the imagination, but given its cachet and pedigree, it never realizes its tremendous potential. For me, there is nothing more distressing than watching what could have been ground-breaking cinema relegated to just another wasted effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FROM HELL, Yeah right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FROM HELL 6/10 THESE COMMENTS CONTAIN SPOILERS. PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW SPECIFICS ABOUT THE FILMFROM HELL was better than say SLEEPY HOLLOW, but that isn't saying much. Like that other film, this was all style and no substance. What is the point of having a pretty picture when it means absolutely nothing to the viewer? This oft-told tale needs something fresh to get a jaded, *UH-HUM*, experienced viewer, such as myself interested. The Hughes brothers went to obsessive-compulsive lengths to get the historical details of the murders right and to create a unique Gothic sense of 19th century London, but they did so at the cost of involving the audience with an actual story. I don't mind the fictitious elements, in fact, I welcome them, because despite what is known about the Ripper murders, a lot remains a mystery. But what I cannot stand is the conspicuousness of someone like Heather Graham in this kind of film, much like Milla Jovovich in THE MESSENGER. I simply could not get over the incongruities of Graham's perfect white teeth and statuesque body with the absolute wretched squalor of her environs and prostitute friends. My other technical quibbles have to do with the directors themselves. Specifically, I'll certainly be glad when the Hughes brothers mature, because right now (through either naiveté or insecurity), they feel the need to use every camera shot they ever learned in film school to show how clever they are. All of that gets old very quickly.As for the story itself, like I said, nothing new or interesting is presented in FROM HELL. The choice of the Ripper is anybody's guess and frankly does not matter. (Although, I have to admit that making the Ripper a Mason was certainly fresh and different.) The relationship between the Inspector (Johnny Depp) and Graham is surprisingly rushed, cliché, and truncated. And finally, this film just isn't gory or scary. Maybe that one's just a horrible reflection upon me or the times in which we live, but MTV-like flashes of blood and horror do not register well with me.In all, I found FROM HELL to be well-made but nothing more than that. It was certainly worth the $4.50 I paid but I strongly recommend not paying more than that.FROM HELL 6/10______________--Hypotheses______________</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Hell ". Hughes Brothers Direction..well, the movie has visuals that are influenced by the modern surrealism that movies have created,especially from the west coast like the ones " The Cell" slant angles and some flouroscent colors, Depp is the constable that is required to solve the case of murders in the whitechapel neighbourhood in London during the late 1880 's, the mood is gloomy when the camera captures the red sky and the stinking streets, there is murder and blood of the unfortunate ones whilst prostitutes on the streets and the cobbles gleam well in in the moonlight, The murders do seem to have a calming effect on the characters ,. How can we expect 29 year olds from CA that have done music videos of hiphop to understand the gross subtleties of british accent, to the pot smoking brothers the american accents and the british is subtle. Depp with a deep italian accent seems british when every once in a while like the mole out of the hole jumps the awareness of the period and thereby the british , Heather tries much harder and she would have visited a local american language specialist on accent to straighten it to suit american movies after the schedule From Hell, visuals lack maturity and therein lies consistency, the movies good vibes are present in the consistency of the brothers, the brothers do a good job within their realm of technical choice. Depp is never done better in any movie before, that is if you consider the best to be a tree doing a role of micheal caine in "Jack the Ripper:" the earlier version. The movie is a pleasent watch and for those that want to have boyfriends jump into thier arms this will be a dissapointment. Murder takes place in the night and the camera stays all night and day , with people coming in fast motion around the body, as daylight breaks in with the detective coming in the the motion returns back to normal...good scene Some frames of gargoyles and chapels remind of the great Sergie..E..N.3 out of 5 stars for the entertainment seeker, 0 out of 5 for the serious watcher</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw yesterday - this movie is not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was going to be a thriller/crime drama or at least a stylized horror movie based on whom the police thought was the real killer - someone named "Kosminski" - who alot of people dont know about. Instead it turned out to be a supernatural "movie of the week" piece of fluff. Cmon!!! I mean having an investigator who can see the future? Johnny Depp as basically a police "nostradamus"? Give us a break! This movie was a joke. And what was the need to have John Merrick (the "elephant man") as a cameo? This does not make sense. And those ridiculuos "hallucinagenic/dream" camera angles are really annoying. What ever happened to "character is plot"? The only reason I can think of is that they couldn't come up with a good script so they decided to distract us with these techniques. Well, let me tell you, it didn't work - I know I saw a bad movie!If you want to see Johnny Depp in a good movie rent Ed Wood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film recently and I have to say I was rather disappointed. I have seen many documentaries on Jack the Ripper and they just give you the facts. What they found at each murder scene, who the suspects were etc... I thought that if I went to see this film, I could experience Jack the Ripper in a more real sense. But this film just felt like another documentary to me. The directors decieded to barely show the aftermath of the murders. A few brief shots of the throats and that was about it. I had heard it was so gory but it wasn't. I thought the impact of the film would have been greater and it would have been more powerful if we could have seen some of the gore. In real life the killer's cape doesn't always block the view.</fullReview>

Even if you close your eyes in all those gory murder scenes, which is the majority of movie, you will still be affected b/c the sound effects are chilling. Johnny Depp is great and keeping a straight, unaffected face while being around those terrible model bodies. As is Robbie Coltrane. No matter how much people trash Heather Graham...I love her, and I believe she is great! And though it is a bit unrealistic that she is so clean and perfect, while all the other hooker are dirty, have bad teeth, and messy hair. Its a chilling, realistic, grimy depiction of Jack the Ripper and the 1888 Whitechapel murders. Though the movie was a bit ruined since I was familiar with the theory of Jack the Ripper's identity in this movie, and knew who he would be.</fullReview>

The movie is very film noire and is shot in a style similar to Se7en and Fight Club, specifically the way the film flashes between images quickly during some scenes. The only thing I found lacking with the film is that it did not give very much background detail as to why Jack the Ripper was killing people.

		<shortDescription>Good direction of a lame script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Hell" is certainly a stylish exercise in gruesome horror/mystery, but the Hughes Brothers' direction is wasted on a script that turns ridiculous by film's end.Jack the Ripper is a killer defending the British throne (currently occupied by Queen Victoria) from an illegitimate child born to a Catholic prostitute (the movie makes it seem like being a Catholic is worse than being a prostitute) who could be heir. His goal is to 'eliminate' all those who are aware of the child's existence. The Inspector Abaline character (Johnny Depp) works well, as does the role of the Watson-like Seargent Godley (Robbie Coltrane), and even the nonsense of the Queen Victoria conspiracy has a certain charming mystique to it.However, Jack The Ripper is not satisfied with just killing, but insists on performing brutal mutilations and the removal of organs. Why does he do this, when he could just throw them off a building or toss them in a lake? I guess because the writers think that gruesome violence will help sell their movie. The explanation is some ridiculous and desperate story of Jack being so insane, that he thinks thoroughly butchering his victims will somehow represent Jewish struggle, or Jewish oppression, or something. I couldn't really tell, and I didn't really care. It didn't seem like the writers did either.That said, the Hughes brothers definitely created a haunting atmosphere through the first act, and although anyone who has seen enough movies and knows enough actors won't take long to figure out who the killer is, the suspense is still real, and will make you eager to see the story unwrap, when you're not dreading a closeup of the victim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Visuals Make this Jack the Ripper Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just returned from seeing the movie From Hell, a movie that I have been anticipating since I first heard about it before summer. In many respects, I am not disappointed, but I feel there are a few things that must be said.SPOILERS BELOW!!!For starters, anyone with a knowledge of Ripper History must know that the infamous Freemason Conspiracy Theory, published by Stephen Knight, has been completely cast out as untrue. It was discovered after the death of its author that some of the research was "created" to help make the conspiracy. Knight stretched certain aspects of the facts of the case (the "Juwes", as the biggest) to help prove his conspiracy theory....which, quite frankly, is the most exciting of all the Ripper theories, though the most far-fetched. Of course Hollywood would pick that one."From Hell" is very detailed about some of the facts of the case. Martha Tabram, the first murder in the movie, is not listed among the canonical five victims (Mary Nichols, Annie Chapman, Liz Stride, Katherine Eddows, and Mary Kelly) but Tabram, along with about a dozen other women, are theorized to be victims of the Ripper. The death scenes were not as gory as I might expect; though to show the body of Mary Kelly as seen in the black and white photograph at the actual murder scene 100 years ago would surely give the move an NC-17 rating. The murders were handled well, with just enough of the "gore" factor to give them the scare factor.Depp gives a very solid performance as Fredderick Abberline (which is pronounced a-ber-leen, not a-ber-line as far as I know) though much of his character was made to suite the story. From a historical standpoint, Abberline did not smoke opium, was married, and was actually "demoted" to returned to Whitechapel for the Ripper cases. And he certainly did not die afterwards. Depp, as we all know from his previous endeavors, plays a wonderful detective, and he handled this role beautifully, as far as I'm concerned.Ian Holm as William Gull was solid. I was a bit perplexed about the change in his voice from certain scenes to the next. I know that originally, Nathaniel Hawthorne was casted as Gull, but I'm unsure if he shot any of the scenes -- I'm wondering if his voice was used as the Ripper's.Coltrane adds some of the very few comical moments, and Graham gives an pretty good performace as Mary Kelly.I read somewhere that there were two endings shot for this film, one of which Depp and Graham got drunk and acted badly for on purpose so that it couldn't be used. When I read this, I thought they would be doing this for an ending where everyone "lived happily ever after." I was sorely mistaken. This movie's take on Mary Kelly living and/or falling for Abberline or even MEETING Abberline is completely made up. It does help the plot along, however.The most wonderful aspect of the film, in my opinion, are the visuals -- the scenery. Absolutely brilliant shots of London in what it could have looked like in the 19th century. The shots of the skyline above the rooftops of the East End were equally breathtaking. The prostitutes (other than the always pretty Heather Graham) were given a very true-to-life makeup job. The Hugh Brothers did a fantastic job in this respect.While not altogether historically accurate, "From Hell" was a very good movie that I will more than likely go to a second time and definitely purchase the DVD from. If you're looking for a more-historically based fictional account, I'd try the Michael Caine film from 1988 (though I must warn you.... they choose the "conspiracy theory" as well). It was made for TV, so the gruesomeness is cut out of the film completely. But if you are looking for a visually stunning account of the Ripper's escapades, as well as a semi-realistic look at the blood that would result from his antics, see "From Hell."You won't be disappointed.***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular film, but remember: FICTION.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Hell" is an adaptation of the royal conspiracy theory that came into existence in the 1970's. As a work of fiction, it's great; it is full of political intrigue and makes for a great story. Depp and Holm really carry it well, and the directors show us a part of victorian england without sugar coating it- the poverty-stricken east end, the drunk, starving people: the working class. It's here that the Ripper committed his gruesome murders.The only catch is that this is strictly a work of fiction. There is absolutely nothing to back up the royal conspiracy except bits of heresay. Sure, it could have been covered up well, but it's by far one of the least likely possibilities. It's tempting to romanticize the story in the hope that these killings had a motive; when in fact they very well might have been random. As a film, A+. But a film only; not a documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a weak stomached movie-goer. I had no problem enduring, and dare I say enjoying such gore-fests as "Interview with a Vampire" and "Hannibal." However, "Hell" makes those 2 flicks look like "The Lion King." We all know what this movie is about, and we all know that Jack the Ripper was called that for a reason. But there's a difference between hearing about horrific crimes against women and seeing it happen. I hate to play the gender card here, but, as a woman, this movie was incredibly hard to sit through. I doubt that there will be a film this year or in the future that graphically portrays a female serial killer who saws off several men's genetalia. Every man in the audience would be crossing his legs and would probably tell every person he sees that this is a horrible film that is degrading to men. Maybe I'm wrong, and forgive what seems to be feminist propaganda, but if there is a woman out there who saw this movie and was not repulsed, I'd like to meet her to find out what makes her tick.Violence aside, Heather Graham is completely out of place in this film. She is a china doll-faced beauty with shiny hair and not a trace of dirt on her among the worst London filth you can imagine. To make matters worse, the girl can read and write (cursive, no less). I guess I missed the scene that explained that the prettiest whores also got to be educated at a private school in the London burbs.Johnny Depp is a wonderful actor, as always, and the views of London are spectacular, but there's not enough style to make up for what turns out to be nothing more than a slasher flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HATED IT!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of a story about the infamous "jack the ripper" sounded so compelling. Based on what I already knew I think anyone would have to admit that a story about him would be very interesting to see, and if anything terribly disturbing and frightening. Not so in "from hell".I have a 5 minute rule that I apply to every movie I see. It is always on the money. If after the 1st five minutes I am not "into it" the chances are extremely high that I will not get into it. The reason I am so adamant about this rule is that in my oppinion if the director couldn't be bothered to grab you in what should be your first impression of the 2 hour film then what the hell is he/she waiting for?From hell was gruesome and bloody and so violent, violence which I have not seen since that horrible movie "the cell" with Jennifer Lopez. I understand that the movie is about JACK THE RIPPER and he was an extremley violent man, however I find that the most scarry movies I have seen in my life use great direction, and editing, and acting to invoke fear in the viewer instead of gratuitous blood and gutz throughout. It's kind of like a comedian who uses profanity. Just saying the word fuck is not funny. However putting it in all the right places can be hilarious.This movie was about the detective played by Johnnie Depp who was on the case to catch the elusive Jack the Ripper. Throughout the film we were shown numerous possible suspects that were all indicated by wearing a masonic ring. OOh. Scarry. It gave you all sorts of false leads and you were supposed to be surpised when you learned who he really was. I frankly was not only not surprised, but I did not care. It also involved a love story between Johnnie Depp and Heather Graham who played the parts and the accents very well, but I did not feel for either of these characters in the slightest. I also found it humorous that all of the prostitutes in the film were dirty looking and not very attractive at all and by comparison Heather Graham looked like a supermodel. They also made a point to say that she wasn't born into this life but misfortune drove her to it which is the reason I suppose her teeth were white and straight, her hair fashionable and clean, and her clothes neat and tidy, while the others were wretched.The scenes of Jack the ripper doing his dirty work were vile and unnecessary. I GOT THE POINT. I remember a movie about HG Wells chasing Jack the ripper through time, I think it was called Time after Time. The movie although not soley focused on Jack was scarry and interesting and made me want to know more about this person which is why I was so disappointed when I saw this movie.From Hell had little point. It was all over the place and very predictable. In the films favor I must say that the scenery was incredible, the cinemetography outstanding, and the sets were beautiful to watch. Contrarily I also must add that often times when I see movies that seem to spend such a large portion of their budget on this they tend to ignore the more important stuff like character development and plot.I think all together this could have been a much better film. There were parts of the story that I found interesting, but as a whole I found it convoluted, contrived, and boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting....the story of Jack The Ripper brought to full life..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One word can sum up this film....haunting. From the opening scenes in this film, to the finish, I was on the edge of my seat. Although the story is not historically accurate (I have never read the graphic novel, but have read alot of books about the Ripper), it was a genuinely entertaining film, one that seriously scared the hell out of me. There are not many films that have had this sort of impact on me.There were certain aspects that were based on fact, such as the Prince of England being linked to the murders after a bout with syphillis, however, most of it is Hollywood fiction. I will not complain however, as I stated above, it was the first movie since the Wickerman and The Exorcist that left me in a state of awe and shock. Johnny Depp was hypnotic as the inspector assigned to the case of the Ripper, while Heather Graham was simply fantastic as the whore that he tries to protect, and Ian Holm was spectacular as usual. Some may think that this movie is alittle too violent, however, it does get the point across as to how brutal a killer Jack the Ripper actually was. The first real horror film of the year is definately one that you should not miss. Rip yourself away from that computer, and go and see...From Hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I haven't read the graphic novel that every review I've read has mentioned, so I don't care if it did or didn't do justice to that source. Just came to it as a Jack the Ripper movie. The trailer suggested it would knock my socks off. It didn't, but I understand there were ratings considerations (as always) with the best stuff being saved for DVD. Anyway this movie gets an A for effort for atmosphere and period detail, they really laid it on, down to the pimp's rotten tooth. That alone mostly carried it for me, but I found it oddly uninvolving for the most part. Partly there's the problem of doing historical events, whether murders or something else, we know in advance what happened which eliminates much suspense. But the murders here seemed almost perfunctory; when it was each victim's "turn" she was conveniently alone on a deserted street just like the sleazy horror flicks we all laugh at. No real terror ever generated. Only the proto-lobotomy scenes (&amp; their aftermath) were truly horrifying. A lot of the conspiracy stuff reminded me of "X-Files," yanked me out of the period, likewise Depp's "visions" a la "Millennium" or "Profiler." I know there was much drug use back then but would a hophead cop really have been tolerated, let alone be an Inspector? It would've been interesting to see more details of Victorian police procedure, grilling suspects etc. (Fritz Lang's "M," also based on a real serial killer, was almost documentary in that sense.) In fact the cops barely seemed to exist. I seem to be the only one who didn't have a problem with Heather Graham or her accent except that originally she was supposedly Irish &amp; I didn't hear any of that in her voice. She looked pretty but not "Hollywood," I thought. Hey, nowadays there're beautiful women who do porn flicks, what's their excuse? The ending was anticlimactic and disappointing, almost made me glad I hadn't been made to care too much about these people. Depp was okay, the old English theater guys were fun, but Robbie Coltrane lit up the screen as always, just wish he'd been given more to do. Ultimately the movie's a nice foggy ride but could've used the ballocks of the Hughes' earlier black urban flicks, it's like they felt they had to curtsy here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Not predectiable or boring like some of the current films out there in moive land. This film is on my Best Films of 2001 list. To be frank one of the best films of the month of October 2001. I wish this film came out in the summer of 2001 to save us from such idot films like "Planet of the Apes" or Jurassic Park 3". Hats off to the Hughes Brothers for a a very thought provoking film. Orginial, thought provoking and what an excellent use of film technics. I loved the sets, art direction, the use of shadow &amp; lights, primary colors and time lapse photography to heighten the tense situation. The score was great too, very dark and haunting, I can't wait to own the soundtrack. The Hughes brothers deserve an Oscar nod for Best dirctor, and Ian Holm desvers an Oscar nod for Best actor for his role. Great film. An instant cult classic. Great way the Hughes brothers mixed fact and fiction and put some new twists on the tale &amp; legend of Jack the Ripper. I highly reccomed this film. A great film for discussion afterwards. For the strong and mature and very open minded. Can't wait too see it a 2nd time. Not to be missed, forget the rest and see "From Hell". Alot of great suprises along the way too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't know Jack.until you've seen this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose it's a curse to all of us "Ripperologists," who are familiar with the history and theories surrounding the Jack-the-Ripper murders. Whenever a new "Jack the Ripper" movie or TV show comes out, we always look for one single character, John Netley, the coach driver who takes the Ripper to his victims. Once Netley appears, we don't have to wait until the end of the movie to find out the Ripper's true identity. Years of conspiracy theories surrounding the case have linked John Netley to one historical figure, identified by numerous theorists as the true identity of Jack the Ripper.But for those of you who don't know Jack, who have been spared the gory details of the unsolved murders that took place in London's East End in 1888, the movie "From Hell" will be an excellent introduction to the history of the Ripper case. Even if you do know the details, "From Hell" is a terrific thriller. It is that rarity of rarities, a well-done horror movie. Jack is not presented as a simple chase-'em-down-chop-'em-up slasher slicer dicer a la Freddy Kreuger. There's a method to this killer's madness.Just remember this: Like most Hollywood histories, "From Hell" is fiction from fact.This much is true: In the fall of 1888, five prostitutes were brutally murdered in London's Whitechapel district. The killer seemed to possess an intricate knowledge of anatomy, and removed some of his victims' internal organs. The first four victims--Mary Ann "Polly" Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, and Catherine Eddows--were found lying in the streets. The final victim, Mary Jane Kelly, was dissected in her own room, her body so brutally cut to pieces that she could barely be identified. (Whether Martha Tabram--the first woman killed in the movie--was a sixth Ripper victim is a matter of debate.)The murders threw London into a panic. Letters signed "Jack the Ripper," claiming responsibility for the crimes, were sent to local newspapers. The letters were probably fake, but a name like "Jack the Ripper" was one the newspapers couldn't resist. One letter seemed to be genuine. It was addressed "From Hell," and contained part of a kidney from one of the Ripper's victims (The movie makes a mistake here. The "kidney letter" is sent following the murder of Annie Chapman, the Ripper's second victim. In real life, the "kidney letter" arrived after the murder of Catherine Eddows, the Ripper's fourth victim, and was matched to her.)Public outrage over the Ripper murders was so great that Scotland Yard commissioner Charles Warren was forced to resign. Queen Victoria herself expressed concern over the murders, and offered a Queen's pardon to anyone who could provide information leading to the killer's arrest. But the murders suddenly stopped after Mary Kelly. Jack the Ripper was never caught and he haunts us still today.Like most unsolved mysteries, a number of theories have sprung up through the years concerning the true identity of Jack the Ripper. One of the more imaginative theories is the "Annie Crook/Prince Eddy" theory, which "From Hell" uses as its basis. I won't give away the details for those who haven't watched the movie, but it's a great "conspiracy theory." It's also, to put it mildly, bull manure.Historically, Annie Crook, while she did exist, was not Catholic. No historic link has been found between her and her supposed husband, Prince Eddy. Furthermore, the man identified as the Ripper in the "Annie Crook" theory, was not, in real life, a Freemason. Take these facts together and the theory, as presented in "From Hell," falls apart.That aside, who cares if its fiction. It's still a great conspiracy theory. It makes for a great story. And in "From Hell," it makes for a great movie. We have great performances by Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Robbie Coltrane, and especially Ian Holm. Ian Richardson--who played the creepily corrupt Prime Minister Francis Urquardt in PBS's "House of Cards" mini-series"--is on hand as Sir Charles Warren. And the screenplay is intelligent and engrossing, with numerous plot twists and red herrings to follow as we join in the search for the Ripper.The Hughes Brothers have recreated the world of the Ripper, London's teeming East End, with meticulous shadowy style. It's always a thrill to follow Jack down the maze of dark alleys, to watch the knife-wielding phantom slip in and out of foggy, gaslit shadows as he stalks his victims. And of course, there's always that wonderful moment, in the darkened movie theater, when the Ripper's true identity is revealed, and we hear the rest of the audience gasp in acknowledgement. But "From Hell" provides an additional twist at the end concerning the fate of one of the Ripper's victims--and it's a twist that even die-hard Ripperologists like myself will not see coming.The "Annie Crook" theory has been used in other "Ripper" films, with great success. If you like "From Hell," look around at your local library for a video copy of "Murder By Decree," one of the best Sherlock Holmes films of all time, in which Christopher Plummer, as Holmes, tracks down the Ripper. Also, check your late-night TV listings for "Jack the Ripper," the 1988 TV mini-series, starring Michael Caine as an alcoholic Inspector Abberline, which chronicles Scotland Yard's investigation of the case. (The real Abberline, by the way, lived well into the 20th century, and died in 1929.)"From Hell" departs from these two in that, for the first time, it shows us the murders as seen from the Ripper's point of view. We see the madness that occupies the Ripper's mind, the visions that he sees, as he commits his terrible crimes. We see what drives this madman to commit such extreme murders, to butcher his victims in such ghastly fashion. That's why I say, even if you know the facts of the case, you don't really know Jack until you meet him in "From Hell."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got in from seeing From Hell, and, while I was expecting good things, I came away incredibly impressed. Everything about this movie gelled wonderfully, from the tightly knit story based on the graphic novel of the same name, to the beautiful cinematography (the image of the blood red skies over London is not easily forgotten), to the acting was pitch perfect for the film. The acting especially was a pleasant surprise, as Heather Graham gave a fine performance despite normally having the acting range of stucco. Johnny Depp basically resumed his part from Sleepy Hollow, but added to it nicely to create a much more realistic character. All in all, right behind Memento, From Hell is the finest film you'll see in the 12 month quality dry spell that has been 2001. A solid 8 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine mystery with great visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hell, based on the expansive (read: phone book length) graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, is a strong mystery with great visuals. The film is even more interesting than I expected; aside from its mysteries and scares, it also has some interesting unsettling elements; some I think were intentional, some not. The Hughes Brothers impresssed me with some strong visuals and a moody, evocative interpretation of 1880's London, complimenting a retelling of Jack the Ripper as a Seven-ish murder mystery. Johnny Depp is the Inspector assigned to the case, who also happens to drink heavily, smoke drugs, and hallucinate vital clues to his cases. Heather Graham is one of a group of prostitutes that Jack has targeted for murder.Graham's Mary Kelly is the movie's biggest problem. As a gorgeous movie star with a bad British accent, she sticks out from the rest of the fine ensemble as a poor casting choice. The rest of the prostitutes she pals around with are plain, dirty, and probably more "realistic." Graham's porcelain face and fire red hair stick out like a sore thumb. As I said, the rest of the cast is excellent, and the film really gets under your skin. I've never seen anything by The Hughes Brothers before, but they are visually exciting directors, and I'll be looking into the back catalogue to see what else they've done. The unsettling elements come in the form of things like Graham as a Victorian hooker and the lack of likeable protagonists, and the ending that is both formula Hollywood and defiant independent cinema. Often commercial aspects and directorial vision seem to be duking it out, even within individual scenes. I don't think either side truly wins; we're left with a mixed bag of emotions and styles.From Hell has a few graphic moments of gore that will turn off some of the weaker-stomached in the audience. And the ending hits as many hollow notes as good ones. But still, while it's not the most satisfying movie, it is never boring. Almost a great film, it winds up an intruiging good film with some unfulfilled potential.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp does a decent job as Inspector Aberline trying to figure out just who is Jack the Ripper,, although it is a fairly decent tale, the movie yet seems to be so convoluted with needless scenes , sometimes i didn't know which way to turn, there should have been a few scenes taken out cause they really didn't need to be there in the first place. i think maybe Depp was a little over his head on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally I thought "From Hell" was a quite entertaining exposition of the least likely of the "Ripper" myths.How much more exciting our Royal family would be if one of their predecessors had been a disease-ravaged serial killer;still,you can't have everything.Then there's the Freemasons..........A "Society with Secrets" as they refer to themselves rather than a "Secret Society".Ho hum.Certainly their influence is very strong in the Metropolitan Police even today - some might have said their malign influence............and was no doubt at least as powerful in late Victorian times - but I can't help feeling if they'd been responsible for the Ripper murders they would have left absolutely no clues. So it's only a movie,then,not a history lesson.Obviously a lot of money has been spent and the net result is quite compelling,its whole being rather better than the sum of its parts. I think the fact that it's derived from a comic book should have alerted most people that the characters might not be very,er,believable. Mr Johnny Depp makes a Byronic Inspector Abberline.Mr Robbie Coltrane plays the same fat bloke he always plays.Various English thesps slum courageously and exit quickly counting the money.

		<fullReview>Akin to "Jack The Ripper" ? starring Michael Caine ? this film is a mish-mash of bad tempi, bad acting, sloppy direction and a quite poor script that's wasted on good actors such as Johnny Depp, Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane. This film made me lose interest more than once, which is bad considering I'm a serial killer-fan. While The Hughes Brothers have directed the massive "Menace II Society", this film is far off that past greatness. Heather Graham's part is that of the Madonna-like prostitute, and very little of London of those past days is displayed "as were"; for more information about the East End-district of London, please read Patricia Cornwell's "Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed" and for even more details, Leslie S. Klinger's "The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes" will provide a lot of the cultural climate, the vast gap between the poor and the rich and those times in general (even though I'm sure there are better anthropological studies available).This film is recommended only for those very interested in Jack The Ripper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie got unusually mean reviews. It is an average movie - it deserves neither scorn, nor adulation. I enjoyed it but it doesn't offer too much that would cause me to watch it again. It's a reasonable effort.Instead of altering the Ripper case willy-nilly to suit their needs, only small changes have been made (they dismiss all but one Ripper letter). So it was nice to see the actual clues of the case appear and be assembled into a coherent storyline; even though the Prince Edward explanation has been discredited. The envisioning of Victorian London is fresh, and the film technique which suggests the passing of time over crime scenes is fine. So it ends up being less dumb than I imagined. Jack the Ripper is wearing the wrong hat though. (Witnesses describe a man in a deerstalker cap, not an opera-style top-hat)Heather Graham is a strange piece of casting for a role that requires a decent accent, and the revisions to Victorian culture itself are absurd. The culture is depicted as having very contemporary, relaxed morals: Annie is a whore; you don't sit in a garden, or visit the Victoria and Albert museum with a whore in 1888. And you just aren't seen in public with anyone but your wife, or there's a scandal. Oh, Mary can read!? Unlikely. Mary has improbable middle-class values and behavior. She'd more likely be a nasty, unwashed, ignorant, uncultured, drunk, prematurely-aging guttersnipe; as Ripper's victims were.The lamest part of the movie is that it hints at two or three options for who might be Jack, then selects the culprit you suspected the first second he was introduced (Gee... that was underwhelming!) And the idea that an underground society actually meets underground (!) is um, quaint.After seeing Sweeney Todd for the first time this week, Burtons' effort looks even less original or thoughtful than I previously granted. All he did was glance at this earlier Depp vehicle; borrow the whole production and add the songs. Heather even ends up living "by the sea!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling, Scary, And Well Told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Hell" takes place in 1888 in Victorian-era London. In the Whitechapel district of the city, prostitutes begin to be found murdered in the streets, all of them stabbed to death with their throats slashed, and their sexual (and other) organs removed. Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), a proclaimed clairvoyant, is assigned to the case, and begins to develop a relationship with Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a prostitute who is friends with many of the victims. As the prostitutes begin to drop like flies, clues are also dropped at each crime scene, and Abberline's visions of the killer become increasingly violent, as he attempts to unravel the identity of the murderer.A truly chilling and well-made film, "From Hell" is a semi-fictional telling of the real-life murders that occurred in London at the turn of the 19th century. The killer referred to himself Jack The Ripper, and while his identity was never revealed, his crimes go down as likely the most infamous serial killing of all time. The script for this movie, adapted from a graphic novel, quite obviously differs from the real historical facts, but it doesn't get too far off track, which is good. Many of the characters actually existed, and some of the events are told like they happened. The pacing here is great as well, and though most modern audiences may find this movie too "slow" or "boring", the pacing is even, balancing the progression of the story and the shocks well. The movie builds a heap of suspense as it progresses, and the final revelation is satisfying. It's quite a visceral little movie as well, and while most of the violence isn't really seen, it's still quite a gory movie, which I wasn't expecting. The depictions of the murders themselves were particularly disturbing, but also done in a shocking and original manner.Johnny Depp plays our hero, Inspector Abberline, and nails the role perfectly. His authority and intelligence emanates on screen, and he plays the role very believably (although his English accent may be a little off, I won't nitpick though). Heather Graham turns in a great performance as well, even though she's playing the clichéd "hooker with a heart of gold" who finds herself and her friends in a very scary situation. Another thing that should be noted about this movie is it's amazing set design and cinematography - the gritty, lamp-lit cobblestone streets of downtown London are presented perfectly here, and the atmosphere is very Gothic and quite spooky. There is also quite a few great visuals (some of them a bit hallucinogenic, but very interesting), as well as some very clever and well-executed camera tricks. The entire picture really looks stunning. The ending was a bit of a downer, but I really didn't have a problem with that either.All things considered, "From Hell" is an exceptional horror/thriller that is stylish, very well told, and quite scary. If the Jack The Ripper case is of any interest to you, or if you are just a fan of horror movies (particularly period pieces), I'd advise you to take a look at this movie, because it is an excellent and entertaining (albeit somewhat fictionalized) telling of those infamous crimes. 9/10.</fullReview>

I mean, there are a lot of exaggerations in some situations but the movie is meant to entertain and not be taken too seriously.The characters are great and portrayed perfectly by talented actors such as Depp and Cochran. The direction of the movie is very good and atmospheric. This movie has great cinematography and art direction. The settings are simply great and truly resemble the England of that time.In the Horror aspect, the movie has great gore and violence. I dug the unrated version. The fact that the Elephant Man does a cameo is a great moment in the movie.I cannot comment that much on this one because it has to be watched objectively and do not associate it 100% with the serial killer we all know. The movie is more about fictitious facts that compliment perfectly the original facts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very ingtriguing look at the Jack The Ripper case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is not your typical Scotland Yard inspector. He has visions of crimes that he tries to suppress or embrace, depending on his mood, with drugs such as opium, laudanum and absinthe. Luckily, he has Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) to help keep him on task. It is the sergeant who takes Inspector Abberline out to the scene of the first victim in the notorious Whitechapel district of 1888 London. Most of the investigators believe that the slain prostitute is nothing to worry about and not unusual at all given her profession. But Inspector Abberline notices some unusual things about the corpse, like the surgeon-like precision of the wounds and the expensive cluster of grapes near her hand. How could a prostitute afford grapes and what kind of client would have hated her enough to do this? As Inspector Abberline looks into the murder, he comes across Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a prostitute who knew the victim and is convinced that the local boss is trying to scare them into paying what they owe. But Abberline doesn't think it is that simple. As he spends more time with Mary, he comes to discover that the first prostitute who disappeared left a daughter and that she was no longer working the streets, but had found a special man, an artist, who loved her and was taking care of her. Mary convinces the inspector to find her and Abberline does, but she is in an insane asylum and seems to have the mind of a child. Abberline turns to the noted ex-surgeon Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) to explain the procedure that made her so and to help give him insights on how a surgeon would have used the tools of his trade on the murdered prostitute. The more Inspector Abberline delves into the seemingly unrelated stories, the more he is convinced that they are linked. So when Abberline discovers that the artist lover is in fact the Prince, he suddenly comes to realize that the prostitutes who are being murdered all have one thing in common....This was a very intriguing look at the Jack the Ripper tale with an interesting premise and solution to the seemingly unsolvable and random crimes. The directors did a wonderful job at creating a very dark and creepy atmosphere on the film that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat even when there is nothing scary going on. I also liked their artful visions of the murders and their restraint in showing or not showing details and leaving it up to the viewers imagination to fill in the blanks. Johnny Depp was superb in his role as Inspector Abberline, as he always is, and you found yourself cheering him on and wishing him every happiness, yet knowing that he wouldn't allow himself to be happy. Heather Graham was quite convincing in her role as a poor British prostitute, but her accent was not quite right. However, it is Ian Holm who really fools the viewers and keeps you in suspense as his character rapidly unravels at the end of the film. However, with all of the film strengths I still had to give it 7 stars because it is just missing that certain something that makes a good film a great film. The plot was a little hard to follow at times and I didn't care for some of the characters, but if you are at all interested in the famous Ripper crimes then this is a movie you shouldn't miss!</fullReview>

Johny Depp does a good work in capturing a character that really doesn't matter that much in the original story (and here takes the leading role). Some images also took inspiration from Eddie Campbell's graphic work ... but you will only notice it if you know the original work. I also remember reading that despite a friendly relation with the directors from this movie Moore said that he would not sign any other movie after the rip off done in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" strange he is credited. Maybe this work redone by Jodorowsky would give it the sharpness it deserves, nonetheless it makes a good enjoyment to spend some free time, and if you like the story don't miss the real thing from Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Studio films can't half be frustrating at times. On the one hand you get all the gloss but on the other you have to put up with 'stars' being shoehorned into the picture to satisfy the bean counters. Now most of the time the later isn't too much of a problem. I mean, sure it can be a little frustrating to have the same few people pop up in blockbuster after blockbuster, but despite what some snobs may say, a reasonable proportion of stars are stars for a reason ? whether it be raw acting talent or mere charisma. But while Johnny Depp is a fine actor as well as a bankable star, he just isn't very good in From Hell.I don't know what went wrong, but Depp just doesn't seem all that comfortable in his role. Maybe he had to concentrate too much on the accent ? if he did, then he still did a pretty bad job on that front ? but even if he didn't, he still seems uncertain of himself. It's as if he doesn't know whether to play the role tongue in cheek or dead serious, and instead falls into some unsatisfactory middle ground.Not helping him too much is the fact that he didn't sell the whole tortured detective thing to me. Abberline is supposed to be a man with a past ? like nearly 99% of detectives in films ? but there was no real weight to the character. Yeah he may smoke opium and he may drink Absinthe, but it felt like style rather than substance. And while that may be the fault of the script or the direction, Depp still felt lightweight in this film. (Lightweight reminds me; I think the heavyweight Robbie Coltrane would have been excellent as Abberline. Or, alternatively, Robert Carlyle.) Then there's Heather Graham. Now Johnny Depp is fully deserving of his status as a star. Heather Graham, though, isn't. Therefore it's rather excruciating listening to her trying to deliver dialogue in a badly contrived accent and rather painful watching her try and play the hooker with a heart of gold. Such a stock character needs someone with a lot of acting talent to make it believable and interesting (maybe Samantha Morton or Emily Watson?). As it is, her character is incredibly dull to watch (and, annoyingly, the film denies us the pleasure of her brutal murder). Plus she looks silly alongside the other prostitutes. You go from believably haggard streetwalker to believably haggard streetwalker to Heather Graham, who's supposed to look the part because she doesn't quite have as much eye make-up as she usually does and because her hair isn't quite combed through. She's not at all convincing, and it's frustrating that the Hughes brothers had to cast her as a concession to the studio.But despite the two main stars being miscast, there's a lot of good stuff in the film. I especially like some of the comments on Victorian society. You've got the brutality of the medicine of the time (the woman being lobotomised and then swept under the carpet in the workhouse), sexual hypocrisy (a blind eye is turned to men using prostitutes but the prostitutes themselves are despised), class (the upper class police chief refers to a middle class doctor as having 'a cheap sort of intelligence') and prejudice. And it's the prejudice that produces one of the best scenes. There's a scene where the police chief is talking to Abberline about who they're looking for. Here are some of the chief's quotes: "One thing's for sure, an Englishman didn't do it." "An educated man? That's preposterous. No well-bred man would do this." "What about the Jews?" At the time, when I was watching the scene, I got a kick out of it because it seemed like a Victorian twist on the 'stupid chief' scenes that you always see in 80s cop films. But after you see the ending, you realise that the stupid chief wasn't quite so stupid. Yet even though, or maybe because, the chief was part of the Masonic conspiracy (damn those Masons!), the scene works even better in retrospect. Not only does it expose the prejudice of the upper classes, but it exposes the hypocrisy too ? a man who kills for an apparently noble cause can be looked down upon and disposed of, but a man who takes part by covering it up is honourably doing his duty.Stylistically, too, the film is excellent. There are loads of wonderful shots. My favourite is the one where you go from high up, down to street level and then underground to the Masons who are secretly running the show. I also like the blood red skies and the shots of Parliament. And the 'visions' are excellent as well. Oh, and I love the time-lapse shot after Jack kills one of his victims ? and before that I like the way that The Ripper just vanishes from the scene like a phantom.And it's Ian Holm who delivers the best performance (although the whole supporting cast does a fine job). He's entirely charming as the kindly doctor and completely bonkers as Jack the Ripper ? the heart scene is great, especially the fantasy element where his fellow doctors are applauding his work. And although Holm doesn't really seem physically big enough to play Jack, it doesn't become an issue because Holm is so great in the role. But I do have to say that the mystery element of the story was misjudged. The 'disguised' Ripper voice is obviously a hushed Holm. But it really doesn't matter. The mystery is revealed with quite a bit of time to go (I dig the creepy black eyes) and the fun is in the bloody carnage ? the murders are suitably nasty.But one thing remains: the film would have been a lot better if Jack would have been allowed to dice Heather Graham.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful movie to look at. The Hughes brothers (Albert and Allen) directed the movie with lots of flair and provide the movie with some stylish and beautiful looking moments. They just seemed to concentrated a bit too much on the visual style and a little too less on bringing the story to the screen. The story is brought a bit too vaguely and not everything seems always to make sense. Basically the fact that Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) has psychic abilities in the movie is pointless and never ever really serves a purpose. Yes, it does provide the movie with some visual nice looking weird scene's but it doesn't really add anything to the story. The story itself of Jack The Ripper is quite tense and mysterious but this movie never truly becomes tense.The movie gives a pretty good view of 1888 London and has some excellent looking sets and uses perfect lighting for the scene's, to create the right atmosphere.The cast is well filled with some impressive names. Having Johnny Depp in a movie is never a bad thing and the other most important characters are played by the other well known actors; Heather Graham, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm.If you like eye candy this is a perfect movie for you to watch. If you like a tense mysterious crime movie this is probably not the best movie for you to watch.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining rubbish, in itself like a Victorian penny dreadful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This piece is immensely silly but quite entertaining, often in spite of itself, on account of being unintentionally hilarious from the start.I watched it on TV and the jump from the presenter's dire warning of "Contains strong language from the very start" to the stereotype Cockney's declaring "bloody" this and "bleedin" that was hysterical! The depiction of Whitechapel low-life reminded me of my all time favourite Jack The Ripper movie, made as part of a "Mad" compendium, in which the murderer is exposed as being none other than...the Loch Ness Monster! Some years ago, before the film was finished, I interviewed and photographed at a comic convention the publisher of the original graphic novel. He was adamant that this was going to be definitively the true story of Jack The Ripper! No fantasy licence about it! Seen in the context of his earnest claims the end product seems every bit as daft as the conjecture that it was Nessie wot did it. For although the story is woven in and around some of the facts of the case, it is really a complete flight of fantasy. And utterly fantastical at that.For a start, even in modern Britain, anyone not "well spoken", let alone someone who yardles on like Depp does here could never rise to the rank of inspector in the Metropolitan Police. Let alone in the Nineteenth Century. The unreality of his "Mockney" speakin' jack-the-lad druggie cop is fundamentally not of this world. The same is true of the idea that people of the period commonly sat at home listening to gramophone recording's as do a couple of the characters here. The disc gramophone had only been invented the year before! More unreal even than that is that in one scene the gramophone is playing music from the score of the movie! And what, in the end, if anything, did John Merrick have to do with all this? Were we were supposed to think, yep, it's the Elephant Man wot did it ).These matters aside, Ian Holm turns in a superbly entertaining performance that knocks the tired Hollywood slasher-stereotype into a cocked hat. Although one cannot help in passing momentarily seeing him as a kind of psycho-Bilbo. However, unlike the tedious likes of Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees, Holm's monster is genuinely chilling, because he is totally believable. The scenes in which we are shown his tenuous grasp on reality, the paranoiac visions and time-slips unravelling in his head, are definitely the best thing here. Although the black contact lenses are another detail hard to reconcile with reality. Even more so the weird gloaming from the windows which the cabman spies, suggesting that Jack's murdering plan in objectively does release an awesome ethereal power! It's as though the two directors could not agree as to whether it should be "all in the mind" or a real force of black magic.The same dichotomy is found in the closing scenes. However,the depiction of Kelly's happy ending with the often mentioned but not previously seen "Baby Alice" is possessed of an idealised unreality that strikes an effective note of ambiguity. Does it work out well or is it only in the drug-addled mind of the wishful dreamer on his deathbed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"From hell" has one big problem, like most recent Hollywood movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem I mentioned in the summary refers to most of the new Hollywood production (especially horror movies). I mean, why are those movies always so "high-resolutioned" and visually clean? "From hell" for example should have been shot in paler, darker colors in order to transport the dark-creeping atmospheres which Alan Moore originally wanted to display. A horror-movie should never be visually to "clean". Take "Ringu" ( the original, Japanese version of "The Ring") it is shot in a low resolution, sometimes with a blurry filter, and that fits just perfect to the movies "groove". From hell has no groove, you are aware each second that you are indeed watching a movie. Where is the illusion? Furthermore the movies speed is way to fast. Most cuts would fit in an action movie rather than in this one. Besides, the graphic novel is revisited very poorly. A mainstream-plot replaces the novels, highly interesting, psychological and philosophical storytelling. Just take Jonny Depp, mix it with a poor love story, use a action movie pace, and you'll have your perfect block(=blood)buster.Just another forgettable movie, done completely in a wrong way I'm sick of Hollywood ruining genuine and interesting plots stolen from evry media imaginable, cutting and amputating them... and what's worse: without letting people know the original even exists.4 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bizarre View of the Ripper Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic "Jack the Ripper" story has evolved to incorporate clairvoyant inspectors, heavy laudenaum usage, prostitution as prolific as religion, and sacred orders and sects. This is, in a sense, what this movie is about. The serial-killer story is delivered well in London with great visuals of the times (late 19th century). And the street life, while horrible, is plausible enough. But the mysticism that was intended to be created in a psychic inspector's (Johnny Depp) pursuit of the enigmatic "Ripper" falls short. The director should have given Depp a "Sherlock Holmes" role and cut the whole visionary bit out, although Depp did play his role well. I won't ruin the biggest part of the movie for you, the "Who dunnit". But I must say while the film does good at keeping you guessing, the discovery appears lame and perhaps far-fetched. The film then really starts to head south as cult-ish intimations develop and later deadlock into a depressing ending that has nowhere to run but down the tubes. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Hell" proves that no matter how much money you throw at a crappy script and amateur direction, you don't get a good movie.See, it isn't just enough to pick one of the most sensationally gory police blotter stories of the past century, throw buckets of money at costumers &amp; set folks, and pick two or three good actors. You have to motivate them to act with good writing. Or *something*.The story is such old hat that it needed a really good angle. Implicating the royal family isn't new. The Whitechapel wannabes wandering the very well-scrubbed sets are all well-scrubbed and their clothing is meticulously clean. AS IF! Late 19th century London was DIRTY, PEOPLE! How is it all of these whores, too poor to have a place to live, are running around in NEW clothes that look like they just got out of the dry cleaners? (Read that last line like Sam Kinnison would have, screaming "just got out...")There are a few shots of squeamish gore. After all, that's what we paid to see, right? ICHOR! ICHOR! But the reactions of the police actors and public onlookers? I'd expect better reactions from actors in a high school play. They look more like they stepped in dogcrap. (Hmmm.)Inspector Depp spends much of his screen-time doing free advertising for absinthe. What, he's sorry he didn't do "Total Eclipse"?Robbie Coltrane's character (amiable Coltrane has the only lively part in the movie) can't decide if the inspector is his buddy ("Goodnight sweet prince", he says at the end of the movie ... ECCCH! Shakespeare!) or his boss (when Depp snaps an order at him, he gets all ... *obedient*).I know, I know, this whole movie is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek.Right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was enjoyable enough. Good atmosphere, not a bad plot (making the Ripper a political murder was certainly a new twist), good set design, good lighting, plenty of gore and so on.There was however one person involved with this film who completely ruined it for me. That person should be buried in sand at least a cable's length from the shore. Who was this person? Johnny Depp's voice coach, that's who. That accent was just plain wrong in several respects.Firstly it wasn't a London accent - presumably it was meant to be a Cockney accent but they didn't even try for generic "London". It was an "Estuary" accent - a sort of mishmash generalised "South East England" accent which has become widespread on TV over the past 15-20 years . In US terms, let's say they'd taken a Trenton, NJ accent and said "OK, that's close enough to a Brooklyn accent; they're both in the north-eastern US" when it MATTERED that the speaker was from Brooklyn. Secondly an accent like that would not (even in the 21st century) denote "middle-class" (as Depps character was described); it's a very working class accent. Nothing in the least wrong with that, but it simply doesn't work (and it's simply not conceivable that someone would have made his way up from the "working classes" to become a police Inspector in the 1880s). Thirdly, and what wrecked it for me completely, was that Depp's voice coach had Depp doing a more-than-workmanlike impression of David Beckham (English soccer player and alleged style icon). The impression was so accurate that I have to believe he did it on purpose. I kept waiting for the Inspector to start discussing England's chances of qualifying for the European Soccer Championships!</fullReview>

As somebody that's been somewhat morbidly obsessed with Jack the Ripper, I had high hopes that the Hughes brothers would deliver a riveting and original film on the murders. And with Johnny Depp in it, who has picked so many good art house flicks in the past, my hopes were even higher. Sadly to say, my hopes were dashed almost from the outset. There was nothing new to the story, there was nothing that drew me in and if anything I kept wondering while in the midst of watching the film, "Why did the directors even make this movie?" They seemed to have no grasp or feel for the subject matter and it was actually a really difficult task to follow through and watch the whole movie.This is definitely not a movie that I would recommend to anyone at all.

		<shortDescription>As Illuminating As The Victorian Gas Lamp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspector Fred Abberline (Depp) is thrust into the middle of his (nee' England's) most serious crime wave: Jack The Ripper. He's a capable officer with a loyal assistant (Coltrane) but it's going to take more than guess work and intuition to crack this evil-nut. Fortunately, Abberline is also gifted with special sight. Unfortunately, it doesn't help prevent the murders. Unbelievably, he falls in love with the prostitute at the head of the group seemingly on the Ripper's slash list: Mary Kelly (Graham). Can he prevent her demise?! Are the Royal Family REALLY involved?! Are the Juwes the ones who will not be blamed for nothing?!If you know nothing about the life and times of history's most celebrated serial killer then you will probably appreciate this well made, atmospheric thriller for the brooding fantasy feature it is. Unfortunately, the more you know about the period of the Ripper, the less - proportionally - you will like about this film. For starters, the theory at the heart of the plot has almost universally been either discretited or, at the very least, presented as unrectifiably flawed. Secondly, Abberline's penchant for narcotics is (and always has been) highly debatable. A difficult point to reconcile oneself with when it forms a rock-solid tenet of the movie's story. And then there's the prostitutes: Graham as Mary Kelly suffers from being at least a league prettier than the next whore (until Estelle Skornik's belated appearance), a red-head (when in reality blonde) and being burdened with a hybrid London/English accent bearing no element of her native Irish or her adopted Welsh (she lived in Cardiff until her early twenties)? Likewise, 'Long' Liz Stride displays not a jot of her native Swedish accent despite only locating to England well into her mid twenties.There are several other flaws which will niggle away at most viewers who possess even a slight knowledge of the murders. But, so what? It's a film. A piece of cinema. It's not supposed to be true. It's quite well made and (for the most part) reigns in it's cliches. Depp invests a certain acting integrity and is supported, ably, by a stong British cast allowed to spout reasonably believable dialogue. But it's not any greater than that. And it DOES purport to be true. All the characters existed and virtually all of them did what they did in the film. So picking up on easily rectifiable flaws IS valid. There are few things worse than lazy film making and - despite some tangible plus points - there is a veneer of sloppiness here which is sometimes difficult to see beyond. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hughes brothers take a mediocre stab at reviving one of the most horrifying murder investigations of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Known for creating effective dramatizations of violence in urban culture, the talent of these two brothers is lost in 19th century London. Even though From Hell misses the mark, you have to give them credit for trying. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, this movie is a speculated story about the cryptic tale in 1888 East London surrounding the aristocracy, a madman named Jack the Ripper, and five unknowing whores who all share a deadly secret.Within the Whitechappel district of London (an exceptional facsimile built just outside of Prague), a murderer is on the loose. Set out to capture this mysterious villain is Inspector Frederick Abbeline (Johnny Depp). We first meet Abbeline as he wakes from an opium trip, a frequent substance used by this character to thwart his clairvoyant visions. Abbeline can see the murders before they happen. Thus, he is the one man to find the killer. The story focuses on Abbeline and a group of whores who are the primary targets of the grotesque human-carving rampage. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), one of the whores, slowly befriends Abbeline as she becomes terribly frightened for her life. Abbeline discovers that these murders are so precisely executed that only a man with great knowledge of the human anatomy can be responsible. This is when he meets Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), a physician of the royal family, who assists Abbeline in piecing together the puzzle. Screenwriters Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias do a terrific job of hiding the man in the shadow's identity until the last minutes of the film.If your stomach could withstand the gore in Hannibal, you'll have no problem with this movie. It makes you wonder where the boundaries are nowadays for cinema as far as what is appropriate to show on screen and what crosses the line. It is much more effective if you leave certain things to the imagination instead of forcing your viewers to cover their eyes at every corner. Bloody effects are a bad excuse to further the plot; it's unessential; not even needed. The love relationship between Graham's Mary and Depp's Abbeline is an undeveloped side story that gets lost in the cobblestones of London. Yet again, it does nothing to further the plot and strips the story of its momentum, catering to Hollywood's unnecessary must-find-romance-somewhere agenda. Heather Graham as a wench is so unconvincing that it is sad to see the poor girl attempt to spit out an accent. Compared to the other whores in Mary's group of friends with missing teeth and bad complexion, dirt seems to easily avoid Mary and dental hygiene must be on the top of her priority list. A box of red hair dye and a Victorian corset cannot save Graham from being poorly cast in a role too far over her head. Depp, with his piercing eyes and oozing sensuality does a fine job with his character but even he can't save this movie from hell. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless gut dreary tale about Jack The Ripper. Again we are made grateful that we weren't poor in London in the 1880's. Not one of Depp's best. One Fly Out Of Five</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack the Ripper murdered 5 prostitutes in ten weeks in 1888 London and like Dracula has entered the realm of legend. Dracula was invented only a few years later in England by an English civil servant called Bram Stoker. England of the late 19th Century would seem to have been a fervent source of nasty tales. The Whitechapel area of East London at that time was a horribly destitute area with an estimated 1200 prostitutes, gleaned from the hoards of desperately poor women forced to live there by their desperate circumstances. That the murder of only 5 of them would have engendered such interest nearly 100 years later is remarkable, probably one of the first instances of a media frenzy over a serial killer. It helped of course that the ripper took delight in dissecting his victims, sometimes carefully placing their organs beside the bodies. Those sorts of lurid details tend to grab reader's attention! The Ripper was never found which also adds to the mystery. From Hell is based on a comic book written by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Campbell apparently lives in Paddington Sydney. Moore wrote the famous Watchmen series. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes have previously directed Menace II Society. From Hell is what is called in the trade richly atmospheric. It's full of gore, rain, prostitutes rutting with their clients up against fences and puzzled policemen. Nearly everyone is either destitute, mad, bad or drugged.  Johnny Depp plays Abberline, an opium soaked detective who has the ability to suss out crimes by dreaming their details. Robbie Coltrane plays the straight Watson like policeman to Depp's Holmes. He who drags Abberline our of opium dens to do his job. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly one of the prostitutes and she's the best thing going for the film. But what's the point! From Hell seems to be something of a gothic film without the Goths, aimed perhaps at a more adult audience, but should they or would they be bothered. This is a slasher film without much in the way of slashes. Depp doesn't help. He plays Abberline so flat he looks like he's sleepwalking. And so will you. Get the comic book. It would probably be better.One Drowsy Fly Out Of Five</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess being from England and having been reading about Jack the Ripper for 12 years from books to movies I finally saw the right movie here in Denmark a few years ago where everything seemed to make sense and it was the mini series with Michael Caine. So my friends and I had to choose between Shallow Hal and From Hell. We figured From Hell would be good since we all were familiar with the story so there wouldn't be any surprises. 27 minutes of the movie and we are in total suspense and something happened and they had to restart the movie once again! So again we sat back and waited for that moment to come again and we figured wow if it was so interesting for the first ? hour it would no doubt be even better later on! WE WERE WRONG!!! The entire movie suddenly fell out of place and entered a whole other dimension where fact and fiction had to be divided and after dividing it the whole movie became fiction. If they had to base a film on something like that they shouldn't have made a Jack the Ripper film it was almost an insult to what Michael Caine had preformed so perfectly as Abberline. Johnny Depp's accent couldn't be anymore silly than it was even though I would give him a little happy by saying nice try there. The real Inspector Abberline was in his late 40's, did Johnny even look past 30? This movie will get a 2 out of 10 and only because the whole setting was terrific and even the special effects with the knife, good! Other than that don't bother it unless you have some extra cash in your pockets and nothing else to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Each scene is stylish but the movie lacks soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hell is the story of Jack The Ripper, an infamous serial killer who committed his crimes in the late 19th century London. He is allegedly the first serial killer who killed his victims with sexually related desires. The movie is based upon the comic book by Alan Moore which, probably, is the most reliable source on Jack The Ripper who allegedly selected his victims from prostitutes who witnessed a secret wedding between one of their friends and a prince from the Royal Palace in order to prevent this scandal to be known by the public. This mere fact is enough to suggest that Jack The Ripper, along with orders to kill were from the Royal Family. However, the way he kills victims in a ritualistic way suggests that there were other motives involved other than merely getting rid of the witnesses.I have to admit that "From Hell" didn't turn out to be as good as I hoped it would be. This is a kind of movie where each scene is nicely done but when you put them together they lack soul. Hughes brothers have done everything right, the camera angles, locations, decoration, costumes, acting is good but when all put together, the movie still doesn't have a soul. One of the reasons for my dislike is that the characters don't seem very real. For example, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) doesn't have the look of 19th century prostitute. Directors didn't even bother using some make up effects to make her look like a prostitute. However, all her friends have more realistic prostitute look, which makes Marry Kelly look even more incongruous. Her relationship with Inspector Frederick George Abberline (Johny Depp) is unnaturally hurried and lacks soul. Inspector Abberline's visions of the murders are haphazard. Does he see them when they are happening or after they've happened? Does he see them when he "chases the dragon" (when he is high on opium) or anytime when he feels like it? In one scene, he touches the wall near the crime scene and picks up some visions. I have found his visions to be very chaotic and not adding any excitement to the story at all. They just create some visuals but that's all. The victims are not introduced to the audience in a way that will make them likable. That's why, you don't feel any sympathy when they are murdered. I have found a lack of excitement there too. I have also noticed one technical mistake: in one scene (I guess it was right after the second murder), a cop turns the corner and sees the dead body lying on the sidewalk. You see him right before he turns the corner and after he turns the corner and sees the dead body. There is not one single visible reaction in his movement. He doesn't pace up to rush to the dead body, he doesn't seem to stop for a moment in surprise. From the beginning of the scene to its end, his speed and movements are unnaturally unvarying. What I liked: From Hell is a highly stylish movie with a quite realistic depiction of 19th century London. Costumes, locations, set decoration and the way the scenes are shot are stylish. It is always nice to watch Johny Depp although this is not one of his best acting performances. The story is very true to the original book in the sense that it grows on all of the characters who were, in reality, accused of being Jack The Ripper. The story, at the end, remains to be loyal to the widely accepted theory.If you like horror movies and enjoy serial killer themes, there is a great chance you might enjoy From Hell. But if you are expecting a serious movie with a strong plot, rhythm and soul "From Hell" is likely to disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a great fan of Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's original graphic novel and an admirer of the Hughes Brothers, I had rather high hopes for "From Hell" when first I heard of its production. As its release date neared, though, and details of the film began to leak out, I became distressed by the broad changes the film's writers had made to Moore's original story, apparently with the consent of the Hugheses. Moore's story is not a mystery; neither, of course, is it a documentary of the case. He admits the novel is a work of fiction and has said that his choice for the identity of the Ripper is most unlikely. The Ripper case, its drama, and its continuing fascination was a hook on which to hang a social commentary -- and this, along with much of the historical research Moore and Campbell put into the book -- is what is missing from the Hughes Brothers' movie. The brothers are working with some very talented people these days, and they've made a very good-looking an good-sounding film, but at its heart, it's empty. Pretty as the cinematography is, talented as most of the actors are, "From Hell" is dull. It hasn't the thrills to qualify as a decent thriller, the chills to make a satisfying horror movie, the emotionally involving characters to draw us into a human drama. "From Hell" is a mess, and you'd do well to spend your money elsewhere.</fullReview>

The movie was slow moving, incredibly predictable, and had a slow, drawn out climax.The scenery was amazing, and the special effects were fantastic. That much I'll give. Even the acting was good. It is just that the story stunk.Don't go see it. Rent it. Maybe even wait for HBO. You already know what happens anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Collection of Theories About The Case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie takes every sensational theory about the Whitechapel murders and crams them into one plot. The royal theory, the masonic conspiracy theory, and the two killer theory are all shown here, and none of them are very convincing. A very entertaining and frightening movie could have been made on the facts alone. Hollywood of course is allowed to put their own "dramatic" spin on real life events, but what "From Hell" brings is the biggest fairy tale possible. The movie plot alone without involving "Jack the Ripper" would have been a better idea. The directors also seemed to want to throw in the real facts about the case quickly, so that they could make room for the fictional aspects of the events. As the movie stands it is a sub par effort and one of the most famous murder cases of all time needs a better plot to tell its story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, an insult to Depp and Coltrane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a depressing, awful, dark, dank, and damp (OH GOD was it ever damp, This version of London has to be the wettest i've ever seen.)Although going full well into this movie knowing it was based on the macabre and mysterious Jack The Ripper, it was more depressing, insulting, boring, and bland than it was suspenseful and scary.It's sad too, because it appears the Hollywood machine went full force in recreating 19th century London, CGI, costumes, and props. It Could have been a great, terrifying suspenseful mystery adventure. Instead it takes a little Alan Moore, history, and mixes in a terrible script. I actually cringed at the awful, screeching Cockney accents provided by the non British/UK actors and actresses. (Depp was OK though, his being mellow and not seemingly screeched at the top of his lungs like the "unfortunates" was.)There was no chemistry what-so-ever between Depp and Graham, at no time was I convinced of their attraction to each other, or of their predictable "romance", if you could call it that. Depp seemed to sleepwalk his way through most of this picture, (I wish I could've done the same.) The "unfortunates" are portrayed as the dumbest group of screeching harpies I have ever seen spread across the screen. How many moments of stubborn pride "I won't take charity from nobody" "I'm not a whore", "I wasn't always a whore." "I need to work to live/eat." moments did you count? Especially from Graham? Even late into the movie, as all her friends lay horribly slain, she still stubbornly sticks her nose in the air with these ideas rather than just taking the money offered to her (and at this point it should be quite obvious that it's not someone trying to get in her pants) and getting the hell out of dodge. It's nothing more than a bad script setup to share a "passionate" kiss with Depp.The killer story, for one of the most infamous and gruesome murderers in all of history is really quite boring, and lacking any mystery and aforementioned "suspense."I felt sorry for Depp and Coltrane, I really did. Having seen them both in much, much better roles, at least the friendship and work between the two of them was comfortable and convincing. It's too bad that no one involved in writing/producing/directing this disaster decided that anyone else should be.Want to see a movie done right with Depp as a detective? I suggest "Sleepy Hollow."2/10 for Depp &amp; Coltrane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silly film with very little appeal beyond three good performances by supporting actors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start? To begin with, the plot has already been filmed in an adequate (and vastly more entertaining) manner in the 1979 film with Christopher Plummer and James Mason 'Murder by decree'. Secondly, Johnny Depp's 'English' accent must be well up there for the Dick Van Dyke 'cod-English, 'gor, blimey, govn'r'' Award - it is so abysmal that you LONG for another of the 'opium den'/'vision' scenes because one knows that at least he will keep his mouth shut and spare one's ears. The 'opium den' scenes themselves, and the role they 'play' in the script, are also themselves the height of silliness, even if they play the 'key' role in the final scenes and the 'saving' of Depp's sweet-heart. The whole role and everything about the latter ('Mary Kelly') is also virtually 'off the silliness scale'. As usual with films about Jack the Ripper, the producers want it both ways; revelling in the filth, poverty, gore, diseases and total cheapness of and disregard for human life prevalent in the slum areas of London in the 1880s, whilst, of course, portraying the lead, especially female, characters, as if they had actually nothing to do with such surroundings. The police photographs and crime scene sketches of the time, to which the film refers at many stages, show the real Mary Kelly (as with all of the other victims of the Ripper) for what they actually were - wasted, emaciated, disease-ridden and broken women, decades old before their time. The 'Mary Kelly' of this film, with her fresh complexion, beautiful 'Pre-Raphaelite' auburn hair, spotless clothes and bright, assertive expression is a travesty of the reality. If, however, 'Kelly's' general appearance and demeanour are shams, wait until the final scene when she escapes to a 'designer' cottage directly on the coast of Ireland with her 'rescued daughter' and decides to devote her life to bringing up the latter in healthy,clean and invigorating surroundings rather than the rat-infested slums of the East End of London - I say, what a terrific idea! A VERY silly ending to an extremely silly film which deserves to be totally forgotten and left to the type of murk and dark obscurity in which most of it is shot and which even makes the physical act of simply watching almost as disagreeable as waiting for the 'plot' to unfold. The ONLY saving graces were the performances of Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and Ian Richardson (the latter's appearances, though, being far too brief).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To the defense of the makers of the movie 'From Hell' it must be said, that no one could have followed the material written by Alan Moore to the graphical novel drawn by Eddie Campbell: there just is too much plot for a single movie. If by the other hand they would have decided to make a TV-series out of the novel, the result would have been entirely different.The most constructive difference between the graphical novel and the movie is, that the novel is about Jack The Ripper: who he is and why he does what he does. The movie is a film about Abberline and his personality and his mission to stop the monster. And some fool decided to add these mystical foresight abilities to Abberline, who in fact was described as rather normal fellow in the novel.Jhonny Depp plays the part of Abberline, and that was a bit disappointment for all, who actually have read the novel, as Abberline is no where near Depp's appearance: he's shorter and more rounder. Best role of the film is given to Ian Holm, who play Dr. Sir William Gull, the official doctor of the royal family. The rest of the cast is good, tough I question of the cast of the prostitutes, or does Heather Graham really strike anyone as 19'th century harlot?From some reason or another all movies based on Alan Moore's brilliant writing fail to capture the essence and the spirit of his works. The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen was same kind of disappointment from the same reason. Moore's characterisations are far too bold for typical Hollywood films. They will always fail to portray them right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grapes of DEATH!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't the first movie about the notorious late 19th century serial killer Jack The Ripper and it sure as 'hell' won't be the last. "From Hell" is, however, the most budgeted one of the bunch and also the first (at least, by my knowledge) that actually attempts severely to reveal the possible identity of Jackie-boy and the motivations behind his gruesome killings. The screenplay for this film was adapted from authentic police reports from that period, and the prostitute-murders are truthful reconstructions, based on original illustrations and drawings. This realism results in a very compelling, powerful and often shocking first half hour. The prostitutes (or "unfortunate women" as they are referred to) of the London Whitechapel-quarter are approached by a sophisticated gentleman in a black coach, who offers them drapes and a tempting amount of money. Shortly after, their murdered bodies are found severely mutilated. They also seem to be missing organs that were removed surgically, which raises the suspicion that the killer might very well be a man of high standing. Police inspector (and full-time opium-addict) Abberline devotedly investigates the case and stumbles on eminent organizations that surely don't want to be linked with the murders. Director-duo Albert and Allen Hughes somewhat lose their grip on the complex story after the third murder and the film's climax is sorely disappointing. The most fascinating thing about the entire production unquestionably is the breathtaking Victorian setting! The London of 1888 is terrifically illustrated, with its foggy streets; corrupt police system and enormous differences in social class. Much more than a horror portrait, "From Hell" is a raw ghetto-drama about survival! This isn't surprising, since the directors previously made the minor classics "Menace II Society" and "Dead Presidents" that are all about social conflicts. Johnny Depp is terrific as usual, Heather Graham makes your heart melt and the supportive cast exists of multi-talented British actors such as Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings), Jason Flemying (Snatch) and Robbie Coltrane (Mona Lisa). Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We need another Jack the Ripper Movie like I need a hole in the head!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go again. Another Jack the Ripper book offering "the final solution" comes out, another costume drama is released utilising its contents.Johnny Depp and Robbie Coltrane play real life cops Frederick Abberline and George Godley. Some odd accents here: Abberline has a very lower class accent for an 19th century inspector, Sussex man Godley speaks with a Scottish accent, and Long Liz Stride has hyper-sensitive hearing - being able to hear the sound of Bow Bells in her native Sweden.There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that Abberline took laudanum, although many people at the time did.We have a few sub plots involving a love affair between Abberline and Mary Kelly. We have the royal physician, the Duke of Clarence, the Freemasons.And what was it all about? Well, the Duke of Clarence married a Catholic girl in a Catholic church, and the girls who are being bumped off were in the church. The royal establishment are quite willing to use murder to cover the whole thing up. Sounds like a great idea, BUT, in those days Catholics had to be married twice: once in the Catholic Church, and again in an Anglican church. Why? Because the Catholic priests were not registered to marry legally; so, in the eyes of the law, a Catholic marriage had no legal standing. So we are talking about a film with a busted plot.That aside, the film is well shot, well atmospheric, and has appropriate music.Another problem is that the conditions the girls of Whitechapel are living in are too sanitised. In reality, these folk lived in utter squalor.How many more films are we going to get about Jack the Ripper?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood treatment of the Ripper murders.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp plays an Inspector Abberline who is assigned to investigate the murders in Whitechapel attributed to Jack the Ripper. The film follows the theory explored in an earlier film, "Murder by Decree" (1979), that the Ripper murders were really the act of a mad palace surgeon who was killing the witnesses to a scandal involving Prince Edward.I can't think of a more unlikely pair of actors to portray Victorian Londoners than Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. No matter how they tried to cover it up with elaborate costuming and bad accents, I kept seeing a surfer dude and a valley girl on the screen. Depp is a pretty decent actor but he was just wrong for this role.The supporting cast is pretty good. Ian Holm is particularly good as Sir William Gull, the mad surgeon who goes about disemboweling the young women. Ian Richardson has a prominent role as Depp's boss, but the script doesn't give him much leeway to act.The production values are slick, and the director went to great lengths to make the sets look authentic, but the film lacked any inner conviction. "Murder by Decree" made more of a social commentary about the perversity of the royal family and the social structure of Britain at the end of the 19th century. Here, sensationalism seems to be the dominant theme.Maybe if the movie had been directed by somebody besides the Hughes Brothers it could have been more complex. They should stick to hip hop culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylistic and empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying _From Hell_ is not a bad film. It is stylistically very striking, and the Hughes Brothers have done a great job in getting London dirty in recreating Victorian times. The atmosphere, the characters (with the exception of the luminous Heather Graham, the cleanest whore in all of London!) are all consistent with a dank, dirty city. The murders are well shot, all the actors are hit their marks, and the film doesn't sensationalise the violence to a great extent.But... having read the graphic novel the movie is based on, I was disappointed. Alan Moore's tale sought to humanize a group of people preyed upon by the Ripper while bringing some motivation to the Ripper murders. The murderer is known from the outset, and it is the character interplay and the metaphysics of the story that provide the fiction's flavour.The Hughes Brothers have instead chose to make a whodunnit of the tale, and have cut out a lot of the story away. I could see the trails of the original narrative trailing throughout the movie, but that only left me disappointed when I saw other bits left out. Mr Moore's narrative would I have been very difficult to film, and would have lasted for hours. Even so, I felt more could have been done. In chaptering the style of _From Hell_, I feel the Hughes Brothers have left out the heart.And I feel for those confused by the end of the movie. It makes some sense in the graphic novel, but really seems dropped out of nowhere in the film.Overall, not a bad film, but it was unable to live up to the source material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not a well crafted film. I kept thinking I was watching some made for TV movie of the week. It was supposed to be a mystery, but you would have to be a total dunce to not figure out who the Ripper was. I will give you a hint, it is the obvious choice that the filmmakers attempt to shy you away from. Then there was Heather Graham, the great actress from Austin Powers (do you sense some sarcasm?) Heather Graham's accent kept reminding me of the Gilligan's Island episode where Mary Ann played the cockneyed flower girl. You know the one, where Gilligan was Mr. Hyde? Come to think of it, that episode was scarier than this film. Depp was pretty good, he usually is. However, the story was just not very convincing and full of holes. There were many gadgets and tricks that you have seen a hundred times before and the climax was so predictable. If you don't have an interest in Jack the Ripper, you are not likely to gain one after watching this film. These two brothers made a name for themselves directing gangsta films and I think that is where there strength lies, if they have a strength. Leave the historical based films to better story tellers. This was ABC &amp; MTV "go to the movies" and the result is a film that will leave you wandering what is on TBS later that night. Perhaps I am being too harsh, but as student of the Jack the Ripper case, I felt letdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two words: Heather Graham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to make one thing very clear, I don't care about the story, it was very boring, not scary and the acting was horrible but Heather Graham is the bomb. She was great in Austin Powers 2 and Boogie Night. In this one she is also sexy. Here is the story thanks to mr. Anonymous.It is 1888 in London, and the unfortunate poor lead horrifying lives in the city's deadliest slum, Whitechapel. Harassed by gangs and forced to walk the streets for a living, Mary Kelly and her small group of companions trudge on through this daily misery, their only consolation being that things can't get any worse. Yet things somehow do when their friend Ann is kidnapped and they are drawn into a conspiracy with links higher up than they could possibly imagine. The kidnapping is soon followed by the gruesome murder of another woman, Polly, and it becomes apparent that they are being hunted down, one by one. Sinister even by Whitechapel standards, the murder grabs the attention of Inspector Fred Abberline, a brilliant yet troubled man whose police work is often aided by his psychic abilities. Abberline becomes deeply involved with the case, which takes on personal meaning to him when he and Mary begin to fall in love. But as he gets closer to the truth Whitechapel becomes more and more dangerous for Abberline, Mary, and the other girls. Whoever is responsible for the grisly acts is not going to give up his secret without a fight....will they be able to survive the avenging force that has been sent after them from hell? The movie itself was very poor, not enough t&amp;a.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie so disappointing that it inspired me to write this, my first review. The only genre appropriate for this movie is Horror because of possible shock factor at the type of murders committed. However, considering the repetitive nature of this film, only the first murder could really be considered "shocking".I find myself shying away from horror movies because I scare easy, however, even I did not find this movie scary. There was no suspense. The movie was merely disgusting. You could not even really classify it as "gore" because the repulsive part was more the idea of the murders rather than what was shown.The "romance" part of this movie was laughable. Heather Graham's character was poorly developed, and I was not convinced that Inspector Abberline would fall in love with her. I suppose the fact that Mary Kelly didn't once solicit men, despite being a whore, like all the other women was an attempt to soften her character and make their love more believable. It didn't work on me.This movie was extremely predictable - you knew what was going to happen next throughout the entire film. I am of the opinion that the potential for a good movie was there, but the execution failed in producing it. I confess, I have not read the novel it was based on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It hurts to think about this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching half an hour or so of From Hell I felt as if the Hughes Brothers had strapped me down and performed some impromptu butchery on my brain. As soon as I saw that opening shot of London's blood-red skyline (after a promising into that does for opium what Pulp Fiction did for heroin) I knew that this movie was going to be an unrestrained and unsubtle Hollywood dream of Victorian England.What is it about pre-twentieth century Britain that makes American filmmakers froth at the mouth and scream "More blood! More filters! More simple-minded exposition!"? 1992's Dracula at least had the excuse of basing its extravagant visuals on an equally lurid literary source, but From Hell's betters are, well, better than that. I loved the original graphic novel for its black and white images that looked like swiftly executed but amazingly skilful sketches. There was a subtlety of artifice that made the story all the more terrifying.So much for that. The Hughes Brothers pour on every daft trick they can think of to conceal the fact that a) they have no feeling for late-1800s London, except as a Cockney version of inner-city Washington; and b) the screenwriters Hayes and Yglesias didn't know to condense the wealth of information and paranoid plot detail from the original into a working screenplay. The pacing of From Hell is, as another commentator noticed, bizarre. The first act, before Depp's character begins to take an interest in the movie, is unbelievable clunky and awkward. The early moments seem drained of drama, as if they were tentative character improvisations in the first days of shooting rather than actual scripted scenes. Characters step into frame to announce their plot significance and motivation and then step off again; if they're not played by Depp, Graham, or Holm, they're onscreen only to talk desperately or menacingly, show cleavage or knives, and kill or be killed.In case you're wondering, Heather Graham does not make a convincing Victorian prostitute. After five seconds of screen time, even before she opened her mouth to attempt a Cockney accent, it is immediately apparent that a casting mistake has been made. The real horror of From Hell comes from the suspense between Graham's scenes; you never know when she's going to pop up next and whine out a line about being hungry and impoverished. It is like being lied to by someone who has stolen your jacket and wears it in front of you; you admire the audacity but you are not convinced.The rest of the cast stands up to the overbearing directorial style with a campy resistance that produces some enjoyment. I liked Depp's thuggish London accent, which has him saying things like "Fank you" and "I fink there's somefing going on here". Ian Holm jumps around in the birdbath of his own cultural folklore and makes all the other performances seem amateurish.This movie, like a whole schwack of others, is a kind of film soup: part inner-city police procedural, part period piece, part slasher flick. Other generic elements surface occasionally, but the Hughes Brothers wield such a furious spoon that it's hard to see the ingredients. The conflicting requirements of genre sometimes produce anachronisms and unlikelihoods that strain the limits of credibility. Heather Graham's character Mary Kelly is an Irish peasant who left at the age of eight to take up an exciting career in Whitechapel as a prostitute, but she can read and write - and has beautiful penmanship. Say what you like about the institution of schools in Victorian England; it's still ridiculous.More ridiculous still are scenes in which Kelly suggests that she left Ireland and came to England because "it seemed too small a place to live the rest of my life in". Never mind the crushing poverty, the potato blight, and the stigma of being an Irish Catholic in Victorian England. It's all about that restless feeling that makes you want to leave your dead-end town, get on that ferry and take your hopes and dreams to glitzy glamorous Whitechapel. And all at the age of eight, apparently. I can only hope that I misheard something. A bit more forgiveable (but no less stupid) is the uncomfortable resemblance between the London constabulary of 1888 and the NYPD circa 1988. Inspector Abberline, when he's not having opium-induced visions, acts like a renegade American cop with an infusion of British politeness. As the movie progresses, examinations of the corpses begin to sound more and more like the autopsy scenes from "Silence of the Lambs".The really anachronistic, or perhaps historically blind, elements of From Hell would involve giving away the whodunnit modular unit of the film, so you'll have to see it yourself. But don't. Unless you like blood (there's lots), or Johnny Depp's cheekbones (does this man never age?), or if you enjoy the spectator sport of watching lesser-known British actors steal scene after scene from hapless American stars. There's also some really really bad continuity errors. Jason Flemyng plays a tormented coachman with one of his ears partially lopped off. Watch for the scene in the film that explains his torments and explores his psyche. It consists almost entirely of a close-up on his face. Take a look at his ears. Then leave the theatre: tell people you've just come from hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Hell is set in the filth of a Victorian London during 1888 in the Whitechapel District where it seems there are prostitutes &amp; knife wielding maniac's on every corner, a bit like it is now then really! It starts by introducing a group of six friends, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), Ann Crook (Joanna Page), Liz Stride (Susan Lynch), Annie Chapman (Katrin Cartlidge), Polly Nichols (Annabelle Apsion) &amp; Kate Eddowes (Lesley Sharp) who all happen to be prostitutes &amp; supposedly look out for each other. One member of the group, Ann Crook is now the Mother of a young baby, has recently married into money &amp; promises the girls that she will give them four quid to pay a Victorian pimp named McQueen (David Schofield) &amp; his men. Shortly after the girls then witness Ann, her husband Albert (Mark Dexter) &amp; their baby being dragged screaming from a flat by Ben Kidney (Terence Harvey) &amp; his men who all work for Scotland Yard special branch, later on that night Mary is warned not to mention to anyone what she saw. Also that night Polly is brutally murdered, she has her throat cut from ear to ear &amp; her body is horribly mutilated. The drug addicted Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp), Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) &amp; Scotland Yard's finest are on the case. Annie Chapman is next to be brutally slain by the killer who has become known as 'Jack the Ripper', getting absolutely nowhere with his investigations Inspector Abberline seeks the advice of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) &amp; his protégé Dr. Ferral (Paul Rhys). Together they agree that the 'Ripper' is probably an educated man &amp; very knowledgeable about human anatomy &amp; the use of surgical instruments indicating that he may be a Doctor. As Abberline gets closer to unveiling 'Jack the Rippers' identity he faces resistance from his superiors, special branch, falls in love with Mary &amp; uncovers dark secrets &amp; conspiracy's that go to the very highest levels of Royalty &amp; Government...Executive produced &amp; directed by Albert &amp; Allen Hughes as The Hughes Brothers I thought From Hell was an OK mystery thriller but nothing to get too excited about. The script by Terry Hayes &amp; Rafael Yglesias based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore &amp; Eddie Campbell is far too long &amp; becomes dull to watch as it neither works as a factual reconstruction of the 'Ripper' events or as a fictional horror/thriller, this feels like a teen slasher based around a few of the more well-known Ripper elements. There are massive inaccuracies between what takes place in From Hell &amp; what happened in reality, the prostitutes never knew each other &amp; if this is the case then the entire explanation that From Hell gives must be wrong &amp; therefore most of From Hell is pure fiction straight away &amp; this alone destroys any sort of credibility that it tries to achieve. Inspector Abberline was nothing like Johnny Depp &amp; he lived until 1929 &amp; had a distinguished career, &amp; I'm not too sure if the real Inspector Abberline would have had psychic visions of the murders before they happened! I'm positive that there are loads more too. From Hell falls also flat as a fictional tale because it is just far to intricate, there are too many characters who do very little, not enough screen time is given to the 'Ripper' or his motives &amp; far too much time is given to the group of moaning filthy prostitutes. I also thought the semi-happy ending &amp; Jack's eventual motive were well off the pace. But the thing that really sinks From Hell in my humble opinion is that it is just so slow, dull &amp; uneventful. In fact I actually fell asleep about 20 or so minutes before the end &amp; had to rewind the tape so I could catch the end, I shouldn't have bothered really. On a positive note From Hell has exceptional production design, the filth, squaller &amp; nastiness of the back streets of Victorian London are wonderfully recreated in great detail. From Hell is also a visually strong film with some flashy camera techniques like when the Ripper stabs a girl in a pitch black archway where at first the only thing we see is the silver blade of his knife as it catches the light but the blade starts to turn more red each time it re-catches the light after disappearing for a second, editing tricks &amp; nice use of CGI to enhance certain imagery &amp; some of the cityscapes of Victorian London with a shot of Big Ben in complete shadow at night &amp; a gorgeous looking red sky behind it particularly springing to mind. The violence &amp; gore was mostly implied &amp; mostly consisted of graphic shots of dead bodies although there is one of the best on screen slit throats it's been my pleasure to view... Technically From Hell is top-notch throughout, but then that's the least I expect from a film with an estimated budget of $35,000,000, the acting is very good from all involved &amp; a special mention goes to the fantastic Robbie Coltrane who is just brilliant &amp; makes his character very likable. Overall I thought From Hell was an OK way to pass a couple of hours &amp; I can't in all honesty call it a bad film but it could have been done with being 15 or 20 odd minute's shorter which would have increased the pace &amp; helped maintain my interest. As it stands I don't think I'll be in any hurry to watch it again anytime soon. Worth watching if you can find a copy going cheap or catch it on TV for free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this on video with a good friend. I was expecting a good film, based on some reviews I had read. Unfortunately, we both thought it was terrible. It turned into a laugh fest as we started making fun of it, and continued to do that all the way through. Some of the accents were pathetically bad. The acting and the script were both terrible. We really laughed at some of the bad lines in this film.We both have been big fans of Johnny Depp. Recently he seems to have been cruising through most of his films, getting by on his looks and attitude without really acting. In this film he tried to do that, but it didn't work. His performance was very very disappointing in this film. If you want to see him in a much better "period" horror film, rent Sleepy Hollow. That one was not perfect, but was much better than From Hell was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has some of the cleanest and prettiest prostitutes ever found in a movie about 19th century English prostitutes. I usually enjoy Johnny Depp for his acting prowess, and in this movie, he did show his talent at doing an English accent and keeping it constant (unlike Heather Graham). Only problem was, it was the wrong accent! He was playing a police Inspector, but instead of having a middle or upper class accent like his peers, superiors and underlings, Johnny sported a lower-class street accent like the prostitutes had. Both the writing and direction were sophmoric and showed a complete lack of understanding of any of the subject matters. It was obvious that the filmmakers had paid plenty of attention to other movies set in that time and place, but they had no feel whatsoever for how it might actually have been. The entire movie felt like that - shallow. When they tried for atmosphere, they got the look, but not the mood. A complete waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an absolute disgrace. It profanes the memory of the dead, violates every imaginable principle and is boring cinema to boot.I recommend that people find pictures of the Ripper's real victims - and what he did to them - before they decide what they think about this movie. How would you all react to a movie about Jeffrey Dahmer with this sort of Hollywood-ised romanticism attached?All I can point to in this movie is the six buxom prostitutes washing themselves in the crystal clear waters of a horse's trough, standing around exchanging pleasantries like characters from a L'Oreal advert. Perfect, lustrous, flowing hair, clean complexions, great teeth, a touch of makeup in the right places. Oh, OK, not 6 stone, starving, filthy and battered. My mistake.The Americans' accents are abysmal. The quotations from Shakespeare are an embarrassment. The Freemason malarky is all more frat party than Victorian England. The ending is a travesty so obscene that it beggars belief.The only consolation in the movie is bravura performances - with nothing to work with - from Holm, Richardson, Coltrane and MacNiece.I echo the sentiments of a previous comment - I hope the ghosts of history catch up with the Hughes Brothers some day, I really do.</fullReview>

The real inspector Abberline was not a drug addict, nor a psychic. Mary Kelly WAS murdered.These were real people to whom terrible things happened. The movie sells these peoples' suffering to us as entertainment, yet does not even show the respect of caring what really happened. I hope the Hughes Brothers et al are haunted by the ghosts of history.As a movie, this film is also a disapointment. Depp cannot do a cockney accent to save his life, the result being distracting.

		<shortDescription>Moody horror that covers the holes in it's plot with a great atmos-fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1888, Inspector Abberline investigates the case of `Jack the Ripper', who is murdering his through a group of poor whores on London's streets. As he grows close to one of the prostitutes, he also begins to detect a conspiracy that is higher than he suspected.Adapted from the Alan Moore/Eddie Campbell comic this is a dark little horror movie. The story opens and closes with Abberline in an opium den (draw your assumptions from that) and follows his investigation into the murders of several whores. The story uncovers a conspiracy that involves police, special branch, masons, surgeons and perhaps royalty. The middle section is the one you need to be focused during - at one time there are quite a few possibilities bouncing around and you need to concentrate. However in the latter stages the story is clearer as the Ripper is revealed - although his portrayal as a psycho and an intelligent controlled man don't sit well together.Story aside the film's strength is in it's direction, it's sets, costume and total sense of place and mood. The sets are excellent and 19th century London is well recreated. The mood brought to the streets at night also deserves praise, the camera moves around shadowy streets - however it does it without cheap `jump out of shadows' teen-slasher style tricks, here it is more a sense of fear than a series of sudden shocks. The directors bring plenty of fresh tricks to the story - plenty of imaginative scenes (including one where a victim lies still while the action around her body speeds up to get to the morning), and there are plenty of quick cuts and edits to make us create our own horror. The creation of unseen horror is well done by the sound effects - there are plenty of blade noises, cutting of skin etc - you don't see it onscreen, but you can't help but see it.The film most horrible idea is of London ruled by a cold Queen who only sees poor subjects as things or material to be worked with. This idea is played through the elite - the masons are happy to do anything to achieve their aims, experimental surgery is played out in front of audiences and the disfigured are not seen as people. This concept, added to the excellent mood and direction make up for the weaknesses in the plot and the occasional bad performance.Depp is good as Abberline - a stronger willed man that his Sleepy Hollow character, and manages to do a good accent for most of the film. Heather Graham is not as good - she's too pretty to be one of the whores and her accent wavers regularly between London and LA. She is good for most of her scenes, but her scenes with the rest of her whores seem overdone by all the ladies. The group of women all seem to be saying their dialogue extra loud and with extra accent - I can't really describe it but they don't feel natural. The rest of the cast are filled out with excellent Brits - Holm, Richardson, Rhys and a small role for a well known face in Lock, Stock's Jason Flemyng as coach driver Netley.Overall this is good - the fear is instilled through sound, mood and shadows. The final 15 minutes feels like it reverts to a standard thriller with a standard mad bad guy, and the end may be a little too happy - but just remember it opens AND closes with Abberline off on opium (get it?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately I found this film a real chore to watch. Perhaps the directors, coming from Detroit, do not have enough connection with England and have not recognised this and obtained the assistance they need, but their portrayal of Victorian London is very much a cliché. The outside scenes look studio bound, with the sky always blood red, not at all typical of England's Gray skies. In one scene a drunk is dragged across the ground, drawing attention to the ground being far too clean to be realistic. In one scene there is a break-in, with a hand reaching in through a window to open a highly polished brass lock. So much for the image of Victorian London as a dirty place where the population is more interested in drinking, prostitutes and other vices than in good housekeeping! There are a large number of identical characters - stunning looking prostitutes in bright dresses often giving an articulate discourse on how hard done by they are, and evil men in sober suits slashing them in dark alleyways. The film is shot from a 21st century liberal perspective, not with the values of the time.It is a few weeks since I watched this movie and I cannot say that I recollect the plot. But I can remember that I didn't find the movie worthwhile to watch at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Hell - where the script came from?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's brilliant graphic novel 'From Hell' is one of the most original and intelligent works of fiction in recent years, and something I cannot recommend highly enough. Please don't let this useless film adaptation put you off the superb original. 'From Hell' the movie is simply awful. The basic thing which sinks it from the outset is a lousy, illogical script that seems to totally miss everything that made Moore's work so enthralling. All the original and thought provoking elements are thrown out, and the bare bones of the plot are recast as a tired, cliched murder mystery, which holds no surprises or suspense, and which, let's face it was done much more convincingly in 'Murder By Decree' back in the 1970s. Johnny Depp is badly miscast as the middle aged Inspector Abberline, his accent is very shaky, and his drug use and clairvoyant visions are bogus and unnecessarily tacked on. The rest of the cast struggles with the poor material. Heather Graham is also a strange casting choice and not very convincing. Robbie Coltrane is reasonable. Ian Holm is well chosen but his character is a major disappointment. And so it goes, on and on. I liked The Hughes brothers underrated 'Dead Presidents', and enjoyed their documentary 'American Pimp'. I think they've got more good movies in them, but this isn't one. No matter how talented they are with a script as bad as this one there's very little that can be done to rescue this misguided and embarrassing project.</fullReview>

How can the directors in their right mind sanctioned a film like this without doing their research. And on top of that, took the time to make out that a possible romance could have happened ?. If they think that they could get away with producing crap of this magnitude, then it is another attempt to "crap" on the English with a pathectic attempt to re-create what can only be described as "The most unsolved and greatest who-dunnit" in modern times. If anyone is thinking of renting this out, I would strongly advise against this as they will be dissappointed to the brink of switching it off.

		<fullReview>I'll watch anything with Depp or Ian Richardson, which is how I got skinned on this PPV rental. For God's sake, do NOT spend money on this sad little ripoff of Murder by Decree -- but with far less talent and entertainment.The plot was "new" 20 years ago but thoroughly discredited long ago as being too silly for words. Even Depp's great Cockney acccent was completely out of character for a Scotland Yard inspector, but the portrayal of one pinup-quality whore amongst a thousand utter dogs was just annoying...as was her accent and acting. The storyline was erratic (even where it made sense), and the so-called "mystery" was obvious early on. The errors or misrepresentations about the Ripper murders were phenomenal, and only someone totally ignorant of the case could get sucked in at all.Depp is one of the most talented actors around, but even he can be grossly miscast in awful movies ("Blow" coming to mind immediately). One suspected his heart was not really in this hotly steaming turd and he just went through the paces playing the exact same role as he did in "Sleepy Hollow," which, though it also had a tired old plot, still turned into a great movie.There are several interesting (and even believable) speculations on the Ripper murders, and of course most scholars have a pretty good idea who it probably was (hint: it wasn't a doctor, a royal prince or a Freemason). Surely we could have been given an interesting premise that didn't have just class prejudice going for it. This really did suck. If you haven't seen "Murder by Decree," go rent it, skip this dog and actually get entertained. This one just blows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp plays Inspector Aberline, a cockney drug addict with psychic powers and a nice line in meaningful stares. His task here is to catch a cunning murderer, going by the moniker `Jack The Ripper', who is disemboweling the local cockney prostitutes.From the opening scenes, where the whores are portrayed as `unfortunates' with a heart of gold and the gangsters are played as snarling, scar-faced sociopaths, I had my suspicions this wasn't going my particular cup of tea. Subtle? Not a word that springs to mind. The character development was heavy handed, bordering on downright stereotypical. Aberline is given a wife who has died in child birth, therefore he feels alone. Robby Coltrane spouts poetry, therefore he is wise. Mary Kelly has a picture of herself as a child to show that she wasn't always a whore. Big broad strokes.Additionally, the supporting cast. (Sir Charles Warren, Dr. Ferral, Kidney and his Special Branch hoodlums) where left high and dry with hackneyed dialogue and slender, under-developed roles.The plot development on the other hand was acceptable, though derivative. A series of vicious murders with one potential victim being singled out for development right from the start. A romantic interlude. It even includes the old chestnut where the lovable whores' leave the relative safety of their lodgings one by one (after being warned to stay of the streets!) and are subsequently slashed. Nothing you haven't seen in the Scream movies. However, there is average development in between this that lifts the story slightly. An interesting conspiracy theory is included and the conclusion was a little less conventional, so I suppose that's something.The thing that particularly annoyed me was the style of the movie. When I heard that it was filmed in Prague I was expecting beautiful architecture, atmospheric back streets. No... A lot of the scenes looked although they had been filmed on a sound stage, whose sets were not particularly impressive. Now and again CGI shots depicted `Old London Town' in all its computerized glory. The directors used shoddy effects for the flashbacks and the premonitions. Time-lapse was used unnecessarily.Sound effects during the murder scenes sounded like someone was dueling with a cutlass, rather than eviscerating someone. I'm sure my organs wouldn't clink and chink if someone went at them with a knife. I'd suggest a trip to the Modern Classics section in the video store for the Hughes brothers too see how it should be done.If you approach this film expecting something other than an average teen slasher movie set in the Victorian era, I think you will be disappointed. I know I was.Cor Blimey Guvnor, stone the crows!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films on this case I've ever seen -Warning:Major Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I watched 'From Hell' for the first time. IMO it is among the best of the 'Jack the Ripper' tales I've seen. In fact it may very well be the best. The only other one I can think of that came close is 'Murder by Decree'. From what I've read in the past on the actual Ripper case, i suspect it probably did involve English Nobility and cover ups in some way.The film was wonderfully atmospheric. It reminded me of the recent 'The Wolfman' film in that regard. I really felt I was back in time walking the foggy streets of the Whitechapel slums. And I felt for the poor people living there trying to get money to survive any way they could. A sharp contrast to the rich and privileged who viewed them as worthless expendables. The lives of a few prostitutes were nothing compared to protecting even one noble or the crown. Just fiction here, but IMO historically true in that regard.Johnny Depp did his usual fine acting job here. His inspector reminded me of Sherlock Holmes, even down to the drug use. His sergeant side kick was not unlike Dr. Watson. The story was imaginative and chilling, it was plausible and might actually be close to the truth. I felt bad for those poor women killed just because they had the misfortune to witness a friends wedding. A wedding and a child that were unacceptable to the crown.To be honest I was not surprised at who turned out to be 'The Ripper', it was obviously meant to be a shock, for me it was not. The signs were all there. Ian Holm's was chilling in the role. I'm pretty sure in the scenes where he was in the heat of mad killing his eye pupils seemed a dark gleaming black, demonic in their appearance. In his calmer scenes they did not look this way and were blue or some other normal eye color.The primitive lobotomy scenes were also unnerving. I noticed that as the judges gavel rang out three times it coincided with the three "taps" on the skull used to lobotomize Jack's brain in the next scene. Just like they had done to the unfortunate prostitute who had bore the princess' child. Queen Victoria herself was also depicted as cruel, when Mary went to the museum with Inspector Abberline she saw a portrait of the queen and commented on the coldness of her eyes. Turns out she was right. I know little about Queen Victory, so this may be unfair to her memory, I don't know. For some reason I keep thinking about the recent royal conspiracy theories associated with the death of princess Diana. I wondered just what the so called "Royals" might be capable of in the name of protecting the image of the monarchy. I'm not saying I believe those theories about Princess Di, just that it made me wonder "what if" after watching this film.Thoughts about 'From Hell' will stick with me for quite a while. I wish my wife had watched it too so we could have one of our usual discussions after seeing a thought provoking film I keep going over scenes in it. I particularly liked the ending, the twist that the real Mary Kelly was not killed but lived on in the little seaside cottage she wanted to return to. Sadly the french prostitute was mistakenly killed in her stead. The inspectors reasoning for why he could never join Mary made cold hard sense. Unfortunately I knew in advance the Inspector was going to die from a comment I had accidentally read in a discussion group. At first I thought his was an accidentally death. Now I believe he killed himself...why else would he have the coins in his hand ready to pay the ferry man. He probably was so disillusioned with life, what he had learned, and not being able to join Mary that he decided to end his pain. His job was finished Jack was finished.My wife didn't watch it with me. She was concerned it would be too gory. Turns out that, considering the subject matter, it really was not that bloody. There were a few scenes that were overly graphic, like of a throat being cut, but over all we mostly just heard a chilling slashing blade sound. The Masons tie in was a nice touch too. Though I don't think their society was depicted fairly. Still, you never know.I look forward now to watching the bonus disk that came with the DVDs. I understand it has material about the actual case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Hell is based on the true life crime story of Jack the Ripper which took place in 1888 in East London. And it's the screen adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.When the prostitutes on street are getting murdered in a brutal and violent manner, the investigation is given to a young Scotland Yard detective Fred Abberline. Abberline who is already a trouble gentleman with the loss of his wife and child sometime back tries to catch this ruthless killer but finds little luck. The ritualistic manner of the murders and the mutilations seems to be done by someone who is quite experienced in human anatomy.In the mean time Abberline gets to know a set of prostitutes who are in the risk zone and particularly gets friendly with Mary Kelly who agrees to support him with his investigation. And soon he realizes that the murders are not just a work of a mad man but something more than he can personally bring down. As he and Mary starts to get emotionally involved he tries to keep her protected from the killer as she becomes the final prostitute left out of the target bunch.There is nothing new in this flick. It's a mix of horror scenes with a matching score. Other than that it doesn't offer much of a twists or mysteries to go along with. And it's quite predictable.But for a crime and horror fan it is not so boring. The flow of the story is good. There are no lagging or unwanted scenes. And there is a serious work of set creation and representation of London which is perfectly noticeable from the very first scene.Johnny Depp is mundane and Heather Graham is pretty. Other than that the script does not offer any actor to be special or memorable.Check more at flickshout.tk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So let's get this straight, the African-American directing team the Hughes Brothers - fresh off a hot streak including Menace II Society and Dead Presidents decide that their follow up would be an English period dramatic thriller? Well yes it was folks, and to prepare for making their Jack the Ripper flick they watched Bram Stoker's Dracula about a million times, and ripped off almost everything but the plot.There is much poetic license taken here, apparently it is based upon a fictionalised comic book version that I have never heard of, but then realistically I haven't heard about any comic that hasn't already been made into a movie.What I like is that it opens with a quote from good ole Jack himself, considering no-one knows who he is that seems a huge leap of faith.So to summarise The Hughes Brothers' version, Jack is not a random hack'n'slash guy roaming the back streets, but a calculated intelligent and skilled surgeon hell-bent on killing specific targets. In this case a sextet of hookers led by Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham, yup good 'ole Rollergirl herself.Now I've heard that Heather absolutely butchers the English accent in this, but as I am not especially familiar with the particulars of the dialect I can't be sure. As an Australian I can definitely tell when someone is massacring the Oz accent, so I guess the best people to ask would be British locals.Now these hookers owe some seedy guys from the Nicholls Street gang some cash, and more than 6 scrags can make in reasonable time at their trade. The boss of the gang McQueen is hanging around in menacing fashion, basically providing a nice red herring suspect for the early stages.This is sorta the first 10 minutes of the flick, and is real confusing, especially if you aren't paying attention, but in reality it matters not a zack, as aside from showing that the hookers are buddies it means nothing.Shortly after we have the first kill, one of the hookers is found minus some vital lady bits and a fair bit of blood. So we finally get to meet Johnny Depp as Inspector Abaline, and his Sergeant played by Robbie Coltrane.Now a digression: I should hate Johnny Depp, he is pretty, bangs supermodels, is rich, and was famous and cocky when very young. I should hate and boycott Johnny Depp movies just like I hate Tom Cruise, Richard Gere and Hugh Grant. But I don't.Why? I tried to find out why by looking at his IMDb page, and what I came up with was that over his whole career he has never once made a film that was obviously just for the cash. Beside this he has latched on to Tim Burton, one of the most consistently interesting directors over the last 20 odd years, which means every few years he will have a film released that I will likely see.Back to Hell. Aberline is a little bit of an opium addict, and dabbles with other nasties too, so much so that he has visions of what is likely to happen in the future regarding the hookers. Now I drink - often to excess - and even though I am not fortunate enough to have visions (if anything I lose memories I already have) I would think it extremely fortunate to have visions of people I have never met, but will soon.More kills ensue and it's 3 down, 3 to go. Turns out that the hookers, being poor and unfortunate, cannot afford luxuries like fruit, so they are lured to their doom with the temptation of grapes. This works apparently on almost every occasion, so it is obvious too that they are poor, unfortunate? and stupid.So Aberline, working on a hunch, goes to meet some noted surgeons in the hope that they could enlighten his theory that an educated and trained man is doing the killing further. There he meets Bilbo Baggins, I mean the Royal surgeon and physician Dr Gull, who confirms and supports his theory.Without delving further and giving away too much there is a key subplot which eventually somewhat clumsily becomes intertwined with the key story, there are cover ups, secret orders and societies, red herrings and short-term suspects and corruption at the highest level. Basically everything a grown boy needs.Ultimately the film unmasks the "real" killer, or at least this version's killer, and while it is at least ballsy that they decide to name one guy and come up with a motive and backstory, it does feel very much like a flimsy attempt at a plausible story. There must have been hundreds of leaps of faith taken to piece the thing together from scratch, and if one or two of those aren't in fact true which is likely the case the whole house of cards falls.But did I like it? Not really, it was OK and vaguely interesting from start to finish, but I never really cared who lived or died, and there was no scene that was especially memorable over the whole 2 odd hours.Except? That I watched Bram Stoker's Dracula a few months back, and I tell ya From Hell has so many similarities in feel, tone and vision that if you watched them back to back you might think they were part of a series.Seriously, that's all I can remember, is someone asks me next week I'll say: "It reminds me of Bram Stoker's Dracula." Final Rating ? 6 / 10. If made up versions of historical events are your bag, check this out. Just don't expect too much in the way of action, humour or entertainment.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring: Johnny Depp (it's safe to assume that after 2010 or so all major films will star Johnny Depp and Jude Law), Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and Heather Graham.This film is probably more entertaining if you only have a slight interest in Jack the Ripper. Anyone who has read at least one recent JtR related book will have to many problems with the plot and setup of this film to really enjoy the mood, violence, and STUPID MTV STYLE Camera-work. Johnny Depp is an opium smoking drink/drunk copper with a Robbie Coltrane sidekick out to kick the Ripper's a**, but his superiors don't really care about who is killing the hookers of Whitechapel. Thankfully Johnny does, but he takes a long time in tracking down the killer, and by that time everyone is dead anyway (kind of)...in fact he doesn't really catch the killer either. My problem is that there are too many liberties taken with the actual story. For a start, all the prostitutes know each other. They are all pals. Yep - all the victims are pals, and therefore in being together provide the killer with a motive for doing them all in. Think masonic rituals and Prince Albert and illegitimate children and such like. (AND - what happened to the child's mother? She didn't get knifed. And to be honest the hookers really didn't have a clue what was going on and therefore didn't really have to die) Another quibble - These days it's reckoned that the killer was that American fella and not the royal surgeon fella, but in this film it is the royal surgeon fella, who is a mason and hired to kill the prozzies (all that crap above about children and such like)... It's like they decided to tweak the story and ended up getting too carried away. We get a love story between Mary Kelly (Graham -who has got red hair just in case we don't she's meant to be Irish or something) and Depp. Kelly doesn't even get killed apparentley - it some other chick (err so that's meant to be okay). And Depp dies. Can't remember any of that happening even in the wildest books about the Whitechapel Murders. The film is enjoyable if you don't sit taking pot shots at it, but does tend to go a bit mad in the old cinematography department (flashing lights, split second shots and such like). The last murder is rather gory (not as bad as it really was though...urgh), Depp and Holm are good, but it's just too far fetched for my liking.Average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric, but overlong and boring take on Jack The Ripper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hell has all the potential in the world to be a great, grimmy version of Jack The Ripper, but it falls heavily short of that potential for one reason, It's to dull for it's own good. I don't mind slow and methodical films, but everything just seemed dull in my opinion, with only Johnny Depp's performance being the only salvation to this movie. It's also very cruel spirited as well. Johnny Depp's inspector character is quite charismatic, but a bit too full of himself at times, the treatment of woman is disgusting, and it's just very, very depressing looking as well. The streets of London have the perfect looking atmosphere, the set pieces are terrific, it's great visually, but I was just too bored to care.Performances. Johnny Depp is his usual charismatic self, but suffers from an overly cocky character, and his chemistry with Heather Graham isn't that great. Heather Graham is beautiful but I didn't care much for her character. Ian Holm's intense performance is great, while Robbie Coltrane does good work as The Sergeant.Bottom line. It's atmospheric, well acted for the most part, and it looks great, but it's just too dull. You might wanna use the skip button for the DVD to fast forward, because it is very talky. Some will ultimately disagree with me and love the style, but I did not.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no shortage of theories on Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders in 188. This is another and takes it's place in the annals of a crime that will likely never be solved.Johnny Depp is magnificent as a drug-addicted Inspector Frederick Abberline, who is charged with solving the murders. But isn't Depp always magnificent? Of course, the powers that be do not want him to solve the murders as it is one of their ownThis is a dark film, as any on the subject of the Ripper should be, but it has a fine collection of actors making it enjoyable. Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias wrote a great screenplay, and direction by the Hughes brothers, Albert and Allen, is spot on.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp plays a detective with clairvoyant powers, and you might think those powers would come in handy when looking for Jack the Ripper, but you'd be wrong.Heather Graham (who's accent also slips out - when it should be her tits)is gratingly out of place as a prostitute her colleagues all look like hags while she looks like a model.It doesn't more pompous and poor as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the Alan Moore graphic novel, though since I am a fan of his work, I may very well do so. However, I understand that it is dramatically different from this. In case you are not aware, no, this is not a completely factual account of the infamous case of Jack the Ripper. The FAQ has all the details. What this does do is go into one or two of the more interesting theories, the juiciest of them, and end up with an entertaining, exciting and pretty engaging mystery-thriller that will at the very least be a fun two hours, even if some people will be able to figure out what's going on before it is revealed. The editing and cinematography are utterly gorgeous, and I'd definitely give another film directed by the Hughes brothers a chance. Visually, this never lets the audience down. And it does well as far as substance goes, as well. This builds atmosphere quite effectively, and in spite of the varying degrees of stylization that this indulges in at points, the sombre mood is constant from the first frame to the very last. Acting is solid, and the parts are well-cast. There are a couple of gold nuggets here and there in the dialog. The music is fitting and great. This holds a lot of authenticity, and the production values leave nothing to be desired. There is moderately frequent strong language, brief full frontal nudity, plenty of sensuality and sexuality in this, as well as disturbing content, bloody violence and gore. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genres this falls into, and/or is fascinated with the subject matter. Just make sure you've got the stomach for it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Hell To Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based loosely on the infamous Jack the Ripper's killings, 'From Hell' is more a fictional story about inspector Abberline ( the man who investigated the murders) trying to solve the case. The film does work as a stand alone and credit goes to the Hughes brother and their cast and crew for the incredible execution. It is a very well made movie as the brothers really capture the eery atmosphere of the haunted streets and the English culture during the time. The sets are marvelously designed and the makeup and costume department do a brilliant job. The fantastic visuals, lighting, score, editing and cinematography work very effectively. Both Depp and Graham have a very good diction. Depp makes it almost impossible to imagine anyone else as Abberline and Graham is fine as Mary Kelly. My complaint is that she really stands out too much among her prostitute peers because she is a little too comparatively well-dressed and behaves rather sophisticated. Of the supporting cast, Robbie Coltrane is wonderfully witty and Ian Holm is superb. 'From Hell' should not be watched as a true story or a reference for anyone who is interested in the Ripper killings. But, there are a few things, like the possible murders and the locations which the Hughes brothers have managed to portray more accurately. Their attention to detail is noteworthy. The story tends to lose focus at times returning on track but overall, this is an engaging dark tale that will appeal to many but may not settle well with those who cannot stomach graphic violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ripping his way into the pages of history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers)The film "From Hell" is not as far out as you may have at first thought in who the infamous "Jack the Ripper" really was. As Scotland Yard Inspector Fredrick Abberline, Johnny Depp, at first suspected the "Ripper" was not just your garden verity psycho killer but a man highly educated in both medicine and the human anatomy: A highly trained and respected doctor surgeon! It's this theory alone that's to eventually lead Inspector Abberline straight to the very base of power of the mighty 19th Century British Empire! Queen Victoria's, Liz Moscrop, Buckingham Palace!High on opium, that was legal at the time, Inspector Abberline could sense things as a police detective that his fellow members of Scotland Yard couldn't. It was that extrasensory perception on Abberline's part that had him see the real reasons for the notorious "Ripper" murders. It was also his addiction to opium that in the end did Abberline in before he could brake the "Ripper" case wide open.Classic Gothic Horror movie that takes a number of real historical as well as mysterious incidents, the "Jack the Ripper murders", and makes some sense of them. We do get to see,like Inspector Abberline, the real clues to the "Ripper" identity and, which are far more important, who he was actually working for. The "Ripper", in what the movie brought out, was not an ordinary killer emigrant and illiterate, in the English language, Jew from Czarist Russia or even an escaped lunatic from a mental institution. He was a very highly educated man who did his ghastly job of murder and dismemberment with a skill that would have taken years of practice at a major big city medical facility to achieve!Starting out with a blood-red sunset over the city of London's-circa 1888-crime ridden Whitechapel and Kensington Districts the film "From Hell" accurately chronicles the murderous "Jack the Ripper" rampage that terrorized London that fateful late summer and fall of 1888. We get to see how the "Ripper's" murder of local prostitutes was not an act of murderous insanity but a well thought out plan, by those who controlled him, to rid any evidence connecting his victims, or one of them, to the British Royal Family.***SPOILERS*** In the end it was Inspector Abberline's bulldog-like determination that turned his superior at Scotland Yard Sir. Charles Warner, Ian Richardson, against him. Not that Abberline wasn't doing his job but, in exposing the reasons for the "Ripper" killing, doing it far too well then he, and the power behind the British Throne, would have liked him to! Even though Mary Kelly, Heather Graham, is shown at the end of the film to have survived "Jack the Ripper's" reign of terror she in fact was, as we saw earlier, the "Ripper's" last and most shockingly dismembered murder victim! I couldn't figure out what the movie was trying to tell us in showing Mary back and alive and well in her native Ireland unless it was her soul not body who we were supposed to be seeing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very different, very good, very atmospheric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many horror-mysteries which take their inspiration from historic events that are memorized as one of the most horrifying deeds man has ever done. Most of those films are so occupied with the perpetrator that everything else regarding films becomes less important and so does the film in its entirety. That is not case with this movie.The Hughes brothers made very impressive film, faithfully creating 19th century London and well build up characters and atmosphere from graphic novel. What I liked in particularly was depth that was achieved in explaining (or said better examination) motivation behind murders - madness and motivation of murderer are done in very impressive way almost trying to get inside his head. Portrait of low and high class London was presented is not less impressive way. Everything was spiced with little bit art approach that fits perfectly - European influence worked very well in this movie.Acting is on high level, starting from Johnny Depp who, as usual, gives unique touch to his character to Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm, all giving good performances and fit their roles very good, except Heather Graham. I must admit her acting wasn't so convincing, it's very hard to believe her character is a prostitute (but not because of her charming performance).There are few explicit scenes but directors mostly rely on formula "things you don't see makes you even more scared when left to your imagination", although I wouldn't recommend this film to children or those with really weak stomach. Without those scenes, I think, film would loose some of its "creepiness", and does not leave you with feeling directors put it there just so the film would be described as horror.For all those who fancy mysteries and don't mind few harsh scenes, go ahead, From Hell is more than decent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an adaptation of a graphic novel which itself was loosely based on the Jack the Ripper crime spree which took place in late 19th century London. Production values are quite high; it does a wonderful job of attempting to recreate the feel of both the place and era. The acting likewise is above par, with solid performances by a gifted cast. Because of the subject, the movie is filmed almost entirely at night, ala The Crow or Darkman, which may be slightly disturbing to some.The movie encompasses conflict on many levels, which in itself is a valid description of Victorian England. Perhaps that's why it succeeds, by not getting bogged down into the somewhat gruesome basic plot-line. The gore itself is held to a minimum and the movie simultaneously goes on to explore many aspects of the class relationships of the time, while never getting far afield of the story. All in all, a pretty cute movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extravagantly Dark Grand Guignol Period Graphic Novel Adaptation, Unrestrained By Any Particular Target Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Jack the Ripper, working in the depraved and underprivileged Whitechapel district of London in 1888, shocking even by any Whitechapel benchmark of the time, has been feed for myriad movies and books, both fiction and non, and even recurring news that the case has been closed have not satisfied our curiosity. This anamorphically shot Victorian- era serial killer drama is a vivid, atmospheric work by the talented Hughes Brothers, who certainly made quite a departure from their prior string of films which included Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp.Though maybe not quite as enthralling in this as Ian Holm, Johnny Depp is creative and becoming as an opium-addicted widowed inspector whose drug-induced dreams generate clairvoyant insights into investigations. The resonance of Sherlock Holmes, another fan of the pipe, is instantly recognizable, and Al and Allen Hughes's drastic departure from 'hood tragedies provides its hero with a pushy assistant in played by Robbie Coltraine, a policeman sent to heave Depp out of the opium dens and jog his memory of his duty.Drawing a fairly dark performance even from Heather Graham, this movie is murky, dank and exhilaratingly so. The movie almost feels devious or illicit. There's a remarkable shot that begins with the city of London, cranks down past towers and trains, and plummets into a cavernous cellar where a Masonic group is sitting in judgment of one of its affiliates. You are stricken with the conception of the vigorous physical evolution of the historical metropolitan area, and the underground mechanisms of the Establishment. In an era when social morals were severe and pitiless, mischief behind closed doors was a flourishing, hot-blooded activity. Countless, maybe all, wealthy and respectable men took part in secret sin.The Hughes Brothers dive headlong into this universe, so far from their native roots and previous subject matter, embellishing and invigorating everything they depict. Their source material is graphic novel by Alan Moore, and some of their extravagant black-and-red cinematography feels influenced by modern comic book illustration, with its angry slants and angles and overstated vantage points. The production design targets garish settings, dripping wet color schemes, bottomless shadows, all painting a lavish picture of an 1880s world of subterranean corners and locales protected by the utmost evil of power and corruption.Watching the movie, I am astounded by how reliably it takes you surprise. Its charm is that it doesn't seem to cater to any particular target audience. Its comic book origins may suggest a younger male audience, but its history, as well as its use of drama much more than violence, doesn't seem made for the same folks, though its gushing blood and, literally, guts, certainly do. It is its own beast, perhaps more in the tradition of Hush?Hush, Sweet Charlotte with a touch of surreality about a side view of an utterly nasty society, dishonored with a trickle- down effect of debauchery and ruthless self-preservation.</fullReview>

This story of Jack the Ripper is different in many ways because it involves an Inspector Frederick Abberline, (Johnny Depp) who is in charge of the investigation of the Ripper and centers his attention to four London prostitutes who are being eliminated by the cruel knife of the Ripper. Mary Kelley, (Heather Graham) is one of these prostitutes and the Inspector Abberline begins to fall in love with her and does everything he can to protect her. You will never be able to figure out who the Ripper is until almost the very end of this film and the ending could never be any better.

		<fullReview>The real Jack the Ripper case is mystery enough, add in some intrigue and conspiracies and it makes for a great story. The film does a great job of transporting you to Victorian London; everything from the clothes and buildings to the attitudes of "non-civilized peoples" really set the mood. There were a few problems; Heather Graham always appears to have just stepped out of the shower. For being a common street prostitute, she is remarkably clean and tidy. Her accent seems to come and go at some points as well. Johnny Depp does a good job as the conflicted inspector and Robbie Coltrane is as usual perfect (of course he didn't have to pretend to be English). Ian Holm also was very good.Spoilers:As for the plot line, it keeps you involved. There are enough misdirections so that you're suspecting the wrong people through most of the film. The idea that the Jack the Ripper was involved in a Masonic plot to protect the Royal line was a bit far-fetched though. Also, at one point, Ian Holm says he can no longer practice medicine because of a medical condition yet he states that the Ripper would have to have a steady hand...now perhaps the doctor was able to have steady hands by taking absinthe and laudanum.Overall, it was pretty good. It's worth your time to watch. There's some nudity and sexual content as well as a lot of violence (though it is done in short bits so you know what is happening but don't actually see it).</fullReview>

But with all these small details, such as his use of absinthe and opium, just small details, all those pieces just completes the movie as whole. It makes it all slightly more real, no one is perfect and Depp always succeeds in playing those roles - especially when it comes to roles of users on illegal substances.

I found this to be a very good movie. Despite I found the acting quite lame, I must say I loved the rest. The screenplay is good, even though it is not accurate, the sets and costumes really good, but what really stands out abut this film is definitely the dark and wacky cinematography and the amazing edition. This film is very good, as it presents another hypothesis about who was indeed Jack the reaper.***SOME SPOILERS AHEAD.*** With Johnny Depp and Heather Grahm, this film narrates the story of a detective (Depp) that is after the serial killing and is trying to catch the responsible (Jack the ripper). He ten meets with a prostitute (Grahm), which is trying to survive with her friends a life of prostitution, with two main dangers, Jack the ripper is on the loose, and she is being chased by an angry pimp. Together they track ad investigate the story of the British royalty, finding out, it is corrupt and it hides many secrets. Even though this film is not great, it is very good. Being drama and horror (gore) movie, this film is definitely good. 8.26/10.00</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hellishly good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided the other day that i wanted to see a film so, i ambled into my local Blockies and browsed for something i hadn't seen. My basic guideline, however, was it needed to have Johnny Depp in it. I adore him! He is a fantastic actor and i knew any film that i chose that had him in it would be worth while. Boy was I right. there it was sitting on the bottom shelf tucked behind classics like the Abyss and Lock Stock but i thought, Meh, what the hell I'll give it a try, i didn't even know what it was about.Now normally i hate horror movies but this was so good. The story line though loosely based on the history involving Jack the Rippper was very engaging and had twists and turns in it that i had not expected, the only way i figured out who the killer was was the fact that the actor has a very distinct voice, apart from that i was guessing until the end. Sometimes acting left a lot to be desired, it was quite like a school play in some parts where the actors were just hanging around to say their lines there was no real feeling in it and i feel that Heather Graham could have been put to better use. Even though she is good actress i didn't feel that she worked in this film. However the pairing of Robby Coltrane and JD was inspired they worked very well off of each other and made the film that much more worth while. JD seems to be a chameleon when it comes to parts, he just becomes that person and his Cockney was spot on. Johnny Depp will forever be my favorite. To end, I recommend this to anyone who likes movies that are unpredictable.Love from Hell</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another rendition of Jack the Ripper's story but unlike some of the others, this is one that is very well done. With Depp as the interesting and intense police detective on the tracks of Jack himself.Highly stylized and brutally gruesome at times, this is an interesting look at what life may have been like with Jack on the loose. Depp once again pulls off a bizzare, yet likable man and Graham is great at portraying a streetwalker of the day. The sets and cinematography are also very good in this movie, adding a dark, stark look at the streets of London, adding to the feel of the movie.An entertaining if at times scary movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling Cinema, but is it art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hughes Brothers version of the Jack The Ripper story is compelling cinema. From the opening credits to the blood red clouds hanging over the city a strong sense of doom prevails and pulls us in. It's tough to turn away from the screen thanks to the stylized Victorian England look and dark, eerie streets, not to mention the well-known mystery of the Ripper, himself! I own this movie on DVD and have watched it a couple of times, but recently I saw it on Cable and I was still pulled right in. Is it Johnny Depp's performance that pulls me in? No. Is it the fresh-faced look of Heather Graham as a low-rent prostitute? No. I watch this movie for two reasons: one the story of Jack the Ripper is always intriguing; and two I love the way the Hughes brothers made everything sooooo dark! To begin with, the story is very dark and gruesome so the heavily shadowed scenes, the damp, gloomy, streets, and the dimly lit rooms all add to further the murky ambience of the story. There are brief moments in some scenes where everything is so black that the viewer has to strain to see and guess what is going on. This isn't cheap film making, this is powerful direction that is seldom attempted in movies today. While the violence is there, at the same time, it's not there. We see a shiny knife blade, a slash and we hear the rip of the skin and then we see blood, but with the exception of one very visual murder, we don't really see the victims get cut. The Hughes brothers take a risk with this movie. In a typical serial killer movie we would see the knife cut into the victim. We would see organs ripped out and limbs chopped off, but this movie leaves much of the actual violence to our imagination. Don't get me wrong, there's enough blood and gore in this to cause some to lose their lunch. But truth be known (and the Hughes brothers understand this) the viewer's imagination is usually stronger than any visual that can be put into a scene. That's the magic of this film. The Hughes brothers focus on the drama, the conspiracy and the character interaction more than they do the violence of the story. In 1888 Jack the Ripper brutally murdered five prostitutes, but that's only half the story according to this movie. Many theories have been suggested as to the identity of the Ripper over the years. The story provides numerous Ripper suspects from a villainous and slimy gang member all the way up to Prince Albert; thus covering most of the typical Ripper candidates that have ever been mentioned. `From Hell' promotes a theory on the Ripper story that includes the Masons, the Royal family and a police cover up. Overall, we focus more on Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) and a band of prostitutes who appear to be the Ripper's targets than the actual murders themselves. Johnny Depp is a little too handsome and young looking to be the over-worked, (in this movie ? opium/laudanum user and clairvoyant) career constable Inspector Abberline. Though I like Depp as an actor, it seems to me that he typically adds a certain modern feel to his roles (Chocolat and Pirates of the Caribbean are perfect examples of this). Heather Graham dresses the part of a prostitute, but otherwise, she acts and looks more like a rough and edgy Mary Poppins. Her stunning red hair is nearly a character in itself. The romance that blooms in the story is a bit forced, but it does create an interesting-albeit purely fictional-subplot. The surrounding actors, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, and Ian Richardson are all excellent choices whose presence adds to the style and richness of the film. The Hughes Brothers have shown their style and talent in every film they've made (Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp), but this movie takes their abilities to the next level. From strange camera angles, and the effective use of color that separates the slums from the upper class world, to dreary lighting, and the period costumes and settings the Hughes brothers provide a visual feast for the viewer to devour. While the story, based on the graphic novel `From Hell', is a bit contrived at times, the viewer cannot pull away. The characters and the fast pacing of the film will keep most viewers from noticing miscast actors and fictionalized events. Is it art? No. Is it good film making. Yes. This is a movie that should be seen. Just don't see it alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The way I like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never heard of Jack The Ripper, until I saw this movie. I expected a romanticized story, where in the end the two main characters end up like lovers and where the bad guy ends up dead, but I was wrong. The movie starts with a couple of prostitute's, looking for customers. One of them is Mary Kelly, played by Heater Graham,who walked in a lonely and dark street and get hold by one of the Nichols-clan. They want a pound a week from every prostitute, but the prostitute's can't pay some much money. One by one the prostitute's get killed with a knife. Than Johnny Depp comes on stage. He playes Abberline, a goodlooking police inspector who solves crimes by getting stoned. When he smokes opium, he sees images I only saw in a movie where the main character has Alzheimer (in "De Zaak Alzheimer"). But with these images Abberline can predict the future. When you see the movie twice or even more, you'll see that the killer Abberline is looking for, Jack The Ripper, is filmed in the beginning already. I always thought that Jack The Ripper was a cruel and lonely man, but in the beginning of "From Hell" he's friendly and he even wants to help Abberline with his investigation.I've now seen the movie three times and still like it. It's suprising and exciting and it has a crazy end, were good guy dies...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I saw this movie right when it came out on video which was a couple of years ago (maybe only one), and I remember turning it off after the first thirty minutes, 'cause I thought it was really boring. However, I watched it again today all the way through and really enjoyed it. As bloody as some might think it is, it's really not that bad and I thought it portrayed the 1800s really well.Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual and you never think of him as Johnny Depp but as the role he's playing. I was surprised by Heather Grahamm just because she's usually playing the ditzy blond, but she was very believable and good in this role.Jack The Ripper did a fine job, and I'm sure the script stayed true to the book (although I have not yet read it.).I give the film an 8 out of 10 (10 being the highest). I enjoyed it quite a great deal, but it wasn't the best 'bloody' movie I've ever seen. Get it?And that's my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of From Hell, WARNING: contains spoilers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hell is a great film; it has a cast of sensational actors and really brings to life the legend of jack the ripper. Johnny Depp plays Fred Abberline, an opium addicted police inspector, while Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly. The two work well together and the romantic twist adds a nice touch to the movie. However, some of the other 'unfortunates' can seem a little over-the-top sometimes.If you're not in to blood and guts the film is still enjoyable to watch as you don't see very much, but if you are there are plenty of clever sound effects to help your imagination! However, there is a lot of the old 'jump out of the dark' effect in this, so rather than being really scary its more a case of constantly jumping out of you skin.One of the best things about the film is the amazing sets and costumes that really bring to life Victorian London, and the way that the camera moves around in the dark alleys to make you feel like a part of the film. credit for that has to go to the set designers; Jana Chovancova and David Baxa, and to the costume illustrator Richard Gray, as well as all of the rest of the crew who done such a fine job on the movie.The part of jack the ripper is well played and if you like a film that keeps you guessing then this is one for you! I'm a sucker for happy endings so this film loses point on that feature, because even though jack the ripper is caught &amp; punished, i would have liked the inspector to follow Mary Kelly back to her home and raise baby Alice together,but that would have been too much of a soppy ending for a horror film.over all i would give From Hell a 9/10, and i recommend that you go and watch it to see just what a good film it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its All In The Wrist Action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest murder mysteries of all time, a timeless whodunit, necessitates the big screen interpretation thereof to be of high caliber. ?From Hell' is certainly well done and most interesting to watch. When the subject matter is so well known and it's history has been meticulously pieced together accessible to millions the world over, a significant challenge is presented to the moviemakers. How do you inspire interest in a story that has been heard many times over? One way would be to look for a novel that takes one of the theories and adds unique qualities to the big players of the time through which the story unfolds. Now what you have is a captivating story of interest to those in the know as well. Of course, acquiring the services of a talented cast will be of assistance too. When this is put together with surreal imagery and artistic sets, you have the formula to take up the challenge.The moviemakers do much to exploit the audience perception of the time which is evident from the opening statement that the Ripper sees himself as the one who will be credited with giving birth to the Twentieth century. Although this illustrated the mind ? set of the character that they had chosen for the Ripper, that is, one of a man who had lost all appreciation for humanity for the mastery of his trade, he is an iconic figure of the 19th century and the boldness of his statement serves to accentuate the gravity of his evil presence.Audience perception is largely due to the rise of media at the time which achieved mass production and the story of the murders spread like fire. Whitechapel was in a grip of terror since gruesome details were of the present rather than a stale story. The rest of London read with fearful interest. His will ? o ? the wisp nature and methodical brutality was quickly immortalized and even today new documents are rising to the fore further titillating public interest.The opening sequence reminds one of ?The Crow' where we are shown a cruel, inhospitable part of London where people are expendable commodities and civil society would have nothing to do with them. The blood red sky relayed a message to the audience of the bloodshed that lay ahead. We then descend into the city and witness the degradation in the form of drunkenness and street women being exploited. A problem that some may have is that the characters are not realistic enough since they are too pleasing to the eye. However, we are not dealing with a realistic account, but a movie that must identify with the audiences perception of the times which has been molded by countless movies and novels. The Hughes Brothers would do well not to deviate from this and they did not. The use of this kind of imagery was presumably taken from the graphic novel. Not necessarily a direct excerpt, but its use helped to tie in the world of the graphic novel with that of the big screen. In that sense the movie should appeal to readers of the novel as well as presenting a new fictional interpretation of these events to other members of the audience. Current CGI technology certainly has the ability to enable a transition of this type. As with ?The Crow' the moviemakers have successfully brought to life the pages of the graphic novel.An impression of the medical fraternity of the time was given as being social beings above all others who were specimens for their diagnosis. The scenes with the Elephant man illustrated this. They were devoid of empathy and utilized the tools of the trade to achieve the required ends of the clan. This was the crux of the Ripper's actions and was the object of a few mesmerizing montages. What was noticeable here was that the gore was limited to suggestion and the savage attacks were indicated by the flash of a sharp blade. This was a cinematically acceptable way of capturing these gruesome scenes and most of the movie rides on the ominous presence of the Ripper rather than on the extremities of his crimes.His overbearing presence was also achieved by scenes where we see the back of the Ripper and hear his voice as a hissing, malevolent evil. When we discover his identity and his eyes turn to pitch black, we are given an image of the dark, raging evil entity that resides within. The eyes rather than his actions are used to better describe his nature. This is done again in one of the final scenes where we see him in confinement with milky eyes ? no longer a threat, devoid of means to do anything.The cast was full of notables and all aptly contributed to the movie. Johnny Depp was a good choice for the lead role of Detective Abberline. His natural and genuine sense of empathy was an entertaining stark contrast to that of the Ripper and the members of the clan. He is also a staunch individualist who will do things on inspiration rather than to the book thus fitting snugly into the shell of his character. Ian Holme got the transition from being the physician at the twilight of his career (a harmless old man), to the demonic, twisted Doctor with an evil purpose in the confrontation scene with Depp without hamming it up and was utterly convincing. Depp's sidekick, Robbie Coltrane, is an outstanding character actor and is always memorable. Ian Richardson has a strong penchant for playing powerful people with dark ulterior motives and delivers once more. Heather Graham perhaps did not do enough with her role, but did not pale too badly in comparison to the strong cast.The fear of the stalker who strikes without warning and leaves his gruesome acts for all to see has a special place deep in the sub ? conscious of society. He attacks our sense of security and rekindles our ancient fear of the unknown. Jack The Ripper was such a being and his heinous acts seemed to be not of man, but of an evil entity. Horror will always be a walking ground for the man who got away. Even if they do solve the case, which I doubt, the continued deliberation as to his true identity will continue to inspire future tales of the world's most infamous night stalker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic, intelligent horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FROM HELL (2001)THE GOOD:--I thought the artistic aspects of this film were so fabulous that they should've earned one, if not several, Oscar nominations. The art direction was phenomenal, with brilliant uses of the colours green and red, and mist and shadows frequently used creating a dark, rich atmosphere. The costumes were really well done and recognise the characters' positions nicely. Visually the time period is perfectly portrayed.--"From Hell" is for a serious horror audience, an audience that appreciates a meaty, well-layered story as well as plenty of gore. This movie gradually builds up to revelations and kills instead of shoving them in our face. When we get the gore, it's extremely rewarding, though the story is also a relief, and at the end of the day that's what "From Hell" is all about - the story.--This movie doesn't hold back with the gore and had some great kills. I especially loved the throat slashing, which has to be one of the best throat slashings ever filmed. It looked so real!THE BAD:--I would've liked the film to take more time with the character development. I didn't really know any of the characters as people, and although the performances were excellent, I didn't care for too many of the victims.--The ending has balls and goes for a controversial choice in telling us who Jack the Ripper is. It's a theory and an interesting one, but since the rest of the movie is so truthful to the legend I would've liked to have an ending with Jack the Ripper walking into a red sky, his coat billowing behind him, instead of changing the mystery which was never solved in real life.RATING:8/10 - Artistic, intelligent thriller which dares to be different on several occasions.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Candyman (6/10) The Exorcist (9/10) The Omen (8/10) Scream (9/10) Sleepy Hollow (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark audacious thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes.'From Hell' stars Johnny Depp as police Inspector Fred Abberline investing a series of murders in the Whitechapel area of London. His partner is Sergeant Peter Godley played by Robbie Coltrane. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, an Irish prostitute that helps Abberline with the investigation.Abberline is an opium addict whose dreams provide a clairvoyant insight into his investigations. In fact, the movie opens and ends with Abberline in an opium den. Depp does a great job with this character, showing the viewers that his acting ability improves as he ages. The story has a number of subplots that are interconnected. The Royal family is somewhat involved due to a little problem in their family that could cause a scandal; we see a secret society that is linked to Royalty and the government - even Abberline's superior officer is a part of this group; there is also a secret police described as the Special Branch involved with the plot. To top it all off, an appearance of the 'Elephant Man' makes its way into the movie. All these subplot points make this movie sound like an 'X-Files' story. 'From Hell' is dark and violent, similar to 'Se7en' and '8mm', yet the first three-quarters of the movie is quite stimulating. In my opinion the movie doesn't finish well. The alternative last scene shown on the DVD special features would have been better since it would have been less ambiguous with what happens to Abberline after the case is closed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started off slow and I wondered why I was watching it. Then it got into the action of investigating the Jack the Ripper mystery and, no pun intended, came alive. The movie is loosely based on facts surrounding the Jack the Ripper murders of prostitutes in London. One follows Johnny Depp's role as the inspector investigating those multiple murders as well as his love for one. Once past the first 10 to fifteen minutes, the movie is easy to follow; there are no dull moments. Fine acting by all and well worth the time to view. I rated it an eight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FROM HELL **1/2An investigative opium smoker sets out to solve the case of Jack the Ripper during the late 19th century following a spate of killings of a number of prostitutes. The investigator has one special gift though especially when getting his daily fix of the drug in that he sees premonitions and snapshots of the killings to come, kind of giving him small insights into who the killer may be and where the killings will happen. The movie plunges into some unexpected areas, especially the unravelling of the Freemason's and its part in the jigsaw which the inspector must solve. Friends may not be what they seem in this case. A number of prostitutes, who have been friends for years it seems, try and console each other and pledge to stay together in these dark times. When they slowly get picked off though by someone who the inspector believes to be distinguished (the killer entices the women with grapes, a delicacy) panic and fear sets in. It's an intriguing film in many ways which is also too unconvincing. We get to know the killer a long way before the end, and a lot of the plot isn't relevant. The overall plot can be pieced together with ease though, and there are no real surprises if indeed that is what the film sets out to do. Although the backdrops were quite real for the time, everything seemed to be too organised for this period. The prostitutes were sometimes too clean and neatly primed, and there didn't seem any indication of the great poverty line that was all too evident in London at that time. Depp was okay, Coltrane was very good and Heather Graham was quite believable. But it didn't strike a lasting chord personally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Hell (2001) Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson, Jason Flemyng, Katrin Cartlidge, Terence Harvey, Susan Lynch, D: Albert Hughes, Allen Hughes. Dark, atmospheric Hughes Brothers version of Jack the Ripper's murders and ritualistic dismemberments of London's prostitutes in 1888. Depp plays the police inspector hot on the killer's trail from seeing visions and Graham is an Irish prostitute who tries staying alive with her pay-by-the-hour colleagues. The gritty style of London is brilliantly created and the grisly forensic investigation is interesting, but the theories at the end are problematical. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. Running Time: 137 minutes and rated R for strong violence/gore, sexuality, language and drug content. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I realize this is old news, the story's been done and done, and the Royal family has been implicated by more than a dozen sources in the Ripper run, but I still found this movie highly enjoyable. The depiction of the working class in turn of the century London adequately depicts the use of absinthe, opium, and wanton harlotry; from both angles of the later. I found this movie to be beautifully filmed, creatively directed and written from an inspired angle. And, while I do have a problem with the depiction of London streets as clean, freshly-washed cobblestones, I still thought the rendition of the city was quite remarkable and had great bearing on this almost Burton/Ridley Scott-esquire feature film.This story is believably portrayed by all involved, and is a brilliant introduction to those with little knowledge of the Jack the Ripper story. For those of us who have had some knowledge of this time-honored walking human disease, it was a beautiful and compelling work of art. The costumes and sets were all lavishly done, and the details were beautifully attended, with a care that is rare in the industry, of late.I rate it with an 8.9/10 from... the Fiend :.</fullReview>

The acting was originally why I saw this film, I like Johnny Depp very much and he is very good in this one. I mostly see him in this pretty strange roles and he does them very well. Heather Graham was not bad either but nothing special at all.It is a very entertaining film even if I thought the story was a bit complicated and everything was not perfect.

		<fullReview>I was Ripper enthousiast anyway, but whether you're familiar with the events or not, this film will still grab you. Because it's an 18 (or Restricted Viewing in USA), it can be as graphic as it wants to be, and it is. It's also quite accurate, with small details intact.The acting is excellent, most of all from Graham and Depp, and while they do develop feelings for each other as you expect, the film doesn't turn into a romance story, which would ruin the atmosphere.The writing's good, no matter what anyone else tells you, though saying that I'm your average film-goer and look more at the atmosphere and the gory scenes (not to mention how good looking some of the characters are! lol) than studying the script-writing.As an 18 year old male, From Hell does leave you not speechless as the only movie that did that was Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but thinking about it a lot, and at several points throughout the film, you think of what it'd be like to be in the situation of some of the characters.London in the late 1800s is recreated beautifully, and the music/sound effects, although suited better to the cinema, are faultless.One last thing - the ending is a twist, esp. if you're Ripper enthousiasts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good effort by all of the cast and crew.Although the Jack the Ripper story is well known and well trodden, with numerous books and films so far, this one is a little different, it actually names someone as the ripper, many don't.Not only that, but it names the person who is a lot of experts favourite for the crimes.The title is a bit of a hook, but some thing like "Another Jack the ripper Film" wouldn't really have worked!The film does lend a bit of a human touch to the main players, it is easy to be trapped into focussing on what even today would be horrific crimes, From Hell avoids this well.Johnny Depp gives his usual excellent performance, he has gotten away from the odd ball roles he used to play, and his last few films have been of the highest quality. He really does get better with every film, and is beginning to fall into the class of actor, who, if he is in the film, it will be worth watching, a la Eastwood, Hanks, Ed Harris, Sam Jackson.Robbie Coltrane is.......Robbie Coltrane, not a classical actor by any means, but well worth watching and the film benefits from his presence.The one thing that really stood out was Johnny Depps' Accent. In general, North Americans have a bit of difficulty with British accents, mixing up Scottish and Irish, or Producing a "snobby" upper class English one. Something like the nasal East End of London is a challenge.Depps, in this case was totally first rate, He sounded like a real East Ender to me, a very good effort.In all, a good film, well worth the admittance or rental fee, in fact I might just nip out and buy it for my collection. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An admirable piece of art...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that this is the first film I've seen directed by Allen and Albert Hughes. The twin brothers directed "Menace II Society" and various other street crime dramas. Their latest film, "From Hell" -- starring Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Ian Holm -- is a street drama of a different sort.Set on the streets of London in 1888, "From Hell" focuses on Jack the Ripper, and his infamous serial-murdering spree of innocent prostitutes. Johnny Depp plays Inspector Fred Abberline, who is sent to investigate these most gruesome killings, along with his partner Peter Godley, played by Robbie Coltrane. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, a prostitute suspected of being one of Jack the Ripper's victims, who helps the two detectives search the murderer.In reality, nobody knows for sure who Jack the Ripper was. This is what makes the film so interesting. There are so many people in the movie who are suspected of being a serial killer, and this keeps you guessing until the film reveals the killer's true [fictional] identity. There are often times where you hear the killer's voice, and even times where you're actually seeing the contents in his home. But you never really figure his identity until the story tells you whom.Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, "From Hell" is so well-directed, contains such lavish sets, and great costume design, that you actually believe you're roaming the streets of London during 1888. There are times where the sky is even painted red, possibly to indicate bloodshed, as the film has a lot of that. This is all what helps the picture seem more disturbing."From Hell" is a film in which the characters are likeable, and where you're absolutely disturbed when witnessing prostitutes get their organs torn out. It's actually an incredible experience. The murders are so accurate, the filmmakers even did research on how exactly the corpses were positioned, and where the wounds were. You actually believe the film came from Hell. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mysterious "Who done it ?" that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> This movie is a great mystery/suspense that keeps you guessing who the Ripper is throughout the movie. With his credit in Sleepy Hollow, and now this, Johnny Depp is on his way in following in the footsteps of Peter Cushing. Warning, From Hell does not discriminate in the blood and guts category. However, while watching the movie, viewers should be able to look beyond that and into the "criminology" aspect of the film. The science of this picture clearly demonstrates how crimes of the early centuries were looked upon, processed, investigated and solved. If you are a fan of scientology and criminology you will definitely take an interest in this script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start with the look of this film because that is what lures one into being catapulted into the era when these events took place. Kubrick with "Barry Lydon" really inspired filmmakers to use classic painting as a basis for production design and many of the scenes could be framed as fine art. Johnny Depp turns in another very potent character study and this film is very convincing in its premise which isn't just based on the material credited. There have been many theories that have credence, linking the murders to those portrayed in the film. No matter whether you want to believe it but they way the film is put together (with some peerless editing), you come to believe that the mystery has been solved. A gripping and terrifying film, not for the weak hearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic directing, and a Kubrick like experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost....the Hughes Bros. They are undoubtably the most underrated directors out there. I loved the visuals in this film. The dark alleys, and foggy streets, dark settings and amazing sets and also the method used by the directors to pace this flim was very unique, and gave this film a look unmatched by any other horror movie out there. This film is more than a slasher flick set London during the Victorian era. It contains phenomenal acting by Johnny Depp and Heather Graham who have an unusual chemistry in this movie that works. She was a little too pretty to be an "unfortuante" or prostitute in my mind, but it's only a movie afterall. I thought the suspense faded after the first hour but nevertheless explains the Jack the Ripper case in a comic bookish way that is not based on facts but opinion. There is no real proven story to the Ripper murders, so why not make a movie showing a possible scenario? That is what the Hughes bros. did in From Hell. I reccomend it !! *** 3 stars!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gothic trappings and dreamy visuals try desperately to cover the stench of exploitation in this violent, speculative retelling of the Jack the Ripper incidents. Johnny Depp, who plays the clairvoyant detective on the trail of the murderer, is a wonderfully intuitive actor but has always lacked a certain screen presence/charisma, an attribute that works in his favor in films like Dead Man or Nick of Time but detracts from performances in, say, Blow from last year, films where we need to believe he has the magnetism and deep motivations the script is telling us he has. His ethereality, for lack of a better word, is a mixed bag here, as the murders and intrigue behind the killer's identity far overshadow and out-interest whatever internal conflicts the Depp character carries. On the plus side, the love story, between him and a potentially doomed prostitute(Heather Graham) makes sense and adds needed poignancy to balance out the carnage the directors(Hughes Brothers) are so eager to wallow in. The murders are inventively, brutally shot, and as the camera lingers unsympathetically on the grisly aftermaths the connection is eloquently, methodically made between the polite economic violence of the London elite and the cold brutality of being on the bottom rung. Nifty piece of work there. The fact that the Hughes are good at what they do(exploitation) doesn't get them a pass but it does lead them into some interesting territory almost in spite of themselves. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the Hughes Bros. really have their stuff together in their latest movie, From Hell. When I originally saw the movie at the theaters I gave it a `7'; but not that I have scoped it out on DVD I believe an `8' is more in order for what is surely the new definitive Jack The Ripper movie. The directors (and writers, for that matter) took the least plausible `Ripper Theory' and turned into to something that is very much believable. For what it is worth, as a child, I read up quite a bit on the Whitechapel murders, and although I espouse I different belief in what happened in London in 1888; nevertheless, From Hell, took enough turns to make me second-guess my theory. The imagery in From Hell was top-notch all the way, and while Heather Graham's Irish accent was abysmal (as well as about half of her acting), Johnny Depp was aces, as always. If you ever get a chance to check out the deleted scenes on the DVD release, you will notice that the Hughes Brothers intended the movie to be a bit more seedier then what we saw in the theatrical release. From Hell was pretty dark as it is, nonetheless, I wish they had kept some of the more grittier scenes and thus showed more of the underbelly of 19th Century England. The deleted scenes are fun to watch. For the most part, however, the Hughes Brothers did not pull any punches, and what we see in From Hell really is a parallel to our present day sub-cultures of alcohol, drugs, prostitution, thievery, and basic skullduggery. The Hughes Brothers did their research into the Jack the Ripper mystique more than any other filmmakers to date (and I have seen them all the Ripper movies). Down to the last cobblestone of Mitre Street, and the paint on the buildings-even the way each victim was mutilated, and how they lay in the street-taking every jot and tittle from the original police and forensics reports, this movie makes the grade. I really can't say why I did not give it a higher rating. Something was missing from the flick, but I don't know what. Nevertheless, if you want a good, solid movie, with lots of fiends and villains, history and mystery, you can't go wrong with From Hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, I won't reveal the plot but let me say as much as this: the main theory about the identity of Jack the Ripper and his motifs presented in this movie are not entirely new. In fact the plot is a mishmash of virtually all the known theories in the Jack The Ripper case. So what about the movie itself? Well, I think it's brilliant. The Hughes Brothers seem to have fallen in love with the Victorian London´s eerie atmosphere that you'll find in Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes or Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Dark alleys, thick fog, snobbish gentlemen in top hats and canes, drunkards and whores barking in Cockney, sinister scientists, Inferno-like mental asylums. And the Hughes Brothers (not with out a tongue-in-cheek) exploit those Victorian London cliches brilliantly.Johnny Depp does an excellent job as - grab your socks! - a psychic Cockney speaking opium smoking (Sherlock Holmes somebody?) and Absinth drinking detective who is investigating a series of grisly murders on prostitutes or "unfortunates" as they are referred to. The pace is fast, the plot absolutely non-believable, but perfectly logical, acting top-notch. It's entertaining and exciting all the way to the end. My only objection concerns Heather Graham's prostitute. An able actress but much too beautiful to convince as a poor Gin drinking whore in the slum of London's East End in the 19th century. Not even a pimple on her pretty nose!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack the Ripper Strikes Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Albert and Allen Hughes have given us yet another retelling of the saga of Jack the Ripper. They have created a dark and dreary setting of the White Chapel district of 1888 London in which to tell their story. When the murders begin, Detective Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) is called in. He is an unusual sort who has "visions" while under the influence of opium. In fact we first meet him when his assistant Sgt. Godley (Robbie Coltrane) fetches him out of an opium den. Abberline soon sees a pattern develop in the killings and determines that the killer is systematically murdering a circle of prostitutes for some unknown reason. Among the "ladies" is Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) with whom he eventually falls in love. Abberline seeks help from famous surgeon (Ian Holm) who explains the technical aspects of the murders. Thwarting him for apparent political reasons is his superior (Ian Richardson). There are enough of twists and turns in the plot to hold the viewer's interest. There are also several gruesome and realistic murders, lobotomies and a resolution that make come as a shock to some. Not for the squeamish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where exactly would you catalogue this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had an interest in Jack the Ripper, mostly because the fact that he was never caught could allow my imagination to make all sorts of assumptions. So, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I wasn't very much disappointed. It offered a truly horrible theory on not only who Jack the Ripper was, but why he was murdering the "unfortunates." The historical inconsistencies don't hurt the movie much. If you want the historical truth than go and watch a documentary on Jack the Ripper. The acting is spotty in the cases of Heather Graham and Johnny Depp as are their accents. The rest of the cast is better. I did find Jason Flemyng's character quite a contrast to the others that I've seen him play and if anyone who has watched "Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister" will find Mark Dexter's character quite a change. However, the look and feel of the film is superb! The dark and shadowy corners make one feel that Jack the Ripper could be anywhere. I also liked the look because it portrayed a side of Victorian life that is often overlooked! All in all a good film if you want a creepy night of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hughes Brothers' version of the Ripper myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Albert and Allen Hughes are the men behind the punching debut Menace II Society and the masterpiece Dead Presidents, so I had naturally pretty high expectations on From Hell, a film about the notorious Jack The Ripper. The film is definitely not their masterpiece but it is nice to see that this kind of cinema still exists in Hollywood. It tells the story of violent murders in London of 1888, as unidentified murderer kills prostitutes without any significant reason. A young and sad-faced detective played by Johnny Depp starts to solve the case, and the deeper he gets, the more twists take place..The film looks great with all its fog, smoke and ominous lightning. The film is very dark all the time which is nice and very atmospheric. The presence of pure evil is there all the time. There are at least three unforgettable images and scenes in this film and I leave them for you to spot. All I will say is that the scenes involve red sky, a bridge and eyes over the city... The photography is very great and technically this film is magnificent. Hughes brothers are very talented and I'm glad that they directed this, as now there is enough personal touch in the film, and the film is not just another stupid entertainment flick.The murders are occasionally graphic and disturbing but for most of the time they are shown as flashbacks and with fast editing. The film is still pretty gory so some will find it too offensive, but more offensive is the motivations and the pure wickedness of the Jack. He is definitely like the Devil himself and at one point he even mentions that he lives in Hell. So this is one Hell of a movie! The fast editings and flashbacks is in fact pretty effective and stylistic element, so I think that even more demanding film lovers may like From Hell, too.The love affair between the two protagonists is a little unnecessary but doesn't go too far, fortunately. In the middle part, the film concentrates too much on the affair between these characters and it seems like they forgot the whole Jack! But as a whole, the film manages to deliver the story and not to get tiresome. I am not familiar with the graphic novels this film is based on, so fans of the original material may find (and find) many differences and faults in this film. But after all, From Hell is an okay horror/gothic experience from great directors, and as I mentioned earlier, it is great that these talents still exist among the entertainment oriented big studios.Not a masterpiece but still satisfying and atmospheric film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie, but it missed an awful lot of marks. The cinematography and setting are just dark enough to remain acceptable, but not nearly dark enough for the story. The actors are all pretty good, with the exception of Coltrane and Holme who're terrific. Heather Graham had to act against the dewy-fresh and scrubbed-clean way they costumed her and set her lighting and camera angles, and both she and Depp had to deal with someone telling them to affect ridiculous, not to mention, uneven accents and speech patterns.I don't think the Hughes Bros. were nearly brave or thoughtful enough to take on this project. They took very few risks and missed most of the visual and story characteristics that made the novel great. They ended up turning a very intellectual work into something more of an entertainment, and on the entertainment level, I thought the movie works. Just don't think too hard when you watch it, or expect anything approximating the novel. If that's the underlying message - that the Victorian era ushered in the age of entertainment over intellectual substance - then they came a bit close to making some sort of point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do we finally know who the Ripper is?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most striking point of the film, in the sense of its historical importance, is that we are actually getting the definitive answer who Jack the Ripper is. Since the plot and the script were based on the book that I haven't read, I'm not sure what the attempt of the movie was, regarding this point. Nevertheless, as a classical dark whodunnit thriller, this is definitely a must-see movie. For those who like this type of movies, of course.Heather Graham is a little bit too sophisticated for an East Side ho, but life can be tough sometimes. She gives the movie an incredible balance in the sense that the movie's darkness is absolutely tolerable and appealing. Johnny Depp is definitely one great actor, although I'm not so sure about his English accent. I don't anticipate any Oscars for this movie (maybe adapted scenario?), but this is not how you really want to weigh a movie...So, definitely the movie worth watching with the great plot and very peculiar ending.</fullReview>

Add in a delightfully witty performance from rotund British character actor Robbie Coltrane, some fantastic theories on Jack the Ripper, marvelously imaginative and literate direction from a pair of ghetto-raised black brothers, a wonderful script spun from a graphic comic-book (!), a suitably off-kilter turn by Johnny Depp, conspiracy theories, political intrigue, scantily clad women, cool costumes, a wonderfully bad Irish accent from Heather Graham, some wild dream sequences and low and behold, you have one of the greatest Gothic-horror-gory-murder mysteries ever produced.

		<fullReview>The Hughes brothers have stepped outside their boundaries.....and they made it work!!!!After making some half-way decent movies...(i.e. Dead Presidents, Menace II Society)...the Hughes brothers have seemed to tack or change directions, just a lil' bit. Ok well a lot. Thinking that they would be another african-american set of directors bent on exploiting situations that are kind of unique to the african-american public, this movie has crossed over in all senses of the word. And this was a welcomed change. The movie was refreshing in a grotesque kind of way, the images and camera work was completely dark and delightful. The story line was impeccably unique, seeing how all the previous ripper movies tended to focus on either the victims or the rippers point of view, and to add to that a conspiracy, possibly from the queen using an elite organization to protect her kingdom, definitely put a twist on the already engrossing tale. Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Robbie Coltranes performances were shining, as was all the cast. The movie actually made you feel you were there. I actually think I caught a buzz watching Inspector Abberline chase the dragon. All and all I think the film was excellent, and it just goes to show that excellence is possible when someone completely steps over their boundaries. My complaints....well a couple....the "bodies" of the victims could have been made to look more real. And the showing of actual disemboweled bodies would have made the movie even more engrossing, it appeared that the camera man himself was too scared to look at them!! But despite that, the movie was excellent!!</fullReview>

Johnny Depp delivered a powerful performance too. Heather Graham is not talented but very Hott with red hair and blonde.

The sort of mixed technique used here (blown-up details, split-screens, drawings mixed with live action and all the usual director-cinematographer believing in his visual genius somersets) works beautifully not to show one's gifted, but to tell the story. And the story works, and the fictional (?) explanation of Jack's killings is convincing and somehow amusing. I gather the whole thing derives from a comic strip: it must be a first class strip, and its peculiar way of looking at the world (with a penchant for the gutter), of sketching, cutting and editing it is transferred on the big screen with gusto.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Hell - A great movie for anyone who enjoys a bit of gore and a very creative take on an historical figure ;) I really enjoyed the level of gore included in this movie - it wasn't too little (as to be expected with this particular story) and it wasn't overboard unrealistic - although there was definitely a fair amount :) The character development for Depp's character was quite interesting - I really enjoyed the point of view taken throughout the course of the movie. The 'character' of characters (if you know what I mean) was a bit of a surprise to me. In other words, they did a very good job in keeping the suspense! The creative 'techniques' implemented in the movie (you'll see what I mean :) ) were very cool! I have to comment on the technical aspects (as they are incredibly important to any and every movie) - excellent! The camera work was fantastic, the special effects, and the music.....well, in the viewing of this movie at the theater I went to we had a bit of a "disturbance" in more than one way while watching - the audio stopped working on the film for some reason in the middle for a couple minutes, yet they continued to show the video, but *chills* they played NSYNC music to replace the actual audio blahhhh! The actual part of the movie that I saw, however, receives some of my highest praise - I've always enjoyed the original story of the movie and loved their take on it, but there's almost always room for improvement and the ending for me.....it just didn't add to the movie what it could have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my father and my brother on its second day in theaters. We went there not knowing what the movie was about. All I had heard was that Johnny Depp was in it. The same guy who did such a remarkable job on SLEEPY HOLLOW, which FROM HELL seems to be like in many ways. The first five minutes were a little boring, and since I missed Marilyn Manson's opening song, I had little to hope for. But by the end of the first murder, I thought "Wow! Cool! She's already dead!" After that, the movie just went up hill. It got better and better as it went along. The worst part for me was that in the blackness of the theater, me and my 29 year old brother ended up sitting in a double seat together. And my father (who was lucky and got a single seat) fell asleep twice and was continuously complaining "This movie's too damn gory and violent!" And I bit my tounge to keep myself from exclaiming "Well no sh*t! Its a movie about Jack the Ripper! What do you expect? A nice family movie?" Well, that it is not. It is extremely violent. *POSSIBLE SPOILER* The goriest part is when Jack slashes wide open the throat of one of the victims. When we left the theater, we had to listen to my dad's constant complaining while all I was thinking about was how long it would take for the film to come out on video. I would find out seven months later. Its only April and I still have to wait another month for this movie to come out on May 14. But, I guess its worth it since that's my birthday. But having to wait eight months for one damn movie to come out really sucks! DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE came out in December and it comes out in three days! Now look who's complaining. So, I give this movie 5/5. It was definetly the best horror film of the year 2001.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Hell not a documentary, and also not a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who moan and whine that the movie does not follow the ACTUAL trail of events that Jack The Ripper left behind for us to follow, nobody ever said this was a documentary, and boy it sure isn't. Remember, this is based on a GRAPHIC NOVEL (i.e. A COMIC), not history. That being said, it's not a bad film at all. Johnny Depp is pretty darn good, Ian Holm and the guy from the Brit series Cracker are excellent, the recreation of Vicotiran England is without peer, and the story is passable (though an exact recreation of the Sherlock Holmes Vs. Jack The Ripper movie called "Murder By Decree" starring Christopher Plumber as Holmes. I swear if you ever see it it's the EXACT same story). Graham is indeed miscast here and stands out garishly compared to her fellow prostitutes who actually look the part while she just looks like Felcity Shagwell on a bad hair day. All in all, if you're not expecting much more than to be entertained, I thought it was pretty good and recommend it. I'm even going to buy it on DVD because of it's excellent recreation of Victorian England. MAJOR WARNING!! THIS IS A GRAPHIC FILM AND IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay. Depp is good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is one the few Hollywood stars whose acting talent shines brighter then his celebrity. `From Hell' follows Inspector Abberline - played by Depp - in this twist filled, conspiracy theory loaded quest to identify the infamous serial killer labeled Jack the Ripper. Abberline swallows Depp so completely that you forget Depp actually exists for those two hours. That's the way things should be. That's the reason I go to movies.The supporting cast was great. Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm are consistently strong actors. The sets and costuming were flawless. The script was surprisingly fluidic for a period thriller slash horror. Heather Graham does well to remind us that she was a competent actress in a past life. All in all a good showing.I went looking for seat-of-my-pants horror, but I found a gore-filled, albeit thoughtful, history lesson. Go see it in that frame of mind and you'll walk away smiling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, the Hughes Brothers might seem like an odd choice to direct this exceedingly graphic re-imagining of the Jack the Ripper case: two African Americans whose previous films (`Menace II Society' among them) dealt exclusively with current American social issues. But as the film goes on, you begin to be aware of a sympathy the filmmakers have for the Ripper's downtrodden victims that relates full well to their current concerns. Here, the victims are the desperate prostitutes struggling to survive in a ghetto where they are regularly persecuted and violently shaken down; and the Jews, whom the London police use as scapegoats for the murders in order to divert suspicion from a possible royal plot. The effect is subtle and very effective. There's also a great attention to period detail (everything about nineteenth-century London is presented convincingly--the production design is by Martin Childs who also did `Quills') and the added benefits of another excellent performance from Johnny Depp (perhaps today's most daring actor) and a fine one from Heather Graham. They're aided by a fine supporting cast including Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane and Katrin Cartlidge (from Mike Leigh's ensemble). All in all, this is a distinguished film with its topics compelling and controversial. Be forewarned, though--this is a stomach-churning experience with many disturbing images and definitely not for the squeamish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classy Chiller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes "From Hell" a classy chiller that's 'a cut above' the rest? Well, a decent script and a handful of fine performances certainly helps. What is actually crucial about the script is not that it is particularly Oscar worthy, but that it never jars the viewer from the timezone that the film is supposed to be set in. Several other details about Victorian London are very convincing as well. So, that takes care of the setting, what about the actual mechanics of the story? It definitely held the interest, but I can't help feeling that the whole experience would have been slightly more satisfying had the makers dealt separately with the two stories of the 'inspired copper' and the 'tart with a heart'. Leaving aside such pedantic quibbles as these not actually being faithful renderings of real people, the feeble attempt at creating a romance between the two leads does not work. That said, both are interesting enough to keep the film running smoothly when we encounter them each on their own. It's definitely 'artistic license' to cast an actress as beautiful as Heather Graham as a 19th century English prostitute, but she does OK, without once threatening to steal the thunder of her more established co-stars. Depp is as convincing as usual, proving a reliably intense performer on which to hang the bones of the story. Give the man a part in "Eastenders"! Robbie Coltrane is good as usual, playing advisor to Abberline; and Ian Holm can always be relied upon to give good value. So each member of the cast (whether American or not) seems quite at home in the 'grimy' capital depicted. Much credit though, must also go to directors The Hughes brothers for making this a thoroughly interesting watch. They handle their first foray into horror territory well, suggesting a return may not be out of the question. If you have an idea of what to expect when you sit down to watch, I struggle to see how you could be disappointed. There are minor flaws to be sure, but not enough to really ruin the 'mood'; and it is the skillfully created atmosphere - contributed to by all - which goes a long way towards making "From Hell" one of the best unsettling thrillers to come out in quite a while...</fullReview>

All other casts able to overshape his character, except Heather Graham.Sorry to say, she's more like a lady turn to whore. She tries to act like one, but her appearance is indeed too stunning. Makes you wonder why she rarely have any customer.The whole pictures puts us in our trapmind. we rarely know about this serial killer rather than a myth or a documentary or a fiction.

		<shortDescription>The Hughes are the men That Will not be Blamed for nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film's such as "Kafka" and "Titanic" have deliberately misled audiences into thinking that the film's content is entirely relevant to its title when in fact it is no more than superficially realised inspiration. "From Hell" makes it clear by the opening quote from Jack the Ripper that it in no way even pretends to be an accurate portrayal of the people and events of 1888. It uses the celebrities of the period (such as Queen Victoria and the Elephant Man) and the ripper murders to concoct a story which is a thinly veiled attack on the ruling classes. Some critic on T.V the other week complained about the gore in this film and said he couldn't watch it. Well what did he expect from a film about JACK THE RIPPER? Doesn't the name give some clue to the fact that his modus operandi was not humane suffocation with a pillow?Would I recommend this film? If you are happy with good British actors at their best (Ian Holm and Ian Richardson are faultless, as always) and some imaginative lighting, camerawork and effects then yes. And although Johnny Depp's accent has been criticised I couldn't see a problem with it, though Heather Graham struggles alongside superior talent such as Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharpe. However, I expected "From Hell" to be thrilling, suspenseful, taught and exciting and it is none of these. I expected to care about the protagonist and the victims and I didn't. Above all I expected to be curious about the identity and motives of the murderer and I wasn't. I got the impression that it was beyond the abilities of the writers and directors to fashion these elements into a story worth telling and watching. No doubt they will blame the studio.If you are expecting to see an exciting thriller and a credible Jack the Ripper story (as opposed to a true one - nobody knows or will ever know the real identity of the ripper) then forget about "From Hell" and look out for the 1988 mini-series "Jack the Ripper" starring Michael Caine as Abberline.</fullReview>

Not only is she too pretty and remarkably clean, her acting skills leave much to be desired. The whole romance that ensues between Detective Aberline and Mary is also about as believable as Heather's rather strange accent.However negatives aside, the film is extremely well made and well acted with particular praise to Robbie Coltrane who is fantastic throughout.

		<fullReview>As a younger person only 15 i read the reviews yestarday from all the older viewers, and recieving my copy on VCD on friday night i thought it would be good to view the film and put a younger persons view towards it.The film i thought is NOT really a horror, but maybe more of a thriller, non the less it is very well made and also very well acted by Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. Also the co stars Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm.Many people said that in the film they all guessed Jack from the start and i also guessed from early on, BUT they would be lying if they did not admit they were thrown off the killer on numerous occasions.I have read to ripper books in the last 6 months 'The Diary of Jack the Ripper' and The Diary of Jack the Ripper the concluding chapter'. I have also read Jack the Ripper in the very popular Murder in Mind series. From reading these books i am very convinced who the Ripper is and even though the person who i suspect is the ripper does not appear at all in the film, it is still very entertaining to watch.A very big downfall this film might have is that if you have little or no knowledge of Jack the Ripper you will fall for this story hook, line and sinker, you must not be fooled. I thought the film was good and had a decent twist at the end. Unfortunately there was a few hollywood-esque parts that are pretty hard to imagine actually happening in the 1890's.This film can work on 2 levels. You can go to it wanting to see a dramatic thriller with no intention of taking it seriously, or you can go and see it to find out if it builds on evidence and to find a conclusion. I think the film is designed more for entertainment than fact. I feel that you need a certain degree of intelligence to understand the film and it is only to be watched when you are prepared to concentrate and follow the story.I stayed glued to my widescreen television and only got a little confused at the end but once i thought about it it wasn't to hard. I would not recommend this film to a hardcore horror fan but more to a thriller fan. This film can make your imagination run wild if your not careful but i found it entertaining.Overall i give 'From Hell' 7.5/10How to improve would be to keep it more factual and maybe stick to nobody discovering the ripper in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Hughes Bros. film opens upon a nightmarish London - a sort of Victorian Gotham in this - awash amidst a tide of prostitutes and sleaze. At times, however, the movie seems almost on the point of drowning amidst 19th century cliché. I was half-expecting to see a few child chimney sweeps, Count Dracula sloping past or a farmer tolling a bell and shouting 'Wives for sale!' to complete the somewhat overblown dystopian portraitUltimately 'From Hell' is passable entertainment but falls dramatically short of classic status. The underlying conspiracy theory: that the Whitechapel murders were a grandiose conspiracy concocted (I simplify) by a combination of Queen Victoria, the Freemasons and the Elephant Man takes some swallowing as does Heather Graham's cockney accent which makes her sound like the missing link between Dick Van Dyke and the dodgy Australian guys who used to play Daphne Moon's 'English' boyfriends on Frasier.That said, hers is not a bad performance and there is good acting aplenty to be seen here notably Ian Richardson as a particularly moronic bastion of the Mafia of the Mediocre, Coltrane as a Victorian Cracker and Depp himself who is as decent as always as the junkie. His accent is actually pretty spot on (speaking as a limey myself) though as some have noted a bit 'below stairs' for a middle class officer of the law.Adapted from the 'graphic novel' written by the Great Bearded Ayatollah of British comics Alan Moore, 'From Hell' is ultimately something of a disappointment. Despite a French cameo UK TV audiences will recognise, it all ends fairly corny and I left feeling I'd learnt nothing reliable about the Ripper case. But until Halo Jones, V for Vendetta or D.R. and Quinch hit the silver screen (unlikely) Moore fans will just have to make the most of this decidedly average picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, from the outset, I found it very hard to adjust to this film's rhythm and style, but after a good half hour I was settled and in for a great ride. The Hughes brothers have created a very dark, bleak, infested London here. It is shockingly realistic. Almost immediately, the film offers many suspects as to who the real Jack the Ripper might be. Not trying to sound clever here, but, I knew who the killer was very early on, as I also believe, after many conversations with people, that Jack the Ripper was indeed who this film makes him out to be! And the motive? Ah, the motive is pure gold! I hadn't thought of it like that before, but my God, it makes every bit of sense!London looks like some kind of ghetto here, and the mood is set for a thriller that will indeed shock many of it's viewers. The brothers do very well not to completely step into the 'slasher' genre - thank God! But the murders, or what we see of them , are very realistic.Johnny Depp, always a favourite actor of mine, does well in his role as a detective who is fighting, well not really, coming to terms with really, his addiction to opium. Poor sod. As far as performance goes, he is solid, but his accent does, at times, waver between cockney and Australian, but he stays with it, and we believe his performance. Heather Graham on the other hand, is slightly less convincing as Mary Kelly, one of the five prostitutes who have information that is worth their lives. Irish is she? Whatever you say guv'nor. Beautiful though!The story, if your not concentrating, is kinda complex. You don't need a degree in Ripperology to 'get' this film though, it's a stand alone depiction of one of many theories that surround the Ripper murders. It's gruesome to think that this actually went on.At one point though, I was so caught up in the film, that I forgot the theory that I had clutched to throughout and created a new one to coincide with the film's narrative...Johnny Depp's 'visions' might not have been visions, it could have been him that committed the murders, in an opium induced state. At the time it made sense, and it still does now, it was a 'Fight Club' type twist that I had conceived. Interesting though!The supporting cast are great, Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane do remarkably well in their roles respectively.The ending is welcome. It makes a change from the Hollywood ending's that are churned out nowadays. This film didn't live upto my expectations though, but it didn't dissapoint on the whole.7/10Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a big fan of the horrer genre at all basically becuase most are bad and the fact is I don't get scared by what happens in movies. I don't mind mystery chillers or the more pyschological horrer like this film, the sort of film that substitutes attractive, screaming, 18 year old girls with clearly visible nipples(Rose Mcgowen, Scream) for a developing plot and atmospheric build up. I particularly find little enjoyment from the slasher genre especially teen slashers. Supposed classics like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on elm street I think are so overated. The first Scream I found good though but still over-rated. Anyway this film is a horrer mystery that builds up atmospheric tension and neat plot twists and developments. The lighting and sets in this movie are fantastic. The cast are made up of a host of British thespiens and of course the two hollywood film stars Johnny Depp and the gorgeous Heather Graham. Of course Depp and Graham are there purely to sell the film ahead of their acting talents which are considerable. Johnny Depp in the last three years has stared in three excellent horrer flicks of various styles, this, Sleepy Hollow and the Ninth Gate. All with him featuring a different style character with a different accent. Depp has proven himself as a brilliant character actor. In "From Hell" he stars as a detective who has visions and is a drug addict. He is on the case of Jack the Ripper with the help of the equally good Robbie Coltrane. The Ripper is killing prostitutes and has targeted five working girls in particular for his ritualistic murders. They include Grahams characters as well as Lesley Sharp and Annabelle Apison as two of the other Whores, the remaining two I know by face from other films but cannot think of their names. The film is very effective, it has its tense moments and towards the end of the film we get more gore as the ripper starts to rampage. Both the American leads do very good cockney accents as do the British luvvies. As for the plot well it nears the point of losing the audience with plot twists and conspiracy theories but the big twists of the film are generally surprising. I was sitting in my seat and half an hour in I thought I'd worked it out, I was well proud of myself and had a grin like a cheshire cat until the Rippers identity was made clear and frankly I was way off. Some moments are quite obvious but that is the case of any movie in history. Overall this was a very good chiller, the story was good and the plot twists were also surpising. I loved the recreation of 19th century London and the lighting effects the film really takes you to another time and place (unless your from london then its just another time). Although the film is good it is one of those that is rather forgettable, I won't remember much in a few weeks except for the plot twist. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>_CONTAINS SPOILERS_ From Hell is based on (but not fully faithful to) the murders of Jack the Ripper, a serial killer who lived in 19th century London. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are the leads (as Inspector Abbeline, the man in charge of solving the case, and Mary Kelly, the tart with a heart). This is one thing that always annoys me about American movies set outside of America: they always feel the need to cast someone American in the lead role, no matter how appalling their accent is. After seeing plenty of good films spoiled by accents (Ordinary Decent Criminal comes to mind) i was worried about this one, and my fears were half justified. While the accents aren't bad, they still have a hint of fakeness about them. This is almost made worse by the decision to cast decent British actors too, such as Robbie Coltraine as Depp's sarcastic helper. I suppose I should just be thankful they didn't try to get Heather Graham to put on a traditional Irish accent. However, despite this fault, it is a brilliant movie. The leads aren't too bad when they're not speaking, and the rest of the cast are excellent. The directing and camera work is stylish, for example a blood-red sunset is shown between two of the scenes, and Depp's visions are suitably hazy and unclear. The film is gory in the extreme, but not for the sake of it. It is showing the horror of the Ripper's crimes, and the brutality within it all. The picture of 19th century London is very realistic (the poor treatment of the whores, the old boy attitude of the chief of police claiming "it couldn't be an educated man, it must have been a butcher, a foreigner or a Jew" &amp; the general dirt, grime and seediness of it all). The plot is dotted with holes and the ending is a bit hard to swallow (the concept that there is an entirely separate line to the English crown living somewhere in Ireland is possible, but very unlikely). However, the film achieves its goal, creating a real sense of fear as Jack lures his victims in, then viciously kills them. I would recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach, tell them to ignore the plot holes and enjoy an atmospheric horror film. Score: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations were high for this and early word suggested better. The fake `Cockney' accents were so distracting it became difficult to involve yourself with, or care about the central characters. I was unpleasantly reminded of the `Dick Van Dyke' Mary Poppins school of acting where all Londoners seem to come from Australia via Peckham via Texas. However special mention should go to Ian Holm who was absolute genius (as usual) and also to Robbie Coltraine who skillfully managed to make one of the few interesting characters out of a fairly un-pivotal part. But aside from these two, overall the film was a bit dull with plot holes and un-settled questions everywhere and it was also the very first time I have not been totally convinced by Johnny Depp in a film. The whole film felt like it was about to step into a higher gear but regretfully never found it, even towards the end. There have already been more intriguing `conspiracy' Ripper films and TV adaptions, so to see these very gifted film makers turn in something so empty was a bitter disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A far-fetched but stylish 'Hell'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hell turns the mystery of Jack the Ripper, that late 19th century murderer of prostitutes, into a double political and religious conspiracy. A bit too far-fetched because this pseudo-conspiracy includes the British royal family and a fanatic Masonic ?sect'. Nevertheless, the movie does a fine job at hinting to the ridiculousness of religious and ethnic discrimination, and it succeeds in portraying the oppression of low-class women.Johnny Depp returns as the serious investigator (as last seen in Sleepy Hollow, notice the similarities?); he portrays Inspector Abberline, who follows his intuition and visions to solve his cases, and is appointed to solve this particular mystery. Depp's performance is genuine because he obviously takes his role very seriously. Abberline is clever, melancholic, psychoanalytical, clairvoyant, and, above all as opposed to his superiors, moral, even human. He is troubled of course, having lost his family in tragic circumstances, and is addicted to opium and laudanum, which aid him in his ?visions'. In the end, he sacrifices his relationship with Mary Kelly (and consequently his only chance for happiness) out of fear for her safety. An epic 'hero', more or less.The presence of his assistant (Robbie Coltrane, Hagrid in Harry Potter) is fortunate. I say fortunate because his character prevents the movie from taking itself too seriously. His sarcasm is tinted with genuine compassion towards the murderer's victims and a respectful affection towards Abberline. Coltrane gives a truly fine performance there, though it doesn't compare to Ian Holm's.Ian Holm (Bilbo in The Fellowship of the Ring) plays a double-role in the movie, and the transition from the poised physician to the devilish fanatic was remarkably done in terms of facial expression, voice tone, elocution, and, symbolically, size and makeup. In its own way, this movie is expressionistic. The prostitutes, or ?unfortunates' as they would rather call them, look and sound exactly as they're supposed to. They are worn-out, cynical, foulmouthed, but, in their own way, they look after each other. The odd one out here is the female lead, Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham (argh!). She is too clean, too pure, and too elegant to be the companion of the other women. She is supposed to be of Irish decent, and naturally, the filmmakers made her a red-head. And a flamboyant one at that, with obviously dyed hair. Her so-called Irish accent sounds as convincing as my Swahili. If you should ever want to cast Heather Graham for your film, make sure you never show a close-up of her face; she's got the most inexpressive pair of painted ping-pong balls, er, eyes, I've ever seen. And now for the visuals: the only description that would fit here is ?psychedelic'. London has never looked foggier, with a smoky red sky and overall reddish ambiance. Abberline's visions of the murders are somewhat unsettling and gory (blood, flies on body parts, hazy photography etc...), but it's never cheap horror. Even the murder scenes are cleverly ?choreographed' so that we experience the act more through sound and feel rather than explicit violence. The whole mood of the movie is more graphically melancholic and dark than cheap and gory, really.Though not quite ?from hell', it's the survival of the fittest in the gloomy streets of Victorian London, where corruption rules till the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, the darkness... oh, the pain...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From Hell" is not a pleasant film. I tried to watch it with my usual shields against the "horror movie stuff" fully deployed - it didn't help. It got to me. To the very core of my fears and my deepest emotions. And that's it's success: It is effective.First thing about "From Hell": Don't let it get you off guard - you'll feel sorry about it later, when the film is over and the lights are on. Frightening? Yes, of course. But not in the way acomplished by other films of the recent philmography ("The Others", come in mind, filled with cheap ghost tricks and "door opens - Booo!" frauds - despite the very interesting general theme and the great performance of Nicole Kidman).No, it is more... subtle. The real terror is not the murders, the way they are being carried out, the beating heart in the hand of Jack or the (scarce, anyway) gore. Nope. The real terror is the fact that you can't escape. That malady is not a state of mind, it's a whole world.The fact that for one to find hope, another must vanish. The fact that there is no action without reaction.Dep delivers another excellent performance - might be his best so far. Despite the baby-face. The Hughes brothers do a great work with the light on their star - they use the light (or the absence of it) to wake inner feelings and make more point than other directors make with the whole film.The semi-happy end is really a work of art (I haven't seen the comix so I don't know if it is taken from there or is genuine). And it only drags the helpless viewer even deeper into the abyss of this world.Yes, it is not a *happy* movie. It ain't a "who done it" movie either - the basic storyline is used as the mean, not the goal. And it certainly ain't no *horror* movie - there are no ghosts, no supernatural beings, not walking dead, no gross details, very little gore, no detailed autopsies, no cataclysmic events.I think I should give out an advice to those not seen "From Hell" yet: Do not go to watch a "horror movie". Or a thriller. Or whatever. Prepare yourself for a different experience.It is a great movie and one I am happy to have seen. And at the same time I am very unhappy. Because I can't let that depressing feeling go away. I can't look at my world as I used to. Thousands of little details capture my attention. Previously innocent moves and words are not innocent any more. The world has a totally different meaning for me now. And four little words are in my mind 24 hours a day:There is no escape</fullReview>

This excellent film recreates a poor Victorian London area: Whitechapel with a detail precision that only a genius good do. The story is known but in this film there is an interesting side story, which is the personality of the commissar, giantly acted by Johnny Depp, and also the prostitutes environment with the Royal complot and the role of the masonry which enhance the interest of this film. The noisy and scary sound track fits just perfect with all the scenes and with the disturbed mind of a "junky" commissar who has "shining" experiences under the opium effect that help to solve the case.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack the Ripper is a perfect story for a film, and the result is quite creepy. Actually a little too creepy. There is some gore and a few really disturbing scenes in this film and it gets a little speculative. I have no idea what the Elephant Man had a cameo for. It seems as The Hughes Brothers are more interested in shocking the audience than to stick to the story. This is only a theory of who The Ripper was, as no one really knows. The film is very stylish, painting 19th Century London blood red. Johnny Depp is solid with his usual melancholy. From Hell is a very good thriller but it could have been stripped down a little, actually adding to the chilliness. Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stylish and Suspenseful Look at the World of Jack the Ripper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of Jack the Ripper is a dreadful place. London of 1888 is grimy, gloomy, and labyrinthine, and the skies are tinted the color of blood. This London is a desolate place, and From Hell doesn't succeed merely as a thriller, but also as an astonishing glimpse of ugly, polluted, and overpopulated London after the initial boom of the Industrial Revolution. From Hell makes an outstanding point by demonstrating the declining morale of the public during the reign of prudish Queen Victoria. The use of trains is an especially great thing; at least two of the murders take place while a locomotive can be heard in the background.Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp: Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow) is the detective put in charge of the case. Along with a deductive mind and a loyal partner (Robbie Coltrane: Goldeneye), Abberline is able to see the murders actually occur while under the influence of opium, his drug of choice. These dream sequences are probably the most poignant and powerful scenes within the entire movie. While unraveling a vast conspiracy involving the throne and the Freemasons, he becomes acquainted with the only good-looking prostitute in London, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham: Bowfinger, Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me), who inevitably becomes the center of an entirely unnecessary romance.What From Hell fails in is becoming too obsessed with the identity of the infamous killer. While the first hour of the film sculpt the anti-industrialist themes and build up a suspenseful thriller, the last half of the movie turns into a predictable, if slightly above-average, murder mystery. Suspense has built up a considerable amount by the third act, and the easiest route is taken when the elaborate scheme is clumsily unveiled by just a small series of dialogues, which leads to an undeservedly short and simple resolution. If only the finale had lived up to its preceding acts and had the filmmakers not have had such an obsessive devotion to unveiling the killer, then From Hell could receive a full-fledged recommendation, and would have undoubtedly would have become known as a masterpiece of the thriller genre. It's a shame it just doesn't live up to its own potential.8/10</fullReview>

In the first five shots of the movie, I couldn't have cared less if the entire premise was completely made up. The shots are unreal and every directing chance the Hughes bros. took, worked. Other than Heather Graham falling in and out of her accent a few times the entire plot worked. The movie gave off a "Silence of the Lambs" feel without having to throw the gore in your face. The sets were unbelievable and I found myself repeatedly perplexed by some of the shots they pulled off.

		<shortDescription>Excellent, weird, hallucinogenic... you'll love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie today in the local theater, and *it* ? *was* ? *AWEsome*!!! Never mind that the whole conspiracy-theory thing was farfetched, or that it was filmed in Prague, Czech Republic (a most beautiful and delightful city, to be sure, but London it ain't). What this movie has going for it ? and what really counts in a movie like this anyway ? is ATMOSPHERE! The whole movie is SO eerie and atmospheric, that you almost feel like you, the viewer, have magically inhaled a few tokes from that ivory opium pipe that you see Abberline puffing on in the opening segment.As has been noted elsewhere, it is hard to pin this movie down. It's not truly a horror story ? though the bloody deeds of Jack the Ripper are indeed horrifying. Nor is it truly a detective story ? though Depp's Inspector Abberline and his sidekick Peter Godley (played by Robbie Coltrane) more than a little resemble the detective duo of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. I guess what you end up with is really more of a dark, DARK hallucinogenic mystery encased in an historical slice-of-life snapshot of the dark underbelly of 19th century London.I liked virtually everything in the movie except for the scenes where Mary Kelly's friend Liz ventured into lesbianism - that to me just seemed stupidly gratuitous (somebody else commented that they felt the same way about the inclusion of the scene with The Elephant Man/John Merrick, but I didn't mind that scene, I thought it only helped contribute to the overall eerie, weird atmosphere of the movie).It's worth commenting that the background score and sound effects are employed to the utmost: if you watch this movie in a modern theater with all that high-tech surround-sound stuff, you will definitely rock, roll, and vibrate!Anyway, this movie can proudly boast of brilliantly executed visuals, set design, sound, weirdness, and just about everything else. I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone who wants to go on a trip... and a strange, strange trip it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleek, Stylish, but at Times Familiar Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You enter a world where the sky is dark, and the streets of cobblestone match. The streets are crawling with late-night walkers and hookers at work. A streak of murder has been striking these prostitutes, with their bodies being slashed and their organs being removed. You have entered the world of "From Hell", a decently crafted thriller about Jack the Ripper.Set in 1888 London, prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) and her friends (also prostitutes, of course) aren't exactly in the best of the times. Their boss is demanding a pay of 4 pounds a week, and in a much bigger problem, a mysterious killer, who the residents merely call Jack the Ripper, is sweeping through the streets of London, slashing specific prostitutes in a pattern. The police force, along with working on the case themselves, decide to call on the help of Detective Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp), an opium-addict who, while under the influence, sees visions of how prostitutes will be murdered by Jack the Ripper...and which prostitute is next (insert suspense music here).This was not your typical hack 'em up, kill everyone, gore and blood all over the place movie. Yes, the movie had lots of gore (this movie is NOT for sensitive stomachs) and lots of blood, but it also contained substance amidst all the killings and violence. Many (too many) thrillers rely on slashing and murder and gore to support the movie fully, without containing a story, but "From Hell" provided a good script, a good and followable story, and...well, the filler needed to make a good movie a good movie.The one thing I would've preferred to be left from the story were the cliche`s. The script contained familiar territory that I've seen before, many times. The best example I can give without spoiling anything is the distinguishing of Mary Kelly from the rest of her prostitute friends. The movie took the tired route of making Mary Kelly prettier, well-kept, wearing makeup, and well-dressed, while her friends...well, looked like poor streetwalkers: no makeup, tattered dresses, etc. I'm tired of movies making the lead girl look more well-bred than her friends, because it seems unrealistic. Why not just make Mary Kelly actually look like a prostitute, and not like a rich, pretty girl who finds herself amongst a bunch of lesser-looking friends? Or if Mary Kelly looks like this, why not make her friends look the same? It might seem more realistic this way.The pacing in the movie was good, but the movie dragged. The movie actually felt like it was two hours long, and that was a little exhausting. Don't think I have a short attention span-I've been able to sit through movies like "Traffic", "Magnolia", and "AI", all of which are longer than "From Hell", and I didn't have any trouble doing so. Those movies didn't feel like their lengths, and "From Hell" did.The acting was good. Johnny Depp delivered a great performance as Detective Abberline, making his character believable. I wouldn't say Oscar-caliber, but performances don't have to be Oscar-worthy to be good. Heather Graham was pretty good too-at times she seemed a little wooden, and I think her character would've been more believable if she seemed more scared about Jack the Ripper. I knew she was concerned, but she sometimes seemed too mello about her life being in danger, like, "Oh, well, Jack the Ripper is sweeping through London and killing my friends, and I may be next...la dee da dee da!"The movie was cinematically brilliant. The murder scenes were well-filmed; one murder was seen as merely darkness with slashes of light being the only thing seen. The best moments cinematically were during Detective Abberline's Opium dreams-you can't even go into description about how great they really were.Overall the movie was very chic and very enjoyable. Take away the cliche`s, and make the movie move quicker, and it would've received those two extra points from me.8/10, B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to London 1888, ladies and gentlemen. What a grand city she is! Everything you could possibly want can be found within her borders. We have the latest and most effective psychological therapy ever discovered ? the prefrontal lobotomy! A tap-tap here, and a tap-tap there, and one more tap-tap on this side and voila! The patient is cured! And, look at how civilized we are ? take this young man, for instance. John Merrick was trapped in the hell of the freak show. But we will civilize him yet! Don't be alarmed by how he looks ? he's not an animal, after all. He is a man! We have gaslight in the streets, and London has no prostitution. Oh, there are some... unfortunates... but pay them no mind. What a time to be alive! Unless you're an unfortunate, of course.The legend of Jack the Ripper is a horse that just won't die. More than 100 years after his crimes, we still don't know who he was, how many he was, what he was or why he was. Oh, sure, we have plenty of suspects and rumors (Lewis `Alice in Wonderland' Carroll, Prince Albert Victor, a conspiracy involving the British Monarchy), but we are no closer to finding out the truth than we were in 1888. Which means that we can still bring it up again and again.From Hell, at least in comic form, has been cited as being probably the closest to the truth as we will ever get. How many comic books can you name that have bibliographies? As far as the movie goes, well, it is plausible.Now, I'm sure we all know at least a little bit about Jack the Ripper. `He' was the first documented serial killer. `He' killed prostitutes in London's East End. `He' didn't do it very nicely. And, `he' got away with it. That's pretty much all anyone knows about `him'. From Hell is a mystery because it has to be, but it's not a whodunit. It also attempts to show what Victorian London was like. It wasn't pretty. The industrial revolution was still new, poverty was rampant, racial tension ran high due to Jewish and Oriental immigrants, the monarchy was not yet a figurehead, and the world was rigidly divided into upper and lower class. Middle class didn't even exist. All of these facts are important to the story.And that story is this: A prostitute has been murdered in London's East End. Brutally, methodically, and a ?trophy' was taken. Enter Inspector Abberline (Depp). Abberline is known for his ?visions', which are aided by the use of opium or laudanum. These visions have helped him solve cases in the past, and his partner, Sgt. Godley (Coltrane), is confident that they can help in this case. As prostitute after prostitute is killed, more clues and patterns emerge. It's obvious that the killer(s) know anatomy very well, and have plenty of money. This would indicate a cultured person. But, no civilized person would do such a thing! Preposterous! Police Commissioner Warren (Ian Richardson) suggests that Abberline concentrate on Jewish butchers, or ferriers. Tradesmen, yes, but a gentleman? Certainly not! Hmmmm.. But, wait! We have some peculiar witnesses ? not to the murder of the first prostitute, but to a rather strange event. An event that seems to involve the Special Branch (think FBI). Mary Kelly (Graham) knows that something strange is going on. The rest of her friends are of the opinion that the press should be told. Mary thinks that this Inspector Abberline might be their best bet ? for the sake of protection. Protection from the Nichols gang ? wanna-be pimps who are demanding protection money. The plot gets deeper and deeper, but manages to stay less confusing than JFK.Visually, the film is effective, if not affective. The comic was done in black and white, but the movie is in color. The opening sequence is good at establishing the squalor and claustrophobia of London's East End, and remains consistent throughout. It's not striving for realism, necessarily. It's not expressionistic, but it is good at evoking the desired mood ? bleak. The violence is well done. It's not subtle, but we are spared seeing what `Jack' actually did.Plot-wise, the movie works. The tension never really reaches a fever pitch, but, we know most of the facts already. We just want to see who did it `this' time. And, we want to know if it will have as happy an ending as it can.From Hell isn't horror, it's not really a mystery, it's not suspense, it's not a costume drama. It's historical fiction, and it's well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this film. I very much enjoyed Sleepy Hollow and Murder By Decree so this one looked like a lock. Depp's bleak protagonist and his sidekick Coltrane worked well but could not rise above the material. A few breaths of the real London of the time-the dosshouse where the women slept against a rope and the Ten Bells tavern(still around today almost as it was then)but the conspiracy angle was handled better in Murder By Decree. I am not saying wait for the rental but most will agree this film was not all it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Hell" is not really a horror movie, though it has some gruesome and disturbing moments, but rather a modern serial-killer movie given an unusual setting, delving into our fascination with the first truly famous serial killer in history.One of the nice things about making a Jack the Ripper movie is that it is a historical story, which lends it a certain gravitas and a built-in interest factor, but since history doesn't know for sure who the guy really was, you get to make up your own ending. "From Hell" seizes on one of the more far-out (and frankly, historically implausible) conspiracy theories surrounding the mysterious stalker of Whitechapel. Still, in Ripper lore there is plenty of "evidence" that can be construed to support just about any theory you can think of, and while the movie takes a few liberties with the historical record, a great many details are rooted in established fact. While I wouldn't view this movie as a conclusive examination of the case, it gives the story enough credibility that it functions quite well as a thriller.The story follows Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp), the detective charged with catching the killer (oddly, they consistently refer to him as "Jack the Ripper", even while the movie acknowledges that the letter bearing that name was probably a fake), while he navigates the seamy alleys of the East End, trying to protect the streetwalkers that seem to attract homicidal wrath (among them Heather Graham, as "Black Mary" Kelly; interesting casting choice, that) and contending with the interference of Scotland Yard's shadowy and muscular Special Branch.One irritating thing about the movie is in the character of Abberline. Understandably, the movie makes him younger and sleeker so he can be played by Johnny Depp (the real-life Abberline was forty-five and married with children while investigating the Ripper case), but it also subscribes to the annoying convention of mythologizing the "profiler". I swear if I see one more psychic detective who gets otherworldly "vibes" about a case, I'm going to hurl my copy of "Journey into Darkness" through the screen. Hollywood seems uncomfortable dealing with profilers for what they are: experienced detectives who are able to detect patterns in a crime and extrapolate what kind of person they are looking for. Isn't that impressive enough? Abberline was, by most accounts, a dedicated and methodical investigator, but here he is a slightly dissolute dope fiend who gets flashes of the future and "sees" the Ripper's future victims while in an absinthe or opium-induced daze. Often, the "psychic detective" thing is used as a cheap springboard for a lazy screenwriter to avoid having to think about how the pieces of a puzzle might fit together; in this movie the "visions" are not only distracting, they're really unnecessary: they reveal little that a sharp guy like Abberline couldn't figure out from available evidence. They must have been interesting to film, though; I guess that's why they're in the movie.Twin directors Albert and Allen Hughes made their mark in the 90s with the acclaimed "Menace II Society", one of the raft of inner-city neo-gangster opuses that were in vogue at the time. It seems the Hugheses made a deliberate attempt to make a movie as different from that as they could, and it would seem a shrewd move. After all, it took John Singleton a couple of movies to escape from the 'hood; and, remember what happened to Matty Rich? Yeah, me neither. Though "From Hell" is a story of another blighted urban landscape, there's not a drive-by in sight. Well, maybe by hansom cab.The Hugheses make good use of the fetid, dire streets of 1880s London (actually, the movie was filmed primarily in the Czech Republic; apparently, London just ain't seedy enough anymore). They play with light in interesting ways, silhouetting the spires of London's palaces and cathedrals against a roiling red sky, suggesting that if we aren't actually in Hell, we're at least in a pretty close suburb with bus service there. The Ripper's hansom cab has twin lanterns that sputter with bilious green light; it looks like a primordial monster slithering through the night, which is a neat visual (useful, too; hansom cabs all look pretty much alike otherwise).The cast is good, although more so in supporting roles than lead ones. Depp is fine, though his accent is weird. Heather Graham is better than I expected her to be, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it wouldn't have been too hard to find a better actress (probably for less money). Ian Holm does well as a retired surgeon who advises Abberline on the investigation, an old man with an infirm arm and a few too many secrets to keep. Also standing out is Robbie Coltrane, as Abberline's loyal, over-literate sergeant. Fans of "The Elephant Man" will take special interest in a certain historical cameo.The movie is well-paced, well-filmed, and delivers the thriller goods in fine style. It doesn't hold up to too much scrutiny, especially among those familiar with the real case, unless they're willing to be good sports. There are a few spots where, eager to fit in as many authentic details as possible, the characters do things that don't make much sense, and the exact motivations for some of the Ripper's actions are not made clear. I suppose you shouldn't expect too much clarity form a movie about an unsolved case. Ripperologists and aspiring forensic historians should not so much suspend their disbelief as zip it in a bag and leave it at the box office for a claim stub; you can pick it up when you leave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really believe that viewing a "making of" for a film can enhance the enjoyment of the actual movie. This is definitely one of those cases. The movie, without knowing anything at all about the history, is very well done. If you like Depp films (Sleepy Hollow, Blow, etc.), you will like this one. It reminds me a lot of Sleepy Hollow if done by the Hughes Bros. It's dark and violent, obviously, with the conditions in the 'ghetto' of London in the late 1800's really done up well. As I said before, though, if you know some of the history and see the making of afterward (I saw the one on HBO) it really enhances the experience. The best thing about the movie is the level of detail. Most of the sets where built from scratch using photos and writings from the period. When you see the movie, you'll realize just how big these sets had to be. Quite impressive for this day and age. All of the killings were portrayed using crime scene analysis and details about how they were done, where they were done and even the position the bodies were found in! Of course, since this is an unsolved crime, there had to be liberties taken with the plot line but I think it was still done very well and could possibly accurate as well. The acting was not the best ever but it did serve it's purpose, it was believable. Overall I'd give the movie a 7.5/10 before seeing the making of special and a 9/10 after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Hell is a gritty and violent thriller revolving around the famed Jack the Ripper murders. The clandestine plot as to who the Ripper actually is probably far removed from the real case, but within the universe this film establishes it fits like a glove. You really don't have any idea who it could be until the last 15 minutes. And none of the red herrings feel like the filmmakers are just pulling your chain.As always, Depp delivers a great character in the mumbling, opium addicted, hallucinating Detective Abberdine. Heather Gramm is mere window dressing as his hooker-girlfriend, but far less annoying here than in most of her performances.The real star of From Hell however has to be the scenery. 19th century London is depicted so convincingly in it's grime and depravity, you'll marvel at its sheer ugliness. Not many films dare to be set in such unwholesome surroundings these days.From Hell says nothing new about the Ripper case, but it has fun dragging you through its reality.</fullReview>

One very good point, from the point of view of someone who's followed the Ripper for a while and toured the sites of the murders- the movie does *not* butcher history (no pun intended). With the exception of the quasi-supernatural bits (which are integral to the plot but don't affect the "history") and the eventual solution (no one knows the real answer, of course), it's all as it happened. But if you know the history and think you know, based on the names, that you know how it will end- boy, are you in for a surprise.'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Hell" is quite a departure for the Hughes Brothers. One almost wouldn't expect something like this from the twins who directed "Menace II Society" and "Dead Presidents." But they did a wonderful job in this examination of the Jack the Ripper murders. The Victorian city of London is presented in its dismal, eerie splendor. Johnny Depp seems to fit in as Inspector Abberline, the latest in his long list of oddball movie roles. And the story is rather well-written, taking an in-depth look at the murders, all the suspects, and thought-provoking theories involving Buckingham Palace scandals and secret societies. This movie may not have solved the mystery of Jack the Ripper once and for all. But it adds to the legacy of a legend that will haunt us all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hughes brothers have again infused social commentary into their innovative filmmaking. The theme is familiar: The affluent turning a blind eye to the impoverished of 19th century British society echoes much about today's world. Like virtually any period film, "From Hell" is intended to reflect something about the present times, demonstrating that no matter how much things change, history repeats itself in different forms."From Hell" deals with social issues in its own way. Normally I'd say that art peddled as entertainment should stay off the soapbox unless it's prepared to be serious. "From Hell" tries to do both and misses most of the time. Still, it's a decent thriller/murder mystery with a definite horror film structure, but still passes as a historical piece.The script is where the film runs into its biggest problems. Foremost of them is that it may take itself too seriously. The slayings are certainly nothing to chuckle about, but some humor would have provided some much-needed balance. They could easily have sacrificed the love story between Abberline (Johnny Depp) and Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), which never finds its feet.Even in the late 19th century, these ritual killings seemed ancient; they were hideous and barbaric, like something out of some long forgotten age, committed by someone whose state of mind should not still exist in a modern society. The killer's savagery woke people up to the enduring possibility of such acts, just when civilization really started to seem civil."From Hell" takes liberties with the truth, following closely to the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. It stays faithful to the details of the murders, based on the actual police and coroner's reports. Mary Kelly's post-mortem for instance, is re-enacted verbatim by the examiner. Kelly's murder was the last and by far the most gruesome. Little is actually shown but it's true that your imagination can come up with far worse images than a make-up effects person can.No one ever figured out for certain who the Ripper was, which affords comic book artists and filmmakers the opportunity to romanticize the character for profit--here done at the expense of the royal family (always an easy target) and the freemasons. But at least these artists offer a reasonable, original revelation of the Ripper's identity that just happens to make good cinema.Grade: B-</fullReview>

Without Depp's strong performance, this movie would have withered away into mediocrity. Unfortunately the movie trudges along at such a slow pace, the viewer is allowed the time to think over and identify the "Ripper's" identity. If the plot hadn't been so slow in developing I would have probably rated the film higher, but as it stands it gets a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Smoky opium dens, sugar-saturated absinthe, bloody red skies,dark alleys shadowed with fog, and silver knife-blades that glintand reflect the light of pure evil? It's 1888, Jack the Ripper is livinghis glory days, and you are right there with him.It's easy to get drawn into this seamy, fascinating world. From Hellis loosely based upon the real events, presented in a beautifullydreamy, surreal fashion. It's the most visually pleasingVictorian-England horror offering since Coppola's version ofDracula, which came out nearly ten years ago. The cinematographer is Peter Deming, a David Lynch favorite (he did2001's Mulholland Drive as well as Lost Highway). He does somevery interesting things with time-lapse styled photography andstop-motion techniques without getting too trick.Directed by The Hughes brothers (their last feature was 1995'sDead Presidents), who supposedly met with everyone from SeanConnery to Brad Pitt to Jude Law before deciding upon JohnnyDepp for the starring role of Inspector Frederick George Abberline.They made the right choice: as usual, Depp seems to immersehimself in the role from diction to demeanor to dress, andwhenever he is on the screen your eyes are on him. Teamed upwith Heather Graham as the ill-fated prostitute Mary Kelly, Deppalmost brings her up to par. Almost. Graham does a fine job, butcompared with the other actors in the film -- Depp, Susan Lynch as'Long Liz' Stride, and Ian Holm as Sir William Gull -- she's miscast.There is nothing about her to ignite the romantic sub-story, and asa consequence that part just doesn't work.Luckily, it doesn't get in the way, either. This movie is not onlyvisually stunning and well-acted, it's very aptly directed. TheHughes Brothers took a risk here, wishing to shrug off their imageof being 'urban' or 'black' filmmakers, and it's paid off. They bring tolife, in short flashes, the legendary curiosities of Victorian life: theadvent of the frontal lobotomy; legal, psychotropic drugs; John "TheElephant Man" Merrick on public display; and the eccentric QueenVictoria with her strange secrets. Like the devil, it's in the details,and The Hughes Brothers have paid attention to all of them.Although the murders were re-created in detail on a set in Prague(and if you've seen the actual crime-scene photos, as I have, youwill appreciate this), they are not as gory as the directors wouldhave liked. Thus challenged, they manage to evoke a feeling ofwhat it must have been like -- from experiencing the brutal killingsand eviscerations themselves, to the aftermath of curious crowdswanting a glimpse of the forlorn, desecrated bodies of thesewomen who once lived -- and it's chilling. Like a red rose gone black at its edges, still smelling sweetly oflife even as it decays, From Hell manages to straddle the fine lineof meshing delicate beauty with bleak death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher, Darren Aronofsky and Quentin Tarantino are all well-known for their intentive and creative visual style. Perhaps, it is time to add the Hughes brothers to this list of impressive visual stylists. Obviously, they already had a gritty realistic film ("Menace II Society") to their credit. "From Hell" is an equally terrific film in terms of camerawork and colors. The 1880 redish skyline of London is as dark, gritty and realistic in this film as any other film I can remember. It is not just the art and set direction which make this production so realistic and interesting; the editing and camera movement is intense and helps glue the viewer's eyes to the screen. Proof of the powerful mise en scene and editing of "From Hell" are in the murder sequences. These scenes are more creative and disturbing, yet gripping than anything in most the horror films made in the last few years. The performances are solid, but not all that memorable in comparison to the overall style of this film. A 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful look at 1888 London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To look at "From Hell" as a slasher or gore film is to miss the forest for the trees. The true value of this film is to gain insight into the ways of life in Victorian London. Few of us can imagine what life was like for the folks that we seeportrayed in this film and if one looks beyond the plot one can learn much. How often have any of us seen what an opium den was like or how the poor had tosleep upright in doss houses or heard what a dank, busy London streetsounded and looked like at night? No, the film wasn't 100% historicallyaccurate, taking liberties with the facts in the Ripper case, but that should be obvious to anyone viewing. Take the investigation with a grain of salt but not what the film has to say about the slice of the human experience it shows you. Further, do not discount the excellent acting that From Hell contains. Anyone who discounted Heather Graham's abilities based on what they saw in The SpyWho Shagged Me needs to eat their words. Admittedly Johnny Depp's facialexpression changed little (even when he was having his drug-induced visions), but Ian Holm always brings his all to any role he fills and Liz Moscrop'sincarnation of Queen Victoria is uncanny. Also, the direction of From Hell nicely complemented the unsettling nature of the material it was portraying. Viewers will feel as if they are a part of the disjointed mind of a serial killer. From Hell transcends being a movie and is more aptly described as anexperience. It passes the test of any good film--that it leaves you thinking and wondering about it long after you leave the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some films that have a certain 'x factor' that lifts them above the ordinary. For some it's a cunning plot (say, Twelve Monkeys), others it's great performances (take Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets). For From Hell it's the casting.The key elements of the production are all competently done - late Victorian London is nicely and darkly reproduced, the plot just about stands up (depending on how bothered you are by the visions experienced by Depp's Inspector) and there are plenty of sound supporting appearances by some talented British actors (Ians Holm and Richardson to name but two).What I really enjoyed about this film was the chemistry in the two principal relationships - Johnny Depp and Heather Graham (who plays one of the group of prostitutes targetted by The Ripper) and Depp and Robbie Coltrane (who plays the Sergeant assisting the Inspector). The relationship that grows between Depp and Graham is believable and the contrast of Coltrane's straight-forward approach with Depp's drug addiction and foresight is nicely played.It's not the best dark thriller ever made (it's certainly not a Horror film), but I'll wager it will be judged better than most everything else launched in Halloween season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Hell is quite the work of art. When the ideas of infusing artinto cinema were produced, From Hell is obviously what wasthought of. But the question is whether From Hell's grandiosebeauty translates into the genius of Salvador Dali or the overblownfluff of Jackson Pollock.On the one hand, the photography is simply stunning. The realismis amazing. The depiction of the London of Jack the Ripper,Charles Dickens and Sherlock Holmes is stunningly realistic. Thesociety created by the film makers is amazing to watch in of itself.Also, Johnny Depp shows that he is one of the best actors of ourtime. Granted, his role as the police inspector trying to find theRipper is not dissimilar from his role in Sleepy Hollow, but whyshould that matter? From Hell is an excellent movie to watchimmediately after taking in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas andBlow to realize what an incredible actor he is.The movie contains vast amounts of violence, yet it is portrayedtastefully and seems necessary to the movie, even if it's not all thatimportant to show the blood and guts. It almost strips From Hell ofits horror label because the brothers Hughes found ways to showgutted prostitutes and still raise the movie above the slasher-goregenre.The plot works like a modern-day version of an Agatha Christiebook. We're given the parts fairly soon, and we watch the inspectortry to figure it out. This is much different from the other intelligentcrime-horror flicks of late: Se7en, Kiss the Girls and In Dreamsfeatured loonies we never met until late in the movie. The Watchertold us who it was the whole time. But From Hell shows us thekiller, as well as several clues throughout the movie, but theending is still a surprise when Depp reveals it. How refreshing!The plot also runs on several levels, adding in seeminglydisjointed pieces (Anne and the Masons, for example) yet putting itall together at the end.The ending of the movie is probably the most non-climactic endingto a horror movie the last ten years. Strange that this movie buildstoward a climax that never happens, yet the ending still leavesviewers satisfied.But not all is well with From Hell:Heather Graham isn't dirty enough. If she's a prostitute, then sheshould be a dirty whore. But she's not. She's the clean-faced,red-haired, smiling one that stays out of the fray while her friendsare slaughtered in unspeakable ways. After all the effort to makethe surroundings realistic, would a little charcoal on the cheekshave been too much to ask?Besides which, Heather Graham couldn't even act in AustinPowers, what ever made the film makers believe she could act ina horror-thriller based on semi-historical events and acontroversial novel? Sorry. Heather Graham joins Mira Sorvino infailing the "first major serious role" test.Someone in the editing room got a little too happy at the beginningof the movie. At some point in the middle of a string of murders,did someone not think to stop and say, "Hey but do you thinkanyone would mind if we showed more than two uninterruptedseconds of a single viewpoint?" In some cases, the splicing anddicing of the film works, but it gets old pretty fast, and horror fansmay be wishing they could play some scenes in slow motion.The ending is also a potential weak point. The nega-climacticending leaves the possibility for the audience to walk out of thetheatre with no lasting impression of the film, except a lot of dark.This is dangerous. Bold and gutsy, and I subtract no points for itsince I found it appealing, but it is dangerous, none the less.Overall, From Hell is the third excellent horror movie released thisyear (Hannibal, The Others, sorry haven't seen Joy Ride orJeepers Creepers yet). It is dark and disturbing. The horror doesn'twork on a shock/scare factor, but rather on a psychological/fundamental level. Audiences won't scream in terror,but many will find the movie horrifying. And in that sense, theHughes Brothers have created a rousing success.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, good stuff, with one really big flaw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible spoilers) "From Hell" is a visually arresting thriller that follows the killing spree of the oh so infamous Jack The Ripper, which take place in 1888 London, according to the film that is. Johnny Depp plays Inspector Frederick George Abberline, a man who can see the murders before they happen, which is done by taking lots of opium and then slipping into a dreamlike state. The murder victims are prostitutes and soon after inspecting a couple of the bodies Depp begins to realize that the killer may be killing these ladies as a form of punishment, not for money. The story of the film, although confusing at times, does make quite a bit of sense and the movie's pretty intriguing, until the last five to 10 minutes, which seem very rushed and because of the not very good, when compared to the rest of the picture. That's just the one problem that hurts the film. The other one is Heather Graham, whose phony and downright ridiculous accent plagues any scene she's in and just proves how miscast she is in the movie. Her acting isn't all the great either. Oh and also Ian Holm plays an old doctor, who is pretty fascinating to listen to, even if he seems a little off. But Holm does play his role well and does add some depth to the cast of the movie. Depp is by far the best of the bunch, as he always is. I'm not sure why he hasn't gotten noticed as much as actors like Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks or Harrison Ford (to name a few famous ones), he's just as good if not better than all three. But Depp does turn in a great performance as Inspector Abberline, his British accent is very convincing and he delivers his lines with a lot of power. "From Hell" is not the best picture of the year, but it does come close on some fronts, with only the ending and Graham's performance keeping it from being truly fantastic. But the visual style, both in the real world and in Depp's visions is very impressive and for the most part the acting is exceptional, again, except for Graham. Sure the film is pretty gory in certain parts but that's what you should expect from a movie whose villain is Jack The Ripper and the violence doesn't hurt the picture in any way. I'll say ***1/2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dark, mysterious film with the look of graphic novel film and it stars Johnny Depp..... Did Tim Burton Make this?From Hell is wonderfully shot and executed film by the Hughes Bros., who follow in the footsteps of Mr. Burton (even with the score that sounds like the work of Danny Elfman) with this dark retelling of the Jack the Ripper killings.Robbie Coltraine is brilliant as Depp's partner. This film should at least be considered for some Oscar nods!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack the Ripper appeared and disappeared after a relatively short killing spree. However, as he was never caught and the gruesome nature of his killings, the Ripper legend still has steam after 100+ years.It's been told and examined in many films, most notably the "Time After Time" film with Malcom McDowell, David Warner, and Annie Steenburgen."From Hell" takes its name from one of the notes presumed to be written by the Ripper and delivered to investigating authorities. The story of "From Hell" addresses the details of the legend and a quite entertaining and mostly logical way. Depp, as usual, offers quite a turn as Inspector Abberline, the chief investigator. This is definitely a must-see film.Be warned. Most of the gore is kept to a minimum, seen indirectly. This makes it even more shocking when a few graphic scenes take hold of your mind and refuse to let go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Johnny Depp is Fantastic!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is one of my most favorite actors who truly is very underrated in the hollywood film industry. Saying this to say I do adore this exotic and extremely handsome performer. I love his style in all of the films that I have been fortunate to see him in. I have been keeping up with him since 21 Jumpstreet, and he never ceases to amaze me! His dark brooding personality is just so surreal and their are not many actors (Christopher Walken another of my true favorites) that can take on these type of roles in filmmaking! The true artist are the writers and the filmmakers, the directors, but without the right personality behind the characters that have to be portrayed, what would these films be? Johnny Depp is tops in this film.I would say anyone out there that loves the dark side of filming, go and see this film. The scenery so captivating, the costumes are so true to form and I loved the music. He holds your attention in this film. What a wonderful treat. I really enjoyed all of the cast, but I do love Johnny Depp and I tip my hat to him in this one. Peace to all Sandy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Hell is an incredible film about a fabricated solution to the mystery of the Jack the Ripper murders. I haven't read the original novel, but I'm told the film got most of the story pretty well. The acting is absolutely fantastic. Depp and Graham seem a bit miscast, but both do very well as their respective characters. The story keeps a fairly steady pace and rarely lost my interest. The murder scenes, in my opinion, never became overly excessive. My only problem though, would have to be the ending.MAJOR SPOILER AHEADDepp dying during an opium high and having a psychic vision of Mary Kelly still alive in Ireland is totally irrelevant and seems to be some kind of sugar coat over the rest of the story.SPOILER OVERThat aside, great movie, go see it, just try to ignore the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to say that as a horror movie this should get five stars. The plot kept you glued to the screen for the whole movie. However, on an historical platform this movie twists the facts to better fit the film. I do not want to go into the facts because I do not want to give any of the movie away. I will say that in real life nobody ever knew who the real killer was and to this day they still have never figured out who he was. I just do not want younger people to come out thinking that this movie was historically accurate when it is clearly not. Sort of like what happened with the Boston Strangler movie with Tony Curtis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FROM HELL has a solid story, is visually exciting and is genuinely entertaining. Depp is good as the Inspector on the case. I was afraid it might be a retread of his SLEEPY HOLLOW character, but it wasn't.All the acting was top rate, except for Heather Graham.I don't know if this was a "studio" decision or the Hughes Bros. decision to cast Ms. Graham in this film, but whomever's decision it was, it was a mistake. Graham is gorgeous, which is a problem. She looked nothing like a 19th century, poor London whore. All the other prostitutes were fat, ugly and had brown teeth - except for Graham who was her gorgeous self with dyed red hair. I don't think they even had that color hair in London at that time. It sounds like I'm picking on her look too much, but it was incredibly distracting throughout the film and constantly "took me out of the film." Her performance was passable, but far from up to par with Depp, Holm &amp; the rest. I am a big fan of Graham in films such as DRUGSTORE COWBOY &amp; BOOGIE NIGHTS, but not here, not in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore. They managed to keep the story pretty much intact, as well as the style and pacing of the book. I was repeatedly amazed at how much of the book got into the movie, which I was expecting to be similar in name and subject matter only.There is one major difference between novel and the movie: in the novel, you know exactly who Jack is pretty much from the start, as well as the reasons he has for the murders. In the movie they flip it around to make it more of a mystery (and this is an appropriate change for a movie version).The crux of this change is that if you've not read the graphic novel, DON'T -- not until you've seen the movie. It gives away too much, and will reduce your enjoyment of the movie.(in case you're wondering, I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival's Gala Premiere, which is why I've seen it and you haven't! :-) )</fullReview>

The whole mood that is created with this frequent use of shadows is very distinct. The costumes are fabulous. The acting is fine.The bad: There isn't any real point to the film that I can see other than to tell this disturbing, gloomy tale which has no point. If it is meant as entertainment it fails as it just made me down and uncomfortable. If the movie was intended as a serious piece then it fails too as it tells us nothing nor does it show us anything worth seeing. It just shows us a lot of ugliness and gloom. There really isn't an interesting story with any depth here. It's like the filmmakers couldn't make up their minds regarding what kind of movie they wanted to make and ended up with this odd film which has the tone of a serious piece yet is hollow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review Four: From HellA five out of ten is by no means bad, From Hell isn't filmed badly, nor has it bad characterization, writing or acting. The special effects are average, too. Everything is just average in this film. It's not memorable, nor does leave ones mind instantly. From Hell is the definition of average, and with that it's not easy to say the film is recommended. The Gothic scape's are visually appealing, and much as one would expect. With the addition of Johnny Depp, one could easily think it was an early, toned down Tim Burton film, albeit not quite as absurd, fun or well directed. Released in 2001, the film has aged well over the last 10 years. One may be surprised it is that old.Yes, essentially this story of Jack The Ripper is a dramatized retelling, and all the better for it. Finding myself almost falling asleep throughout some scenes (when not even tired), the pacing isn't quite the best, either. Some scenes are unnecessary, some are over-drawn and some of the more exciting scenes aren't long enough.What was a fine film, however, has an ending so largely disappointing. This, again, isn't due to a script, nor the acting. it is purely from the directing style. It's, in text, satisfying ending, but it's just poorly executed. Possibly the issue with this film is that it takes itself 100% seriously, attempting to surprise with answers an audience is already familiar with. Essentially it spends so long building questions (and giving away the answers far too soon) that it detracts from the experience.For those a fan of the Jack The Ripper tale; this is a 5 out of 10 film, it's far from the best and you've seen it all before. Still, with it's own charm it is worth viewing. For those expecting a 'who did it' thriller, you'll leave severely disappointed with a 3/10. Anyone hoping for anything more akin to the Sherlock Holmes (2010) style model, loaded with dark humor, acting and a thrilling narrative, this film is far from it.A SOLID 5 OUT OF 10. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch it, but for $5 when no other options are out there, grab it for a rent. Buying it isn't advised, as it doesn't seem to hold up as a repeat viewing material.</fullReview>

The pacing is a mess - it's feels like a bad docudrama at times. The plot is all lost in the jumbo of scenes and characters. I never really was able connect to any of it - much as I wanted to.

		<shortDescription>Neither good nor bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movies i find most difficult to write a review about are the ones that are neither good nor bad but rather somewhere in between. This is definitely one of those movies.I saw "From Hell" in the theater back when it was released. And i left the screening not really knowing what to think. While there are a lot of things to like about the movie, it still didn't give me a lasting impression and the story quickly faded from my memory. What i definitely liked was Johnny Depp's doped out investigator, i also liked the very beautiful sceneries and the fact that several of the surrounding actors were very good. No, the problem was neither in the production nor in the acting department. Nor was it due to a boring subject-matter, there is definitely something that's still enticing and curious about Jack the Ripper.So what was it? Well, i don't know really but my best guess is the script. Because despite all this scenery, these good actors and this interesting real-life story, the end-result is actually rather dull and uninteresting. The movie didn't leave a mark, didn't make me want to learn more about Jack the Ripper, and worst of all it didn't really entertain me much. There was simply no nerve, no excitement, present. And for a thriller that's not good.So i guess the grade is... difficult to give. While it was decently entertaining during it's running time, and there was much nice scenery and images to watch, it faded immediately after the movie ended. And of the exciting chase for Jack the Ripper not much excitement remained (or was ever present). So i guess this is somewhere between good and bad, which means... a 5/10?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, Intriguing, Slightly Barmy Jack The Ripper Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In London in 1888, the enigmatic Inspector Frederick Abberline is called in to investigate brutal murders of prostitutes in Whitechapel, in which the victims have been butchered with surgical precision. At a loss to explain or prevent the murders, Abberline is taunted by letters and clues from the killer, whom the papers have dubbed Jack The Ripper ...The Hughes Brothers are unlikely candidates to direct a Victorian Gothic drama, but their film is an excellent mix of style, authentic atmosphere and entertaining mystery. It starts a little shakily, introducing too many odd characters too quickly, but soon settles into a dark, chilling depiction of the notorious Whitechapel Murderer. Its trump card is the fantastic production design (shot in Prague) by Martin Childs; a sprawl of dank, grimy East End cobbled streets and alleys, pubs and flophouses, all backlit by fabulous matte paintings by Syd Dutton and Bill Taylor. It's a living, breathing, nineteenth-century slum and it transports us to the world of the story. The problem with a movie about unsolved crimes of course is that it has to give us an answer; this film goes for one of the much-disputed conspiracy theories that the Duke of Clarence (Queen Victoria's grandson and second in line to the throne) had a legitimate child with a Catholic streetwalker, and that Sir William Gull (his physician) lobotomised the mother and killed anyone who had witnessed the marriage (other popular but unlikely theories are that the killer was the Duke himself, or a painter called Walter Sickert). The script weaves an entertaining yarn around these ideas, filled with secret masonic rituals and dastardly deeds, but it also goes a bit loopy in parts, throwing in bizarre developments (the most famous victim, Mary Kelly, escapes) and tenuous links to Queen Victoria and John Merrick. The central linking concept - that the victims all knew each other - is almost certainly false, but the locales and the details of the killings are painstakingly recreated. The movie nicely captures the tension of the time between the nobility and the deprived; the notion that the authorities did little to find the killer because who cares about a few less tarts in the world anyway ? Of all the Dickensian hardships foisted on the poor, Jack The Ripper represents the cruellest injustice. The cast are varied but good, with Depp (a Ripper fanatic by all accounts) impressive as the laudanum and absinthe-soaked Abberline, complete with a great "nuffing sahgint" accent, Graham memorable as the tenacious, fiery-haired Mary, and Coltrane solid support as the world-weary, Bard-quoting sergeant. I have mixed feelings about Holm's performance; he's one of my favourite actors (superb in Alien, Dreamchild, Brazil, many others) and is excellent in this, but he's seventy and five-feet-six, so I'm afraid he doesn't quite work as Jack The Ripper for me, despite some spooky pitch-black lenses. Compare him with David Warner in Time After Time for example, who is perfect casting as the original serial killer. For a good comparison piece to this, check out the 1988 TV-movie Jack The Ripper, with Michael Caine and Lewis Collins. Despite some flaws, this is a great costumed thriller; the title comes from the signature on one of Jack's infamous letters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"From Hell" presents something not seen in movies since the old Sherlock Holmes movies. It tells the story of an inspector (Johnny Depp) investigating the Jack the Ripper murders in 1888 London, but it suggests that the decadent aristocrats in a way aren't much better than the murderer himself. Of course, the setting is like a star on its own: eerie, dismal streets that look like they could be hiding almost anything...ANYTHING. As for the question of historical accuracy, that doesn't really seem to be an issue. You have to focus on the bleak, evil surroundings to really get the feeling.Depp is great in his role, as can be expected. Also starring is Heather Graham as prostitute Mary Kelly; let me tell you, this is a role very far removed from her comedic ones. Robbie Coltrane plays a sergeant; because of this movie's grim nature, you probably will be able to forget that he plays Hagrid in the Harry Potter movies. Ian Holm, Ian Richardson, Jason Flemyng and Katrin Cartlidge also star. Maybe the most surprising thing about "From Hell" is that it was directed by Albert and Allen Hughes (known for movies like "Dead Presidents").Overall, this is not a movie to be missed. It just goes to show that real horror entails that which we don't know. Very well done.</fullReview>

Not that they are bad actors, they did a good job all considered. Its just that I did not find these typical Hollywood types in the faintest bit believable. Kinda up there with Tab Hunter as Christ (Didn't that actually happen or am I thinking of some other "Star" of the 1950s.) But I should not be too down on Hollywood, after all Robbie Coltrane would probably not have been my first choice for the sidekick either. Again...a reasonable "journeyman" actor but for goodness sake! Finally the dialogue. Sounded more like a script from a late 1990s crime drama. Lots of street talk.. (F... this and F...that) still I should not be too upset, at least no one called the other a "mo fo" Not that I mind profanity. But if you are going to do it at least make it culturally sensitive and chronologically accurate.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, and the DVD includes some factual 'Ripper' information.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many I suppose, I had a passing awareness that a criminal called 'Jack the Ripper' once roamed, but nothing more than that. This movie clarifies who he was, and gives us a gripping thriller to boot. As we are told in the DVD extras, it remains a mystery as to who exactly he was, or why he killed a number of women during that period in the late 1880s and the early 1890s London, but the story here is based on one of the possibilities. The title comes from an actual note believed to be written by the killer, and signed 'from hell.'Johnny Depp stars as Inspector Fred Abberline, who has a habit of smoking drugs and drinking absinthe, but also a reputation for solving crimes with very scarce clues. He is depicted as one who often dreams of the solution and can foreshadow crimes. Heather Graham adopts a mostly believable Irish accent and plays Mary Kelly, a woman of the street. Ian Holm is superb as Sir William Gull, a former surgeon, and who becomes a key player in solving the mystery presented in this story. Also good is Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Peter Godley who often assists Abberline.A movie about gory murders must contain some gore, but the directors keep it to a minimum so that the gore supports the story and never seems gratuitous. SPOILERS FOLLOW. It turns out that Gull was the ripper, assisted by his carriage driver. Turns out the heir to the throne in England had secretly married a Catholic, they had a baby, and the only way for the Freemasons (represented by Gull) to save the integrity of the throne was to get rid of the heir and his mother. But there were witnesses, a group of prostitutes who had to be murdered also, and that was his motive. But they weren't just killings, but ritual murders, that is why victims were also disemboweled. Mary Kelly was to be the final murder, but Abberline gets to the scene just in time to save her and defeat Jack The Ripper. Fiction, but a good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 2001 chart topper Hollywood flick offers a different and a peculiar insight into the most infamous and most terrifying serial killings in British history- the ripper murders.Set in Victorian London, this film focuses on five prostitutes in the Whitechapel area of London, Mary Kelly, Martha Tabram, Kate Eddoes, Dark Annie Chapman, Liz Stride, and Polly, When prostitute Martha is found murdered with her throat slashed Londoners are appalled but the true nature of her injuries demand that a professional detective be brought in. Johnny Depp is at his acting best portraying the opiate addicted Inspector Abberline assigned to the case, but as he makes progress with Martha's murder another more gruesome one comes to light.The whole of London is gripped with fear as each prostitute from the gang is horrifically mutilated and slashed to ribbons in turn, each one having part of the body or organ removed.When Inspector Abberline joins forces with the fiery and tough talking Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) he is offered a crucial insight as to the perpetrator of the crimes a man who married her best friend Anne, a person who appears to have a direct link to the family of Queen Victoria herself.As bodies begin to mount and the pressure escalates, Abberline is on a race against time to find Jack the Ripper and stop him reaching his final victim, Mary Kelly- with disturbing consequences</fullReview>

Sometimes when a film is supposedly about a real person, I think it best to forget that, or at least try to enjoy the film for it's own sake. Some things are taken for granted. No-one knows who killed the girls, so how do we know the same person killed them all? The thing that comes across most strongly when reading about the murders, is the incompetence of the police. Was a huge 'cover up' in operation? Again, no-one knows. For me, the film would have benefited from better editing, more character development,and less of them.

Another good aspect of this movie is the cinematography. It is dark, quick and suspenseful, all of which, are good for this movie. I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys horror/suspense movies or people (like myself) who have interest in Jack the Ripper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real life Ripped off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Hell takes a genuine theory about the identity of Jack the Ripper and dramatises it. We follow opium addicted inspector Abberline played by Johnny Depp as he tried to discover exactly who is stalking Londons East End. It had better not be Phil Mitchell again.The film is stylishly shot and really brings grimy victorian London to life. The story is interesting and well known. However the film is just far too long. I felt it would be far better and more gripping had it been a good half an hour shorter. It was littered with useless scenes which dragged on leaving you bored as much as you tried to get into the story. It was like the director just couldn't make up his mind what to cut and said to hell with it.The character of Jack the Ripper needing a carriage driver to get around London (with no one noticing a huge black carriage at every murder scene) reduced the impact of the character. He just didn't feel as evil or as vile when you knew without his lackey he'd be waiting for the bus like the rest of us.Just a few niggles like this prevents me from giving it my highest scores. It had potential to be a fantastic murder mystery but instead ends up too long winded for its own good. As a result is not a film you would like to see too many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very obvious, but oh-so-good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's dark, it's dismal and it is very dirty. From Hell's Jack the Ripper is as obvious as can possibly be because he speaks several times and does very little to disguise his voice. Nevertheless, Johnny Depp is absolutely fabulous, a little less eccentric than a lot of his other films, but on top form and looking gorgeous! Heather Graham, however, is not so hot. Her Irish accent is terrible and her presence causes all female viewers to groan and roll their eyes. Fortunately not a lot of hanky-panky happens between the two leads. Robbie Coltrane is happy spouting Shakespeare and shouting at constables left, right and centre. Ian Holm is clearly having fun with being evil. From Hell is a fast-paced murder-mystery (with very little mystery) that will have you laughing, bitching and hiding behind the sofa in 2 hours. Someone pass me the kidney flavoured crisps...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Graphic and potent crime thriller from the Hughes Brothers. Fantasy and speculation provides entertainment on the edge. Versatile Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted police inspector who uses his clairvoyant powers to try and track down Jack the Ripper. While investigating the gruesome murders in 1888 London inspector Abberline(Depp)finds himself falling in love with an intended victim Mary Kelly(Heather Graham). Just over two hours and sometimes a little choppy plotwise. Depp is intense and affable. Even the chalky looking Graham makes for a winsome prostitute. Supporting cast includes Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and Paul Rhys. It is probably a good idea to watch on an empty stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great alternative reality of the jack the ripper story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>if you want to see real facts about Jack the ripper then you should better see a documentation. but I feel that fictional movies don't always have to correspond with the facts that are known. they can be an altogether alternative reality to what we know so far. and that is what From Hell is. around a legend a fictional account of what happened is created, and this results in a beautiful mystery film that kept me on the edge of my seat for the full 117 minutes. the plot is somewhat complex, but worthwile the effort. the imagery is very powerful,dark and atmospheric and creates a wonderful, romantic and sometimes surreal setting of london around the turn of the century. the sequences where Johnny Depp 'chases the dragon' are very intense and beautifully done. great camerawork, nice cutting, and strong acting. if you don't like a complex plot, or get annoyed when facts don't correspond to life, you simply won't get what this film is about, and probably hate it. But if you can let yourself be led into an alternative world for two hours and just immerse in the story, then you'll recognise this film for what it is: a really great movie.</fullReview>

Heather Graham does a fair job in playing an Irish born hooker. Johnny Depp does a surprisingly good job.Now the bad points: the movie is too drawn out and takes too long to get going. The part that I really despise about this movie is the use of the Masons (a fraternity to which I belong) as a scapegoat. The movie makers should investigate there information more thoroughly before they present their "facts" on subjects they know nothing about. They do try to play down the Masonic part with a Masonic "trial" near the end but it does not work. Also the implications of some of the ruling elite knowing about and sanctioning The Ripper's actions is deplorable.Don't waste your time on this too long, too boring, too everything bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive retelling of the graphic novel by The Hughes brothers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(possible spoilers)From Hell tells the story of Jack the Ripper in 1888, possibly one of the most infamous murderers, in an enriched and stylized way pumped up with some good old killing scenes. Johhny Depp plays an investigator in England who can find who the Ripper may attack next in his visions and begins to get close to someone who could be next (Heather Graham plays this next, a helpful prostitute). How he sees these visions? He is a regular opium taker and in his state he sees these gruesome details. The story wanders here and there, yet it's made up in the most part by a rich and darkly exhilarating atmosphere evoked by the Allen and Albert Hughes and their photographer peter Deming, and by some fine performances turned in by Depp, (dare I say) Graham and Ian Holm who plays a hierarchy figure, so to speak. It might not be for all tastes, but for those interested (or those who took interest in the graphic novel) won't be disapointed.One more note: adding the Elephant man may not be neccessary in a movie about Jack the Ripper, but credit is due in having two of the 19th centuries more famous English gentlemen in one film.

		<fullReview>Despite playing fairly free and easy with the facts of the Jack the Ripper case, Albert and Allen Hughes still manage to fashion a fairly ordinary tale out of a compelling murder case. Johnny Depp is the laudanum-addicted police detective assigned to uncover the killer of prostitutes in London's Whitechapel area. Depp, exercising his almost-there-but-not-quite English accent, has clairvoyant dreams that help him not one jot in solving the mystery, but which offer the directors the chance to insert some edgy editing.The film looks good, but is too long and sometimes your attention wanders as the good inspector wanders into an improbable emotional involvement with the prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, with an accent even wonkier than Depp's). Its solution to the mystery is just about plausible, and skirts around the possible true involvement of a member of royalty, but for some reason the Hughes brothers provide an ambiguous coda that leaves the impression that it all may just be the dream of a dying man. It's a strange choice, a bizarre perversion of the 'he woke up to discover it was all a dream' cliché that fails to work</fullReview>

But what I got was pathetic art film it was just a mediocre adaptation of a comic book.From Hell (Spoilers******) 20th Century Fox brings the cinematic version of the graphic novel written by Alan Moore. England during 1888 a mysterious killer starts to murder poor prostitutes, for searching him Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) was brought to the case. Even after his strict surveillance the killer continues to hunt down more prostitutes. Things went more darker when a young prostitute named Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) enters Abberline's life. Soon Abberline found that each victim was connected and the killer was some one from the Royal Family.Directed by the Hughes brothers (Allen and Albert) tells the unseen story of the notorious killer Jack the Ripper. I don't know why they treat such hard core theme to a sucking art film. It has no tension, no forcefulness, and no suspense. Or is that because of they feared Alan Moore's creativity, or a NC-17 rating, they cheated all the die hard fans by creating such lame movies based on a Great materials.I give this movie 1 out of 10.From Hell = Dull Hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FROM HELL (2001) *** Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm, Jason Flemyng, Ian Richardson, Lesley Sharp, Susan Lynch, Terence Harvey, Katrin Cartlidge. (Dirs: Albert &amp; Allen Hughes) Smartly executed adaptation of the graphic novel (in more ways than one) by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell about the most infamous turn-of-the-century murderer, Jack The Ripper, in London's Whitechapel district becoming the first serial killer with only Depp's fearlessly intelligent yet opium addicted constable on the case and in hot pursuit. Graham is one of a small clutch of ladies of the evening on Saucy Jack's menu to dispatch with gruesome elan and Coltane lends comic support as the Shakespeare quoting aide de campe. Atmospherically enriched by cinematographer's glimmeringly dank photography (check out the cool ?dreams' entries that Depp experiences of the murders occurring) and detailed Victorian era production design by the gifted Martin Childs filmed on location in Prague. The film's final act seems abrupt and wanting more than is given but why quibble when the body count culminates in a battle of wits in this Sherlock Holmes meets "Se7en" interpretation of the old chestnut of the notorious madman. The Hughes Brothers truly represent old-fashioned entertaining filmmaking of the top drawer variety in their unlikely junior effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp vs. Jack the Ripper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A police inspector (Johnny Depp) in 1888 London tries to capture Jack the Ripper. Unfortunately, he falls in love with one of his intended victims (Heather Graham). Very loud (WAY too many shots and sounds of stairs coming down from carriages--the sound is ear-splitting!), dark and confusing. The movie looks fantastic--there are some breath-taking shots of Victorian London. But, plotwise, it's a mess. It moves quickly but is very confusing at the beginning, way too plot heavy (the film is almost 150 minutes) for its own good and throws in hallucinatory images ad nauseum (Depp has too many drug-induced "visions"). The acting helps--Depp is excellent in his role--he looks very handsome and nicely underplays it. Graham is good but looks terrible--way too pale and drab (but then, she IS playing a prostitute). The film doesn't skimp on blood and gore--there's not a lot of violence, but when there is it's not pretty. Ultimately, the film is too long, too grim and too depressing to really enjoy. Still the producers/directors the Hughes Brothers are talented men. Let's see more of them.</fullReview>

Perhaps I excepted more, but this was a bit too sordid in spots. I gave it a second look I year later, after buying the DVD, and found it so sleazy I wound up trading the disc. This movie never succeeded at the box office, and I can see why: bad vibes and poorly told, despite the fine cinematography.Most films starring Johnny Depp are entertaining, and this is no exception. I never got bored with the story but, in addition to the sordid tone to it, I question the storyteller's bias against Masons (no, I am not one nor have any interest in them) and thought there was a bit of anti-Christian prejudice, too. I couldn't understand a lot of the accents, either, which lessens the enjoyment of watching it.</fullReview>

I'd swear I'm in Victorian era London. Some "trivia" critics criticize the Absinthe fire ritual in this. But actually I never questioned the lighting of the sugar cube. That was probably invented about 3 or 4 days after realizing we should put a sugar cube in this bitter drink. I was bothered by the fact that Depp, a well known Absinthieur, did not douse the flaming caramel with ICE WATER. You HAVE to drink it with ice water to make it "louche". To set the fairy free. IF Dumbasses keep serving Absinthe improperly here in the states, it will be banned again. IF YOU ARE SERVED ABSINTHE WITHOUT ICE WATER, YOU'VE BEEN SERVED BY A DIMWIT!!!! Ice water or die!!!! It's 100 to 186 proof!!!! You can die if you don't show this drink the proper respect. That said, try the French or Swiss stuff, and try honey. Greatest drink in the world.

		<fullReview>From Hell has its moments as a movie. However, it is also an opportunity lost because people wanted to take a safe option instead of the one that was offered to them.The plot revolves around Fred Abberline ( Johnny Depp ), a London investigator who is on the trail of Jack the Ripper as he leaves a trail of mutilated bodies through the Whitechapel district of London. High up on his list seems to be a group of prostitutes- one of which is Mary Kelly ( Heather Graham )- who confides in Abberline in the hope that the Ripper case may be solved. However, soon, both the inspector and Kelly, along with the trusty sergeant ( Robbie Coltrane ), see that the trail may lead to echelons of society far higher than they could possibly imagine.This, in itself, does seem like a good plot for a movie. However there are a couple of big problems that stop it from working. One is that Abberline has 'visions' when under the influence of opium which seem to be a half-baked excuse by the Hughes Brothers to show London in a different light and it doesn't really work. This compounds the second problem, which is that there is no real mystery element to the plot, instead he comes up with a vision which helps him figure it out.The performances are varied with Depp good as Abberline and Graham average as Kelly but it is the English supporting cast of Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson as his police chief and most strongly, Ian Holm as Sir William Gull, which makes the atmosphere come alive. To add to that is an amazingly dark score and a great set in Prague which makes Victorian London seem as real and malevolent as ever.From Hell is a sort of a halfway house between a brilliant Alan Moore graphic novel which portrayed things from the view of Jack the Ripper and a straight out period murder mystery and it's this compromise that sees it fail. One wonders if the plot was changed just so they could get someone like Johnny Depp and Heather Graham into the star credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack the Ripper continues to allude people, even to this day. First and foremost, the suspect list is very extensive. However, this version from the film, From Hell, goes with the popular theory of a Royal/Freemason conspiracy.From Hell, is a film that captures late 1880s London very successfully. The technical and production skills that provide the haunting slum appearance of East London is superb.As for the film, many liberties were indeed taken. Johnny Depp was magnificent as Frederick Aberline...but Aberline cannot be said to be a drug-addict and the ending is fanciful. I understand artistic license, but when a film embarks upon a non-fictional event, the truth or facts, should still be used as the fixture and fitting of a film's direction.I enjoyed the film, and the actors and actresses were extremely good. The story and caveats were interesting, but its the omissions of the case that confused me. For example, Jack the Ripper was identified, not facially, but his clothes were identified. I believe it was a deer stalkers hat and tweed clothing and a small suitcase, which was obviously used for his surgical apparatus. The mystery of the Ripper rests on how the hell, no-one noticed anything and the lack of witnesses. London during the late 1880s was a very over-crowded place, especially the East End, with arrivals from Eastern Jews escaping the pogroms and also Chinese immigrants.The film could've projected the social and political pressures more, as it was these issues, that made the Police work even more daunting, as it was an area that was afflicted with radicalism and communities in perpetual transit. This would mean, many false leads and greater pressure as a result.However as a film, the atmosphere, the production and acting, all combine to make a great film....but not a factual film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HELL-ish ending wasn't all that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big gore fan, in regards to bloody murder scenes, but I generally liked this. The plot was intriguing (who doesn't like the high profile cases?), and the actors made the movie worth watching, despite any flaws. I have to admit Graham's performance was the low point of the movie but Johnny Depp, Ian Holm, and Robbie Coltrane? Fabulous actors. Over all, the accents weren't too bad- Depp's serviceable, Graham's annoying. And I really enjoyed watching Depp "chasing the dragon" because his psychic abilities were not as horribly cliché as they could have been. The bits about the stonemasons were very interesting as well.My favorite part was the ending. I had expected the typical: Boy saves girl, boy solves crime, boy shags girl and Bob's your uncle! But the ending surprised me, pleasantly. It was sad and uncomfortable- I loved every moment of it.For a night of soft-core-gore, From Hell is a good choice. It's not terribly frightening, but some of the more suspenseful moments may have you clutching your pillow a bit tighter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, this is a scary film. It's bloody, but hey, we're talking Jack the Ripper here. It scared the snot out of me. But wow, if it doesn't make you think...The reason I write this review, if you ever want to see the horrific conditions that women with no male help in their lives were forced to live, this will show it. It made me think about how much I have by not living in that era of human history. It was brutal for women who were forced to become prostitutes just to live if they were on their own, there were no other jobs for them. And even then it wasn't living.I saw it when it first came out on video and I haven't forgotten it since.And the story was good too, Johnny Deep was of course brilliant, I was more impressed with Heather Graham whose characters are usually more shallow, she was deep in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accents and importance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the film story line was superb I found that Johnny Depp's accent led my mind to wander away from the film in a subconscious attempt to work out where he was "trying to be from" - there was no specific area more a sort of mix of various regional accents - better than the typical US actor's "English" and certainly better than Dick van Dyke as a cockney. I suppose a US actor was used so that films would sell better in the US - shame. Heather Graham was supposed to be Irish and her accent was anything but that - shame again - why not use an Irish actress? It would have made the film more believable. I love Robbie Coltrane but I associate him with comedy films/"comic relief" - so his presence, along with the atrocious accents, meant that it was impossible to take this film seriously. It's a great pity as it could have been so much better without these unnecessary distractions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective Gothic horror piece of speculative fiction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who don't know, From Hell is an adaptation of the graphic novel by the same name, written by comics-god Alan Moore and with art by Eddie Campbell. Now, I've never read the graphic novel, so I won't be commenting on how well The Hughes Brothers adapted Moore's work. I will say this though, the movie certainly looks like a graphic novel, with its creepy rendition of late nineteenth century London, and its red painted skies.This graphic novel stuff is important to note because one must realise that From Hell the movie isn't trying to be an accurate depiction of the history of Jack the Ripper, but rather an adaptation of a book that was a heavily-researched, but ultimately speculative fictional account on the story of Jack the Ripper. The movie isn't trying to be historically-accurate, but rather uses history as a context for its fictional narrative. Which doesn't mean that one can't be bothered when police officers carry flashlights or when they screw up a historical figure's actual title given the year of the story (1888), these are anachronisms that should've been correct. However, if someone is upset by the film's suggestions on the identity of Jack the Ripper or the fate of Mary Kelly, then they're missing the point of the fiction. The film isn't trying to be the definitive account of Jack the Ripper, but rather the telling of a theory, a "what if" tale as it were.On to the film itself, From Hell is a gruesome telling of the Jack the Ripper story. Due to the nature of the story, it is gruesome and grim, and visually dynamic. I'd describe it as a moderately scary semi-horror movie for people (like myself) who don't watch horror movies. In watching the special features, it appears that the Hughes Brothers did a pretty good job matching scenes to the actual locations of the crimes in question, which makes the film a little more chilling in retrospect.In terms of acting, Johnny Depp does a decent job as Inspector Fred Abberline, the chief investigator in the Ripper killings in White Chapel. He creates a character interesting enough that the audience is compelled to follow throughout the film, but nothing too spectacular. His co-star Heather Graham, playing prostitute and potential-Ripper victim Mary Kelly, is the weak link of the film, with a horrible accent and a useless romance sub-plot. It is obvious that she was cast to help open the film, and the character was fleshed out to humanise the victims. However, she is horribly out of place amongst the otherwise English cast (that being the actors not named Depp and Graham) and does little for the film than look good (which, I don't mind, since she does look good. Perhaps a little too good for a nineteenth century prostitute). Joining Depp and Graham are Ian Holm as the Royal Family's physician-in-ordinary Sir William Gull and Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Peter Godley.I found the flick to be a fairly effective Gothic horror movie, and enjoyed the theoretical explanation of Jack the Ripper's true identity and motives. The film has some genuinely creepy and horrifying moments, chief among them is the carriage the Ripper uses to bring himself to his victims, which is made at the same time ordinary and other-worldly through the use of shadows and sound. It has a very Sleepy Hollow-feel to it, which is always a little creepy.However, the film is merely above average, as it does a few things very well, but nothing extraordinarily well. A good movie to check it if you're in the mood for some late 1800's England creepiness, but aren't expecting high art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp as excellent as ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fresh retelling of the Jack the Ripper legend was probably due, and this Hughes Brothers piece is just the job. It remains faithful to the story whilst throwing in one or two potentially controversial aspects that will leave audiences horrified, but also with a number of talking points.***Spoilers*** The potential link of Jack the Ripper to the royal family has been rumoured for decades but has never been proved. Although this film might have benefited from remaining slightly more ambiguous, nevertheless it is a fascinating tale, though viewers of a nervous disposition are advised that blood abounds.Johnny Depp, as ever, gives a solid performance whilst always injecting human interest into the role. Heather Graham's performance is good but not spectacular, and her Irish accent is a little shaky. Robbie Coltrane is his usual bustling, robust self, and even in the most serious of roles he can be looked to to provide some comedic relief, and he can always convey his relishing of the role. Ian Holm brings the required gravitas to the performance.A superb and fascinating but rather grisly tale, this is not the average mindless Saturday night entertainment, but an excellent murder mystery, and a much needed de-mystifying of the tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp as a Cockney!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rather scarily-titled 'From Hell' is an entertaining piece of Hollywood hokum about Jack the Ripper. Without giving too much away, it offers a new spin on old material (although seasoned 'Ripperologists' will find little to surprise them). Johnny Depp works surprisingly well as cockney detective Inspector Abberline, and the cast is uniformly strong - although some might think that casting Heather Graham as an Irish/Cockney prostitute is pushing credibility a bit! Still, this is an enjoyable romp and there's no need to let realism get in the way of the fun. Frankly a lot of the characters seem to have stepped straight out of 'Oliver', but it hardly seems to matter. That said, the atmosphere is genuinely chilling at times, and it's interestingly filmed in a style reminiscent of comic books (the script was based on a graphic novel). Not one to take too seriously, but fun fodder for a wet Wednesday evening with the curtains drawn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite a staggering film to behold. Indeed, a steady stream of mealy pansies filed past me in the aisles of the theatre I watched it in. Apparently they were attending a film "From Hell" expecting content "From Someplace Kind and Amusing".Fusing realism with expressionism, the Hughes bros. direct this latest 'Ripper' movie, based on the graphic novel (read adult comic book) by Alan Moore. The film is realistic in that it takes care to reproduce historical artifacts from the 19th Century Whitechapel killings. It also quotes the Ripper and is sensitive to location.Expressionistic, in that the sky is regularly turned red to provide a sanguinary atmosphere, and dark throbbing music played. Neither of these accompaniments were afforded to the Ripper, but they are included in such a fashion in the film as to provide a clear delineation between realism and expressionism, so they remain unobtrusive.In any case, although the jury is still out as far as the genuine culprit in these killings (Moore says it was a surgeon, Cornwall holds it to be a painter) we can say with absolute certainty that this film enthralls with its vision of Rippage. Jacky boy is certainly one of the horror genre's mainstays; along with Dracula (incarnated many times, recently by Craven), zombies (28 Days Later), and werewolves (Wolf). Myself, I prefer ALIEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I much prefer the TV movie with Michael Caine. That one was more based in fact. This film just went winging off into the ozone near the finale with messianic Freemasons and a convoluted "solution" that had me shaking my head and wishing for a more straightforward mystery, which is what The Ripper is. The Hughes Brothers were in love with the freaky dream sequences and imagery (which were interesting visually), but left the plot hanging. The gore was a bit overdone and almost became a fetish, in fact a bit comical in places. Having the Ripper speak was a bad move because anyone with half an ear would know who it was.The best thing about this movie was the ultra-real atmosphere of Victorian skid rows and Johnny Depp.</fullReview>

Performances by Johnny Depp as the inspector and Ian Holm as Jack the Ripper in particular were wonderful. Didn't really care for Heather Graham's performance and I thought she should've died anyhow.

		<fullReview>Notwithstanding Johnny Depp is one of my favourite actors, I think he might not be the best character for this part. He has not the"physique du role" for playing an addicted middle age inspector in the 19th century. How could I say, he looks too healthy !! Also Heather Graham is definitively too pretty to play a 19th century street whore. The best thing in this movie is the atmosphere that only a city like Prague can give for a 19th century large city reconstruction. It really looks like you're living for a couple of hours in those days. The mixing between history and romance is very well crafted and acting is quite good. The bitter ending, so uncommon in an american movie, is unexpected and therefore appreciated. The impression is that the story would have deserved a longer time to describe it better in all its many shadow points. However a 7 is well deserved.</fullReview>

The story focuses on brilliant but troubled police inspector Depp in Victorian era London who uses his unearthly tactics to investigate a series of grisly murders while tracking the killer, eventually forming a close bond with prostitute and potential victim Graham in the process. The film plods at times, but it's well-acted and designed, full of engrossing moments, and has an effectively eerie and spine-chilling feel throughout. Not for the squeamish goes without saying, but it's still an impressive and ambitious period piece from the creators of Menace II Society. ***</fullReview>

Some other characters are not that good, some things unbelievable. But the movie has atmosphere. That is important. It succeeds un fields, where many other movies were doomed to failure. It takes us on a ride through the streets of gas-lit London. I have had such an expierence only one - nay two times before: When reading Caleb Carr's two novels "Angel of Darkness" and "The Alienist".

		<fullReview>If you've ever read From Hell, the graphic novel (and by graphic I do mean graphic) by Alan Moore, then you will know just how much of a labyrinth it is as far as plot goes and just how hard it would be to incorporate all aspects of the story into a two hour movie.As predicted, it doesn't match the book, but I never expected it to. It does do a damn fine job though and gets as much of the details in as possible. The only problem I had was that it tries to turn the film into a whodunnit kind of thriller with the stories idea of the killers identity being revealed at the end. In the book we know from the beginning who it's supposed to be and we follow him around as he commits the murders and we hear his thoughts and his ponderings. This approach that the film takes cheapens the artistic value a little bit but having said that it does make up for it in other areas.The horror is actually horrible and the thrills are actually thrilling and Johnny Depp's cockney accent is pretty good, it just sounds weird because its coming from his mouth which is something we are not use to.</fullReview>

Not knowing any of the history, I could accept it for what it was, a movie with some excellent acting from Johnny Depp and those wonderful English actors. Thank God there is still the class-consciousness and upraised finger to the 'posh' that I love about my hypocritical country, shown by the incompetent head inspector over-ruling the smart young if addicted detective. (Follow the money, to find out about social class in the United States. But at least we PRETEND to be class-less, and come to think of it, we often are!!!).Interesting perspective on the FreeMasons, about whom I'm now inspired to find out. Did they really have human sacrifices, and were they in collusion to do horrible things, an upper-class lynch mob? My step-father was all set to go through initiation into the Masons and discovered at the last moment their segregation rules, so sacrificed the paid dues and the bonhomie of their companionship (during the 60s).If you think of the movie as a better-than-average thriller, you'll like it, with some good acting to boot. The carriage of DEATH with the heavy-footed black horses set the mood, nicely. In fact, have a "Jack the Ripper" home film festival and watch Michael Caine's version after this one. Many similar touches.  Someday someone will give us a dramatic movie that shows us the forces that drive a woman into prostitution and it's horrible degradation. And I think I've got a hideous humiliating job, working for a monster!!!!!!! Who knows? You may even feel better about your job after seeing this movie. I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous gothic horror film with a little ideological meat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so it's not as complex as the book by a long shot (but ifyou've read Moore's 600-page, heavily researched masterpiecewith its 40 or so pages of historical notes in back, you weren'texpecting that). But the acting varies between decent and excellent(the latter on the part of Johnny Depp and Ian Holm), the script issolid (structured, unlike the book, as a mystery where you don'tfind out the killer's identity until the end), and the visuals aregorgeous -- a bleak Victorian landscape under a smoky red sky.Particularly nice are Abberline (Depp)'s green-tinted opium visionsof the murders. The gore is also appropriately restrained for thefirst two-thirds or so of the film, such that when we finally see oneof the women's throats being slashed (it opens up like a mouth),the sight is truly shocking. I was also glad to see that despitelacking the novel's depth, the film retained a strong focus on themurders as the act of a man embodying the violence of adominator society. The film successfully associates that society'sracism with its oppression of women -- a significant ideologicalstatement. The ripper's vision at the climax of the film (the lastmurder) has him being applauded by the all-male members of therich, educated upper class, making his vision of himself asserving his class clear.Finally, kudos to Robbie Coltrane as the sergeant -- his earthy,practical character made an excellent contrast with Depp'sintuitive, emotional Abberline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This particular movie wasn't quite what I was hoping it would be. For one thing, it too unnecessarily graphic, something I don't appreciate, however, I did appreciate the overall story they used, and the acting was good especially the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. Go see it if your a fan of this type of movie, but don't see it if you have a weak stomach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hughes's are two of the best afrcian amercian directors in the game right now. Their newest film From Hell displays their talent for horror and suspense witht his movie. The film plays it smart by not showing the killer's face till the end and the death's are never shown. I reccomned this film very highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well first thing it did not show that much. It left you out there not knowing what was really going on. They made it sound so big and it really didn't stand up to it name. I can understand not wanting to be too gory, but for the most part, you were left wondering what was happening during the murders. There really wasn't any character development, so you did not have much sympathy for the victims. The main character wasn't developed very well, and was a waste of Depp's talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what a piece of crap this movie was. i love horror movies and gore, but this movie had nothing to offer. it was slow, boring, and tried to make up for its slowness and boringness with a lot of blood and slasher effects. i don't understand how it is the #1 movie in the country. are movies that bad these days? anyway when the movie got really disturbing i swear i could hear trent rezner's voice sing "i wanna..you like an animal" it was really my friend who said this movie was a like a bad nine inch nails video. but that's a pretty redundant thing to say i think. not to mention this movie is extremely stupid. there is one part when they expose the killer, and the movie spends 5 minutes trying to convince you that the killer is crazy. right, like i didn't know. and you're crazy if you liked this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though slightly sleepy and hollow at times, "From Hell" is a slice of movie heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may have noticed that I've played the comparison game a lot in 2001.While it's had its benefits, it's also resulted in my watching of failures such as "Final Fantasy" and "Shrek" (yes, I considered "Shrek" a disappointment), in order to compare them to the likes of the far superior "Tomb Raider" (which I wanted to compare to 1995's "Mortal Kombat") and "Chicken Run," respectively.It may sound unfair, but at the same time it's led me to watch movies that I originally wouldn't have plunked the money down for in the first place."From Hell" is no exception. I first heard of it after reading an article i n a British film magazine, of all places. The plot, characters and setting quickly had me believing that this was going to be "Sleepy Hollow Redux," which is never a bad thing.As with the aforementioned 1999 Tim Burton masterpiece, Johnny Depp plays a Brit-accented police detective who tries to solve a series of grisly murders. Whereas "Sleepy Hollow" retells the legend of the Headless Horseman, "From Hell," directed by the Hughes Brothers, does likewise with the legend of Jack The Ripper, who, unfortunately, was never apprehended for his crimes.However, that's where the similarities end.While "From Hell" is by no means a letdown, I found that "Tomb Raider" had more in common with "Sleepy Hollow" than this did, but that's another story. It doesn't mean, though, that it's not entertaining. And yes, it has an engaging plot, though I had to see the film twice to fully get the gist of it.As always, the ever-versatile Depp steals the show. He stars as Fred Abberline, a drug-addicted inspector who sees visions of brutally murdered women in his narcotic-hazed dreams that ultimately come true. One thing leads to another and he is soon saddled with a serial murder case in which a group of gravely down-and-out prostitutes inhabiting London's sleazy, unpleasant Whitechapel District circa 1888 are being murdered one by one by a killer who is bedecked in a top hat and billowing cape and whom the public has nicknamed Jack The Ripper. He then takes his madness a step further and removes his victims' organs postmortem.To put it bluntly, this ain't Mary Poppins, folks. There are no homogenized visions of merry old England to be found here.Heather Graham plays alongside Depp as Mary Kelly, one of the circle of dirt-poor hookers who, while not being slaughtered, are constantly harassed and hounded by a seedy gang ? call them Victorian-age pimps, if you will ? for whatever small change they can scrounge up.The killer's "surgeries" cause Abberline to seek help from Dr. William Gull (Ian Holm), who just happens to be the physician to the royal family (and who has developed a skin-crawling medical treatment known as a `prefrontal lobotomy'). Their partnership ultimately reveals an exciting twist in the plot.Ian Richardson is effective as Abberline's pompous, anti-Semitic superior (he immediately believes a Jew is responsible for the killings), as is Robbie Coltrane as the inspector's sidekick, confidante and sounding board.I'm always in the mood for a good murder mystery film, and "From Hell" fits the bill nicely. I liked how little clues were peppered around the crime scenes, ranging from how the hookers' throats were slashed ("The cut goes from left to right; the killer is right handed," Dr. Gull surmises early on), to Abberline finding an empty sprig of grapes and detecting the scent of a potent alcoholic drink laced with laudanum on the victims' breaths.Plot and acting aside, the real standout of the film is Martin Childs' production design. The backgrounds and sets are so believable that one would never guess that the film was entirely shot in the Czech Republic, which it indeed was. The cinematography by Peter Deming brings viewers up close and personal to the action; it's almost as if you're part of the movie yourself as the characters stroll through Buckingham Palace or a dark alley. The exterior master shots of London are so beautiful that they look more like paintings borrowed from an art gallery.There are no real negatives about this film; my only gripes were that the scenes involving Dr. Gull's medical procedures and John Merrick (the Elephant Man) served only to shock the audience and did little to advance the plot, and it also seemed rather odd that Jack The Ripper would have a partner in crime (a nervous, bottle-swigging carriage driver played by Jason Flemyng), which, as a result, doesn't make him as imposing as he should have been. The flow of the movie is distracted in the third act when another woman, passed off as a French friend of one of the prostitutes, is suddenly thrown into the pot from out of nowhere for no known reason other than to apparently add to the body count.Yes, the term has become cliché, but "From Hell" is definitely not for the faint of heart. While the blood and gore is censored to some extent in the first act, more full-bleed (no pun intended) shots of the carnage are seen as the film progresses, and everything goes whole hog in the ending.What attracted the brothers Hughes to this film was the opportunity to make a period movie about street violence (a genre that hasn't been beaten to death enough already), which is a thin motive in itself. While it's not groundbreaking for the genre by any means - it lacks what made "Sleepy Hollow" and "Seven" so spellbinding ? it holds its own, though my mother noted that it was like watching "Murder By Decree" all over again.All comparisons aside, "From Hell" is a nice, if sometimes grisly, little piece of cinematic heaven. 8/10</fullReview>

"Plan 9 from Planet X" now has a rival for worst film of all time.To start it is the cleanest Whitechapel ever (better than today). Electric lights in rooms. Accents (Mary Kelly was Irish?)This could have been a good film. Unfortunately the plot was so obvious and the characters so shallow made this the so dire I would be surprised if Robbie Coltrane puts it on his C.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FROM HELL / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)It is the dramatically gruesome ideas that make this film what it is, but it is the poor execution of those ideas that makes this film what it is not. "From Hell" contains a few nice sequences, exquisite performances by Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Ian Holm, a very convincing technical department, and it has a superb third act. Unfortunately, despite those positive factors, the film as a whole doesn't quite work. Jack the Ripper committed five gruesome, ritualistic murders during a ten-week span in London during the fall of 1888. He was never caught. As the first tabloid star of the twentieth century, he is remembered as one of the most notorious serial killers in history. "From Hell" does not successfully bring him to life, though the Hughes brothers certainly breathe life into the era. The film's sets were created by Academy Award-winning production designer Martin Child. He and seventy artists and carpenters constructed a 20-acre set near Barrandov Studios. Their hard work pays off; the film embodies an entirely believable design. It's a great achievement from a technical standpoint. Based on a popular graphic novel, "From Hell" referrers to the return address on a letter from Jack the Ripper. The always entertaining Johnny Depp stars as it's recipient, Fred Abberline, a tormented Inspector who seeks temporary relief with opium. His unendurable addiction gives him visions of the future. Let's have some more about Abberline's internal struggles and opium addiction. Let's dive into his mind and explore the source of these visions and addictions. This is a very intriguing aspect of the character, but the film never really develops this subject. Instead we get a shallow, flat concept that never leaves ground. Inspector Abberline is called to duty when a vicious serial killer takes the lives of several prostitutes. As the bodies start piling, the inspector realizes his superiors are far more interested in preventing public panic than finding the killer. One figure, however, named Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), takes interest in Abberline. As a physician to the royal family, Gull is a powerful enough figure to assist Abberline in his investigation. They discover a secret that threatens everyone who knows it.Albert and Allen Hughes direct the film with a sense of precise detail. They took extreme measures to assure the film's effectiveness. They softened the lighting by placing a silk cloth over the rear of the lenses. They shot the flashback sequences on positive film. Fast motion and time-lapse photography give the movie a unique flavor. The cinematography creates an ominous presence. The Hughes' failure lies not within the technical aspects of the film, however, but within the misconnection with the audience. Despite a plot about the mystery and horror of Jack the Ripper, the movie is not particularly scary, nor does it work as a mystery. Watching the movie, I never found myself guessing the identity of the killer, nor did I follow the characters, or identify with which victim would be the next to go. There is no real sense of a puzzle here; the script does not give us enough to care about the killer or his victims. Much has been said about the film's violent content. Although it certainly suggests strong, gruesome violence, we seldom actually witness it. "From Hell" does contain some of the most grotesque images I have seen in film, but as a whole, Jack the Ripper's violent acts are not witnessed, but implied. During the murders, we usually only see a quick flash of a knife, and then partial glimpse of the aftermath of the victims. It's a letdown, since it's one of the few interesting things in the movie. All of this notwithstanding, even if there was more stomach-churning gore it would not have saved the movie. Violence relives tension, and "From Hell" does not build a single iota of suspense. No wonder why there is no sense of mystery or intrigue; for most of the film, we are sitting flat on our butts. In a movie like this, we want to be on the edge of our seats. To make matters worse, this film is almost two hours long. You know the sensation you get in your butt when you drive a car for a really long time? That cramped, anxious feeling that makes you want to get out of the car and stretch? That's how I felt during this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack the Ripper, whoever he is, once said "People will say I gave birth to the 20th Century", I don't know in what sense he meant, but he certainly made an impact in his time, and is still a significant figure of history. So this film set in 1888, Victorian London, focuses on the events concerning him. Basically drug-taking, premonition dreaming Inspector Frederick 'Fred' Abberline (Johnny Depp) is the man investigating the murders of many female prostitutes, with their throats slit and bodies mutilated, some with internal organs removed. One of the prostitutes in fear of this psycho Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), helping Abberline with the investigation Sgt. Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane), and Sir William Gull (Sir Ian Holm) is the man who later seems to be the most likely suspect. That's really all I can say about the plot. Also starring Ian Richardson as Sir Charles Warren, Jason Flemyng as John Netley the Coachman, Katrin Cartlidge as Dark Annie Chapman, Lesley Sharp as Kate Eddowes, Susan Lynch as Liz Stride, Terence Harvey as Benjamin 'Ben' Kidney, Annabelle Apsion as Polly Nichols and Estelle Skornik as Ada. It is a chilling story, and the filmmakers specifically wanted to keep the violence to a minimum, in my opinion I think they should have exploited it, or better yet, reveal the real identity of Jack the Ripper while doing so. Very good!</fullReview>
