		<shortDescription>The powerful, true story of what REALLY happened on the River Kwai during WW2.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE KWAI, the story of British POW's forced to build the Japanese jungle railroad, was my favorite book when it came out in 1962. Thus I was a bit apprehensive at what filmmakers would do to it when I heard about TO END ALL WARS, the title itself being changed. The film is different in many ways from the book, but is so powerful that the addition (apparently for dramatic excitement) of fictional characters bent on staging an escape can be forgiven. Agnostic Ernest Gordon's story of his being nursed back from the brink of death by Christian friends, thereby starting him on the road to faith--and incredibly, understanding and then forgiveness of the harsh brutality of his Japanese captors--raises this film far above any other WW2 films that I have seen (except perhaps the under-rated THE THIN RED LINE, like TO END...also filled with philosophical questions and ruminations). Although the brutality of the Japanese bushito system is shown in all its horrific brutality, some of the Japanese, especially the young man who serves as interpreter, are depicted as having touch of humanity. The film's central thesis seems to depict the affects of clinging to anger and vengeance versus seeking to be able to forgive and reconcile. The latter is shown at the end of the film when, similar to the scene in SCHINDLER'S LIST, the real Capt. Ernest Gordon and Japanese interpreter Nagase, now old men, meet and shake hands in Thailand at a memorial to those who died building the railroad. The creativity of the men, forming a Jungle University where Plato and Shakespeare are taught, is celebrated, calling to mind the inspiring film of women POW's, PARADISE ROAD. When this thought-inspiring film finally is released to theaters or video, don't miss it. It can serve as an antidote to the dozens of mindless, vengeance-based flicks cluttering up the screens of our cinemaplexes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "War" Movie That's About Values, Not War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a serious film lover who keeps up with the best new films. I stumbled across To End All Wars when it was shown recently on one of the Starz/Encore channels. At the end, I kept asking myself why I had never heard of it. The film is nowhere to be found in Roger Ebert's reviews or Leonard Maltin's annual guide, and yet I suspect that Ebert, at least, would rate this film very highly.I like films that are about something that is important, at least to me, and not just pure entertainment. Not that I don't enjoy a good action-adventure film or light comedy from time to time, but most of the time, I prefer to spend my time watching films that make me think and perhaps even ask questions of myself.To End All Wars is one such film. The Bridge on the River Kwai, which deals with the same historical events, is not, despite its many strong points. In this respect, To End All Wars is the better film, and the one that I am more likely to watch frequently.Despite its title, the film is not really about war. What it is about is the efforts of a small group of men, and one man in particular, to maintain their faith, their sense of values, and their very sanity under horrible, murderous conditions that would drive most men to insanity or to become murderers themselves.The film forces me to ask myself whether I could have done the same under those conditions. To be honest, I'm afraid to ask the question because I may not like the answer.Although the film depicts many horrible things, it is not a depressing film, at least for me. Rather, it's a positive, hopeful film, in the same way that Schindler's List is a positive, hopeful film. If one man, in the case of Schindler, or a small group of men, in the case of the ones in this film, can maintain their sanity, faith, and values in a world that has gone insane, then there is hope for mankind.As for the references to their Christian faith, it is not laid on with a trowel, as it might be in a lesser film. It is simply there as an important part of their lives. Whether or not we share that faith is beside the point. What is important is that they shared it, and that faith helped them to survive.Could the director and the writers have made their points even more effectively? Probably. Would I have liked to have known more about the individual characters? Definitely. Would the film have benefited from a larger budget? Possibly.All of these questions are moot, however. Every film deserves to be judged on its own terms, on the basis of what it is and not what it might have been. Not every film can be another Citizen Kane or Rules of the Game, nor should it be.Taken on its own merits, To End All Wars is an excellent film that I expect to watch many times and recommend to my family and friends as well. The fact that the film never got proper distribution, at least in the United States, and therefore never got the recognition that it deserves, shows just how shallow and superficial the Hollywood film industry has become. Thankfully it is available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a Japanese POW camp, a Scottish band of soldiers learns about a very different culture - the hard way. They also learn from the more refined and educated among them the meaning of serving each other and their enemies, to the point of self-sacrifice. The film begins rather slowly (and overly-sentimental) but becomes an incredible story with great acting and characters, powerful philosophy and imagery. Many gripping moments of self-realization, facing reality and appreciation for life and death. The depth of relationships, self-sacrifice and lessons learned leaves the audience with a lot to process. Overall, very inspiring and well-made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was not until the end of the film that I discovered that this was a real life account of the horrors suffered by the allied POW's building the Burma railroad.No film can ever show how terrible it was, despite the attempt to film in sequence with the actors dieting in order to lose weight as time went on. The actors would have had to do three years manual labor in the jungle heat for 18 hours a day on 1,000 (or less) calorie meatless slop, while suffering dysentery, beri beri, pellagra, tropical ulcers, regular beatings and other cruelty, all the time unaware of what was happening at home or how the war was going. They lived under the constant fear of being killed once they were no longer useful. By the time they were liberated the survivors were walking skeletons.It is a credit to the filmmakers that this relatively low budget movie conveys this terrible period so well and the fo. This should be a "must see" in school history classes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful in the way that Schindler's List was powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the reviews I've read of this film use the word "powerful" to describe it, and I will too. It's powerful because it's realistic; no stereotyped good guys or bad guys here (it's based on a true story, after all), and yet plenty of cruelty and some kindness, which leads to an exploration of themes such as justice and mercy in a way that (at last) doesn't lead to boredom or cynicism. It's *not* a light relief to watch this -- but nor was Schindler's List, possibly the only other prison-camp movie which matches this one for exploration of human motivation and hope.Oh, and it stars a crop of very respectable (and largely British) actors. Why, oh why has this never had a cinema release in the UK?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To End All Wars is a remarkably bold--almost brazen--film that deserves a wider distribution. As far as war movies go, it is much better than Thin Red Line, which tries to be thoughtful but only achieves a meaningless ambivalence. To End All Wars conveys its message in a clear yet profound way.As a Christian film, it shines as the boldest offering I have ever seen. Whereas popular depictions of religion (Seventh Heaven, anyone?) might mention an unspecified god every now and then, this film uses unmistakable metaphors and symbolism that blur the line between analogy and reality. It is one thing to put a cross in a shot. It is another thing completely to depict someone making sacrifices for his friends.Ultimately, To End All Wars makes no compromises, neither to those who think its rating does not match its message nor not to those who think it is too preachy. Some things need to be preached.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw this film as i tend to like films of this type about humanitarian stories, the fact that this one is true actual events made it even more powerful for me. it truly does bring home the facts of what the men from ww11 endured to make our world today as free as it is, and it is films like this one that should be shown as part of history curriculum in high schools. the film was brilliant, brutal, honest, extremely well acted, filmed and managed to touch me to the point of tears. Robert Carlyle was fantastic, as were the rest of the leads, i would give this film 9 out of 10 simply because 10 out of 10 would be perfection and perfection does not exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After repeated watchings my rating may go up. I love the movie THE THIN RED LINE and this movie reminded me of it strongly except it did not have the excellent cinematography that film did.I watched it because I like Robert Carlyle a lot and was not disappointed by his performance or any other of the actors on both sides of the war. The pacing was perfect and the violence was very brutal and sometimes unexpected but effective.The message it delivered to me made the movie for me. Loving thy enemy. Just realizing that we are all just humans caught up in something we didn't start. I highly recommend this movie if you like a film made with compassion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting just another 'Rambo' or 'Platoon' but instead got a 'Schindler's List' or 'The Pianist'. At the start of the film, I was all for Robert Carlyle to go on a rampage and kill the POW guards (or 'nips' as they are referred to in this film, and were during WW2). But as the story progresses, it turns into a story of self-sacrifice with Christian ethics. I must say, during the crucifixion scene, I shed a tear (which is VERY rare for me, and even more so since this is a low-budget film). This film is very moving, at times it can be hard viewing, but if this film does not move you then you have no soul - it's worth watching!!! Some of you might feel revenge, or (like me) forgiveness after watching it. The end message of the film is to test the viewer and ask them a question: Can you forgive your enemey and love and help them like a friend, no matter how much hurt and pain they cause you and your loved ones and to forgive them? I would highly recommend anyone with a human soul to watch this film, but if you like all the CGI, blood-for-fun, violence and drama of 'Saving Private Ryan' then you're not welcome here...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never had a movie have the effect this one had on me. This movie makes other movies look shallow and weak in my opinion. It made me really think about life, and the acting was so good. Not just another war movie, To End All Wars takes the true story of Ernest Gordon and veteran Argyle soldiers to the screen in a way that will turn your heart inside out. I honestly can't explain the effect this movie had on me, me and my friends sat silent as it ended out of astonishment. I recommend this movie to everyone I talk to about movies. It's a breath of fresh air because it makes some strong statements about morality and forgiveness, and is written beautifully.</fullReview>

Sutherland and Carlyle did a tremendous job . . . a powerful cast. True to the grim realities of war without being gratuitous - a refreshing dynamic! It's quite a different viewpoint of the same period as "bridge of the river Kwai" It seems like so many war movies are depressing, or even if they have real resolution, there is no real hope for the future. This movie uniquely brings hope regarding the human condition - even as men are ground within the mortar and pestle of war - they can look beyond themselves . . .to not only respect, but love their enemies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fatal helicopter crash (FHC) of a movie/shoulda been a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This thing commits 2 unpardonable movie-making sins, from whence spring all its awfulness. 1) There is no time or dialogue given to build up ANY sympathy for (or even a bare knowledge of) the characters. So the movie is constantly trying to pull on my emotions without earning it. That's sentimentalism. When the swelling Celtic or Triumph of the Human Spirit music came (and it came often) it was a farce! A joke! KILL 'EM ALL, CAUSE I DON'T CARE!2) It lacks any subtlety whatever. First, the omnipresent use of the Narrator is a dead giveaway. Narrators in moving pictures are ALWAYS questionable and usually show laziness or ineptitude or that they're dumbing things down. Using the Narrator throughout, as this turkey does, it becomes a short story acted out on the screen. It's sermonic. It defeats the purpose of MOVING PICTURES. Aren't movies moving pictures &amp; music &amp; dialogue being ACTED OUT to make us feel and think? TELLING us how to feel and think through narration or obvious dialogue betrays the intent of a movie. Secondly, the dialogue was unsubtle. A man saves his rations to give to a dying man. He tells the dying man that he has connections to get extra. Then the nice man is dying and the other wonders about it. An onlooker says, "He never got extra rations." STOP, OH PLEASE STOP. No, he goes and spells it out--"He was giving you his." Here's another--Narrator: "We didn't pay the captain back in kind; it began to eat at him." Show it subtly, don't just blurt it out loud! Here was a priceless one: Hardboiled, hard-talking Scotsman: "Whatever Dusty said to Ito, I knew that I had witnessed the power of forgiveness." I knew that I had witnessed the power of forgiveness?! Whoop! Thirdly, the symbolism was o so unsubtle and way overdone. The one-man-punished-for-all-the-unworthy-ones came up 3 or 4 times. One guy gets nailed Jesus-style to a literal cross! To me this cheapens Jesus's cross. If you're going to use that symbol show it in the distance, something! And the ending scene ends up mocking the much better Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. The movie had other serious problems. It didn't know what it wanted to be. By turns it's an escape movie, a life is meaningless movie, a knowledge makes life worth living movie--it tries to be too much. There's also too many emotional arcs. They're happy, they're sad, they're up, they're down, they're winning, no they're losing... And, the theology is bad. "Love your enemy" and "turn the other cheek" apply to personal injury not to wartime, unless you're one of those who believes all war is wrong. Finally, there was NO humor in the movie. In the worst of times, maybe especially in the worst of times, there is humor.My tag lines: "Christian movie-making at its best!" "Torture yourself by watching 'To End All Wars.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a war film, it features in a time of was with POW's and their jailers, but it is at its heart about the magnificence of the human spirit. A marvellous example of hope. The worst and the best of the human condition is on display, it doesn't succumb to tricks or props, it doesn't need to, because what it has is emotion. Get out your hankies. Be prepared for marvellous performances by all of the cast, nobody stands out because that was the way it needed to be played.This film is one of those you must see. I bought it for under ?5.00 at my Choices video store, and what a bargain that was. Go out and buy this film now and add it to your collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Refreshing? How can you call a movie with such graphic brutality and violence refreshing? Because it is a true story account of forgiveness. How can someone endure such pain, such torture, such inhumane treatment and in the end offer their brutalizers forgiveness. In our day and age of "dog eat dog" living, we need stories such as these to remind us that there is a better way, no matter what you have to endure.The movie is brilliantly written and brilliantly acted. You will want your friends and family to see this film! It is extremely unfortunate that the makers of this film could not get the financial backing for it to appear in theaters, it would have surely been a hit. I look at some of the movies that are out there today and they are so disappointing. Please send a message to Hollywood and endorse this work of art that should have made it into every theater in this great land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winning game plan, losing execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The material with which Cunningham et al were working with in this film was tremendous; unfortunately, their handling of it was not. Part "Bridge on the River Kwai," part, "The Great Escape," part "The Passion of the Christ" (heavily sanitized), the film probably suffered from trying to live up to the mastery of its predecessors.To begin with some positives, though: the photography is very good. Although some of the shots do a poor job of creating a sense of visual rhythm, each frame can stand alone as a still photograph. The shots are nicely balanced, and the lighting is rarely amiss. The acting also leaves little to be desired. This is one area in which Cunningham succeeding as a director: he really did a nice job of fostering an actor-friendly atmosphere and brought out the best in the respective players.However, as successful as Cunningham was in directing the shooting and acting, he was equally unsuccessful with the rest of the film-making process. To begin with, there is a comic litany of unlikely objects magically appearing in this remote Japanese prison camp. From a set of bagpipes, to a collection of clean dress uniforms, to a violin, to a wheelchair that would have made FDR envious, some of the decisions that were apparently made to enhance the dramatic effects of certain scenes stretched the imagination more than a little bit. It was also remarkable how well-shaven the POW's remained during their two-and-a-half year imprisonment.But those are relatively minor issues, I suppose. More damning is the general lack of perspective that the film provides, both narratively and spatially. For example, there is no feeling as to how long the march from the battlefield to the camp was, although I assume that it was supposed to be a long, arduous ordeal. Cunningham's issues providing narrative perspective were perhaps the most important flaw in the film. As a viewer, I was never able to grasp the difficulties that these men had in this camp. While the narrator (I believe the presence of the narrator to have been a mistake to begin with for this particular film) kept making references to the precariousness of their hold on life and sanity, the film never visually or narratively reinforced the grinding-down provided by the everyday reality of the camp. There are a handful of exceptional instances of oppression shown, but nothing that leaves you feeling the physical and mental exhaustion the prisoners faced every day. Instead, you see a lot of scenes of the prisoners as they perform Shakespeare, or discuss philosophy. On an intellectual, rational level, it is apparent how important these activities could have been to the prisoners, but this importance is never captured aesthetically.There is also precious little character development. Firstly, too many characters are important for all of them to be sufficiently developed in a feature-length film. There are too many stories to tell, without enough time to tell them all. The characters ultimately remain relatively static, in spite of the wonderful potential supplied by the plot to turn any one of these men into a compelling portrait. This lack of character development also saps the strength of many of the philosophical/religious overtones. Because it is difficult to connect to many of the characters, their sacrifices and transgressions mean much less than they should.Finally, as I hinted at before, the presence of the narrator eventually undermined any subtlety that the film may have had. While is some places the narrator's comments merely cheapened the "showing" (as opposed to "telling") of important thematic elements in the film, in many places the narrator's comments completely replaced any attempt to "show" the reality on which he was commenting upon, including his comments on the hardships of the imprisonment.While I have heard/read many people who have responded very emotionally to this film (in a positive way), I have a hard time understanding their sentiment. The film simply relies too heavily on abstraction rather than visual/narrative demonstration of the reality it is trying to depict to inspire any strong emotions in me. While the plot and characters contain a true treasure trove of potential, I feel like most of the potential was wasted on this particular film-making team.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There`s no such thing as a Scot who isn`t a fan of Robert Carlyle so I`m one of nearly five million people who has followed his career with some interest and vaguely remembered in 2001 he was starring in a POW drama called TO END ALL WARS but didn`t hear much else about the movie and after seeing it on TV a couple of nights ago I can certainly understand why it disappeared without trace . It is a very disappointing film First of all I confess that movies set in Japanese POW camps deserve to be seen by everybody , unlike post war German society Japan never ever refers to the atrocities committed by their side during the second world war . Japanese history books are devoid of entries involving the invasion of Manchuria , the rape of Nang-King , the Bataan death march , Korean " Comfort women " and the Burma railway . Of course Japanese text books do mention the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki but that seems to be the only referrences to the second world war which is a bit like present day Germany claiming the war started with the bombing of Dresden and finished with the Red Army invading Berlin and raping the local women . So any movie that portrays the Imperial Japanese Army in a bad light is okay in my opinion But the problem with TO END ALL WARS is two fold . First is the totally unfocussed characters . When the film was completed much was made that it " Starred " Robert Carlyle and Kiefer Sutherland but after seeing the movie it`s obvious that neither Carlyle`s character Campbell or Sutherland`s character Reardon is the main character - It`s Ciaran McMenamin`s Ernest Gordon the original author of the book and seeing both Carlyle and Sutherland are far better known faces than McMenamin the three characters compete for screen time in a rather uneven manner . Perhaps it would have been better if a fairly big name had been cast as Gordon with Campbell and Reardon being played by unknowns ? Especially since much of the tale is carried by Gordon`s narration . Secondly as several people have already pointed out much of the story feels like cliche . It`s probably not the fault of this production but why does every Japanese POW camp have to feature a loud brash American running a scam ? Both BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI and KING RAT feature similar characters . There`s a few other cliches along the way too As I said this is a disappointing movie and due to the subject matter a rather depressing one too</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a history buff I've seen a variety of war and POW movies. WWII movies happen to be a favorite as they seem to show special spirit of the nations in a hard fought fight against the Axis powers.Out of all of the war movies I've seen this one holds a great place in my heart.1) The story wasn't solely focused on an American soldier. While I love our soldiers many nations joined together to fight in WWII. It was really nice to see other nationalities hold the banner of freedom out in such a movie.2) The opening scene captures my heart.3) The soundtrack is one of the greatest I've heard outside the Thin Red Line.4) Kiefer Sutherland portrayal in the latter half of the movie is the greatest since the early days of his portrayal as Jack Baurer.5) This movie beyond anything else shares the greatest picture of redemption I've yet to see.I was in awe of this story throughout. It captivated my attention and refused to let it go. I've never enjoyed a movie enough to write a review on IMDb, but this broke every mold I know.</fullReview>

I honestly can not find out what is wrong about the film. The acting was way better than average and was extremely demanding. The script was good, not fantastic or anything, but hardly horrible. I wouldn't say it was a 10 star movie, but leaving hate comments of 1 star is extremely harsh and unfair. I recommend it along with the other greats of WWII films. As far as it being unrealistic... well I would say it probably never happened, but people deal with pain in different ways. They choose a much different path and I do think it is 100% believable because it has happened before. My last complaint is people complaining about violence or goriness in war movies. Honestly it's war what do you expect? I enjoyed it and I'm sure most people will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Profound film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To End all Wars": Starring Robert Carlyle ("Go Now"), Keifer Sutherland, and MANY talented men. As the film began, it felt like a cousin to "Bridge on the River Kwai", but the plot slowly morphed to an even MORE complex set of ethical issues, with divisions not seen in that great 1950's film. I see this new one as more related to the movie "Andersonville" - our own true American tragedy of a P.O.W. camp during the Civil War - and what THAT experience demanded of those interned. "To End all Wars" is certainly an anti-war film, and a true story, but looks at many individuals for the complexity of dealing with the horror...and offers bits of consolation...where it can be found. Its elegant ending reminded me of "Schindler's List". "To End all Wars" deserves to be considered a PROFOUND film.</fullReview>

Kieffer Sutherland brought his character to pulling you into his part, Mark Strong and Ciaran McMenamin played their parts as kindred spirits excellently.The best acting was Sakae Kimura playing Sgt. Ito. He never spoke a line of English through the film, but his facial expressions spoke massive volumes! I was completely taken aback with how well he communicated without even speaking my native tongue. My hat is off to him for such an excellent performance.If you enjoy films about humanity, perseverance against all odds, and learning the atrocities of war this will be well worth your time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an aspiring filmmaker and enjoy, possibly obsess, on watching a lot of movies. I am known as the "movie guy" and people ask me for my two cents about films all the time. When I heard of "To End All Wars" it sounded promising and decided to give it a try. It never came to a theater near me, but I did get to rent it when it came out on DVD. I have to say that touched me beyond any movie I have never seen and you can't even imagine how many movies I have seen. The directing was beyond glorious, that I'm sure Steven Spielberg would be moved. I very much liked how he portrayed the POW's and the Japanese soldiers. The POW's are very shaky, hand-held look while on the opposite side the Japanese are very still and clear cut. The story was powerful and something everyone can learn from. The Christian subtext is light and only adds to the characters. The acting was fantastic! Robert Carlyle and Kiefer Sutherland gave amazing performances, but I do think that they were upstaged by Ciaran McMenamin and Mark Strong. They convicted me and touched my soul as they brought out, only what I can call true life. If you want to watch something that will make a true impact on you and leave you breathless, then this is the movie to go with. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if I told you you will watch a war film but won't see so many war scenes? Would you believe me? Would you say "this can't be a war film!"? Well, believe me, TO END ALL WARS is this film! It's a very good WAR film where shots and guns are not seen very much. Maybe this movie should be named a "drama war" or anything like a "military drama". But let alone the genre. The important thing is to enjoy this nice movie with a different development: a Scottish group of soldiers are sent to Thailand to fight the Japanese force but ends up being kept as captive. The soldiers are forced to build a railway for the Japanese but some of them plan to escape from that hell. When they're together at night, they discuss what to do for their future but they don't seem to agree about it. The discussions (and arguments) arise and each of the prisoners defends his point of view. The acting is very good and our attention is 100% towards the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A powerful film about pow's in Burma/Thailand, who built The railroad of death during the 2nd World War.It shows many things about us humans, but most importantly it portraits hope, forgiveness, the bible and leaves a big question about what justice is. Very good movie indeed, acting and directing are superbly done and why i didn't see this film before now, blows my mind. This film can teach us a thing or two about being human.I highly recommend this beautiful film, but beware it's not for the faint hearted.Actually it touched me deep inside and made me think, what is life and why can't we live in peace without these agonizing wars!</fullReview>

What they don't realize is that even though the mob in Hollywood may have not liked David to much, or that no one took a massive bite into the distribution/cinematic release is that they just missed out on what could have been an amazing, AMAZING thing for the film world. Not only for their wallets but in every other aspect. I would still like to see this Film re-released in the Cinema, and have a big build up.

		<fullReview>For anyone who is interested in learning more about Ernest, please find his book. It was called Miracle On The River Kwaii. It may have been changed to To End All....I knew Ernest and he was helpful to me in my life. The movie doesn't go deeply into some of the torture that was really experienced - the book does so be warned.The character of Dusty is also a bit different in the book. The juxtaposition of his true sense of simplicity, and the other inmates intellectual prowess, anger and rage about their treatment is very interesting. How Ernest could survive - how any of them survived is beyond belief. Perhaps the Japanese sense of "Bushido" and many of the current Islamic beliefs show a parallel hereIt is helpful and hopeful. Ernest was a great man. I have made a web page about him and the film here if you have an interest www.pauladams.org/Stories/ErnestGordon.htm</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to watch but has a lot of emotive issues which many can identify with. The university of the Jungle was inspired and empowered the POW's with a sense of purpose and hope. "Dusty" was almost over the top in his offer to be a substitute. Kiefer also had that same quality after he came to his senses. The credits at the end of the film showing both Japanese translator and the teacher being reunited at the cemetery was as moving as the film itself. It was pretty gruesome to watch the brutality being inflicted on the prisoners. What they accomplished in the building of the railroad through such horrendous and challenging conditions was extraordinary. The suffering of that challenge and the response of the prisoners to their captors certainly speaks for forgiveness. It is similar to the hearings in South Africa just a few years ago.</fullReview>

I continue to be amazed at man's inhumanity to man, and equally amazed at how some men rise above all of that to live and die with integrity. This is the true story of POWs in WWII. It will change you and challenge you. Everything about it is excellent-- screenplay, direction, acting, production value, commentaries. But be forewarned. It's brutal. This story was originally produced as "Bridge on the River Kwai," but this is the TRUE version. The original was changed and sanitized. I was especially touched by the several scenes near the end where characters reached their natural conclusion, and by the postscript, which brought the viewer to the present.

		<shortDescription>Good subject - shame about the script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie covers an interesting - and important - episode in the history of the war with Japan, and it ought to be realistic, being based on the actual experiences of Captain Ernest Gordon as a Japanese prisoner of war. But it is let down by a clichéd, lightweight script, more suited to the playful inanities of Dad's Army than the harrowing deprivations and violence of life in a concentration camp.The direction and editing too are amateurish: the end result is a disconnected sequence of scenes, with little narrative or emotional development. Only Robert Carlyle's passion, James Cosmo's gravity and the Japanese commanders' brutal aggression make some of the early scenes convincing, shockingly so. But realism soon evaporates as we see fit, healthy, well-fed men suddenly start dying (which has to be explained with voice-over); we find the prisoners mysteriously transported back and forth between the camp and the railroad construction site, over a hundred kilometers away; and the soldiers who labor hard by day are wakeful and eager of an evening to indulge in philosophical study.I wonder though why I am almost alone in dissenting? It seems that the movie's wholesome homespun morals appeal too readily to sentimental Christians.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of the film To End all Wars when I picked it up at my local library because it looked like a good popcorn kinda war movie and had one of my favorite actors in Robert Carlyle. I must say how wrong I was, do not see this movie as a popcorn film, it is as far from that as something like Schindlers List. It is a very disturbing and powerful film about men mostly Scottish who are taken prisoner by the Japs in World War 2, and are tortured and forced to build a railroad to India on very little food. The movie is filled with great little things as well as all the great big things, my favorite is that one of the characters in called. He is called Yanker, as they say its because he's American and he's kinda a w_anker. The film is filled with wonderful little touches like this making what would have just been a very good film into a truly great picture and one of the best war films ever made.</fullReview>

Many of the characters go through complete transformations throughout the course of the movie, and we get to witness this firsthand. sometimes we get caught thinking 'why would he do that' when a character commits a particularly selfless act, and I think that is a big part of the writer's intent.There's a lot of historical, literary, and biblical allusions which add to the complexity of the movie, and ultimately I think it adds depth and helps us to understand the transformations of the characters.The movie is all the more amazing when you consider it is based on a true story.I would recommend this movie but beware it isn't a walk in the park to watch.</fullReview>

Kiefer Sutherland is one of my wife's favorite actors and was, frankly, the only reason I rented it. I am SO glad I did! I remember the moment, when they helped the injured Japanese, when I realized that "To End All Wars" was not so named as reference to the WWI slogan, but as subtle hint that the only way we, as a race, will ever outgrow war is when we all realize that we are truly killing our brothers and when we understand that the wars will cease. To kill the enemy you must hate him. If you can love your enemy you cannot kill him. More, if you can love you enemy more than yourself, he cannot kill you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I cannot understand the tired and cynical comments by 'Coventry' at the top of this page or the measly rating of 7.2 out of 10. 'An average war film' indeed ? one has to wonder whether he/she actually watched it! You only have to read the comments by viewers on this page to see the truth ? this is a brilliant and important film. It puts the typical 'Hollywood WW2 blockbuster' completely in the shade and shows them up for what they are ? just entertainment for the unthinking masses and big profits for the film moguls. This film shows how real and ordinary men behave in extraordinary circumstances and fortunately is devoid of the Waynes, Mitchums, McQueens, Hanks etc. and their like. I have to compliment the Japanese actors for having the courage to portray their fellow countrymen committing such awful acts of violence. The film is very well acted and very thought provoking. The only criticism I can make is that (naturally) all the POW actors looked too well fed and muscular! The reality is that they were mainly skin and bone and disease ridden (shown briefly in black and white photos). I had a problem knowing which approach I would have taken under the same circumstances ? the quiet forgiveness of your enemy or the burning desire to take revenge on them for perpetrating such hideous war crimes.This film should be made compulsory viewing for every man and woman over 18 years of age. Perhaps then people would get some idea of what 'going to war' can lead to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too formulaic and overdone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No wonder that this movie became nowhere a success. It was made at a time when dozens of war movies were being made every year. This movie adds very little extra to the genre and offers few surprises or insight information about things we didn't knew yet.Also problem is that the movie just isn't much interesting because very little is actually happening in it. Just analyze this movie for a moment. Is it really the interesting story approach of the prisoners starting a school and start learning about so called 'deeper' philosophies. And here also lays a problem. The movie is toward the end trying to get philosophical and with deeper meanings in it but due to the way of film-making it feels too forced and because of that it gets overdone and works ineffective.All of the genre clichés you could expect from a movie like this are present here; A mean camp commander, a more friendly guard, escapes and escape plans, one group of people who wants to escape and others who want to stay put and the list goes on. Of course I understand that its hard to be original with a concept of a movie set entirely in a POW-camp but they at least could had put in some more surprises and less formulaic characters.Also the casting didn't helped much. Whose bright idea was it to cast Ciarán McMenamin (who?) as the main character. The movie is further more filled with some well known actors such as Robert Carlyle, Kiefer Sutherland and James Cosmo but it all makes you wonder; wouldn't they characters be just as effective and good if they were being played by lesser known actors? The actors performances just don't add enough to the characters and their development. You can see that this movie is a waste of such a fine cast.The characters are also one of the problems I had with this movie. They don't ever fully get developed and you just never feel close or attached to any of them. I once again results in the fact that the emotions of the movie don't work out because you quite frankly just don't care.The movie also isn't very effective with showing how brutal and hopeless the situations in the camps were. The lacks a certain atmosphere of danger and perhaps even is too light on the subject, despite having some violent and cruel sequences in it. But all of those moments are rather predictable and you can sense them coming from miles away. It makes them ineffective and also makes the movie feel all the more formulaic and forced.The movie doesn't look cheap but it feels like a cheap one nevertheless, due to some lame camera-positions and editing techniques at times. Also the fact that the movie begins almost immediately set in the POW camp just doesn't work out effective. It just makes you feel cheated that you missed out all of the action, which obviously occurred but wasn't shown on screen. Lots of cruel things are happening to the characters but problem is that we don't know them yet, so to say it boldly, why should we care what happens? The directing and choices they made just aren't much good and I doubt we'll ever hear some big things from director David L. Cunningham in the future.But obviously this movie is of cause much better than just your average B-war movie. It's definitely a watchable movie but really not deserving of the high rating and praise it is currently receiving on here. It's a watchable but above all a very redundant movie that adds nothing new to the genre.I just don't see how this movie does do any justice to the real POW, by the Japanese during WW II. This movie offers nothing more than formulaic entertainment with drama that feels too forced and overdone to find this movie ever credible or powerful, despite it all being based on true events.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Beach), Kiefer Sutherland (TV's 24, A Few Good Men, A Time to Kill, The Lost Boys, Phone Booth), Cieran McManamin and Mark Strong shine through in Oscar worthy performances in this powerful true story of (as the tag line says) the will to survive and the courage to forgive.Director David L. Cunningham's film, based on World War II veteran Ernest Gordon's book, is a thing of beauty. Never mind all those so-called 'American Classics' like American Beauty and The Cider House Rules. Don't get me wrong, those are excellent movies, but I just see To End All Wars as better film-making triumph. The film shows the true horrors that British and American soldier faced in a Japanese prison camp during WWII.With McManamin and Strong being little-known actors, I thought that Carlyle and Sutherland would over-shadow them. But that is not the case as they act as supporting material to McManamin's breathtaking leading performance and Strong is equally as 'strong'.But To End All Wars doesn't just have wonderful performances. Every last detail is done to perfection, especially Cunningham's direction. But, there is one thing that does puzzle me and that is if Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and The Rock are both in IMDb's Top 250, then why isn't this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing to say is that if you are looking for a war movie with big battle sequences that shows men singlehandedly holding back a complete division with only a pistol and some foul language, you best look elsewhere.If you are looking for a movie that gives a little insight into what happens to a man when he gets stripped of dignity, morality and even base humanity, you NEED to see "To End All Wars." I have never been a P.O.W. or even served in uniform so I would never dare to say that I would do this or that or even compare myself with any of the main characters in this movie, but I FEEL that the acting, the portrayal of men who WERE there was brilliant. Although some of the scenes in the movie were fictional -- such as the use of a wheelchair for one of the men who had been paralysed from the waist down -- the balance of scenes as taken from the autobiographical novel were very well done.This movie tells the true story of men being held in a P.O.W. camp by the Japanese and being used as slave labourers to construct a railroad to allow the Japanese a method to conquer more territory in Asia. What impressed me more than anything else was how the movie did not play down the brutality of Japanese soldiers in WWII because it might offend sensibilities. History should not be pasteurized because if we water things down we might end up repeating such things in the future. ALL countries have had their "dark" eras.I enjoy any movies that depict the military because I am an amateur military historian. This particular movies earns high marks in ALL areas, cinematography, acting, directing and most important, remaining accurate to real events. If you have NOT yet seen it, I envy you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Moral Premise Without Being Too Preachy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What separates this film from most run-of-the-mill war movies was its powerful moral premise--while excluding senseless and unnecessary scenes of violence. What could be more profound than showcasing two of the Bible's most virtuous passages of loving one's enemy as well as loving your fellow man to the point where one is able to sacrifice his life in order that the other may live in two heart rending scenes--which offered a satisfying payoff for viewers. While this film made analogies to and alluded to scriptural passages--it did not come across as too preachy either--which could be a turn off to mainstream moviegoers. If this wasn't the case then perhaps such a film, which was based on a true story, would not exist had these POWs felt the need to convert these Japanese prison guards through conventional methods of proselytizing instead of winning them over through their fine example, conduct, resilience and moral fiber in the face of extreme adversity like they did in real life--which speaks more powerfully that any passage from Holy Scripture, Shakespeare or any other words of wisdom for that matter. Just imagine, if all Christians imitated the example of these POWs--ending all wars in Christian lands would not be out of the realm of possibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkable Picture About the Cruelty of War and Forgiving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen this movie on television and just had to make a comment about it. It has been the second or third time I've watched it and it never got boring even though I knew the scenes.To not spoil this movie for people who haven't seen it, I won't go into detail. Anyway, there has been written a lot about it on the internet. You do get to see a lot of cruel scenes in this movie but never find any scene inappropriate. Anyway, the things in this movie have really happened as it is based on a true story. It is the story of a handful of soldiers from the 93rd division of the Scottish "Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders". They had been imprisoned as POWs by the Japanese during WW II. While they were in the prison camp the Japanese decided that they had to work on a railway between Burma and Thailand. This railway, part of it being the infamous "Bridge over the River Kwai", is still best known as the "Death Railway", since approximately 150,000 POWs and native workers died during its construction.What makes this movie so brilliant is the moving portrayal of their characters by Carlyle and Sutherland, who both deserved at least an Academy Award nomination for their efforts, in my opinion. The directing is very nicely done as well, I cannot tell of any flaw witnessed.Being based on the true story of Ernest Gordon, one of the few survivors, this picture is simply a must-see. It shows without any restraint the way war really is and what it was like to have to suffer being a POW in this prison camp. Additionally, it also shows the only way of surviving mentally the things you were to experience there. And that is forgiving your enemy.</fullReview>

It ultimately brings us to the conclusion that there is more to life than hate and vengeance. The end of the movie was one of the most moving scenes, two former enemies now enjoy life and remember the fallen together. Very powerful! We also see a powerful moment when the American (Sutherland) takes responsibility for something he did not do in order that the rest of the group will not be punished.

Knowing some information about WW2, the Japanese did some terrible things to other countries and the people they captured. And this film will show how terrible it was for the Japanese prisoners of war labour camp and might makes some audiences get really angry and some may find some scenes difficult to watch, by showing many types of torture. Showing the humanitarian aspects of the movie can be haunting and yet powerful and showing how brotherhood and friendship during the times of being a prisoner of war was very touching. This was a inspirational film and I found that everyone of the cast put on a great performance.

I feel it right to stop there because the description of the film itself does no justice at all to its sheer brilliance.the supporting cast,kiefer sutherland &amp; robert carlyle was reason enough to watch this film as thy play an extremely integral part to the tale,but alas this film is quite 'sickeningly' underrated. it teaches the power of forgiveness (as its tag line suggests)&amp; i hope if the film was a real person it could forgive the Oscar film board and public.this film is the only film where despite the antagonistic portrayal of the Japanese, it has great respect for there culture via dialogue and also the development of the characters. The character 'Edo' (the shin-obi code faithful commander) is one to watch out for, despite his few lines in the film his elegance,stern demeanour &amp; performance shines through. Not many people noticed this i believe &amp; as not to spoil it there is one very beautifully emotional scene part way through the film which anyone who is going to watch it will know what i am talking about involving a prisoner called 'dusty' and the commander 'edo'.I am one man who cannot make a difference with this,i hope my word will not fall on deaf ears and you go out &amp; watch this film on DVD. i have seen all the war films that have been praised, this really is the best one i have seen, THERE!,I SAID IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is a tribute to the principle that "they can imprison my body, but they cannot imprison my spirit". As a metaphor for all life it can give hope to anyone who feels that they are trapped by a nightmarish prison of circumstances they cannot escape - how to live a fully human life when escape is not possible. One of it's most dramatic elements is when the film's ultimate pragmatist (Sutherland) has to choose between facing this nightmarish tyranny with the courage of hope as his fellow inmates or with the cowardice of convenient compromise as is his character. A truly inspiring, and moving film. The brutality shown however is not for the weak of stomach. This is a war film the way war really is. The acting is exceptional, and the production value is stunning for a film that was not produced a big studio budget. As most true stories about real people are, it is engaging, but that also is because it is well told. The film picks up with the gripping details of the Japanese prison camps where "Bridge over the River Kwai" left off. I'd give it an 8 out of ten.</fullReview>

It's an unflinching look at the ugliness we are ALL capable of, as well as the incredible capacity for good that lies within each of us as well. The emotions were real, increasing the impact of the central message of forgiveness as the key to inner freedom, dignity and hope. We ALL need to hear and live that, and to see fellow human beings live it in front of our eyes in such desperate conditions speaks to the possibility we all have to choose it as well. I found it a truly inspirational, life changing film and hope it receives wide coverage around the world. It could change the way we live as individuals and as nations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To End All Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To End All Wars" Starring Robert Carlyle,Keifer Sutherland and Mark Strong.The lead is played by Cairain McMenamin as Earnest Gordon who is our guide through the hell on earth that was the Burma Railway. It isn't your typical action war film with clear cut heroes and villains,more an exercise in morality.How do you deal with extremes and maintain some kind of moral code.?The Carlyle character is a man's man soldier and wants death or glory.It is pointed out to him there can be no glory because what would you do even if you did escape?Nevertheless he consumes himself with hatred for his captors and plans of escape even though he knows it will lead to reprisals against everyone.He has lost his ability to connect with others.Eventually he tries to escape and inevitably he and his fellow would be escapees are executed.However Mark Strong,whose character is an ardent Christian,decides to sacrifice himself to save Carlyle.The Japanese have seen a depiction of the crucifixion in his bible and choose to kill him this way.How do you evaluate this?If you think about it,he gets to have his cake and eat it.He is "liberated" from his situation and has performed the ultimate selfless act by saving someone.But has he?Imagine the guilt that the Carlyle character must carry around for the rest of his life.I imagine no one could live up to that. I read about a guy who saved himself from the Herald Of Free Enterprise by standing on someones head to lever himself up,but condemning the other guy to drown.A more natural reaction perhaps,but what a thing to live with.The Keifer Sutherland Character provides an insight as to how crisis can change people.He is known as Yanker due to being American and a bit of a J.Arthur Rank(er). As the Death Railway is being built he becomes adept at black racketeering with the locals and the Japanese.He has no qualms about this even if it screws things up for everyone else. He develops a sense for the needs of others when he joins the study group set up by Earnest and they discuss Plato,the nature of justice,forgiveness and various other moral questions. A shovel goes missing and the Japanese are about to seek revenge when Yankers says it was him.He receives the mother of all beatings and becomes paralysed.It emerges there was a miscount and it was for nothing. Why did he do it?It is left to us to decide.Perhaps to punish himself for previous conduct.I like this about the film.You aren't directed what to think.This cruelty brings us to the Japanese.What are we to make of their behaviour? The Bushido Shame Code is explained.It seems guards at POW camps were only there as punishment for some act of cowardice and disgracing the Code and therefore the Emperor himself.This may explain the extreme behaviour towards POW's themselves,in the Bushido system,the lowest of the low for surrendering.At least they weren't as bad as the prisoners and they could take their own frustrations and sense of worthlessness out on them. However,acts of kindness are portrayed.The translator interacts on a human level and the Commandant rewards the men with Red Cross Parcels and books for hard work.Our image of Japan in the West is inevitably shaped by these events. It is a weirdly homogeneous society where the individual is submerged by the honour system.This is exhibited in unusual things such as if a company is doing badly,the directors would rather go without pay than lay people off as it is seen as disgrace to do so.The opposite is true here! Japan was totally cut off from the West until the 19th Century and evolved differently as a result.In a daft sense it was only the contact with the West that brought out the worst in them as capitalism and the Code led to a ruthlessness that was shocking in the extreme.Imperialism and a nd a superiority complex were a disastrous mix. I'm interested by how they turned it around post war.It's an idiosyncratic place but the extremism seems to have gone.How and why? The Pliger documentary "Behind the Mask" uncovers some ideas.Lastly I think that the fact the Japanses were portrayed as yellow peril made it easy to drop the atom bomb.Even if the Allies had developed it a year earlier,I don't believe it would have been used against Germany.The film ends with a meeting a la Schindler's List between Earnest and the translator.He can forgive but I understand why others can't.A great film,hard going and lacking mawkishness</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is well shot and well acted. But it does go a bit over the top and takes forever to reach its inspiring/wimpish ---check one--- conclusion. It's "Bridge On The River Kwai" for people who are tired of watching that old standard on the late show for the seventh time but still need a new fix of brutal Japanese and starving Brits who, despite all else, have kept their stiff upper lip. Not to trivialize the horrors that occurred, this film still looms larger than life. And the heavenly choral music in the background during the interminable denouement is, well, a bit much. Nor does it explain how destitute, starving, mistreated POW's in the middle of the Thai jungle manage to keep their wrist watches and pipes (both the smoking and musical varieties), smoke cigarettes and be cleanshaven every day (except for the one guy with his neatly trimmed regimental moustache.) Having said all that, you can be quite certain it never will turn up as an in-flight movie on Japan Airlines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was the main problem with this movie, the 'messages' are delivered with all the subtlety of a spade in the face. Over and over again.I found it hard not to cringe as these examinations of human nature were forced repeatedly down my throat, and in case you miss them the soft speaking Scots guy drills home the points in his narration.If you want a film about character, ethics, morals and the corruption that war wreaks upon humans then watch Apocalypse Now! This film devalues the messages it tries to get across (although they may be occasionally valid) by simply trying too hard. Like a Disney film, but less subtle... like the last few minutes of an episode of the He-Man cartoons.The direction is capable and the acting is competent... although it was hard not to laugh at Kiefer as it always is when he isn't Jack Bauer. Robert Carlyle was good but extremely orange.The only thing missing from this film was a big group hug, a song and dance number or a cameo from God. That would have really wrapped it up nicely.</fullReview>

I loved this movie and would highly recommend it to others, especially if you like movies like "the flowers of war, Saving Private Ryan, Schindlers list, The Thin Red line, K-19, Fury" and other of the greatest war dramas in Cinema.It's not a easy movie to Watch, and not for the faint of Heart but well worth a Watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To End All Wars is another fine example of well directed and produced war movies, with even and gifted cast - names like Robert Carlyle or Kiefer Sutherland are just more well-known. Brutality of war and misery of war prisoners are realistically depicted - as well the events and deed that made most of the POW's survive the three harsh years filled with forced labor, hunger and tropical diseases, and how changed conditions reveal new features among people.This movie is probably not for women as female figures appear on screen within a minute only. But if you like war movies and small closed location does not bother you, then To End All Wars is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The not so cheerful bridge over the river Kwai</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie totally slid by me when it came out and I am usually pretty good at spotting good war movies. It was a really well crafted movie that kind of felt like a realistic version of the factually flawed movie "The Bridge over the River Kwai. No catchy whistle tunes, just the cold harshness of the non Geneva convention signing Japanese Imperial Army.The story follows a group of British soldiers as they surrendered to the Japanese and came to suffer the war as slaves in a POw camp. It illustrates the cold, in human treatment they suffered and how they survived in the face of such adversity and evil. It is a great tale, as gut-wrenching as it is, of both the evil humans do to each other and the strength that we can have to survive.The movie was filmed pretty well, and the actors, especially Robert Carlyle gave strong performances. As good as it was I still do think there was room for improvement, and it was still a somewhat sanitized version of what life in these camps were really like. Perhaps that was to get through the censors or the just didn't want to create a controversy or face a backlash for being to grotesque, such as the controversy "Saving Private Ryan," received for being to realistic in regards to it's D-Day scenes.I do think it is a movie worth watching for the history alone.Like my reviews, hate em?

		<fullReview>As a metaphor the "original" Bridge over The River Kwai is arguably a better movie with its development of the David Niven character, but this one packs a much bigger punch in the reality department - This is probably as close to depicting life in a POW-camp at the time as it is possible to get without actually injuring the actors or making a documentary. Obviously this is closely related to the fact that this movie is based on actual events depicted in a biography by the main character, but is is still surprising how close it gets (I swear it looks like the Sutherland character barfs for real after a particular savage beating - if not its certainly incredible acting ;-) ). And considering the tiny budget its downright fantastic. Personally I find the many religious allegories a bit too much, but I have no doubt that thats what helped the POW's at the time. All the same I'm guessing this particular POW-camp was an exception, because I doubt that many soldiers (actually both enemies and POW's) would be so civil. Off course for mankind's sake I hope I'm wrong ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just returned from seeing this movie. In the way that opening scenes from "Saving Private Ryan" were both riveting and disturbing, and the theme of average individuals rising to rare levels of sacrifice and honor was portrayed in the same movie, I was deeply impacted by this retelling of real life events. It is showing in Phoenix theaters for a limited engagement, and should not be missed.The previous post about Christian themes is accurate - the Christian faith of a few men do serve as a prominent theme. However, it is worth considering that deleting these aspects of the story would taint the experience it is portraying, perhaps in the name of political correctness. I'll offer that censure of those elements would color the reality of what happens when some find themselves in a place that tests their convictions at the core.This is not a "feel good" movie - I left it disturbed, but also inspired to re engage ordinary courage and honor in my comparatively tame existance. This is a movie that I will see again, with my 16 year old son (R rating is for violent scenes and language).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at the Hawaii Film Festival/Big Island showing. Director David Cunningham, a local boy making good, was able to meet with viewers after the feature to discuss its making and reactions to its viewing. Even without this 'extra', it was a powerful and humbling film to watch. It recounts -- without the jingoism of 'Bridge on the River Kwai' -- the circumstances around the building of the Burma-Thai railroad during WWII using prison/slave labor under horrific conditions. But what might have been unrelentingly grim instead is a challenge and a view of the possibilities that can happen when hatred is met with non-resistance. Not simple passivity, rather with a commitment to choosing what is good, where meaning may be found. In the face of this dedication, the other's hatred is not confirmed by your own hatred, but is challenged in ways that weaponry and strategic battle plans can't accomplish. I look forward to this having national release -- sometime in 2002 as I understand it.</fullReview>

The film carries a great message while telling the true story of scotish POW Ernest Gordon in WWII in a japanese camp.

Graphic in places but not overdone.Hopefully, this film will cause it's viewers to re-think their stance on war. It goes beyond the normal anti-war film message of "War is hell, therefor we should stop engaging in war.". It gets down to the personal level of re-evaluating hate, justice, mercy and forgiveness. This is the level where our own wars are fought. How many of us have the courage to go beyond the justice of "an eye for an eye" to the forgiveness of "turn the other cheek"?"To End All Wars" might make you think about these questions.

		<fullReview>James Cosmo, Robert Carlyle &amp; the token Hollywood Superstar Keifer Sutherland are the main protagonists here.Playing soldiers captured by the Japanese during World War 2 who are made to build a railway.On its own this is an amazing movie with a brilliant cast (especially the supporting actors) but when you find out at the end it is based on a true story it makes it even better.Some of the atrocities committed by the Japanese are truly awful, beating a prisoner on his 1st day at a camp for disobeying a rule he hadn't even been informed of. Forcing prisoners to sign something that says they won't try to escape.Executing prisoners in cold blood (James Cosmo is murdered for refusing to sign and haranguing the Japanese Commander). The Japanese are constantly referring to Bushido, The Warriors Code of Honour but never once are they honourable in their conduct to their prisoners.Even when they are rewarding them with gifts, they are giving them Red Cross parcels that rightfully belong to them anyway.There are many examples of extreme violence and senseless cruelty towards prisoners that may put many potential viewers off. Making men dig graves then shooting them into the graves they have just dug for themselves (at the very start of the film!).Almost beating a man unconscious for not bowing to a guard even though no camp rules have been explained to them as new prisoners. Beating a man until he is crippled with a shovel for theft even though it is discovered no theft occurred, it was a simple mis-count.Crucifying a man is the worst example of this cruelty. This film is difficult to watch at times but deserves to be much better known about.Watch it and pray no war ever happens like this again.</fullReview>

It's also such a parallel to what Jesus did to us, he forgave us our sins and died instead of us.

		<fullReview>The differences between Japanese Bushido and Western Christianity are illustrated in a convincing way in "To End All Wars." While it is not possible today to show the true harshness of conditions in a WW2 Japanese prisoner of war camp this movie goes a long way to demonstrate the type of treatment POWS experienced. The psychology of the POWS and their guards is an interesting feature. Another film which explores this interaction is "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence." My main criticism of "To End All Wars" is with the casting of some of the officers in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the 93rd Regiment, not Division, of the British Army. The colonel is way too old to be leading the battalion in 1942. Robert Carlyle also appeared to be an unlikely second-in-command, though he did a good job portraying the emotions of someone under extreme tension. This movie is more realistic than "Bridge on the River Kwai" and is a very good about portraying a sad but significant time in history which still has lessons for the present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A powerful film. If the story was not based on true incidents it would appear contrived and the negative critics might be vindicated. But it happened.Those who scoff at the love your neighbor concept must realize that soldiers faced these difficult questions daily. Forgiving a person for taking your spot in the bank line is one thing, but what if he killed your friend? If violent images unsettle you watch with caution, but if you can brave Ryan, you can handle this film. The acting is superb and worth the watching alone, but the forgiveness message rings clear and present. For those who say Christians don't make first rate films, say it no more; this is the kind of film Christians should produce, but for reasons of reality resist.Set in a WWII Japanese prison camp the men undergo brutality designed to destroy their dignity. The shifting character arcs take place not only between the prisoners but spread to their captors with layered subtlety that only multiple viewings can uncover. Did the ending really happen? Yes.Kiefer Sutherland's focus is riveting, and he may be the only actor you know, but other actors ?Robert Carlyle, Ciaran McMenamin, and James Cosmo - give a clinic on the craft.This film never hit the screen, it went straight to DVD. It is a gem among walls of silly stories and special effects eye candy. Watch it and you may want to own it to view again. A great discussion film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I believe was made before or at the same time as Gibson's Passion. However, this story has a parallel meaning to what the Passion tried to bestow-forgiveness and redemption. It's set during World War II, where the Argyll Highlander regiment gets captured by the Japanese Army in Asia. As they surrender, they are treated below any type of human accommodation that even a simple animal may have. The story portrays life in a Japanese POW camp. The Japanese held to their philosophy that if you have to surrender and yet you didn't kill yourself because of the shame, they have every right to treat you way below a common animal. Or in other words, the code of Boshido is the ruling doctrine. The movie is extremely moving at the way these soldiers try to resurrect living "death" into a personal achievement of survival and discovery. Especially, during the funeral of their colonel where the officers and men are assembled during the service, and the playing of the pipes to "Amazing Grace" brings a moving synthesis in how the rest of the movie will be narrated upon. This is just one of many important scenes in the movie. It's a movie that by watching it will have a powerful and profound affect upon anyone who thinks that life is just about materiality and not above a higher meaning. The acting is superb. In my opinion, this is definitely one of Kiefer Sutherland and Robert Carlye's best films in which they did. If you like substance, you will love this movie. This is definitely one of the best movies to have come out. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

Is forgiveness a by-gone promise of something that once existed.Anyway,this is getting deep,back to the film.From the off,it is clear that the film is somewhat low budget,but this only adds to the effect that the director is trying to create.The cast,it seemed,worked together to create not only shining individual performances,but every character is feasible,natural,and most importantly,believable.I cannot stress the quality of the cast in print.Robert Carlile is superb! Exceptional even! And this shock effect that the film has,it does not stop at the characters,but the whole plot is structured so that emotion itself shines from the screen.And another thing,if I ever meet the scriptwriter,he'll never go thirsty again!You might have noticed that I have disclosed almost nothing about the events themselves,and are rightly wondering why.Heed the answer: This film is beyond description.It takes film making a step further than 'brilliant'. For me,there is an obvious way to assess a film,that being the age old question:'does it change your view on the world?',and I answer - this film does.And however brief that change of view may be,it is precisely what makes 'To End All Wars' worthy of remembrance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redemption Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be wary of this film if you are a cynic. To End All Wars shows redemption for humanity compared against the unforgiving mantra of human nature. Before seeing this film I would recommend reading a little on the Bushido Code: Samurai code of honor: the code of honor and behavior of the Japanese warrior class, emphasizing self-discipline, courage, and loyalty (Encarta Encyclopedia). This loyalty spoken of indicated that the more brutal you were to captives, the greater your loyalty to the emperor. This will help to explain why a film about redemption needs to show so much violence. Being a combat veteran, I understand the nature of war and the hatred it sparks. To End All Wars shows today's audience the brutality that The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) could not show due to viewer morays of the 1950s. David Cunningham the director with a documentary background breaks away from conventional film making using hand-held camera work that does NOT make your eyes hurt like Bourne Supremacy(2004).Moya (Maire) Brennan, Enya's sister lends to the soundtrack her ethereal touch bringing an emotional high to an already wonderful film. Break away from over-the-top action flicks and take a journey with David Cunningham to a time when the world was at war with itself and within the very souls of those who fought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has to be one of the best World War II movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should have been promoted more widely by the producers. Favorable word of mouth is now gaining the audience it deserves. The acting, script, cinematography, music and themes combine to make this an outstanding film. The director dares to take seriously important questions about courage, justice, forgiveness, anger, reconciliation and redemption. The transformation of the POWs during their 2 1/2 years in a Thailand camp is portrayed realistically and complexly. No easy answers are given to any of the moral questions confronting the POWs. The audience is asked to think through what they themselves would do -- and why -- in such a horrific situation. How to keep your humanity from disintegrating, how to keep compassion alive in your heart, how to live with honor and courage -- all are addressed in psychologically and philosophically compelling terms. The ending alone is worth watching the whole movie. Highly recommended for anyone interested in an unusually intelligent look at what war does to everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A must see. I really wish this had received a chance in the US theaters. It seems to be a shame that it came out of the woods on Video. Just glad I found it and experienced movie making at its best. Again - the acting was top notch along with a sense of realism from the camera views they use. I would recommend to watch the documentary afterwards as part of the Special Features. This story, finally shared with the world is one you will not forget. I also would like to note that the soundtrack is also on par - another amazing match to capture the essence of this movie. I can only imagine what this movie would be like on a big screen- all the same I am grateful for the people who pushed to have it made and to share this great story with the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard about TO END ALL WARS, I thought of BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, set in a similar POW camp. I remembered feeling hopeless and cynical after viewing ...KWAI, which I saw several times. I felt thoughtful and hopeful after viewing ...ALL WARS. I usually can't watch R-rated movies. I have to go out of the theater when things get scary. But because of the good comments my friends made about this one, I sat through it, covering my ears and turning my eyes from the screen when necessary. I like personal stories, and this was from Gordon's book telling of his memories of his experiences. I recommend this movie to anyone who is tired of ironic, cynical stories and wants some hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rich film with powerful themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw To End All Wars, and thought it was an excellent film, especially given the difficulty of making a film like this on a low budget. Each character is richly developed and faces life-altering choices that are believable and powerful, and all the drama is catalyzed by Dusty saving the life of one man by giving up his food. Dusty saves Ernie's life, and then Ernie is the one who begins to lead the other soldiers into a place where they learn that there are greater things worth believing in and other ways to think about themselves, their fellow soldiers, and even their enemies than they had ever considered before.What does it mean to love your enemies? Ernie asks this question at the end of the film, and by that time we have seen the power of this act, because a person who has done evil cannot fight back against someone else who does good for them in return. Carlyle's character represents someone who has too much pride to accept someone's forgiveness and sacrifice for them, whereas Ernie is someone who does accept it, and it changes him forever. What will those Japanese soldiers who they helped think when they get back to their hometowns. They will remember that act of compassion forever, and it likely will alter their worldviews about what people are capable of doing, and how we perceive other people and value them. And it is fascinating that though Dusty is the person who starts this by saving Ernie by sacrificing his own life, the person he saves is the one who goes on to effect these powerful character shifts in the bulk of the camp's prisoners. One good work by one person leads another to do something that affects a much larger number of people. That is profound. If you haven't seen this film, I would strongly recommend it. What does it mean to be a good person, and do all philosophies really result in the same quality of character? These are questions we should be thinking about more.This film explores some of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently rented this film and found myself drawn into the emotional aspects of the story. There are many movies about war and the holocaust. I imagined the pain that the real people went through and found it hard to hold back the tears. The message was clear - forgiveness. The character,"Dusty", was a great example of being Christ-like. After what Ian did to gain the men he needed for his plan, Dusty forgave him way beyond the simple words, "I forgive you." I am a big Kiefer fan so initially, he's the reason I rented it. Ultimately, it was the message and storyline that led me to buy it. So much goes on during war that we as civilians do not see. Take the time to see it the way the director and writer meant for us to see it, and not as just another war-time movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To End All Wars is an outstanding movie--excellent story-line, great acting, creative directing and cinematography. But the thing I love most is that it doesn't "cheapen" the true story by taking sides--it exposes areas of gross IN-humanity, but at the same time lets you feel the humanity and the internal struggles of those caught in the midst of the ugliness of war. And in the abyss of that ugliness, it unveils a story of inspiration, forgiveness, friendship and faith that is amazing. I've encouraged MANY friends to see it and have bought several DVDs, both for myself and as gifts. It's a "must see"--should have had a full theatrical release!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unconventional War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To End All Wars is a rather anti-Hollywood movie as it avoids many of the conventional clichés so often found in Hollywood films. Instead of glorifying egotism, violence, and revenge, the film thoughtfully presents motifs on the nature of suffering, self-sacrifice, forgiveness, and redemption. These elements alone make this film worth viewing.The film also deals directly with the cruelty inflicted upon prisoners of war by the Japanese during WW II-a topic that Hollywood, with good reason, usually avoids. This subject matter could easily devolve into racism; however, the filmmakers effectively present the cruelty inflicted upon these POW's while avoiding racist caricatures of the Japanese who imprisoned them.Both the Japanese and Western prisoners are presented with depth and complexity.This is a well-made film worth the two-hour investment of watching it.</fullReview>

Prison camps show such brutality toward us as humans, it challenges us to the core of who we are - anger, hatred, malice and that is for those that are fighting with each other. It has not yet touched on those from the same side who think only of themselves. Our natural instinct is to save ourselves and forget about anyone else, yet that is not what we see in this movie. There is much to be learnt from this movie even now as we see the fighting around the world. There is a way to walk in forgiveness, there is a way to love your enemy.

		<fullReview>"To End All Wars" came to my attention via a friend in Youth With A Mission, the organization that is a major player behind it's making.The first half of the narrative is well done, as are many aspects of the latter half. Unfortunately, the screenwriters don't give their viewers enough credit. No one with the savvy to appreciate, or at least recognize, the comparison of Jesus' ethic of unconditional love to the ideals of Bushido needs bludgeoning with a recapitulation of the Gospel as was done in the coda to this film. The story is so well done, the themes so clearly delineated, the principal roles so thoroughly identified with those themes - let the story tell the story! It's not hard to draw any conclusions for those so inclined.There is a line in one of the letters from the Apostle Peter: Be ready to answer anyone who asks about the hope you cherish in Jesus Christ. One of the great themes (if not the foremost theme) in this film was that of earning the right to be heard.I wish the screenwriters paid closer attention to their craft and followed suit. This could have been a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"To End All Wars" may not be a classic or a great war film. It starts slowly, and the numerous characters make it a bit confusing. This is not "Saving Private Ryan". However, the movie gets more interesting, intense and meaningful as it goes along and concludes with a satisfying ending. "To End All Wars" is a film worth hanging in there past the first half hour to get to the more involved parts of the plot and characters. There is more than just a POW camp war tale here. There is an entire subplot about the prisoners motives, character growth, attitudes and eventual heroics that is worth waiting for. Most war films start and end with shooting and battles. "To End All Wars" looks at the human side of conflict. Add to all of this the basis on a true story, and this film makes for a worthwhile two hours. 7/10</fullReview>

I don't care if To End All Wars is more realistic than Bridge On The River Kwai, realism does not make a better movie. Bridge On The River Kwai was about something. To End All Wars is about survival of brutality over and over and over again. I got tired of this movie less than half way through. See Bridge On The River Kwai, read a good book about the subject, or watch a documentary on the subject instead. This movie is only for people who like to watch people get tortured.

		<fullReview>I read the book on which this was supposedly based. Having then watched the movie, I can only imagine the author let his family talk him into participating in this, after he was feeble. The movie only used the book as the barest point of departure - going straight against its theme. It was a totally, unapologetically Christian book. Not about mankind's potential, not about Shakespeare, not about brotherhood or manly sacrifice, nor any of the clichés which littered this untidy script. The book rang true - perhaps idealized, but wow, it had so much passion, so many miracles, such eyewitness detail and amazing emotional juxtapositions. It's a literate, thoughtful, unforgettable read. The movie, however, was an insult to the memories of those POW's. The movie only collected anecdotes, added numerous fictional characters and inserted "war-movie" derivative subplots, none of which served to clarify its muddy waters... Please, if you're not afraid of a man's giving credit to God - (why take offense?) - spend a few bucks on Amazon.com etc. for the book. It's a quick read, and much more worthy of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average POW drama (minor spoilers included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've been presented a lot of drama's and epics that show the more dramatic and inhuman aspects of WWII lately. Nearly a decade ago, Spielberg started the trend with Schindler's List and since then, their number increased with the years. Some of them are big-budgeted box office hits and some of them are modest and slick productions that don't usually make it to the big screen. To end all Wars belongs in this second category but then again?it doesn't really deserve that much attention. It's an average ? yet, very well made ? sentimental drama that puts the stress on life in the Japanese/ Korean camps. James Cosmo's battalion is imprisoned and doomed to sit out the entire war under strong surveillance of the Japanese rites and religion. In almost unbearable circumstances, the POW's are forced to build a railroad (420kilometer!?!) and the only thing that keeps them motivated is the fact that one good-hearted prisoner started to teach Plato's philosophies in secret . The effort to face modern audiences with the horror of war is nicely tried, but it all looks a bit too forced and fake in my eyes. The sentiment and especially the morality is too exaggerated at times and the heroic characters are almost cartoons. Practically every known (and irritating) war-cliché is used here including some good old favorites like `the friendly and remorseful enemy among the bunch', `the egocentric loner who eventually sacrifices himself for the whole team', `and the macho major who constantly looks for escape possibilities'? For the record, To end all Wars is based on a true story but I strongly suspect it has been dramatized a lot. Nonetheless, this film also offers quite a few aspects that'll keep you interested till the end-credits role over the screen. The very decent acting-performances by Robert Carlyle and Kiefer Sutherland for one thing! Carlyle is smoothly becoming a solid acting monument, who never gives away a disappointing performance. Sutherland it at his best in this kind of roles?he doesn't have the responsibility to carry the entire movie which fits him better. James Cosmo always is a pleasure to observe?even though his portrayal here is brief and terribly stereotypical! If you're looking for a grade-A WWII drama, I sincerely recommend ?The Grey Zone' and ?The Pianist' over this one! But?if you're fascinated by the topic, you certainly won't regret watching To End All Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it all about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The IMDb discussion board has had a lot of discussions regarding this film. Certainly, if you are a fan of the John Wayne genre of the marines storming a bunker type movie then you should really avoid this film. For you to post a comment on the board leaves you open to deserved criticism. When I make a judgement on a film I consider many things such as how the much the movie cost, did it rely heavily on one big star name; was it factual and did the movie leave me asking questions about how I would have reacted in those situations. For me, 'To End All Wars' ticked all the boxes in that, it was done comparatively cheaply; it did not rely on one big name but utilised craftsmen actors who don't rely on good looks but can go a bit deeper to find that mirror on the human condition to portray what it was really like. Importantly, this film never fails to leave me asking questions 'what would it have been like' and 'how would I have coped'.The acting is first class in this film with Carlyle, McMenamin, Strong, Sutherland and not forgetting Sakae 'Supastition' Kimura all putting in excellent performances. I thought the juxtaposition of Kimura &amp; Carlyle was unforgettable. Both these men essentially subscribed to the same destructive code of honour. Although admiring their loyalty and obedience (note the distinction), ultimately it led to the needless deaths of the men under their command. I also scrutinised my view on the bible too with the help of this film. The characters of Dusty and Campbell both based their actions on what the bible subscribed: in Dustys case the teachings of Christ 'to sacrifice your life for a brother' and 'to turn the other cheek', all from the the new testament and in the case of Major Campbell 'an eye for an eye' a tenant deeply rooted in the old testament. What path is the right one to follow? I note the criticisms of Dustys character especially about 'how unpatriotic he was. I think when these men were incarcerated into that dusty, disease ridden hell hole all notion of ties to ones country diminished. Note when Ernest upset the solider in the dinner queue and he called him an 'english *beep* After time it gravitated down to an 'us and them' struggle between the oppressors, the Japanese and the oppressed allied soldiers. I don't think patriotism was at the forefront of the prisoners minds, it was survival or in some cases 'could the end come quicker'. This wasn't a film about Christianity it was about the men, despite having nothing, they were richer for co-operating together and for tolerating the treatment that was doled out to them. Watch the film again and note how Dusty in his chaplaincy / minister role gradually wins round the four main characters namely: Yanker, Reardon &amp; Campbell and the other prisoners in the camp. You don't have to be a believer in Christ to know that the road that Gordon, Dusty &amp; latterly Yanker was far more productive than Campbell &amp; Itos confrontations. Carlyles angst married with that haunting score just as Ito administers the final part of his obedience to Bushido still stays with me.</fullReview>

After a week I finally played it and was surprised to find the story was about the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, my grandfather had been stationed in Burma at that time and it is by the grace of god that he had not been captured also. As the events unfolded I felt such a combination of anger and sorrow but also the dignity and unyielding solidarity displayed by the men who helped each other survive. By the crucifixion scene the tears were coming fast and I could not believe the level of evil these oppressors would stoop to but Ernest Gordon showed us that despite man's inhumanity to man we are all human and infallible and forgiveness and compassion is the true way to survive. I will never forget this film and the history of what these men endured.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Communication major with video emphasis at Moody Bible Institute and we recently watched TEAW. What a great movie! I love it most because of its powerful message to love your enemy. The Bible says in Luke 6:27 "But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you." That is what this movie is all about. I've also had the opportunity to hear a lecture from Jack Hafer, the producer of this film, and a very powerful man of God. He had some very good things to say about God in cinema. I think this movie would be good for both Christians to see and non-Christians as well. If you are a Christian this would be a great one to take your non-Christian friends to and talk about the movie afterward. I don't want to give away any of the movie, but I think I can say that the theme of loving your enemy is very strong in this movie, so much that it made the people in my class that watched it shed a few tears.

Lots of depth and complexity. One of the great dilemmas the prisoners face 1) should they escape the minimal security and take their chances in the jungle, 2) should they attempt to overpower their captors (and then what?), 3) should they resist their captors at every turn and suffer the consequences, or 4) should they love their enemy and (apparently) cooperate with the enemy?

What makes this movie better than others is that the story appears to be told with very little artistic interpretation. The story (indicated to be based on true events) does not suffer too much from Hollywood fabrication; its reality compels you to watch it.The only drawback was that despite the existence of witnesses, the Japanese characters came across as stereotyped. Their character development would also have made for an interesting (albeit much longer) movie. They weren't the focus of the story, but at times their characters were as vital as the leads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart-wrenching story of redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not typical Hollywood fare. "To End All Wars" is a redemptive story that features Greek philosophical musings about justice, great quotes from Shakespeare, and the teaching of Jesus about non-retaliation and love for enemies. All of this is set against the backdrop of the suffering endured by Allied soldiers in a jungle prison camp during World War II. The filmmakers provide a fascinating contrast between Eastern and Western cultural values, as well as between Christianity and the Japanese Bushido code of behavior. The movie shows clearly and refreshingly that the worldview of a people does influence its behavior, and that it is possible to judge one worldview as superior to another. It also shows that when human beings act selfishly, they lose hope and end up destroying one another. But when we act with sacrificial love toward each other, not only do we stand a better chance of living, we also keep from becoming savages. What a wonderful, thoughtful film! I heartily recommend it for anyone who is tired of the well-worn, formulaic movies that Hollywood seems to be cranking out these days. If you loved Mel Gibson's, "The Passion of the Christ," you will love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most powerful movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had a chance to see this movie twice: once in spring of 2003 and once last month. The impact was great both times and i was moved to tears watching it with my family the second time. I think the divergent views I've read here may be indicative of one's world view. Aside for the technical merits (it has been rightfully noted this was a lower budget movie), the themes explored here cut to the core of what it means to be human (pursuing beauty and truth while in a POW camp), what it means to practice forgiveness when revenge is exploding within you, and what it means to love without regard to one's allegiances.I can see why some would counter that this movie was a cliché playing homage to virtue. But, considering it was a true story, I think it's appropriate to examine oneself against the choices made by these characters and ask what choices we would make. And how do we judge our response? Are we satisfied to dismiss nobility that withstood the crushing blows of torture simply because the "message" is too obvious? Or perhaps it might inspire us to rise above a Rambo-like response when faced with injustice. If we wish to advance our humanity we should strive for, not demean, noble ideals.Yes, there is an underlying exploration of what it means to show Christ-like love in the face of brutality. What I appreciated is that examination seemed devoid of liberal or conservative manipulation of Christ's message. It simply took a tough teaching like loving one's enemy and showed what that might look like when humans do their best to apply that lesson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My father was a prisoner on the death railway so the film had a special meaning for me. I think that it was a pretty accurate portrayal of what happened - obviously much more truthful than Lean's River Kwai epic. I don't think that it really had a message - other than to depict man's inhumanity to man. I did not find it uplifting in any way - and I am rather thankful for that. There can be no justification whatsoever for the treatment of the allied prisoners and local slave labour. The code of the Bushido might explain the obscenities that occurred - but it is not a justification. My father went to his grave hating the Japanese and that is hardly surprising. No forgive and forget for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh outlook on an old theme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story: In a world of relativism where anything goes and values are becoming personalized, this movie gave me a truly fresh outlook on old Christian and Buddhist values. In this movie, I saw the basic principals of goodness and value, which we all were taught as children, become relevant in the "real world" of that era-and most definitely more relevant today. Principals like "Do to others as you would have them do to you," "Turn the other cheek," "There is no greater love than to lay down your life for a friend." I walked away from this movie changed, and excited to know that I had just seen a standard set for society today.Technical: The first time I realized that this was a low budget film was after I had watched it and heard the news from someone else. It didn't give away that secret during viewing. There were some problems with lighting and a really cheesy wheelchair. The music was a mix of Celtic and Far East, and I enjoyed it. I also liked how they chose to portray violence; they weren't graphic about it, but it wasn't whitewashed. There were also some new styles of filming which I found to be quite interesting. But, you'll have to see for yourself :)Overall a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually do not like war movies at all. They are too violent and depressing. This movie has plenty of violence (all true to the telling of the story). However, the one element that made this movie great and kept my eyes glued to the screen was HOPE! In the midst of all that they were experiencing, when they should have wanted to die, they found hope and forgiveness and redemption! It is a beautiful story that was told and directed very well. The acting was excellent. David Cunningham told the story in a way that really drew me in. I felt the sorrow of the prisoners in the beginning of the movie, and then their hope as the story developed. My only disappointment was that it was not more widely released in theaters. As a result many people are missing out on an excellent movie. In short: it is an excellent movie - very well made - good acting and directing - wonderful story line (and it is based on a true story)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This excellent film sneaks up on you. Just when you are gritting your teeth and white-knuckling it to get through the violence, something beautiful begins to permeate the film. Forgiveness, mercy, even love are depicted amidst the squalor and degradation of the POW camp. The conflicts are not just between the Japanese and the American POWs either. The POWs themselves are strongly at odds about how they will respond to their captors, allowing viewers to identify with the best and worst of man's motivations. This film shook me to the core, evoking powerful responses from within. To End All Wars is a must-see movie with stellar performances by all. The fact that it is a true story will overwhelm you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of true sacrificial love that crosses cultural lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some great movies produced today that commend and highlight virtues that are missing today in our western culture. The movie "To end all wars" hits the heart and displays what real love looks like. There is still some room for men and women to take their places among the the line-up of heroes for others to follow. I saw sacrificial love demonstrated as one man freely gave up his life that another may go free. This is a time when thinking of others would truly make a difference in our nation as well the rest of this world. It is an inspirational movie to watch. Hats off to Mr.Sutherland and rest of the cast who took time and offered their gifts to make such a striking movie. I saw this movie in Thailand recently and highly recommend that you view it and see for yourself. The message is powerful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about this film long before I was able to see it and must say that it was definitely worth waiting for. This real-life movie takes on some of the deepest issues dealt with of the human soul and champions what is best in us. The viewer cannot help but be led into an examination of our own conscience and morality. I came away from it moved and wanting to be a better man.The story is set in a Japanese POW camp for Allied forces in Thailand during WWII, amidst horrible conditions, and is from the 1962 book, "Miracle on the River Kwai", written by real-life survivor Captain Ernest Gordon of the Scottish Argyle Highlander Regiment.This movie was powerfully done and beautifully filmed. It was one of the best movies I've seen in many years and is one worth owning and watching over and over. If this movie doesn't win an Oscar, it's only because of injustice to independent films. Definitely a must-see!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging, excellent, more historically accurate than "Kwai""</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this during the Hawaii International Film Festival, with director David Cunningham present for Q&amp;A. It was visually powerful, emotionally compelling. Robert Carlyle has rarely been better, and Kiefer Sutherland gained a lot of credibility for me with his performance here. Since it is based on the same historical events as Bridge on the River Kwai, comparisons are inevitable. While Kwai had big budget, great visuals and a catchy tune to whistle, it took tremendous liberties with fact in order to produce a blatantly jingoistic film: all Brits are noble, all Americans daring, and all Japanese demonic. In "To End" we see not only more accurate history (with much dialogue and voice overs taken from diaries of survivors), but we also see shadings of between the extremes of noble and demonic. It is a profound character study on the impact of war and inhumanity on a diverse group of people. The other reviewer posted here as made a variety of derogatory comments, dunning the film for low budget (but quality performances -- sounds like Carlyle et.al. believed it to be a significant project; they also went &amp; got tattooed to remember the experience); use of still photos to stand in for staged battle scenes (someone better tell Ken Burns this is only done by low rent sorts!); and the observations by the narrator who found meaning and sanity through his religious faith. I found the use of stills for battle sequences to be effective because instead of drawing attention to shoot-'em-up action it kept the focus on individuals and how they survived (or not) this horrific and inhumane time. By definition, battle sequences are big and noisy and paint in broad strokes. A film that examines how the mind, heart, spirit, sense of self, identity, etc., survive needs to have the viewers attuned to subtleties, not desensitized by booms and blasts.Any study of survivors of war will show you that the question of meaning is pivotal in their ability to go on with life rather than succumb to despair. Read memoirs of Holocaust survivors. Read about Vietnam vets who still hide in the hills. What made the difference between those who were able to rebuild a life after war and those who were stuck perpetually in the past events of horror? A spiritual sense that enabled healing, transcendence, distance, letting go, reclaiming a believe in humanity. Cunningham noted that he had spoken to many veterans who saw the film at the various festivals where it had been shown. He noted that there one could clearly tell that many had spent the subsequent 50 years still trapped in the events of war, while others went on and lived life. The difference, he said, seemed to be those who could find a sense of meaning or purpose to life after war. It is not a film that is likely to fill the recruiters office with ardent young militants, and that I fear is the main reason it has not been given proper distribution in this post-9/11 period. Kwai was much better propoganda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Silly would be the best way to describe this. There is a point where one of the camp inmates states that the shirts that the officers wear is all that seperates them from the anarchy out there with the rest of the prisoners.... there was no raw emotion, no anarchy, rather there was an abundance of civilised respectful behaviour throughout. Even the Japanese butchering of prisoners was couched in honour and tradition... everyone worked jolly hard to build the railroad that a lovely shiny puffer train was going to use... to invade India.The one guy that gets beaten so badly that he is crippled ends up getting a lovely home made wheelchair... and the Japanese carry on feeding this man who is incapable of working???Blah de blah...

		<shortDescription>A MOST TIMELY MASTERPIECE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, the last picture that I took in at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival, was the most moving film I've seen in a LONG time and one that I wish the whole world could chill out to right now. It's an independent feature (picked up when MGM allowed its option on the source material to expire) with a big-budget sheen and enough "name" talent to ensure decent distribution. Believe me when I say that this is Oscar material in the same gut-wrenching vein as THE KILLING FIELDS.In essence, it's a no-sugar-added revisiting of the WWII territory first mined by Hollywood in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, and it makes that 50's Oscar favorite look like an Asian variant on Hogan's Heroes by comparison. It's based on the 1962 book, "Miracle on the River Kwai" by real-life prison camp survivor Captain Ernest Gordon of the Scottish Argyl Highlanders regiment, captured during the Japanese takeover of Singapore in 1942. It's about men pushed beyond the breaking point of human endurance by brutality, backbreaking labor, meager rations, and omnipresent disease who are able to persevere through the actions a "a few (very) good men" -- men willing to perform the ultimate CHRISTIAN act of self-sacrifice (which would certainly seem to differ radically from the Muslim variant). It's about enmity between races breaking down in the face of such acts.Gordon became a man of the cloth after the war, emigrating to America and becoming Dean of the Chapel at Princeton University. When you see clips of the real-life Gordon shaking hands, visiting gravesites, and perusing a photo album with one of his real-life captors (also depicted in the film) at a reunion in Burma in the 90's and sense the true peace and good will between them, it's impossible not to be touched.Robert Carlyle and Kiefer Sutherland are the aforementioned "names," and they're both first-rate players in a large and talented ensemble cast. But the real revelation is newcomer Ciarán McMenamin in the central narrative role as the young Gordon. Truly a towering performance in a movie with a visceral, soul-moving power light-years beyond anything that Hollywood would ever attempt. Highly recommended, especially for anyone considering maturing beyond the comic book/video game/action hero brand of "heroism" regularly served up by Hollywood. Try some REAL heroism for a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget Christian POW film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, if that one-line summary didn't discourage you, I have a few comments in part caused by the totally uncritical reviews I have seen posted here. First off, this film is obviously low budget, with scenes of the actual war restricted to black and white still photos, and the actual film only involving like three people plus extras. Secondly, the moral of the film, which repeatedly is shoved down the viewers throat, is nauseatingly clichefied Christian ethics, turn the other cheek style, with the not very original core content of "Hatred consumes you", "Forgiveness is divine", "Love your enemy", etc you get my drift. The bad guy in the film is the prisoner that dreams of escape and freedom, albeit with an unrealistic plan. The good guy is the prisoner which motivates the POWs to work even harder for the Japanese, finishing the railroad ahead of schedule. This moral is highly dubious. Moreover, the complex psychological and moral issues explored in "The bridge on the river Kwai", such as the Stockholm Syndrome of growing to be loyal to your captors, and how hard a POW should work to aid the enemy, are blatantly absent. Instead, this film recommends that you love your tormentors and work as hard as you can for the Emperor. If you are a Christian Disney loving person, why not see this movie. If you would consider revenge if someone tortured and killed all your family, in other words if you are a human being, this movie has you cast as the villain, so avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply Themed and Brutally Honest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starting with their capture, this story pulls you through World War II in the eyes of Scottish POWs in a Japanese POW camp in Thialand where they triumph and succumb to the Japanese, nature and themselves.--- Well first of all, I should say the title is misleading, "To End All Wars" is by no means a war movie -- it's a POW movie and a very different one at that. There's no grand escape plan or revolt, instead it chooses to concentrate on the mental and moral aspect of being held against your will, facing punishment, torture and having no idea what will happen tomorrow or how long you will stay alive.The plot is expertly put together and deeply rooted around the question: Should you turn the other cheek or have your revenge, do you have it in you to forgive your enemy? There are plenty of characters involved in the movie and each one, from the main character to the smallest part, has to ask themselves that question, and by the end of the movie you will too.The biggest drawback is that the movie is drawn out a little, much like Fargo seemed to me, but by the end I was so involved I didn't even notice. Other than that it introduces you to the violence that went on in this camp fairly early on in the movie, and it's exceptionally violent (and not for the faint of heart). It easily exceeds the level of violence in Saving Privite Ryan in some of the parts. Yet for all the violence, it does not glorify it at all. And that's where the plot comes in, "can you love your enemy?" After all they did to you? That's the question consistently asked.The acting is fairly well done for both sides. Robert Caryle plays the part of Devil's Advocate, wanting revenge for most of the movie and Kiefer Sutherland portrays a loner who for part of the movie tries to survive on his own until he realizes he won't be able to get through this without friends. The main character, Ernest Gordon, is inspired by a religious Dusty who's presence boosts moral throughout the whole camp. There are plenty of other smaller roles both POW and Japanese, and at times it may get confusing but this does not hinder the movie.The music is aptly used only in the most dramatic and vital parts. And in some scenes is really well done. The tracks themselves are enjoyable, except for one or two (Although to be fair some of them were unoriginal).To End All Wars, although slightly slow and violent is surprising good for a movie most people have every heard of. It's definitely not a light-hearted movie, but if you ever get a chance to see it you should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should not have been a miss but a hit. An up-lifting story, a goodish cast and some excellent drama but it fails miserably. Why? I don't know! Most good movies try and show both sides of an argument however wrong and this one attempts to give the Japanese as well as the Allied side to the brutality suffered by the prisoners in the hands of the Japanese. It almost succeeds but doesn't quite get there. As with any true story it is difficult to make it dramatic without, well, being econimical with the truth. But we have seen this work before in other movies so why not here? I know the history of the British regiments that fought in the second world war and their traditions but it is never made clear that the Argyles did not surrender but were forced to stop fighting on orders from High command. In Bridge over the River Kwai", Alec Guinness's character makes it clear by saying "we were ordered to surrender". For such a proud set of soldiers to put up with what they did in the camps was even more humiliating then even the Japanese thought. The movie has some good moments but never really gets above average which is a pity because the story deserved better.</fullReview>

I felt the film followed on well from the book he wrote about his experiences during his capture and was an inspiration to many. I feel the actor portraying Earnest could have had a more convincing accent but the character and motivation was captured well in this film. The genuine respect and love for his fellow man whether on the same "side " was quite heartwarming and developed the Christian ethics aspect quite clearly. I felt the casting was appropriate and enjoyed placing the characters from the book into the recognisable stars of the film. As I had not had the opportunity to meet my uncle for many years it was good to see him in the flesh and watch him at the close of the film as he revisited graves of his fellow soldiers who fell during the building of the bridge over the river Kwai.

Could I forgive enemies who are pure evil like Dusty and Ernest did? I don't know. Ciaran McMenamin (he of the unpronounceable name!) does a great job.

		<fullReview>This is a powerful movie. It captures the possibility that men (in this case) can bring to horrific situations when they are challenged to go beyond themselves and live to a higher ideal. It reminded me of Victor Frankl's work in Man's Search for Meaning. These men discovered a "why" for living and found the how in the process. The interactions between the prisoners and the prison guards particularly demonstrated the power of forgiveness, while interactions between the prisoners themselves especially evoked the power of love. I have seen it twice in movie theaters, and both times I was left speechless as were the majority of other movie goers. This movie sticks in my mind because I can't quite figure out what it was that made it so compelling and left me in this state at the end.

		<shortDescription>A fascinating way to view humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Humanity" is a term that is used to refer not just to our own species, but to our cultural "sameness." Thus, often, one finds that a group who is considered an enemy is not "human" like the rest of "us." This enables us to behave in inhuman ways ourselves. However, often it is this very denial of our own humanity that enables "others" to see us as inhuman as well, and the cycle endlessly repeats. The philosophy of "an eye for an eye" creates a downward spiral for all of humanity.This, among other philosophies, is revealed throughout the movie. The pacing is slow and involved, but never, ever boring. Every moment holds the audience in thrall, enabling the viewer to experience the loss, the shame, the anger, of the WWII prisoners. It is this very emotional build-up that helps one to question (theoretically) ones own behavior in a similar situation. And as the movie continues, it also slowly reveals an enlightening view of the soldier's very captors and their own specific motivations and cultural influences, as well.This movie is a must-see for anyone who would like to expand their understanding and compassion for humanity's behavior, with all its glorious imperfections.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not been the same since viewing this film. It is disturbing to be sure. But it is also a transforming film, one that pushes the limits and boundaries of what it means to live out one's faith. War is hell. Can forgiveness and redemption be found in the bowels of war? I am convinced that this film, based on a true story, proves it can be found even there. The actors -- an international ensemble from North America, Europe and Asia -- are superb. You forget you're watching a film. It avoids the political, I think. The Japanese characters were a bit stereotyped at first, but they became real, nuanced, textured, and very believable as the story unfolded. And the actual meeting of the two former, reconciled enemies at the end is a master stroke. The makers of this film strived for greatness in this film, and I think they achieved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monumental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the middle of reading FLYBOYS, (an account of Japanese philosophy and perception of the art of war at the time of WWII), a viewing of TO END ALL WARS confirmed the polarizing realities that exist between cultures of East and West. However, even differing cultures have the possibility of two shared experiences. The first is hatred. Less commonly, the second is understanding. I found that the reading of the words of Christ breathed monumental significance and transforming power to the life of a prisoner of war camp. Likewise the recitation of Shakespear shed light and nobility to that dark stage. Having seen the movie tonight, on the eve of Father's Day, I was granted sobering hope for the kind of life I hope to live, and teach my children to pass on to their own children.This film is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to tell you the truth, I was quite surprised when I saw this movie. it was different than I expected. it was better, there were real emotions and great acting. before I saw this movie, we talked in my English-class about Ernest Gordon and I remembered the title TO END ALL WARS, so I rented the movie. it made a bigger impression to me than most movies had ever done. and even though kiefer's character was a self-centered person I couldn't help myself liking him. the morality of campbell lost it's credibility but I loved the acting esspessially kiefer's. I've got just one thing to say: it's a brilliant movie, watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Amazing Movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first moment Robert Carlyle's Character is beat to the ground for causing the Japanese guard to "lose face", I was hooked. Every moment I saw in this film caused me to be amazed again and again. A bit of insight was brought into Japanese Culture at that time as I watched these men who were completely alien to that way of life being forced to live under that system.Cinematography wise, there was little to complain about. That doesn't mean nothing... It would take too long for me to go shot by shot, but one thing in particular which is good if you see a few scenes of it, but is annoying the first time is the frequent several second flashbacks... The first couple times I saw them I wasn't sure exactly what was going on (Particularly the fight at the food line) but after I saw it a few more times, I finally figured it out.I don't have much to say about the score. It was good for it's purpose, and the Celtic theme was really interesting to me. Other than that, nothing spectacular (once again, low budget so no copyrighted songs, not that this needed any)Kiefer Sutherland and Robert Carlyle were very impressive, but the one that blew me away was "Dusty Miller" who's real name I don't know. Maybe that's why he blew me away as I think he is an unknown. Cieran left something to be desired at times, but most of the time he was good as well.Many of the Japanese soldiers were good too, but some seemed a bit overacted. The main Japanese guy who dealt all of the punishment seemed overacted most of the time, but the shovel scene really let me see into his character. The translator was very good and I couldn't find much to complain about him. All of the Japanese actors, of course, acted for Kurosawa, so you would expect them to be excelent, but their acting style may be a bit too old for this movie, though they may be quite impressive by themselves or in their element.The message of forgiveness and reconciliation are very needed. I am very upset with an earlier reviewer who basically said if you felt like these people did that you weren't human... How dare he or she just discount something experienced in real life by the person who wrote the story. In contrast to that, the things Dusty and Ernie did were incredibly noble. It's not losing your humanity to forgive, but to eliminate the feelings of hatred in your life is to regain your humanity, remembering that the story was told as it happened.That is probably the most amazing thing of all.</fullReview>

There was also the things that I would hope to be -- gracious, exceedingly forgiving, and always hopeful. I believe that the best movies are the ones that make you quiet for hours.

		<shortDescription>An intelligent character film, not for the squeamish or dull.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for pure, unadulterated summer blockbuster fare and do not have the ability or desire to think critically (logically) and interact mentally, you should probably avoid this intelligently written, directed and superbly acted WWII era film about real men enduring unimaginable cruelty and hardship . . . and emerging as better men.Mr. Godawa has written an excellent adaptation with tight dialogue and a compelling visual story that Mr. Cunningham (Dir.) and Mr. Gardiner (Cinematographer) have interpreted with a stunning, first person, and visual realism able to capture the imagination and compel the viewer to come along.Mr. Cunningham uses a modified "documentary" process to shoot this film with up-close, hand-held cameras to put the viewer into the situation. This little stroke of genius is what provokes the visceral reactions expressed in most of the reviews in these pages. These reviews have been referred to as `uncritical' in another review.Unfortunately, there are some who will not get beyond a loathing of the morality and character the men in this story exhibit. The whole purpose of a character film like `To End All Wars' is to delve into deeper psychological and moral issues through the characters who are part of this story. Some will say such issues are absent, simply because the issues are dealt with from a perspective with which they may disagree.The truth of the matter is that these folks cannot abide the conclusions drawn from the deeper and more complex psychological, moral and even theological issues explored and expressed in this film. Even the character who will be labeled `the bad guy' in the film, portrayed by Mr. Carlyle, (also consider Mr. Sutherland's character, from a different perspective), is, in the end, deeply affected and somehow changed for the better by the experience.The film is not about heroes and villains, according to the simplistic tastes and demands of some viewers. The film is about real men, real circumstances and real outcomes based upon a real (dare I say True) worldview that is `real' foreign to the contemporary, postmodern mind. That, of course, would be the kind of `shoved down the viewer's throat' morality that today's `politically correct' and undiscerning viewer will speak out so vehemently (and without obvious warrant), against.If you like a good, straightforward and easy to follow, good guy versus bad guy, don't make me think, summer blockbuster, action and no story flick, watered-down and without depth . . . this film is not for you. If, on the other hand, you are willing to stand face to face with the enemy and `see the reflection of yourself', then you will, indeed, want to watch this film. . . at least twice . . . if you can stomach the truth of it all.Watch the film with a clear mind, consider the truth presented and be careful, lest you too emerge a better person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real classic. There aren't many films that make you look at yourself and question you morality, but this one does, and without mercy. If it was a work of fiction then it would still be good but it is based on a true story which makes it so much more powerful.Basically it is about a group of Allied prisoners of war in a Japanese POW camp. Based on a true story there are no punches pulled and every aspect of human behaviour is portrayed here, anger, frustration, retribution, humanity, forgiveness, guilt, rage and sorrow. Reality reigns with cruel grandeur here and some of the scenes are shocking and it is worth remembering that it is a true story. I urge everyone to see this film. A real moving experience. If you are a big fan of the Hollywood flag waving action films with a leading lady and a happy ending then forget it...stick to your popcorn and cokes and live in your own little dream world.I cannot say enough about this film, it is one of them films that at the end you are left stunned for hours afterwards. If you liked Das Boot then you will love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you prefer shoot 'em up, no character, blood and guts for no other purpose than "effect" type of movies, and characters more shallow than than a pancake grill, then don't watch this show. But if you have the guts to come face to face with your own frailties and the ugliest of "man's inhumane treatment of man," if you're motivated by the lives of those who have the courage and character to make positive moral choices in the least desirable of life circumstances, if you can handle a depiction of humans who are able to make sacrifice because they have understood and experienced a greater Strength than their own, then this movie is a must see. You will be uncomfortable, you will be challenged to consider your own moral fiber, and by the way, it ain't all pretty. But pretty and good don't always intersect, as is clearly demonstrated in this character piece which is refreshing in its simple yet profound theme of forgiveness that comes with a price and cuts to the heart.Low budget? The brilliance of Cunningham's production is what he was able to do with the budget he had. That's craftsmanship. Do yourself a favor and take a few hours to experience this quality historical character piece...but only if you can handle the truth, the truth about human nature, about life and about yourself, if you're brave enough to cope with what you might discover in the process.</fullReview>

I was amazed at what a moving and well-made film this was even though it was not a high-budget movie.I like the fact that this movie portrays reality and doesn't gloss over what happened and the struggles that the POWs went through in dealing with their treatment. The Christian themes are not `preachy', but are very genuinely portrayed in these men struggling through a very difficult situation. I really hope that this movie gets a general release soon.

		<shortDescription>Incredibly real...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernest Gordon was the author of several books. Two of them are: To End All Wars: A True Story about the Will to Survive and the Courage to Forgive, and Miracle on the River Kwai. In 1957, the story of Mr. Gordon's experiences in a Japanese prison camp during WWII inspired the making of the movie The Bridge on the River Kwai. In 2001 a new movie came out to tell Mr. Gordon's story once again. That movie, To End All Wars, shook me to the core. Unlike Bridge on the River Kwai, which was an excellent academy award winning film, To End All Wars took me further. I did not just watch the movie, I became part of it. I was in that POW camp. I suffered with the prisoners. I knew them personally. With Mr. Gordon's validation, the director of the film, David Cunningham, has done an excellent job in showing us what really happened in that POW camp.This is not a movie for wimps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw, truthful description of Japanese camps in WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Occasionally a movie allows the brutal truth about a situation to tell the story, without the Hollywood glitz or gratuitious violence. "To End All Wars" has that potential. It seems historically well researched, and it pulls no punches in depicting the utter degradation and devaluing of humanity in a desperate wartime scenario. It draws out feelings of injustice, rage, helplessness and despair. What do human beings do when they are trapped in a situation where there is no hope of rescue and where their captors are without moral sense?This movie examines the plight of prisoners of war when there is no promise of spectacular rescue, and where heroism is greeted with disdain and physical brutality. I found myself squirming and looking for a neat Hollywood ending. There is none, but instead, deeper qualities of forgiveness and self-giving love bring a different kind of victory. This is a disturbing movie, painfully close to reality. It poses the hard questions and leaves the viewer with plenty of food for thought. Strong performances by the leading actors compensate for some slight sense that this is a low budget movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A WWII movie with implications for today's conflicts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To "End All Wars" is a movie vital to the times we find ourselves in. Based on a true story, the film handles war and it's hardships with a raw strength. Set in Japanese prisoner of war camp of WWII, the statements made by image and few words are deep, not contrived nor small. "To End All Wars" puts issues in front of us, and does not back down with a formula answer of heros. War and international conflict situations are dilemmas, with no quick or easy answers. This is brilliantly shown in the story, as the Japanese values and way of thinking is shown alongside the more familiar Western values.With questions of war right in our face, "To End all Wars" walks us through very personal questioning and implications of actions -- both national actions as well as individual actions. I very much appreciated the journey that the movie draws you along, dropping us into the questioning, the wondering -- into the harsh realities of mankind's nature, both good and bad. What would I do if I was in that situation? The answers are not blatant, I must search. This is a strength of the movie, for it is a real walk. It really happened."To End All Wars" is not a sweeping big picture of the strategies of WWII, but rather it is a film about a window -- one that could have been in many eras, many countries ... it is about nations with nations, and the wrestling for goodness in mankind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie about a series of events at a POW camp during World War II. It's not really a war movie, it's more about how a group of men endured things few of us can imagine. It also offers a rare glimpse of applied philosophy: you can study the great philosophers and world religions, but at what point does what you believe affect the choices you make?I loved it, but it was hard to watch. After seeing it I wondered what I would do in the same situation. In that sense it reminds me of films like Papillon or the Killing Fields, both of which show people with amazing character and an unbelievable will to survive. The movie is kind of artsy in that there is more silence than dialogue. At times it feels like a documentary, which makes the whole experience even more real. Great flick.

		<fullReview>I saw this Kiefer Sutherland movie last weekend and was very surprised. I have shunned away from flicks like Full Metal Jacket and the recent Tom Hanks movie because of the reported gore, and the black and white type of good people and bad people conflict, but this movie is quite different.It is a true story from a diary of a prisoner of war and his experience in his POW camp among the other prisoners, and most curiously, with his captives.Besides the "movie" itself, the film includes vintage shots of the real prisoners and people in the movie. At the end of the movie there is a snip of the POW that wrote the book (Ernest) the movie is based on and one of his captives, also portrayed in the movie. I liked this aspect as it gave me some "closure", although the movie itself will cause you to do some thinking beyond your 70 min or so of viewing.You will get a taste of some good British actors and an insight to how the Japanese used POW's as man power during the war. The part I liked most was when the captives seemed baffled at some of the POW's responses to their treatment. There was not party or group hugs but you definitely "felt" the characters were moved in various ways by their prisoners. The theme seems to be of overcoming your situation and reaching beyond your instinct and circumstances to do good for others, regardless of *their* behavior or response. In a way, it illuminates the grey side of life.The violence wasn't to bad, criers will flood on this one (but not from the violence) but mostly you will be a little more in touch with what POW's (all are male) go through while held captive. You do begin to see that some end up more "free" than their fellow POW"s.I recommend this movie if you want more than a warm fuzzy feeling on movie night for a change. Your conscience will be stirred as you put yourself in their place and hopefully you'll come out a little grey as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of such magnitude, it's a wonder the screen could contain it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and the visual images of this film bear that out completely. I have seldom, if ever, been so moved by a movie. Knowing it is based on a true story, and that it involved POW's made me wary of going to see it. I am not one to want to watch violence portrayed larger than life on the big screen, and that is what I expected to see. But once there, this movie would not allow me to look away, even in those graphic moments. The extremely fine performances of the actors, the gripping script, the completely appropriate camera work and production design, the strong direction, the historical accuracy, as well as all the other technical aspects of putting together a film were unquestionably of the highest quality.But that is not what made seeing this film such a great experience. It was in the intellectual, emotional, and spiritual connections it made with me and the entire audience that it's greatness was achieved. That it powerfully touched everyone in the mainstream theater (The Archlight) where I saw this film was evident. The eerie quiteness, the wet eyes, the tissues being used as people left the theater were a silent tribute to the way it had grabbed each individual there and caused them to feel and think deeply.It took me personally through the POW's steps of resistance, despair, questioning, hate, revenge, searching for hope, faith, and some finding that peace which is incomprehensible without God's help, while others could never grasp it. I know I have never, ever faced anything nearly this horrific in my life, and yet I find it hard to forgive. How could these men do that? Seeing men give to each other out of their abject and retched conditions made me think deeply about what I consider to be hard challenges and difficult issues in my life. Where do I turn for guidance and help when the "tough" times come? Any film that can make people think about their innermost convictions and examine their philosophy of life this seriously has tremendous merit.This film deserves to be given a wide release and a serious PR campaigne. If our world is ever to learn how to achieve peace, we need to think about the issues this film brings forth so clearly.Peace begins with each person making a choice - not in government policies, no matter how honorable, or military power, no matter how right or wrong the cause, or grand philosophies or any religion being discussed, no matter how eloquently. But it is in each individual choosing to live a particular way regardless of what others are doing that peace begins. That is what this film demonstrates so clearly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this Kiefer Sutherland movie last weekend and was very surprised. I have shunned away from flicks like Full Metal Jacket and the recent Tom Hanks movie because of the reported gore, and the black and white type of good people and bad people conflict, but this movie is quite different.It is a true story from a diary of a prisoner of war and his experience in his POW camp among the other prisoners, and most curiously, with his captives.Besides the "movie" itself, the film includes vintage shots of the real prisoners and people in the movie. At the end of the movie there is a snip of the POW that wrote the book (Ernest) the movie is based on and one of his captives, also portrayed in the movie. I liked this aspect as it gave me some "closure", although the movie itself will cause you to do some thinking beyond your 70 min or so of viewing.You will get a taste of some good British actors and an insight to how the Japanese used POW's as man power during the war. The part I liked most was when the captives seemed baffled at some of the POW's responses to their treatment. There was not party or group hugs but you definitely "felt" the characters were moved in various ways by their prisoners. The theme seems to be of overcoming your situation and reaching beyond your instinct and circumstances to do good for others, regardless of *their* behavior or response. In a way, it illuminates the grey side of life.The violence wasn't to bad, criers will flood on this one (but not from the violence) but mostly you will be a little more in touch with what POW's (all are male) go through while held captive. You do begin to see that some end up more "free" than their fellow POW"s.I recommend this movie if you want more than a warm fuzzy feeling on movie night for a change. Your conscience will be stirred as you put yourself in their place and hopefully you'll come out a little grey as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful film that should not be considered "low budget" as the production values are very good. Well acted this is a moving story well worth seeing. It is amazing that this true story has not been told before. It was the best performance Keiffer Sutherland has ever given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of such magnitude, it's a wonder the screen could contain it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and the visual images of this film bear that out completely. I have seldom, if ever, been so moved by a movie. Knowing it is based on a true story, and that it involved POW's made me wary of going to see it. I am not one to want to watch violence portrayed larger than life on the big screen, and that is what I expected to see. But once there, this movie would not allow me to look away, even in those graphic moments. The extremely fine performances of the actors, the gripping script, the completely appropriate camera work and production design, the strong direction, the historical accuracy, as well as all the other technical aspects of putting together a film were unquestionably of the highest quality.But that is not what made seeing this film such a great experience. It was in the intellectual, emotional, and spiritual connections it made with me and the entire audience that it's greatness was achieved. That it powerfully touched everyone in the mainstream theater (The Archlight) where I saw this film was evident. The eerie quiteness, the wet eyes, the tissues being used as people left the theater were a silent tribute to the way it had grabbed each individual there and caused them to feel and think deeply.It took me personally through the POW's steps of resistance, despair, questioning, hate, revenge, searching for hope, faith, and some finding that peace which is incomprehensible without God's help, while others could never grasp it. I know I have never, ever faced anything nearly this horrific in my life, and yet I find it hard to forgive. How could these men do that? Seeing men give to each other out of their abject and retched conditions made me think deeply about what I consider to be hard challenges and difficult issues in my life. Where do I turn for guidance and help when the "tough" times come? Any film that can make people think about their innermost convictions and examine their philosophy of life this seriously has tremendous merit.This film deserves to be given a wide release and a serious PR campaigne. If our world is ever to learn how to achieve peace, we need to think about the issues this film brings forth so clearly.Peace begins with each person making a choice - not in government policies, no matter how honorable, or military power, no matter how right or wrong the cause, or grand philosophies or any religion being discussed, no matter how eloquently. But it is in each individual choosing to live a particular way regardless of what others are doing that peace begins. That is what this film demonstrates so clearly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before this movie came out I could never name a movie as my favorite, I enjoyed many having strong cinematic quality, strong character development, and others that had social significance but lacked the driving force that allows one to sit back and watch over and over. However To End All Wars has multiple strong characters and a stellar story, that is adapted from real events. Ernest Gordon's story is definitely one worth telling; the writer, producer, director and actors all worked to tell it in a way I will never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keifer's workBefore... To End All Wars After...24 isn't that bad either; OK, it's the best show on TV since MASH, simply incredible. Personally I see a lot of moral fiber displayed by the characters in the show 24, which is *the* theme of to End All Wars. The difference being that the movie explicitly points to the source of that moral fortitude (Christ), while the show leaves the ultimate source of Jack's motivation relatively ambiguous, leaving me wondering... Family? Nation? Personally defined morality? Keeps us viewers guessing, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why war is not fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am always wary of war films that say they are based on a true story. But this film is obviously very close to the facts because of the way in which it does away with the superficial and goes for the "guts' of living out of forgiveness above the typical revenge and hate films. The dirty, stinking and constant cruel circumstances of these Allied POW's make you wonder how the heck they could do it. War is not fun and being in a Japanese prison in a sweaty jungle with extreme inhuman treatment must be no fun at all. I was glad to see the script of each character was real not just some grunt from a super-human killing machine who kisses all his enemies goodbye. Kiefer Sutherland was the American trying to make the best of a very bad situation but faced with the responses of indifference and hate that all war victims seem to experience. The strong performance by Robert Carlyle as Campbell should have had the Scots applauding and won a number of Film Awards. However Ciar?n McMenamin as Ernest Gordon strengthen the film with his honest narration leading to the last part of the film where the truth of war and the suffering involved is squarely faced. This is a haunting and truthful film with great scenes but please be warned those who have experienced war and its cruelty you will be crying at the end. I give it 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid drama taken from real life experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bridge Over the River Kwai" meets "Stalag 17" meets "Dead Poets Society". Gripping performance worthy of the heroism of the real-life experience. Challenging on many levels. Like the best of dramas it poses more questions than answers. Probes the human condition on the most basic levels from "Why are we here?" to "What is justice?". Not for every audience. I would caution viewers from exposing the film to younger audiences because of the graphic depiction of the cruelty of the Bushido captors. Nonetheless, as the viewers come of age, it is an important historical lesson that answers many questions as to the whys and wherefores that precipitated the Second World War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great account of the death and atrocities suffered by Allied POW's in WWII..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the first I've seen that really shows the atrocities committed by the Japanese toward POW's in WWII. Although "The Bridge on the River Kwai" was a great movie, it was fiction and showed British officers collaborating with the Japanese, which would have never happened. I have read that many of the survivors of the Thai Burma railroad were sent to Saigon, where they were packed in "Hellships' for transfer to Japan. Many were killed when the ships were sunk by American submarines, as the Japanese failed to properly ID their ships containing POW's. Could you imagine surviving all that abuse and death on the railway to be sunk by your own Allies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable Realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the movie The Bridge on the River Kwai and in my opinion the movie looked like a joke. The huts were well made, the soldiers were remarkably healthy, the Japanese overseeing the camp looked like your next door neighbor who practices democracy. The movie is remarkably similar to Hogan's Heroes.The reality of POW's, prisoners, people in poverty is really unusually brutal and oppressed. This movie has a remarkably realism to the same tune of The Pianist. Under that conditions you have very little to say but to comply and adapt for your own survival.This is not a movie who likes action, this is a movie for people who like realism, up to a level of course as the people who died there were more likely to be Malays, and other locals. The death rate for these people were close to 50% while only about one in six of captured POWs survived through this ordeal.What is interesting is that the Japanese were less cruel to the POWs than the Germans were to the Jewish. Once the job was finished, as you see in the movie of the Pianist, and you were no longer needed, they shoot you dead. I think the Germans wiped out the forgiving Catholic Polish people by at least 90% of the population that way. So the concept of forgiving and love thy neighbor policy doesn't work well with the German Gestapo.Now let's look it from another angle, if you bother to check a bit of war history and I am no expert on that either, you will find that after the Japanese took over the South East Asian regions, they found they have a too many POWs on their hands. So they decided the best way to handle that would (as well as the locals) was to build a railroad to further expand their empire. Now if the Germans were at it, they might have probably gassed them or shoot them to death.Now let's look at the Scottish POW, Earnest Gordon when he mentions to forgive and love the enemy. Yes, the formula works very well since if the POWs serve their emperor by following emperor's instructions, it was compatible to the Bushido system. So the Japanese were forgiving if you do exactly what they tell you to. And once the job was finished, they didn't get rid of you either and they show gratefulness by returning the books they had confiscated earlier because the POWs worked so well to the Emperor's cause. Now if we go back to the Nazis system such a Christian formula would not work. So the compatibility and survivability is not guaranteed by the Nazi system. It looks more like it depends on the whims of heil Hitler.So while the movie has remarkable realism, it is told through the eyes of a person who has some Christianity and apparently the Christianity system were compatible with the Bushido system and the Japanese were somehow grateful for the job well done. In the Nazi system as told by the Pianist, the only way you can survive is not Christianity, it is by hiding and avoiding and sometimes you might be lucky enough for some Nazis who have some touches of human quality to help someone else, of course luck has a great deal to it. So the name of the game is what system works depends on how the conqueror treats you. If he loves you if you are willing to sacrifice, then fine. If he does not and likes to throw you away like a toilet paper, the best solution is to escape and hopefully avoid capture, or to kill him before he kills you - take over the camp.So the lesson to all of this is you treat your enemies depending on how he will treat you based on your own actions. If he's just as forgiving, we can forgive him. If he is unforgiving and a blood sucking vampire, then it is best to escape from the camp and kill the them before he gets a chance to kill you. Since once you are no use to them, you get shot, just like James Bond 007 enemies. They shoot you if they see there is no benefit for them.As you can see an unforgiving conqueror doth not maketh a lasting empire since the best option for those under such oppression would be to escape or kill the conqueror. So in case you are a conqueror, Christianity rules worked. However, if the conqueror uses Bushido or Chrisitanity, or Nazi, then it is your ballgame to decide which strategies is best for you to adopt.Great film for people who like the realism. However, the philosophy was somewhat pro-Christian. There are much more depths that needs analyzing here as I express in this movie review.Mother Nature says it best: Adapt or Die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine POW movie with good performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but I like him. He was good in THE LOST BOYS, even if the movie wasn't so great itself. His off-screen performance in PHONE BOOTH was chilling and Jack Bauer from 24 is arguably one of his most well-known characters, surprisingly.In TO END ALL WARS he is one of many men captured by Japanese soldiers circa WWII and tortured in prisoner of war camps. The performances are very good and Robert Carlyle is good as usual.Overall this isn't a great movie but a good one with some fine performances and good direction. I'd recommend it, and probably say it's worth 3.5/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Movie About World War II - Bible vs Bushido Code of Honor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1942, 61,000 allied prisoners of war were forced by the Japanese to build the Thailand-Burma railway, also called the death railway, through the Burmese jungle in the very tight schedule of one year. A Scottish group of soldiers is arrested in a Japanese camp, and when their leader is executed by the Japaneses, the leadership of the band is transfered to Major Campbell (Robert Carlyle), Lt. Jim Reardon (Kiefer Sutherland) and Officer Ernest Gordon (Ciarán McMenamim). They become close friend of the British prisoner Dusty (Mark Strong), who speaks Japanese and understands their culture and principles. In order to support the starvation, the humiliation and the brutality of the captors, and keep the moral and dignity of their men, Ernest and Dusty give classes to the other soldiers. Through the Christian principles of the Bible, the men find freedom by forgiving the enemy and even through self-sacrifice. "To End All Wars" is a superb movie of war, certainly one of the best I have ever seen. Based on the true story, it is a deep story of human relationship and Christian principles. The cast is very inspired and it is hard to highlight one individual performance. The characters are very well constructed, and the story touches deep in the viewer's heart. It is impossible to control the tears in the scenes of the self-sacrifice of the selfish Lt. Jim Reardon, and the fate of Dusty. In the end of the story, the meeting of the real Ernest Gordon with Takashi Nagase in the memorial place is amazing. The Samurai's Bushido Code of Honor, which has many principles in common with Sun Tzu's The Art of War, is confronted with the Bible in this overwhelming movie. Most of the beautiful songs of the soundtrack are sang by M?ire Brennan, most known as Enya. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "A Última das Guerras" ("The Last of the Wars")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story, but really awful acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All due respect to those who suffered through the ravages of WWII. The story has a ring of truth, with some added features. The movie, however, was one of the worst I've ever seen. The emoting was amateurish at best, which is sad considering the actors involved. Some compared it to the movie Bridge Over the River Kwie, but the only comparison I could see was they were both set in a South East Asia jungle. Kwie is in Thailand; this story, we're told, was supposed to happen in Burma. Doesn't anyone study history and geography these days? And the title, trite by any other name, since "The War To End All Wars" was what WWI was called and was all about. Couldn't someone at least have been a little bit original? Total waste of time.</fullReview>
