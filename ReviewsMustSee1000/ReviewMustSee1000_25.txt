		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film first came out in 1980, I remember going to see it on opening night. The sheer terror that I experienced in viewing "The Shining" was enough to make me go to bed with the lights turned ON every night for an entire summer. This movie just scared the life out of me, which is what still happens every time I rent the video for a re-watch. I have seen The Shining at least six or seven times, and I still believe it to be simultaneously and paradoxically one of the most frightening and yet funniest films I've ever seen. Frightening because of the extraordinarily effective use of long shots to create feelings of isolation, convex lens shots to enhance surrealism, and meticulously scored music to bring tension levels to virtually unbearable levels. And "funny" because of Jack Nicholson's outrageous and in many cases ad-libbed onscreen antics. It never ceases to amaze me how The Shining is actually two films in one, both a comedy AND a horror flick. Ghostly apparitions of a strikingly menacing nature haunt much of the first half of the film, which gradually evolve into ever more serious physical threats as time progresses. Be that as it may, there is surprisingly little violence given the apparent intensity, but that is little comfort for the feint of heart as much of the terror is more implied than manifest. The Shining is a truly frightening movie that works symbolically on many levels, but is basically about human shortcomings and the way they can be exploited by unconscious forces combined with weakness of will. This film scares the most just by using suggestion to turn your own imagination against you. The Shining is a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Highly, highly recommended. - Paul</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly brilliant and scary film from Stanley Kubrick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't praise this film long enough!The Shining is, without doubt, one of Stanley Kubrick's undisputed masterpieces and a true classic in horror cinema. It is a film that, over the course of the years, has managed to scare the living hell out of its audiences (and still does). The film is an adaptation of Stepehen King's original novel, written in the late '70s, and although the film is not very loyal to the book, it still stands as a thing of its own.Right from the beginning, as we contemplate the car going to the hotel from those stunning aerial shots, deeply inside us we know that something in the film, somehow, sometime is going to go wrong. As we obtain that severe warning, an almost inaudible voice gently whispers to us 'sit tight', a sense of unexpectedness invades us all, and it is that very same feeling that makes our hair stand on end throughout out the entire movie.The plot is simple: Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in up in the secluded mountains of Colorado. Jack, being a family man, takes his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) to the hotel to keep him company throughout the long, isolated nights. During their stay, strange things occur when Jack's son Danny sees gruesome images powered by a force called 'the shining' and Jack is heavily affected by this. Along with writer's block and the demons of the hotel haunting him, Jack has a complete mental breakdown and the situation takes a sinister turn for the worse.The film, unlike many horror-oriented films nowadays, doesn't only rely on stomach-churning and gory images (which it does contain, anyway) but on the incredibly scary music based on the works of Béla Bartók and on the excellent cinematography (the Steadicam is superbly used, giving us a sense of ever-following evil), as well. The terrifying mood and atmosphere of the film is carefully and masterfully woven by Kubrick, who clearly knows how to really make a horror movie.Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as the mad father and husband is as over the top as it is brilliant. Shelley Duvall, who plays the worrying wife who tries to help her son, is also a stand out; she shows a kind of trembling fear in many scenes and is able to display weakness and vulnerability in a very convincing way. Undoubtedly, The Shining is full of memorable moments (the elevator scene or the 'Heeeeeere's Johnny' one-liner for instance) and, simply put, it's flawlessly brilliant.Stanley Kubrick's direction is pure excellence, giving the whole film a cold and atmospheric look, thus creating an unbearable sense of paranoia and terror. There are moments of sheer brilliance and exquisite perfection in this film; the horrifying maze chase is a perfect example. Every single shot is masterfully created and there are some genuinely scary scenes which will make you sit on the edge of your seat.The Shining is, in my opinion, a special landmark in horror cinema which will always be regarded as one of the scariest movies in film history. Since I saw it last year, when I was 13, I have rarely been able to have a bath in my bathtub.Just in case, ya know. Overall, The Shining is incomparably the scariest film I've ever seen in my whole life (and I can tell you I've seen a great deal of horror films).It is an unforgettable, chilling, majestic and truly, profoundly scary film crafted by an eccentric genius who wants to show that the impossible can be done. The Shining is a sublime, hauntingly intriguing and endlessly watchable film that shows Kubrick at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of psychological horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK's Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80's- performs it's duty as a fright flick, and then some.There are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that's completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it's memorable conclusion in the last half hour.Kudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of 'Hollywood talk', which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak 'on the nose', and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'Wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let's face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing achievement in filmmaking and the art of terror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fact: Kubrick is better than King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's well know that Stephen King doesn't like Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining (so much so that he scripted an abysmal TV movie version). According to him, Kubrick didn't understand the horror genre. Well, I think Kubrick did. I think he understood it only too well. He knew that it was a genre full of conventions, cheap tricks and tired clichés. Therefore Kubrick decided to throw all that nonsense out of the window and make a film based on atmosphere rather than predictable thrills. You don't get people here jumping out of the dark time after time. You don't get worthless shocks. Kubrick's version of The Shining is an insidious film. It gets under your skin. In other words, it isn't for Pavlovian dogs that have spent a lifetime being conditioned by cretinous nonsense.What runs deepest through The Shining is a frustration with family. Right from the beginning it's obvious that Jack isn't happy with his lot ? as he's being shown around the hotel he can't help but take a sneaky look at the backsides of a couple of women. Well, can you blame him? The poor man is married to a bug-eyed, bucktoothed Olive Oil look-a-like.Then there's Jack's quiet frustration with his son Danny. As he's driving to the hotel, he's bothered by requests for food. And then his son makes out that he's knowledgeable because he saw a programme on TV. Already he's slightly irked - he's got to spend months alone with these people; one who resembles Popeye's missus and one who talks to his finger.So really the hotel brings out nothing that isn't already there. It merely brings everything to the surface ? Jack's resentment as regards his wife, his frustration as regards his lack of writing talent and his annoyance at having a troubled son. It's kind of like he's testing his family. Are they strong enough as a unit to survive being cooped up together?One of the underlying themes in the film seems to be television. What happens in The Shining is what happens when someone stops watching the idiot box. With it, a person can find solace in mindless programming and retreat from the strictures of family life. Without it they're faced with all their problems and all the failings of their loved ones. Even the strongest family can be brought to its knees when there's no escape from each other's company. Therefore it's quite telling, when Jack loses the plot completely, that he spouts lines from TV: "Honey, I'm home" and "Here's Johnny." Just watch some television, Jack.But it's also the pain of writing that contributes to Jack's insanity. There's nothing quite as harrowing as an empty page. Plus there's nothing more annoying than being interrupted mid-flow. One of the best scenes in the film is when Jack tells his wife to get lost when she interrupts him. It's extremely violent in how cold Jack is towards Wendy. And because it's grounded in a reality, it's all the more effective.Also rather unsettling is the scene where Jack talks to his son. He makes Danny sit on his lap and he proceeds to tell him how much he loves him and how he'd never hurt him. It works so well because it's so cold and because there's such an obvious lack of affection. The words are just empty platitudes. They mean absolutely nothing.Jack's true feelings are only revealed when he gets to talk to Lloyd. It's in this scene that you realise the marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be ? Wendy has never forgiven him for accidentally hurting his son. And it's also in this scene that you realise (as if you hadn't noticed earlier) that Jack is absolutely crackers. He's talking to ghosts. But they could also be figments of his imagination, for there are mirrors behind most of the ghosts he talks to. Effectively he's talking to himself. And I love this matter of fact way of dealing with the supernatural. There are no fancy tricks. Everything just seems unnaturally natural.In fact, everything to do with the ghosts is superbly handled. The twins are spooky, Lloyd is amiable and Grady is out of his mind. And it's Grady who's probably the most chilling presence in the film. He starts off as a bumbling waiter but then quickly becomes a stone cold killer. Just the way he says 'corrected' conveys more terror than a million slasher films. And Philip Stone's performance is a million times more subtle than Nicholson's. I mean, as much as I like Jack in the film, he does chew the scenery. But Kubrick likes his over the top performances, so that's the way he wanted it.And undoubtedly it's Kubrick's movie. He's the real star. And I love everything he brings to the film. I love his command of lighting ? just look at The Gold Room scenes. I love his use of music. I love the way that he turns the Room 237 scene, one that could have been a standard 'jump' scene, into a comment on Jack's marriage ? his willingness to be unfaithful. I love the way that he leaves lots of unanswered questions. I love the shots of the blood coming out of the lift. I love the helicopter shots at the start. I love the way that pages and pages of typed words are the most frightening visual in the film. I love the maze. I love the fact that you see a ghost getting a blow-job from a ghost in a bear suit? Man, I love absolutely everything about this film. It's horror for people who know that true horror isn't being stalked by a man in a mask, but being trapped alone with your family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest movies ever---8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic horror from a master director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is offered a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel he accepts it as an opportunity to work on his novel in an isolated environment. He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles, his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear - but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy, although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here, his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest horror movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, it's better), I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says. I read that, a couple of decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (I tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was The Shining. And thank God, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as Jack Torrance (how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'). Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jack's desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.One of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack, Wendy, and Danny talking in the car, in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV, as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on TV (`See? It's okay, he saw it on the television.').The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and Kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when Danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway, you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? It's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubrick's movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Torrance Meets David Bowman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about the scariest movie I have ever seen that has not already been said by others more articulate than yours truly? Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather, this is a Stanley Kubrick film, and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick's entire body of work as a serious filmmaker. Thematically, THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film's overall technique.In a nutshell (no pun intended), Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall co-star with Oregon's Timberline Lodge - enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel - in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity, but deals with issues of child abuse, immortality and duality. What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique. Garrett Brown (the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials), inventor of the Steadicam, chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze, providing magic-carpet-ride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish. If the film starts off too slow, remember who the director is. This man likes to take his time, and the results are well worth it: incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel; horrific Diane Arbus-inspired twins staring directly at us; portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets; elevators that gush rivers of blood in slow-motion; Jack Torrance's immortality found via the hotel (akin to David Bowman's journey through the Space Gate); and some of the best use of pre-existing music ever assembled for a motion picture.It would take a book to examine and defend the film's strong points and drawbacks. If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off, with no interruptions, and make sure that it's raining. This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14. Makes a great double feature with Robert Wise's 1963 thriller THE HAUNTING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense "writing"... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.Okay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn't fare so bad. It's how Kubrick perceives King's universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.Horror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.Kubrick's cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.Certain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack's typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid's face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he's Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress. A delicate, detached thing thrown in with the mad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining, you know what's weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone, for people who claim to not like horror films, will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not, you have heard of it, know a few lines from it, and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack's "Here's Johnny!"? Who could forget "All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy"? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick's best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department, a lot of people say it's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove, but if those film pioneered film making, then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation, madness, terrifying images, and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. Jack Torrance, Jack's son Danny, and Jack's wife, Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day. The elderly African-American chef, Dick Hallorann, surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication "shining." Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain "shine" to it and many memories, not all of them good, and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Seeing this, Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts calling out the word "redrum" frantically, and scribbling it on walls. He goes into a trance, and withdraws; he now says that he is Tony, his own "imaginary friend." Jack sabotages the hotel radio, cutting off communication from the outside world, but Hallorann has received Danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" formatted in various ways. Horrified, Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker, which then unlocks releasing him. Danny has written "REDRUM" in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom. When she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is "Murder" spelled backwards. Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. "Here's Johnny!", and Jack's legendary image is born.The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall, her scene of finding Jack's rant All Work? is incredible, that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub, it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema. The reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection, it's been on The Simpsons, it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it, trust me.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Funniest Comedy of 1980</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I shall never, ever be able to understand the phenomenon known as Stanley Kubrick. When he was on, as with DR STRANGELOVE, he was brilliant. But when he was bad, he was awful.I saw THE SHINING in its first release in a packed movie house in New York City. I had read and loved Stephen King's novel; I am widely read in the horror genre and do not scare easily, but that book gave me the creeps for weeks.Well for all the people who have been raving what a masterpiece this film is, I can only tell you this. The crowd in the theatre started giggling the minute Jack Nicholson appeared on film, and by the time he chased Shelley Duvall up the stairs, the whole crowd was literally in stitches. And I was laughing right along with them. Maybe New York audiences are just jaded; I don't know.Not that this movie does not have some scary moments. Shelley Duvall is rather good when she is away from Nicholson and it starts to dawn on her that something evil is taking over her family and her life. Unfortunately, Miss Duvall plays Wendy Torrance, a strong, intelligent, and resourceful woman in the novel, as a pathetic, whiny ninny most of the time, and by the time Nicholson had her trapped in the bathroom, I am sure plenty of us were screaming for her head. It must be said that this is not the fault of Miss Duvall, a talented and intelligent actress who according to reports fought bitterly with Kubrick over his interpretation of Wendy.The kid talking to his finger is another idiotic and unintentionally hilarious bit of business that was not in the original novel. Why Kubrick thought this was a good idea is beyond me.But let's get down to the real problem: Jack Nicholson. In the right role, he can be very good, though he has never been among my top ten. Jack Torrance is totally the wrong role for him; for one thing, he does not look ordinary enough. But the worst thing is that Stephen King's story was about a man being SLOWLY AND INEXORABLY driven out of his mind. Nicholson goes nuts so early in the film that there is literally nowhere for him to take the character. And Kubrick was either in awe of Nicholson, who was still riding the post-Oscar high from CUCKOO'S NEST, or he just didn't care, or he thought it was scary when it was actually funny. I don't know.As if all this were not bad enough, the whole mess drags on for two hours and twenty-two minutes; this movie practically cries out for a pair of scissors.Some people will feel that I have spat on an icon, I suppose, and they have that right. But Stephen King himself was not happy with this film, and when he finally got the opportunity to re-do it as a television miniseries in 1997, the results were much better. For the one thing that is missing in Kubrick's version is a heart.Anne Rivers Siddons, in discussing her excellent horror novel THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR, writes that the thing about horror is that it smashes people and relationships. Thus the best horror stories are at bottom also very sad (Brian De Palma's CARRIE gets this; Kubrick's film does not). And whatever your feelings about the miniseries format may be, the Torrance family created in 1997 were people you could care about. Director Mick Garris understands King better than Kubrick did, and Rebecca De Mornay, in particular, redeems the Wendy character in a spectacular tour-de-force towards the end. In 1980 the Torrances were figures of fun. Rather like the barbaric Victorian custom of laughing at the lunatics in Bedlam.Awful, awful, awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie, Tense, Memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies I`ve seen, and I have seen a lot of horror flicks. It may not be faithful to the Stephen King book, but it still manages to have an intensely eerie tone to, even though any traces of a plot are practically absent. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance as always, and his descent into sheer madness is one of the most entertaining things about the movie, especially when he finally snaps, and turns against his own wife and son. Stanley Krubick has been called mysterious, and there is no doubt about it in this movie, almost every scene has some sort of obscurity to it, some mystery, and it forces to the viewer to feel at least a little bit frightened. Krubick is actually quite brilliant in the way he transforms almost every seemingly normal thing into something menacing, such as the snow-bound atmosphere, a set of twin girls, and even some shots of hallways and rooms gave me chills! In a critical way, "The Shining" is not a great film, there isn`t much substance, clarity or depth, but at the same time, you can`t help but be engrossed by it`s strikingly different style and effect. "The Shining" may not hold up to close fault-finding, but it`s certainly one of the most exceptional horror movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incoherent, lifeless, hack film-making. Horrible storytelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How this film gained such high praise and notoriety completely escapes me. I have seen hundreds of films, and this is easily the most incoherent, bland, and lifeless piece of work I can recall seeing (especailly by such a renowned filmmaker). And yes, I hated "2001: A Space Odyssey" as well. Long, drawn-out, boring, lifeless film packed full of irrelevant imagery and symbolism that amounts to a filmmaker who doesn't know how to tell an intelligent story with solid characters and emotions. That is the same exact problem here.First off, Shelley DuVall added nothing of value to the film. She was blah from beginning to end. No endearing qualities whatsoever. The whole film was a failed experiment thinking that random creepy, irrelevant images coupled with an incoherent story progression devoid of any character arcs would be successful. Kubrick had no sense of scene transitions. He shows no ability to allow one scene to flow into another, to give it fluidity or convey that he has an overall, consistent vision. The inconsistency over what aspect ratio he intended for it is further proof that he had no concrete vision, in my honest opinion. A solid, competent, talented director knows what they want, and are very confident in their visions. They have a very clear idea of how they want things viewed by every audience, everywhere. That's why directors and DPs hate it when their films are put into the pan-and-scan format. Kubrick also fails to have his DP shoot or light 98% of the scenes intriguingly. Watching this, it was like watching an old TV-movie - dull, uninspired, and lifeless. Yeah, the steadi-cams and dolly shots are all impressive, but sometimes, scenes seem to exist just to show off the cool camera moves they can do. Scenes which contribute absolutely nothing to the overall film, in any aspect. Being a filmmaker myself, I am of the belief that every scene should have a purpose to either the plot or characters of the film. Anything else is a waste. And beyond those steadi-cam and dolly shots, it's essentially bland for nearly the entire film. Almost zero interesting angles, and amateurish editing skills. Yawn inducing cinema.Good story progression would show Jack Torrance starting out as a well adjusted, happy family man that gradually descends into complete psychosis and homicidal mania. Instead, Kubrick shows him as already a man dissatisfied with his life, marriage, son, and career. Then, Kubrick just flashes a title card on the screen saying 'One Month Later,' and Jack is already deteriorated towards the verge of madness. That's shoddy storytelling, and a hack's idea of executing a character arc. No cause is given to why he becomes a homicidal maniac. There's also no correlation between all the surreal, nightmarish imagery. It's completely random, and doesn't evolve into revealing a story behind its origins. All this surrealism is just an excuse for it to be labeled 'horror' as it doesn't serve an underlying purpose as to why anything is happening amongst the characters. They don't confront, deal, or resolve the reasons or purpose behind it all. It's just there to make the film bizarre.Now, I don't mind methodically paced films as long as there's a purpose to it all. Any talented editor could make this a much more effective film by chopping a good 35 minutes or more out of it. Horror films require momentum to equal good pacing, and good pacing is necessary for solid tension. Still, even if there was tension and good pacing, fact is, really, there are no endearing characters in this film for me to build any sympathy for. I don't care what happens to them because they're one dimensional, emotionless, weak-willed people. How this family could even co-exist for five minutes is beyond me, let alone how they survived a more than three hour drive up to the hotel in the first place.This film is almost complete trash because it shows the filmmakers have no intelligence or coherence for the movie they were attempting to make. There are enormously better conceived and executed films from this time that proved far more effective. If you want isolation and paranoia, check out "John Carpenter's The Thing." If you want surrealism, go rent Don Coscarelli's original "Phantasm."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely have I seen a masterpiece of literature turned into a pile of horse manure...PROBLEMS:(SPOILERS)1.JACK NICHOLSON= Hugely miscast.The descent into madness is supposed to be gradual. This Jack looked like he was already going to murder his family.2.SCRIPT=Although the names and basic plot are in place(guy goes loopey in hotel) a lot of the scenes in the film I could not remember reading(eg two girls,blood in lift). Why did Kubrick drift from the book? Mostly, he didn't drift in A Clockwork Orange, so why here?Plus, the characters were one dimensional cardboard cut-outs, so how could I pity them?3.SHELLY DUVALL=Deserved to die, she was that annoying. The Wendy in the book is strong willed and not a pathetic loser. The reason they went to the Overlook was to save their marriage.4.ENDING=Jack did not freeze to death in the snow. In the book, it showed that Jack was still human enough to recognise his love for his son. The ''frozen'' scene here left me with a feeling of disgust that the pinnicale of the book had been replaced for a cheap shock.WATCH THE TV SERIES INSTEAD BUT READ THE BOOK FIRST.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the most overrated movie of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most overrated movie of all times. I'm not a huge horror fan and I get scared very easily, but this movie actually made me laugh or sigh in despair about the lengthiness of the scenes and the predictability of the plot. I read the novel when I was a teen and it beat the crap out of me, I still am afraid of bath tubs in hotel rooms (embarrassing but true). The novel is an all time favourite of me and when I read all the great reviews about Kubick's Shining I was really looking forward to see the movie. What a mistake. For all lovers of the book, this is not a book adaptation, Kubick made his own story...unfortunately. Not only does Dick Hallorann get murdered by Jack - the fact he survives in the novel was one of the reasons I loved the book so much, it has after all somewhat of a happy ending -, but even worse, Kubick turned the whole story around and twisted it to an extend where the original plot is hard to recognize. Jack Torrance is very obviously a mad man right from the beginning who very openly hates his wife and kid, so as others have pointed out before, why didn't he leave his family or killed them before. The whole point of the novel, the normal guy and loving father with a hang to alcohol who gradually gets brainwashed by appearances in the hotel, gets totally lost. One might wonder why the movie even needs the whole hotel plot if Torrance is already mad as a hatter from the very beginning. Apart from this, I guess, had I not read the novel I would probably not understand one bit of what was going on with the characters. But unfortunately that's not all. Also the performances of Nicholson and Duvall were so lousy, it really crept me out. I've never seen Jack Nicholson perform so badly, he seemed like a parody of himself and don't get me started on Shelley Duvall. Periodically I thought I watched some amateur actor in a school play. Her adaptation of Wendy Torrance was so annoying I was staggered between the wish of seeing her chopped to pieces and the wish to see her survive and protect her little boy. The character Wendy in the novel is a strong, resourceful person, the Wendy in the movie is a whiny, weak, and extremely stupid person. The fact that she lays down and sleeps while she is trapped with her 'sick' son and a mad man in a hotel with no contact to the outside world is beneath me. The ending is probably the worst part of the entire movie, on the one hand it's ecstasy as the film draws to an end on the other hand it is as far from the original plot as can be which in this case is an extremely bad thing. The only actor that impressed me was Danny Lloyd, apart from the fact that Kubick partly tried to turn him into a parody of Regan MacNeil I think he did a fantastic job for the little six year old boy he was to that time. He seemed like the only natural actor on the scene. All in all this movie was by far the biggest disappointment I've seen for a long time. Save your time, better read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Number one on my most awful list!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, I've already written one review for this movie. But I've gotten lots of hate mail since then because I was told I did not explain enough. So here goes.Lots of spoilers are coming.Let's start with the actors. Jack Nicholson puts on a terrific performance in this movie. I will say that much. However, I hate to say that is the ONLY good thing about this movie. The woman (can't even remember her name) is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. She was just annoying and I was pleading with the movie for her death. The little boy, in his slobbering fits, made me just want to puke. No, the only good thing about this movie was Nicholson.The plot is not too bad, but is, to be honest, very lame. He is a caretaker and must take care (duh) of the hotel during the winter, it's closed season. He takes his wife and child to live up there.Nothing happens for the longest time. It is just such a boring movie. I was so sick of it by the time Nicholson started losing it. By the way, he loses it for no reason. The movie doesn't explain anything. I've never read the book, so I'm guessing you'd have to read the book to understand ANYTHING. The kid has a magical talent or something called the Shining, but this has nothing to do with the movie! I was at a total loss!There's a rather grotesque scene involving a naked woman that really made me want to shut this off. But something drew me in... I guess I just wanted to see how bad it could really get.Whoo, I wish I didn't do that.It just gets worse and worse after that. The plot falls short with tons of holes, the storyline is absolutely boring and crooked, and the climax is TOTALLY predictable. I knew that the black guy would go up to the hotel, get killed, and the woman and child would take the vehicle and escape.The music is so horribly screechy that I just wanted to clap my ears and cause deafness every five minutes. But I guess it fits the grotesque atmosphere of the movie.I was utterly disgusted by this movie. If this is supposedly the best of horror, I will never want to watch the horror genre again for fear of seeing its worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real chore to sit through!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never did understand the appeal of this terrible movie. Mind you, I could probably say the same about most movies directed by Stanley Kubrick. He is one of those directors who produces very long, boring movies that move at a snail's pace and are really difficult to withstand for more than a few minutes at a time. Movies such as 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY, DR. STRANGELOVE and SPARTACUS are examples of this kind of movie.As many other commenters have pointed out, Stephen King didn't like this movie because it was not faithful to the book. In fact he hates it so much that 15 years or so after, he made his own movie entitled STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING. I've never seen the other version. But anything with his name attached is normally worth watching so I'll at least make the effort to track it down. It really couldn't be any worse than this tripe churned out by Stanley Kubrick.I've heard THE SHINING being referred to as "scary", "terrifying", "masterpiece", "classic", "thrilling", "horrifying" and so on. Yeah right! This movie does not even come close to producing anything equating to those words. The only horrifying thing about it is how it became so popular.Where can I start with the problems of this movie? Let's start with Jack Nicholson. I thought Jack Nicholson was great as The Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN, but in this he doesn't even seem to be acting. He plays a character who is supposed to become insane as the story progresses. Yet it is very clear from Jack's first scenes that his character has already "got a few screws loose". And that stupid "Here's Johnny!" line. Was it supposed to be scary? Funny? What? Who knows? It was just downright stupid as far as I'm concerned. Yeah I know it was a reference to Johnny Carson, but what's Johnny Carson got to do with this movie? The answer: absolutely nothing at all.And Shelley Duvall. What can I say about her? She looks like Olive Oyl from the POPEYE cartoons. How ridiculous! Somehow the viewer is expected to believe that her character and Jack are married with a kid. Yeah right! There is no chemistry between the two actors at all.Finally, Scatman Crothers. I have great respect for this actor. He appeared in TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE and it was one of the very dull segments. Yet his superb performance gave it credibility and the story touched upon my emotions. In THE SHINING, however, Mr. Crothers is there just to be killed and I don't suppose he was bothered about his character being killed off considering how lame the movie is. It was probably just a paycheck used to pay off a few debts. And the ridiculous thing is that the character in question never dies in the book.I honestly can't believe that people think this movie is better than classics such as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN and THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE. But yet this movie has a higher IMDb rating and is sitting very comfortably on the top 250 chart. Nonetheless, that won't alter the fact that the three mentioned movies put THE SHINING to shame any day.Stephen King's SALEM'S LOT was infinitely superior to this movie. Personally I think the director of that movie, Tobe Hooper, should have been asked to direct THE SHINING. We would have had an infinitely superior movie. Trust me. I've seen plenty of Mr. Hooper's movies and he very rarely fails to disappoint. THE FUNHOUSE was a low point of Mr. Hooper's career but even that movie looks like Oscar-worthy material compared to THE SHINING.Overall, I would not recommend this at all. I've not seen STEPHEN KING'S THE SHINING, so I can't really recommend it just yet. But, I would recommend checking out some proper horror movies such as SALEM'S LOT, PSYCHO, THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE just to name a few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Masterpiece of Horror Lives On!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*!!- SPOILERS - !!*Before I begin this, let me say that I have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the "Authorized Version" of this movie, remade by Stephen King, himself, in 1997.Both advantages made me appreciate this version of "The Shining," all the more.Also, let me say that I've read Mr. King's book, "The Shining" on many occasions over the years, and while I love the book and am a huge fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling ... and SCARY.Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film. In the direction of the movie AND the writing of the screenplay, itself, he acquired the title "Magus" beyond question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding credits are: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more.The Torrences (Jack, Wendy his wife and Danny, their son) are living in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack has been hired as the caretaker. It is his job to oversee the upkeep of the hotel during the several months of hard snow, until spring when the Overlook reopens its doors. It seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the Colorado Mountains for a snow-filled summer getaway.The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. It lent to the atmosphere, by having a dark, yet at the same time "welcoming" atmosphere, itself. The furnishings and furniture was all period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. It not only lets you enjoy the approach to the Overlook, it also fixes in your mind how deserted and isolated the Hotel is from the rest of the world.The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters was a stroke of genius. You get the whole story of their past, Danny's "imaginary friend," Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice, neat introductory scene. There was no need in stretching the past history out over two hours of the movie; obviously, Kubrick saw that from the beginning.Closing Day. Again, the scenic drive up the mountains to the Hotel (this time, with family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange.The initial tour through the Overlook is quite breathtaking, even as the "staff" is moving things out, you get a chance to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furnishings, dormants and crown moldings in the architecture. "They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even the "staff wing" is well designed and beautifully built.The maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian. When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center, seeing Wendy and Danny entering, it's a magickal moment; one that tells you right away, there are heavy energies in that house; there's something seriously wrong, already starting. "I wouldn't want to go in there unless I had at least an hour to find my way out." (The Hotel Manager)Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance. His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. You could actually believe you were there in the hotel, taking the tour of the kitchen with Wendy and "Doc." His explanation of "the shining" to Danny was very well delivered, as was his conversation with the child about Tony and the Hotel. It was believable and sincere.The cut out and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains looming behind, the cold air swirling about, mist coming up from the warm roof of the snowbound hotel, adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie. It also marks the "half-way-to-hell" point, so to speak; the turning point in the movie.Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence was masterful. (So WHAT if she also played Olive Oyl?! It just shows her marvelous diversity!) Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said," What? Olive Oyl? *lol* (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I took that back as soon as the movie started. She's brilliant. In this Fiend's opinion, this is her best performance, to date! (Although I did love her in Steve Martin's "Roxanne," 1987.)Once Kubrick has established the pearly bits of information of which you, the viewer, need to be in possession: the Torrence's past; Danny's broken arm; Tony; the history of the Hotel itself; the fact that Danny is not "mental," but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general layout of the Hotel; all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences; the movie never stops scaring you.The two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (the girls having appeared several times to Danny, first by way of Tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel) were icons with which Danny could identify, and of which he was afraid, at the same time. They were haunting (and haunted), themselves and showed Danny how and where they were killed, in a rather graphic and material way.Kubrick's Tony was written as an attendant spirit, like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father. He was..."the little boy who lives in my mouth." He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny. NOT like in the book, I realize, where Tony was intended by Stephen King to be the projection of Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father. Kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when Tony "took ... Danny ... over." The idea of Danny's older self projecting back to his younger self isn't...scary.The "Woman in the Shower" scene, done by Lia Beldan (about whom I can find no other credits for having done anything before, or since) as the younger woman and Billie Gibson (who ALSO appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since), was seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting. It was dramatic, and frightening. Abhorrent and scary. When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL.Jack quickly embarks on his trek from the "jonesing" alcoholic to a certifiable insane person. The degradation of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, would-be mental patients and drug addicts do) portrays his pressing NEED of the atmosphere to which Lloyd avails him; namely, alcohol ..."hair of the dog that bit me." (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no charge to Jack. "Orders from the house." (Lloyd the Bartender) Nice play on words.When Wendy find's Jack's "screenplay" is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles...when he asks from the shadows, "How do you like it?" and Wendy whirls and screams with the baseball bat in her hand...is so poignant. It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is...how messed up Jack is. It's very scary, dramatic and delivers a strong presence. That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood, imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy, and with the confrontational ending to this scene, make this possibly THE strongest scene of the movie.The "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What do I say? What mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young, troubled son standing over them with a huge knife, talking in that freaky little voice, exclaiming "REDRUM" over and over? Even if it HAD no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL. It was something everyone could (and has) remember(ed). Speaking of memorable scenes...Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history. His ad-libbed line, "Heeeeere's Johnny!" was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. It also goes down in horror movie history.The ending..? Kubrick's ending was perfection. I felt it ended beautifully. No smarm, no platitudinous whining, no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie. Just epitomized perfection. That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending.Who cares what was taken out?! Look what Kubrick put IN. Rent it, watch it, BUY IT. It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason. IT RAWKS!!*Me being Me* ... Take this movie, and sitck it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 "Authorized" version done by King and stick it down in the kiddie section. That's where it belongs. .: This movie rates a 9.98 from the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With THE SHINING Stanley Kubrick grabs the audience with the very first shot of the opening title sequence: A zoom shot over a lake as bombastic and very disconcerting music is played and as the music continues eldritch cries of children can be heard in the background!!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!! This is scary and Kubrick also injects even more terrifying moments into the movie . Three people husband and wife Jack and Wendy Torrance along with their young son Danny stay at a remote hotel as caretakers during the winter , a winter that sees them snowed in so right away you know this family can't easily escape or call for help so did anyone else feel their heart jump Wendy comes screaming to Jack saying they're not alone in the hotel and that there's an old woman there ? Did anyone get a fright when Jack confronted her in the bathroom . THE SHINING is full of these very scary moments " If it's got so many scary bits and works in terrifying you Theo why only seven out of ten ? Surely this must be something of a horror masterpiece " It was awarded seven out of ten because that's what THE SHINING deserves over all . Despite moments of heart-attack inducing fear that's all they are - Moments , which makes THE SHINING rather patchy and we have to endure many slow moments . You want to find out how boring it is being a caretaker at a remote hotel ? Watch this movie I could have forgiven the slow moments but my major gripe is that I found the movie confusing . I have never read King's novel but that doesn't matter because an adapted screenplay should make sense whether the audience has read the book or not and since the message board for THE SHINING is overflowing asking this and that question as to what the ending was about ? , How was Jack Possessed ? What is that photograph about ? etc this means the story has been badly adapted for the silver screen , which considering the potential can possibly be described as unforgivable since my abiding memory of this movie is how much it caused me to scratch my head , nott how much it caused me to jump out of my seat</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What to say....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, the originality of the story is great, mainly because it was done before all of those abandoned but "haunted" hotels, motels, houses, whatever kind of building scenario. But I thought the movie moved at a time dragging pace, the whole shot of Danny Torrence rolling around on his tricycle left me wondering..."What was the director thinking?" A lot of the things that happened in the movie made no sense to me really. The book I thought was much more clear and less abstract on the transformation of Jack Torrence. I also thought the betrayal of Jack Torrence's character was wrong. We essentially knew nothing about him or his family, other than Danny was having bad dreams, then it starts with the Torrence's taking over of the hotel for the winter and Jack has lost his mind.I loved how it was done in the book, you got a good feel for who Jack was and where he had come from and you felt good about him. When they go to the hotel the symptoms Jack experienced where eye widening. He was chewing on the aspirin, losing his temper and getting major headaches, all conclusive to when he was drinking, but he wasn't. I thought the movie missed a little on that. The movie by itself however seemed to want to breath a life of it's own rather than paying homage to the novel it came from. I guess when it came down to it, I really had no care for the wife and child. Danny walking around saying redrum was really one of the most annoying things I have ever had to watch. But because the film was so slow to progress that when the climax finally showed up it failed to make up for lost time and attention.All in all, an O.K. movie, but I really don't see what the hype was all about in the this other than the famous "Here's JOHNNY!" line. Watch it if you wish, obviously it has a 8.5 on IMDb for a reason...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am dismayed at the overwhelming positive response to this garbage of a movie. The only explanation I can come up with is the responses are affected by what I can the "Genius Effect" and time. The Genius Effect (which I'm sure someone else probably has coined - but if not, I'll take credit!) would dictate that if the filmmaker is a genius, then the film is a work of genius and must be excellent. Since I don't consider Kubrick a genius, I don't think all he had done was great. Some of it was OK, probably the best was FULL METAL JACKET, but I digress. I do think this point has some merit because reviews of Eyes Wide Shut were very good and, very recently, it was revealed that Kubrick himself thought it was bad (see Guardian Unlimited Film, http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1888077,00.html).The other effect, time, is more of what I remember people saying when the movie first came out. There were many comments that it shouldn't be considered a horror film but rather a comedy because audiences were laughing more than screaming (and not just at the funny moments, i.e. "Here's Johnny!"). It seems audiences are more kind as time goes by, or at least in this case anyway.The "acting" in this film is absolutely atrocious, especially that of Shelley Duvall, which one IMDb user stated "is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all." That's because it isn't. It is flat and unemotional (even when she tries to be emotional). Jack Nicholson doesn't become crazy due to isolation, he's nuts from the beginning. His character's dealing with his wooden family doesn't beg the question, "Why does he want to kill his family," but, "Why didn't he do so long before this?" Not saying I condone injury to the dull and irritating, but being locked up with those two would put anyone's nerves on edge. I can't believe they survived the car ride to the hotel.Needless to say, I didn't find THE SHINING scary in any way, even when I saw it at age 11. By then, I had the wits scared out of me by a far worse movie IT'S ALIVE (gimme a break, I was 7). After that, I have yet to be scared by any other movie, and THE SHINING never even came close.In all honesty, I have tried to give THE SHINING a reasonable chance. I've seen it more than five times, thinking "I must be missing something." Each time it gets worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel over the years &amp; not all of them good." A great horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining starts with Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) driving to an isolated hotel named the 'Overlook' situated high in the Colorado mountains for an interview with it's manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) about becoming the Winter caretaker. Ullman tells Jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh Winter sets in. Together with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) &amp; young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) Jack moves into the hotel &amp; at first everything seems fine, it's a beautiful hotel, absolutely huge &amp; whatever they need is at their disposal. However the Overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide &amp; Danny has the ability to 'shine' which means he has psychic powers that let him see &amp; hear things 'ordinary' people can't. As the days, weeks &amp; months begin to pass Jack become more &amp; more insane, Danny keeps 'seeing' things &amp; people while Wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what's happening to her family, as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped Jack finally loses it...This English production was co-written, co-produced &amp; directed by Stanley Kubrick &amp; is a fine horror film. It appears that The Shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions &amp; the one I will be commenting on is the shorter European cut that runs just under 2 hours in length. The script by Kubrick &amp; Diane Johnson, is based on the novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I can't compare them, goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film. There are very few character's in The Shining with Jack, Wendy &amp; Danny the only ones that really matter, since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them, become involved with them &amp; what they go through. The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long &amp; keeps you interested throughout. On the negative side I don't think the reasoning behind Jack going crazy &amp; wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me, the fact that Jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me &amp; I don't know if I missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever, I'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about! There is very little in the way of violence or gore, a couple of rotten zombie ghosts &amp; someone is killed with an axe but The Shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood &amp; special effects as it has a gripping story. With a budget of about $19,000,000 The Shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as Kubrick, the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing &amp; smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character's around the maze of corridors, the sets look absolutely real &amp; instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners, basements &amp; cobwebs Kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors, massive open expansive spaces &amp; a modern decor (well 80's modern, just check that red toilet out!). The acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying &amp; Nicholson seems crazy from the very start. The Shining is an absorbing film that I enjoyed watching although I'm not sure I'd watch it again anytime soon. For those looking for explosions &amp; fancy special effects you will be disappointed, for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story I definitely think The Shining is for you, well worth a watch in my humble opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of The Best Horror Films Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was kinda surprised when I heard that Stanly Kubrick had made a horror film and that it was The Shinning was a big shock to me. Kubrick is one of my favorite film makers and after I saw 2001 and Clockwork Orange I had to see his other movies. I had heard a lot about this movie and kinda a lot of the scenes but I really didn't remember this movie that well. So I rent the movie and watch it as soon as I got home and loved it. This is one of my favorite movies even though I really do not like the horror movies. Jack Nicholson give his best performance(have not seen One Flow Over The Cuckoo's Nest).Sherry Duvall and Danny Loyd do better good but I didn't like their performances. The thing I didn't like about this movie is that the shinning in the story is wear the Danny can do a lot of telepathic things with his head, which I thought was kinda random. Even though that the things I didn't like about this movie really bug me I still love this movie. This is a great movie if like to see another Stanley Kubrick film or just want to watch the one of the best horror films out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm being a bit sarcastic but the truth remains that this movie was not horrifying. This was supposed to horrify us????? I know exactly how some people will feel when they read my comment, cuz I felt the same when I saw someone write something like this when I read a few comments about Terminator 2 or even Fight Club. But sorry guys the truth has to be told, and yes everyone's perception matters its the whole lot of perception that make or break a matter. Learn to live with it instead of just flinging curses at me. Now about the movie, I must ask, which is the scary part??? The isn't genuinely 1 descent scene to make me feel terrified and or anticipate. And yes I'm quite easy to get scared, when I was younger 13 ghosts terrified me (seesh)... I am an avid horror fan and have seen from gore and violent movies (Zombie flicks) to complicated (Donny Darko)to completely non-sense movies. But nothing even comes close to this. I saw Zombie Holocaust a day back and thought that no movie can be worst, I'm still correct but maybe it was all the overhype and the anticipation that made me absolutely NOT LIKE The Shinning. I mean why is the movie even called "The Shining", it should be called, Jack Nicholson Balding, cuz that's what's the camera mostly covers. His balding spot(s). The end is the worst ending ever possible and nothing makes sense. If a ghost can unlock the door, why cant he kill the mother and the kid? If the Perverted Black Cook had the Shine and knew something was wrong, why didn't he bring a weapon? Was he mentally blinded by the Shine??? Or was he thinking he was macho enuf? For all I know Jack may have just forgotten a fuse outside somewhere and his wife would have found it and it would still be the same movie, now Stanley wishes he had called it the Balding.... Plus I rally didn't feel claustrophobic and or scared almost never. The only time I got a little (yes it was a tiny winy little wittle moment) when I saw the old lady. Maybe be it was the anticipation or maybe it was the horror factor, but I still believe that this movie could have been much better off with a genre of "Thriller" Horror sheesh Dark Knight was more horrifying</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest directors, one of the greatest actors, one of the worst movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time and his many movies are excellent, probably because he is perfectionist, despite this is a torture for the actors who worked with him. As I read, he had gotten Shelley Duvall act the same scene 87 times, then Duvall had a nervous breakdown. It seems impossible, but unfortunately, in spite of this effort (perfectionism) there is nothing except for Jack Nicholson. Everyone talks about the bicycle scene with amazement. Yes, it was interesting, but if we think about Kubrick's other movies, it is nothing. The script is seriously mediocre, the direction is a bit better than the script. For example, the development of the story is uninspiring. Nicholson enters the bar of the house and starts to talk to a man, but also he does not react at all as if everything is fine. What a bad idea to mention that the house is uncanny. You think to yourself like what is going on here? The idea of the man who comes a mansion with his wife and children, then he starts to go mad was not well adapted in other words. The movie is in contradiction with Kubrick's coherent direction style. The final was one of the most uninspiring finals of all times and a little bit ridiculous. The characters who sense the danger and try to help are nonsense and unnecessary. Those characters only serve to thrill us, but unnecessary. The child often looks gawkily, he gapes. Those moments are very silly and to me really annoying. The hatchet scene is the best (the only best) scene of the movie. I should count the bicycle scene, too which the child rides his bike through the corridors. Generally, in fact, always, nobody does something to the bad movies which loved and overrated, but The Shining was nominated for the worst director in Razzie awards. When I learned, you can't imagine how I cheered up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror movie. Based on the novel by Stephen King.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another fantastic movie directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick.It was released back in 1980 so you shouldn't expect the overuse of special effects (SE) like in many modern movies. They simply didn't have that technology. And I think the quality of the story sometimes can benefit from that. I've seen to many movies were stories drown in SE. Anyway, Kubrick won an Academy Award for SE. In The Shining he sure knows when to use them and not. Excellent camera-work.Kubrick uses well balanced and clear images. Combined with a fantastic story progression and strong psychological impressions it all sums up to a great movie experience with a great nerve. It is all so clear and so deadly. It really is composed well and it does exactly what a horror movie is intended to do: Scare the hell out of the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A tremendous sense of Isolation"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his greatest achievement in the sumptuous period drama Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick moved on to make his statement on the horror genre. A massive shift in focus, but perhaps not such a surprise since there were elements of horror in 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.Kubrick's greatest strength is probably in that he always followed his own muse, regardless of what was going on in cinema at any one time. Of course, he was sometimes influenced by his contemporaries, but he never followed a trend. The Shining is at once bold and innovative, yet also nostalgic and old-fashioned. In a way this mimics the story's theme of history repeating itself and the overlapping of past and present events ? a typically Kubrick-esquire mixing of style and content.The atmosphere of The Shining is created through use of space and place. Kubrick shows us two kinds of space at the Overlook Hotel. There are vast, empty spaces such as the grand hall and the gold room, generally revealed to us in slow zooms. Jack is more often shown in these rooms, and they represent his growing isolation from his family and his detachment from reality. Then there are the winding passages like the corridors and the maze, which Kubrick's camera explores with steady tracking shots. More often than not it is Wendy and Tommy whom the camera follows through these passages, and this gives us the sense of confinement and helplessness of their situation.In terms of place, The Shining is in a way a Heart-of-Darkness style journey into hostile territory. The opening credit sequence tells us this right at the start, as we see Jack's car travelling higher and higher into the mountains, a tiny dot from the helicopter shot. The Overlook Hotel resembles its mountainous surroundings, both in shape and colour. Kubrick's construction of space and place combine to create the nightmare situation ? a place which is in itself massive and spacious, but which is also a prison, cut off from the outside world.Kubrick is perhaps best known for bucking trends, and rejecting by-the-book approaches, and The Shining does go against the horror grain in several respects. Perhaps most notable is the light. Whereas virtually every horror film prior to this had exploited the darkness, The Shining (as its title suggests) is filled with light and brightness. It's also something of a return to the early days of horror, largely favouring creepy atmospherics over slasher shocks. In fact, there is a very direct and obvious reference to DW Griffith's Broken Blossoms (not actually a horror, but it's still got the axe moment) and even Shelley Duvall's performance towards the end slips into wonderful Lillian Gish-style melodramatics.The Shining is tightly constructed, and it certainly stands out from its contemporaries in the genre, but like many of Kubrick's films it is seriously overrated. For all its supposed sophistication some of the horror moments are terribly camp and corny ? for example the old woman in the bathtub does the most ridiculous zombie lurch I've seen outside of B-horror. Those quick zooms and that snare thing on the soundtrack that accompany every shock moment are massively overused and soon become tedious. For my money the supernatural horror elements do not really work ? he just doesn't get the creepiness right. It's only the real-life, psycho-killer aspects that have any impact here, and this is mainly down to the intensity of the acting performances. I'm risking flak by saying this, but maybe the film would have been better if Kubrick left out all the ghosts and just told a story about a man's journey into murderous insanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whoever said horror only happens when it's dark?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in 1981 and, just recently, decided to see it again before I wrote a review.Time hasn't diminished the effect: this is still a scary movie from one of the industry's greatest directors.After seeing it for the first time, I sourced Stephen King's novel and sat down to have good read. Boy, was that a mistake? I gave up trying to read King's dense narrative that seemed to be all over the place, leaving it aside so that I could remember the effectiveness of Kubrick's screenplay. Only much later, did I learn that Kubrick's script deviated markedly from King's novel. Well, I guess that's art...There are many striking features about the film. First, who would expect to see a true horror movie shot mostly in bright daylight and at such an idyllic setting? Quite the opposite to all the Dracula type schlock that had been so common and that graced cinema screens up till then. Recall Psycho from 1960... The effect for me was to make the narrative all the more horrifying.Did I say idyllic setting? More like modern Gothic, in a way. Or maybe Kubrick was subtlety poking fun at prior so-called horror flicks that had the inevitable dark castle sitting on hill, with lightning crashing around most of the time?And then there's Jack Nicholson, one of Tinsel Town's eccentrics, if not crazy, playing a role tailor made for him. How could it not be, after seeing how well he did in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)? Some might argue he was over the top, a caricature almost, of a man who truly goes insane. Watching him for the second time, however, I think his performance reminded me all too well of insane people I've met in real life.As a study in abnormal psychology, I think it works very well ? in fact, it's a tour de force. And that's why I'm still also a mite disappointed by the way the narrative turns to use supernatural elements to explain the reasons for Jack's descent into his private Hell. (I suppose I'll have to read King's novel to sort this out.) I'm prepared to accept the idea of telepathy between young Danny (Danny Lloyd) and Dick (Scatman Crothers) because I've come across situations that strongly suggest its probability. I see no need, however, to introduce the supernatural, except to appeal to the gullible.Shelley Duval is well cast as the already nervous wife, Wendy; and, I read that Kubrick made her even more nervous with his need for perfection. Scatman was suitably impressive and mysterious; a fine actor and composer. And, hats off to young Danny Lloyd.If this is a movie you've missed, I recommend it thoroughly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a Horror film that doesn't suck.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a Horror nut.But, "The Shining" is one of the few Horror films that I did enjoy watching.Not only is it a Kubrick(2001 and Clockwork Orange)Movie, but it's also one of Jack Nicholsen's best leading role's I've seen yet.The story is about a teacher who's now a writer named Jack. He applied to be the Groundskeeper for a Hotel Resort in the mountains during the Winter. They close the Hotel during the Winter because the place would be snowed in and be difficult for the cars to get out. It would cost to remove the snow all the time so closing the Hotel for the Season is cheaper.Jack got the Job and brings his family along to stay there for the season. Jack feels very honored to get a job like this. His wife is proud of him too. And his son, Danny is looking forward in seeing the place.Danny has a split personality where he has a bitter half named Tonny who live in his mouth. And has some physic powers too. This freaked Danny's mom a bit but a Doctor said it's nothing too serious.When they made to the Hotel they get a tour from the Hedge mazed to the lobby and to the Kitchen. This Hotel however is built over an Indian burial ground. Strange things happen in this type of place. Being trapped in a place like this all winter can make a kind man become a serial killer.I never read the book but I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's one of the few Horror/Thriller movies I consider "cool". Has some great moments, great dialog, and a cool ending. It's something I can see again and again.I recommend it to all the Kubrick, Nicholsen, and Stephen King Fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All play and no work makes Jack (Nicholson) a VERY dull boy. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's certainly not a new complaint in relation to this film, but I must register it anyway: Jack Nicholson's acting here is all wrong for the material. Instead of a slow buildup from banality to insanity - which, given the movie's otherwise brilliant creepiness of tone and style - could have been truly horrific to watch, we get Jack Torrance as the nutjob Big Bad Wolf right from the very beginning. It's weird: it's as if Kubrick is indeed making the ultimate horror film, and Nicholson is sabotaging it every step of the way by enacting the ultimate horror film *parody*. Each on its own terms is immensely enjoyable, but they effectively cancel each other out. I've never seen the styles of director and star diverge so emphatically (A minor comparison would be the first "Fletch" movie, where Michael Ritchie's taut direction is appropriate to a gritty crime thriller, but where star Chevy Chase waltzes through the vehicle glibly throwing darts into every dramatic setup).However, there's no point in blaming Nicholson for the mess - this was clearly the way Kubrick wanted the part to be played. Perfectionist and control freak that he was, you don't believe for a minute that any inch of a Kubrick film isn't exactly how he wanted it; he certainly wouldn't allow a mere *actor* to steamroll his well-laid plans, not even one as forceful and magnetic as Jack Nicholson. Still, this movie - together with Batman, and even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - soured me on Jack for a long time; I found in him an actor far too willing to coast on his personality and to ham it up mercilessly, rather than bother to actually create a recognizable human being. Such a technique is fine, even commendable, for farceurs like Jim Carrey or Paul Reubens (either one of which would probably have been just as effective as Nicholson is here at being Jack Torrance) but we should expect more from our so-called Dramatic Actors. It wasn't until I saw some of his more restrained, nuanced work in such films as Ironweed, Wolf, The King of Marvin's Gardens, and even (amazingly) Easy Rider that I realized what a truly fine performer Nicholson can be when he is forced to, as it were, paint in between the lines (by the way, no complaints from me about his Oscar for As Good As It Gets - he's the only actor alive who could have made that part work the way it did). It's just too bad Kubrick didn't decide to use him this way; watching Jack Torrance go from a diffident, restrained man (watch the first part of Wolf to see how surprisingly well Nicholson can play such a character) to a rampaging lunatic would have been truly frightening (even with the extra bit of campiness Nicholson throws in - "Heeere's Johnny!", etc). It would have been as if the Overlook Hotel unleashed some primordial demon from the depths of an essentially decent man. The way it plays now, Jack's evil and insanity are loudly telegraphed from the very beginning (those dancing eyebrows of his NEVER stop!) - all that's left is to go through the motions.Of course, there are some pretty startling motions to go through in this movie; Kubrick's technical brilliance and his ability to create an engrossing mise en scene ensure that the film can never be seen as a total failure. In fact, when Nicholson is offscreen, the goosebump factor here is actually pretty high. The long tracking shots of Danny riding his Big Wheel through the winding hotel corridors are justly famous, as is the very design of the Overlook's wide open - yet paradoxically oppressive - map room (where Jack does his "writing"): these sequences effectively make the Overlook into a character itself. The isolation of it, its stillness and quiet, and most importantly its labyrinthian hugeness serve to overwhelm the tiny family and break down whatever bond they may have (which, again, would have been so much more effective if we felt this family was ever bonded in the first place). Kubrick ingeniously avoids shock devices, for the most part, and creates his spooky atmosphere through an almost inhuman stillness and quiet - which effectively creates an undertow of dread and expectation in the viewer. Quite simply, there are images and flash-cuts in this movie that will get under your skin and that you will never be able to shake - they will haunt your subconscience forever (deliciously). None more so than the truly classic moment where Wendy, the wife, finally discovers what it is Jack has been "writing" all this time: I can think of few movie moments in history that are so gut-bustingly hilarious and at one and the same time so bone-chillingly frightening and perverse. For this one moment alone, the film demands a viewing.It's simply too bad that Kubrick felt the need to invade the sanctity of his gothic cathedral like setting with the over the top rantings and ravings of the town lunatic. Not that that lunatic is not one devil of a fun guy to hiss and laugh at, it's just that he belongs in a different movie - the Evil Dead flicks, maybe, or one of Freddy Krueger's opuses. This conflict in styles between star and director ultimately make The Shining, for me at least, a frustrating experience: I keep wishing one of them would just get out of the other's way. The Shining could have been one of the hammiest and most enjoyable grand guignol horror experiences ever, or it could have been perhaps the most finely crafted and subtly shaded psychological thriller of all time. Alas, it cannot be both - and in trying to do so, it effectively undermines itself at every turn.</fullReview>

It was the only horror movie Kubrick ever made, which may be positive on our part; because he was always motivated by a style that seldom had seen reproduction from other filmmakers, this allows one to look at the product from a neutral perspective, canceling out all standard comparisons to other horror movies, especially those that were also tailored from Stephen King novels (although King himself thinks Kubrick's adaptation of his novel was butchery, for some reason?). To say that the picture is one of a kind is accurate, but one in a million feels even more appropriate. It is in that small handful of the scariest horror movies ever made, and it distances itself from the typical 'slasher' genre, which is now very tiring, because no remake in made in the 2000s can beat out the original 1970s/1980s version.Another equally amazing thing is, after all this time, is how well Kubrick used his actors, music and visuals to underscore the themes of the story itself. The technical details are prototypes in themselves, helping the story build massive tension; the long hallway shots, the eerie musical score, the use of words written backwards, the implication of a blizzard, and the tall, wide staircases establish a sense of uncertainty for both the audience and the individuals in the movie. Each of the characteristics are also evidence of the haunting craftsmanship?the photography of the hotel, for instance, creates a portrait of breathtaking beauty long before the breakdown of the characters' lucidity chars our attraction to it.The performances are just brilliant, but with the exception of Shelly Duvaull, while her performance as a caring mother is good, her mousy screams get very overacted, and tedious after a while. But Jack Nicholson was AMAZING in this film, his performance was strong, believable and terrifying. It is easily his best performance to date!Overall, everything in The Shinning works brilliantly. Full of brilliant psychological scares and flawless imagery.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's epic nightmare of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>''The Shining''is one of my favorite horror movies of all times. While Jack Torrance's madness increases, you stay more and more tense while the movie develops. And the movie really makes you scared in some scenes. Being the work of a perfectionist(Stanley Kubrick) and a plot by Stephen King, this movie who gave a lot of trouble and work to be ready,is a good option for everybody who is a horror genre's fan!Jack Torrance got the job of caretaker of the Overlook Hotel,since it is going to be closed down during winter.Jack and his family will be the only people in the hotel for a long while Danny, the little boy, is the one who sees things that no one else sees: he is the one who first sees the ghosts in the hotel and also sees what is about to happen in a near future. Danny is what we call to be ''the shinning'' as well as Halloram, the hotel's cook. But the hotel is full of bad spirits,and many of them are helping Jack to become crazy...Jack Nicholson is great and really looks a mad man. Shelley Duvall has a strange type, but has nice screams.Danny Lloyd, that plays Danny Torrance, is my favorite character. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Visual Treat From Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this came out on DVD, I gave it another shot, after not being too impressed with the VHS the first time. Wow, what a difference! Now, it's on Blu-Ray and it's really fantastic - the best yet! This is a "must see" in high-def.I found it to be very entertaining, very suspenseful and a visual treat. Those visuals were so good that I didn't mind the slow pace. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her "Olive Oyl" face, smile and soft voice. She got panned by a lot of people, and that was unfair. She's fine. The kid (Danny Lloyd) was good, too, as were the supporting players.The film is typical (director Stanley) Kubrick weirdness but not as weird as some of his other stuff. The only things I personally didn't care for were two blasphemous outbursts by Nicholson and a general unpleasant feeling seeing the innocent Duvall and son terrorized near the end. I did think, story-wise, that Nicholson's character went "crazy" a bit too fast. That could have been drawn out more....but I'm not complaining because I genuinely am fascinated with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrid Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King is one of the greatest American novelists in the past century. While he is dubbed a "horror writer," he is much more than that. He is a character writer, and while his novels are intended to scare, characters are the central point of the novels. They rely so heavily on backstory that the characters are practically real. However, this is very hard to do on film and it can result in making the story seem unimportant. So, as you can expect, I was not eager to see how they could ruin The Shining. Well, after reading the spectacular novel, I moved onto the film. After watching the film, I was flaming mad. The film The Shining does not fail from their overuse of backstory. These characters are completely shallow and you don't care about them. King novels are hard to adapt, but they can be done well. Carrie is an example of that. However, this movie is an awful adaptation. Kubrick basically took some character names, some locations, and made his own "scary hotel" movie. Why he couldn't just make his own "scary hotel" movie, I don't know. The acting is, for the most part, garbage. Shelley Duvall gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. She's just so awful that you want her to get killed, as opposed to the novel. I just felt that I didn't care about anybody in this film. It felt empty and like there was no point to anything in the end. King said that he doesn't like the film because it doesn't make you feel. I agree completely with that. I felt nothing other than lack of interest when I watched this stinker. It wasn't even passable as a good stand-alone film. I hated every minute of this film. It was supposedly psychological horror, but it didn't make me think at all. This movie is horrible, and I hope book readers never have to witness an adaptation as bad as this atrocity...well, okay, there is the '97 TV movie, but even that's not as bad as this crap!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely awful, awful stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This entire movie could have been viewed with subtitles and everything on fast forward. Low on dialogue and storytelling, and sky-high on Kubrik-Hype, his God-awful long shots were as deadly as Jack Nicholson's axe... they killed the movie and any suspense it attempted to create.I literally watched the last part of this movie on fast forward. The Kubrik-esquire long shots are an absolute drag, and the producers should have worked more on the script to let people understand the story more.Try watching a few scenes on fast forward, and you'll get the joke. Absolutely unacceptable. The story is not served in any way by watching a well-acted freak with an axe limp across a half-mile hallway or an old black guy walk, 6-inch stride by 6-inch stride across the same bloody hallway for five minutes.All movie adaptations worthy to be mentioned should have enough material within the contents of the movie for people who have NOT read the book to understand ENOUGH so as to get the general story right. This adaptation does not do anything of the sort. Unacceptable script-writing and unacceptable direction. I forgave Kubrik on 2001: A Space Odyssey, but after watching The Shining, in hindsight, his clichéd long shots and his awful storytelling puts him in one of the directors whose work I consistently do not enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Shining' is often named as one of the greatest horror films ever made. And while I do agree that it is in the top five in the horror genre, its not exactly a perfect film. It has its superb moments and its lackluster moments, in my opinion.As far as the good points go, Jack Nicholson is one of the obvious ones. Nicholson is a very talented actor and his role in this film is a display of his brilliance. He has the ability to turn almost every role he plays into a one-man show (for example, his iconic role as The Joker in 1989's Batman). He makes his character, also ironically named Jack, dimensional. He's menacing, conflicted, witty, and eventually psychotic. Danny Lloyd, also playing a character of the same name, also does a great job with his role as the little boy who "sees all". The film in itself, based on the infamous Stephen King's novel, has a disturbing atmosphere to it. A few of the famous scenes ("Redrum", the twins in the hallway, "Here's Johnny!") definitely leave an impression on the viewer.As far as the negative goes, one big problem I had with the film was the casting of Shelley Duvall. She is, at least in my opinion, a horrible actress. Or shall I say over-actress. But, to her credit, I'm not sure if it was her acting or if her character was actually written to be shrill and stupid. Either way, she was distractingly bad and unintentionally funny in most of her scenes. Also, the running length does go a little long. It clocks in it at over 2 1/2 hours. I can watch a film that long if the story keeps moving and developing. There are a handful of certain scenes that feel too drawn out and prolonged, dragging the pace of the film unnecessarily. I understand King's novel was very lengthy, but the film could've been just as effective if cut down about 30 or 40 minutes.That being said, this film is still breath-taking and much better than some of these 'slasher' flicks that have come out in the last decade or so. But, it does have its flaws at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary Images, Creepy Tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***mild spoilers***When I saw this as a kid, it inspired me to read the book, which, at 11 or 12, scared the bejesus out of me! I realize the film didn't stay as accurate to the book as the mini-series in the 90's did, but some of the scenes in Kubrick's version stay with me to this day - like the twin girls talking to Danny, and the blood rushing down the hall from the elevators.As I grew up and became more interested in movies, I realized how amazing those tracking shots are - the ones with Danny on his big wheel, riding through those giant empty corridors. Also, the opening credits that show the vastness of Colorado, and then it ultimately zeroes in on the Volkswagon with the family.Now I love Jack Nicholson as much as anyone, and he was a madman in the film, no doubt; however, I didn't like how he pretty much started out as a madman from the beginning. It would have been scarier to show the family as more 'normal' than Crazy-Jack, Weak-Wendy, and Creepy-Danny. Then have Jack slowly evolve into the monster. Incidentally, Shelly Duvall said that Kubrick would scream and yell at her and treat her like crap on the set if things didn't go his way. I think maybe he was trying to get her in character to appear extra-meek, and scared.I think the character of Jack in 'The Shining' symbolizes the monster that someone becomes when they're affected by alcoholism. The 'haunted hotel' symbolizes how scary a home can be for the family that lives there. Jack's drink of choice was Jack Daniels. His name is Jack. The son's name is Daniel. There's more evidence to support that theory in the book, that Kubrick chose not cover....like maintaining the boiler, and its ultimate explosion. That's my theory, anyway.All in all, it is a great film. Not The Greatest Film Ever Made...but still effective, scary, and unsettling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably The Most Aesthetic, Artistic &amp; Accomplished Of All Horror Films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably the most aesthetic, artistic &amp; accomplished of all horror films, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is another masterwork of precision craftsmanship that presents the gifted filmmaker at his prime as he smoothly blends the elements of supernatural &amp; psychological horror into one methodically structured &amp; meticulously layered story whose underlying themes &amp; narrative complexity has spawned numerous interpretations over the years and remains a subject of discussion amongst film buffs even today.The Shining tells the story of Jack Torrance, a former teacher who takes the caretaker's job at the Overlook Hotel which tends to stay closed during the winter season. Arriving at the remote location with his wife &amp; son, Jack intends to use the solitude of the hotel to pursue his passion for writing but once the family settle into the hotel, his condition worsens as he begins to act strangely, suffers from writer's block, becomes prone to violent outbursts &amp; is constantly haunted by the supernatural entity that reside there.Co-written, produced &amp; directed by Stanley Kubrick, The Shining is his first stint with horror and yet he exhibits a far better understanding of this genre than most established directors of horror cinema. From the opening moments, the film is able to establish an ominous mood thanks to the eerie score that accompanies its title sequence and the aerial photography that finds its camera hovering over those rocky mountains, lush landscapes &amp; narrow roads leading to the Overlook Hotel, thus already foreshadowing the isolation that awaits the Torrance familyThe technical aspects in almost every Kubrick film is carried out with precision care and The Shining is no exception. Production design team deserves kudos for the meticulously designed set pieces for it provides the hotel an identity of its own. Cinematography makes very inventive use of its camera &amp; follows our characters like a silent observer at all times while the fluid movements, clever angles, steady zooms, perfect lighting &amp; aptly chosen colour tones greatly amplify the whole look &amp; feel of the picture. The real highlight however is how the Steadicam is utilised.Kubrick here pushes the Steadicam to its extreme to achieve a smoothness &amp; stability that hasn't been replicated ever since. The flexibility &amp; sleek flow provided by this new technique didn't just allow the director to stage some of modern cinema's most iconic shots but also brings the viewers into the story by placing them behind the characters as the plot unfolds. Editing is a strong highlight too for almost every scene ends up playing a relevant role in the story. And the background score is in perfect sync with each &amp; every moment and elevates the whole experience by encapsulating the entire film with a highly unsettling mood.With Jack Nicholson in the lead role, Jack Torrance already looks like someone who's just waiting for a little push to descend into total madness which doesn't come off as a surprise when it eventually happens. The stressful experience Shelley Duvall underwent during its production is well-documented but the effect of it all can be felt in her rendition of a broken Wendy, as the entire ordeal only helped her performance. And Danny Lloyd plays their psychic kid and just like every kid in almost every horror film, he's annoying to an extent. All three actors are over-the-top at times but this added exaggeration somehow works in the film's favour.On an overall scale, The Shining is a thought-provoking meditation on madness, isolation &amp; paranoia that defies everything that was usually a norm in the genre of horror back then yet puts on screen a cinema that is now regarded as a definitive example of atmospheric horror. Immortal for its contribution to horror, a staple of pop culture, and a classic amalgamation of superb direction, deft writing, innovative camera-work, skillful editing, menacing score &amp; devoted performances, The Shining remains one of the greatest achievements of its genre that's only getting better with time and is definitely amongst Stanley Kubrick's finest works. Highly recommended. Multiple viewings advised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into violence, while his psychic son (Danny Lloyd) sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future.What is most interesting is that this film has gone from bad to good. When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround.Then we have King's disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty...As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film, but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film, for example, "The Changeling" has this one beat...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The shining BEAUTIFUL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Stanley Kubrick's 11 full length film made in 1980 original a Stephen King novel this film stars the brilliant Jack Nicholson and the also brilliant Shelley Duvall. The shining was released as Horror and Mystery with a Certificate of (R), this filming had a budget of $19,000,000 and grossed $44,017,374 making it a very successful film by Stanley Kubrick. The plot for the film states '' A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future''. A very simple but engaging plot to a story. Before I express my love for this film I think it's only right to pen down just how awed I was whilst watching the unbelievable amount of detail put cinematography for this film. The word beautiful does not live up to what exactly I felt about the cinematography in this film, not only was I awed I was almost in shocked almost scarred knowing that someone just as human as me made something so?.Immaculate. While trying as hard as possible to actually watch the film in detail I was constantly distracted by the cinematography in this film however when I did manage to focus on the film and the actors I have to say that I was actually very scarred most times while watching the film the other half of my concentration was spent marveling at the magnificence of the film itself.The acting in the was unbelievably authentic, it was recorded in the book ''The Real Stanley Kubrick'' that Kubrick was not so happy that Jack Nicholson made more money than he did for this film and in some ways it is understandable and although it is without a doubt that Kubrick had done a lot of work for this film it ultimately could have been let down by the acting. After watching Jack Nicholson's performance in this film it is now impossible for me to not think that somewhere far, far in Jack Nicholson's mind he has a bit of the personality of the character he played, left in him. I believed that he was crazy and he was going to kill his innocent family and at some points I did feel compassion for him but after questioning myself on why I did feel compassion, I could not find a reason. The main actor would not be able to make any impact on the audience without the help of his supporting actress Shelley Duvall. Shelley Duvall's eyes was probably the saddest eyes I have ever laid my eyes on, it made it easier to show just how scarred she was when her husband was going crazy. Her tears we real, her fear was real and he attempts to save herself and her child was equally as real but sometimes when on screen with Jack Nicholson, his character was so powerful that Shelley was left in the background and all the audience wanted to see was Jack Nicholson going crazy. Before watching this film I believed that it was impossible for a director to explain to the actor exactly what he wanted he or she to do but when I heard that Kubrick Made Shelley Duvall redo a scene in the film over a maybe exaggerated 100 times I believed that the acting in this film wasn't by luck it was something that Kubrick had seen and wanted to be acted perfectly on screen. Although it is recorded that Jack Nicholson improvised the line ''Here's Johnny'' In the bathroom scene, I felt that this so called legendary line did not add anything to the scene for me. Yes that line is a great line and yes it's become somewhat an iconic line but I couldn't understand what I was supposed to feel about it, the line did have a comedic side to but how was I supposed to find a man about to kill his wife and child funny. Even though Kubrick was known for his dark humor this was in no way dark or humorous.In conclusion I loved this film and saying exactly what I loved about this film would result in me repeating myself. This is my second favorite Kubrick film and this film made me have a respect for Kubrick .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King + Kubrick + Nicholson = great horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today it is very hard to catch a good horror movie, so we all have to remember some true horror classics. "The Shining" is definitely a horror classic and also a King's classic. Stephen King wrote many excellent books and I think that this is maybe best translation of King's book on screen. "Misery", "The Shawshank Redemptione", "The Green Mile", "Carrie", "Secret Window" and others are also great but we have to consider that this is one of the first 'King' movies. Back in 1980. one very special director managed to make one very special movie. Of course I'm talking about Stanley Kubrick and "The Shining". Kubrick managed to create fear that book has (brilliant scenes when Danny is riding his bike through the empty hotel and that sound of wheels). He managed to make the atmosphere and he scared us all. His camera is great and this movie is a result of his genius. Music is creepy, Danny's imaginary voice is creepy (Tony), Overlook Hotel is creepy and Jack Nicholson is the king of creepiness. He is perfect for the role of Jack Torrance. With his crazy eyes, attitude and personality, he makes brilliant portrait of a man who gets insane as the time passes. I don't like Shelley Duvall but I have to admit she was good. She was very convincing and she behaved like every ordinary person, in her position, would behave. All my compliments goes to Danny Lloyd too, cause he was very young and yet he acted so well. To all you horror lovers and to all movie lovers. This one is for you. You don't need to watch most of todays crappy horrors. Just watch "The Shining" and prepare yourself for one twisted story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies I've seen, and I have seen a lot of horror flicks. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumours of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad? One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favourite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator. The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a Good. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to confuse a shallow mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the perfect way to describe The Shining is to describe Stanley Kubrick. He is a man with vision and original ideas, but he lacks a purpose. While The Shining aims to be a horror movie, and by the way, fails in that miserably, in my eyes, it takes the worst and most typical horror movie route. That's not necessarily bad, but.There is always a mystery and the great unknown behind horror movies. This is what The Shining builds up in an impressive manner. The sole terminology and amount of mysteries and mystery elements leads the viewer to think all this build up will lead to an epic conclusion where the great reveal finally tells us what is going on, why is Jack getting insane, why does the boy see those things, who is Tony, what are these shining people and will the black man die first. Nope. Instead we are shown scenes where ghost sets Jack free from the stockroom because that's the only way for him to get out, okay? He needs to get out so he gets out. Of course that is never explained. And this leads to the biggest problem with the story. Nothing is ever explained. "Too many answers will just ruin it." Yeah? I see this as nothing but a terrible excuse for a lousy storytelling and lack of brains since there was hardly anything to get beyond what was told.The loose ends, unanswered questions and all the other spooky stuff that was in the movie just to make it more spooky and mysterious are, in a one word; cheap. And with few more words; a waste of potential. I guess many of us have seen a meme picture of a dog sitting on an airplane, it looks like the dog is flying it and then there is a text "I have no idea what I am doing." When I imagine Stanley Kubrick directing this film, I recall that picture. I see him behind the camera, the cast, the hotel, the stairs and a text "I have no idea what I am doing" and that's what we call The Shining. Not that the story was even the biggest problem, nor that the ending scene makes no sense due this not being a movie about Jack, but the characters and the sounds too. From this point on, I will act like there are no loose ends, and the story telling and plot is flawless, and I will get into why this movie is bad solely because of it other merits.In the beginning, I mentioned this failing miserably to be a horror film. The sounds will kill the theme quicker than Kubrick creates a loose end. (This is a joke, so I did not lie 2 sentences ago). I find it incredibly hard to get in the horror mood when the "music" can be described as wheezing. One thing they did miraculously well; they captured the feeling of tinnitus. Seriously, when you hear sounds like that, you go to the doctor and wish for the best. Then suddenly my bass is yelling, I hear the exact sound C-Class horror movies use when jump-scare scene is executed. What does this movie do with a sounds like that? They show us a black frame with a text "Thursday" in it. I ask myself, "Do these guys take this movie as a joke?" but I do not know the answer. I am not sure if these sounds are supposed to be spooky and scary, create atmosphere even, but one thing they do is remind you that you are sitting on your sofa and that you can always turn down the volume because it is just a ridiculously bad sound directing in a movie.Now, let's get to my favorite part. The cast. Jack Nicholson, what a bastard, I love him. But I see The Shining as his worst acting, not even acting, a role. He looks insane in every single picture that was ever taken of him. How is a man who looks insane a suitable person to be character in a movie where the character changes from your average fellow to a completely insane psycho? Well, he is not. He was a bad pick. I can only say that this is not the story it was supposed to be. There is good acting too. Shelley Duvann does an amazing job acting out a dull retard. Then a question. Who likes dull retard characters? This movie is her story, her family goes insane, she is in the middle of it all, she experience the horror. Then a second question. Why should we give a damn about what happens to a retard like her? This leads us to final and one of the biggest elements I am going to analyze. The kid. He is shining, he hears Tony, he can contact other shining, he is the reason why Jack does anything, he sees the horror, glimpses of past, future and future past, he is everything this movie is about. He drives the story towards the truth behind the hotel and towards everything this movie is. But what is he exactly? He is called a plot element. This is not a bad thing in my eyes, I think it is great. What is bad is what he wasn't. Imagine with me. He makes Jack shining, he makes Tony talk to Johnny, he resolves Jack's humanity, he is the one who experiences the horror while being the horror itself. After this the movie ends the same way, but now it has changed to a story about Jack who was inflicted by the horror of the kid and Tony. Instead we get an ending where Kubrick is basically saying, "Since we don't know how to end this movie, let's insert bunch of stuff which makes it look deep." Cop-out. That's how you confuse a shallow mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" was an overly hyped horror flick that has gained a cult status of a classic. But after watching it, I was disappointed. Based on Stephen King's novel, the film drags and goes on for an inordinate length. Had watched "Apt Pupil" based on the novel written by the same author. Comparing the movies, it becomes obvious that the stories have promising beginnings but fall to very unrefined clichés in the end.The film does have few moments but by then you just start to lose your interest. The film deals with double personality and hallucinations, but on the term, the film is nowhere close to the spooky thriller "The Sixth Sense." Where the presentation of "Sixth Sense" was tremendous, "The Shining" remains utterly boring. Only the saving grace was the nice camera work and the grandiose of the setting; else other remains forgettable.Rating: 1 star out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is a scary horror thriller from the late acclaimed director Stanley Kurbick whose admirable in making this movie based on a book by Stephen King by giving audiences almost everything they could except from this kind of genre. Jack Nicholson turns in a great performance of Jack Torrence a writer who slowly begins to slip into insanity because he's being influenced by the dark evil spiritual forces that haunt an isolated hotel in the mountains of Colorado where he and his family are staying as caretakers during the winter. Nicholson is convincing as Jack playing a man whose losing his mind because of the evil spirits that haunt the hotel. Shelley Duvuall is okay as Jack's wife Wendy but nothing memorable. None offense. The rest of the cast including the young boy who played their son are good in their roles as well. The Shining has enough scares, suspense, creepy moments, and surprises. The music seemed to sync well with the tone of the film. It also added to the suspense and creep factor. The running time of over two and a half hours does make it feel a little long but the rest makes up for the movies few flaws. With it's few flaws aside The Shining is definitely one of the best horror films out there and I recommend this to any fan of the genre if you can get past the long running rime. Overall The Shining is an effective horror thriller with suspense, scares, anticipation, creepy moments, surprises, and good performances by the cast especially Nicholson who make this movie worth the time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining, a masterpiece of thriller movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a 1980 movie by Stanley Kubrick, whom by now has become my favorite director. The movie is based on Stephen King's novel by the same name. The story tells us of Jack Torrance, a retired teacher and now writer, who plans to spend his winter, along with his family, at the Overlook Hotel as the caretaker. The isolation of the place seems to be the perfect condition for Jack's inspiration to flow. His wife Wendy, seems to agree with this decision, but their son, Danny, seems not to like this idea. Doc, as his parents call him, possesses a special talent, a so-called imaginary friend by the name of Tony, whom reveals him future visions. Danny later learns through Mr. Halloran, the hotel's chef, whom posses that same power, called "The Shining", power which also allows the to communicate through some sort of telepathy. From this point on, they are left alone and the story starts becoming awkward. Jack locks himself to type and Danny strolls down on his tricycle through the Overlook's hallways, creating one of the mos memorable scenes of the movie. The mere sound of the vehicle's wheels rolling on the carpet and then on the wooden floor help get the mood right. Mood which is only made creepier by Kubrick's imagery. A pair of twin girls, an elevator filled with blood and the mysterious room 237. Jack on the other hand has been having some mysterious encounters with other people on the supposedly empty hotel, and in a conversation with whom he believes to be the caretaker who killed his own family, is that he is finally revealed to have some sort of background inside the hotel, and is also lead into "correcting" his son and wife. The typewriter continuously clicking on various scenes, makes us believe of Jack's efficient work, but when Wendy manages to enter and read his papers, all she finds are pages and pages filled with the phrase: "All work and no fun, makes jack a dull boy". After a first fight where Wendy knocks Jack with a bat and locks him in the storage room, is that we learn that all the weird things going on are not just in the Torrances heads, but that there indeed are other forces at work, which manage to open the locked door to Jack, hand him an Ax, and change his mind once and for all into killing his family. Jack heads towards the family's room, where Wendy and Danny are hiding in the bathroom. Danny escapes through a window, which is too small for Wendy. Jack makes his way through the locked doors with the help of an Ax, and exclaims the movie's most memorable quote: "Heeeeeres Johnny!". Jack gets his hand cut by Wendy and decides it's better to chase Danny. the boy leads him into a maze and finally to Jack's freezing death, which allows Danny and his mom to escape. Jack Nicholson is amazing, he is perfect for the role, somehow mad men roles fit him perfectly. Whether it is in Batman, The Departed or even Anger Management, Jack's most sane role, ironically, is One Fleew Over The Cuckoo's Nest's McMurphy. Shelley Duvall is also quite perfect to me. Her dialogs seem scared when they ought to be and determined when they need to. Finally, Danny, played by Danny Lloyd makes a respectable job, but always subject to some limitations due to his early age. Stanley Kubrick made all of this possible on his screen adaptation of the novel, which Stephen King considered "Not that faithful to the book". Its dialogs, sequences and specially its imagery are what have made out of this movie such a classic of not only cinema, but of popular culture. References which can be found on The Simpsons or even in Slipknot's video for Spit it Out, to name a few. The soundtrack by Wendy Carlos fits perfectly, its highlights being the simplicity of the main theme, and the piercing screech when the shining is used. So, you may wonder. What makes this movie so scary? There are no alien invasion, epidemic diseases and the ghost do not act directly on people (except the lady from the 237). The terror applied by King and Kubrick relies on the terror caused by the mere idea of being tried to kill by someone you love, and who is supposed to protect you. In any conversation of terror movies, The Shining will always be present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific essay on Human's insanity!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that SHINING is a major classic of the horror genre, but it's even a bit more than that. It's the horror movie elevated to the "art status". I mean, unlike the majority of the horror films which use the same kind of plot, stereotyped characters, clichéd scenes, and worst of all, are produced and reproduced in endless sequels, SHINING is a single and unique piece of "Horror Art" (as PSYCHO was until they remember to do the first sequel in 1983). It doesn't mean that SHINING doesn't have some clichéd scenes, because it has indeed (I can remember the scene when WENDY lock herself in the bathroom and tries to escape through that little window where barely could pass her head?), but if we "forget" about the few clichés it has we really have a good horror film here. On the other hand, in this movie, horror is more symbolic than actually gory. It is mainly symbolic icons which create the horror scenes, so we can definitely say it's more a psychological horror movie than really a gore fest. In fact, there's almost no blood, if we exclude those "blood waves" gushing out through the corridors (here it is one of the symbolisms I did refer?). More than a horror film, SHINING is a terrific essay about Human's insanity, because it explores until the edge the loss of self control and the irrationality of the Human mind! And to do that disturbed character, JACK TORRANCE, who better than Jack Nicholson?! He really looks like a true lunatic! Superb acting I must say! He has the perfect face, expression, sarcasm! On the opposite side it's the acting by Shelley Duvall, which plays WENDY TORRANCE! It's really bad! She doesn't convince at all playing the victim, as her acting just seems too fake to me! Danny Lloyd, the small kid, also does a nice performance. Excellent film, I score it 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an avid fan of both Kubrick and Stephen King so perhaps I am a little bit biased in this review. But still, I simply cannot understand the critical slander that is often heaped on this film. It is nothing short of brilliance. Any even casual reader of King's novels understands the understated and claustrophobic terror that he conveys to your subconscious, the eerie images that creep into your mind when you wake up in the middle of the night and make it difficult for you to get back to sleep. "The Shining" is the only adaption of any of King's novels that I have seen that conveys these extremely unsettling images to the visual medium. Jack Nicholson gives one of the most hauntingly fascinating performances in film history in my opinion. The scene in which he slowly pursues Shelley Duvall up the stairs ("Gimme the bat, Wendy!") is absolutely horrifying, yet impossible to look away from, because you know you are witnessing great acting at its pinnacle. There are those who call Nicholson's performance "over the top" and "campy", but I simply do not agree. This movie belongs to Jack Nicholson, and he absolutely owns every single second he appears on screen. With possible arguments made for "Chinatown" and "About Schmidt", this has got to be the finest performance of his amazing career. Shelley Duvall is perhaps a bit overmatched (imagine Meryl Streep or Cybill Shepherd in her role), but she gives a respectable performance and the makeup team does a frighteningly terrific job in making her look progressively weary and haggard as the film goes on. And young Danny Lloyd is terrific in a role that must have been extremely difficult for a child his age to understand. Overall, I believe "The Shining" is a standard by which all other horror films should be measured and is infinitely more frightening than the never-ending and schlocky slasher pictures that seem to dominate the mainstream nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in a theater then it was released, and it was one of my more memorable movie experiences. A rather longish movie, I thought it was moving a bit slow. Watchable, interesting, but not very scary. But, without actually realizing it, the tension was slowly building, building, building. Why do I say this? Because with about a half hour left of the movie, I suddenly realized I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. I don't think this has ever happened to me before or since, with the possible exception of "The Exorcist" or "The Omen". That, my friends, is a sign of a very good film indeed: it accomplished what it set out to accomplish, which was to jangle thoroughly jangle the viewer's nerves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of the genre, very recommended!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it doesn't take after the book literally, this movie is one of the best adaptations I have ever seen. Based on the novel "The Shining" by Stephen King, the story takes place at the Overlook hotel, where Jack Torrance and his family (his wife, Wendy, and his son, Danny, who "shines") spend the winter, Jack having gotten the caretaker's job there. Being completely isolated from the world due to snowstorms and witnessing manifestations of evil supernatural forces, the Torrances are forced to defend themselves...at all costs.The concept of "shining" can be explained as telepathy. That is why Danny can talk to Dick Hallorann without having to open their mouths like in a normal conversation.Stanley Kubrick made a very inspired choice by choosing Jack Nicholson to play Jack Torrance. With his kind of "Damn you!" grin and his ability to fake madness, he scared me more than anything in this movie. Because this movie definitely wouldn't be half as good as it is if it didn't have Nicholson in it. This movie practically "belongs" to him and I wouldn't see anyone else in his role.A few deviations from the book are present, but are marvelously compensated by other made-up facts. The movie has good structure and is worth viewing, not only for Jack Nicholson's great performance, but for the simple fact that it didn't need so many flashy special effects to stand up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why The Shining is the Best Horror Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a big horror fan, but I think I'm converting. Knowing the legendary status of "The Shining" I chose to watch it on Halloween. I was not disappointed. It's become one of my all time favorite films. I think I enjoyed it as much as I did because it wasn't a simple horror/slasher film. What blew me away was Kubrick's mastery of genre and his ability to incorporate so many different genre conventions into one story.Here are some reasons why I think "The Shining" is the Best Horror Film Ever (Contains spoilers):It creates iconic surrealistic images. I will never forget Jack Nicholson hitting the door with the ax, or chasing his son through the maze, or Danny riding his big wheel through the halls.It is also an adventure with a sort of happy ending. The driving momentum of the story is the hope the audience has that Danny and Wendy Torrance will somehow escape the madness. Danny in particular becomes the protagonist that we are rooting for, caught in a crazy adventure that may be a nightmare for him to experience, but is thrilling for us to witness. He must use both his special power and ultimately his wits to save himself and his mother. He saves them with his power by calling the chef who brings them the snow cat. And he saves them by his wits by outrunning Nicholson in the maze. When all is said and done, it's a satisfying adventure. It is also a sci-fi fantasy where the hero has a secret power that gives him some sort of edge in this creepy struggle. Credit for this must go to Steven King, a master of sci-fi horror. By giving the boy supernatural powers it gives him a fighting chance against the horror.It's the best ghost story I can think of. Ghosts in the movie look like real people, making them that much more creepy. Seeing a ghost all translucent and obviously a ghost would hardly be scary because we'd know that they are a ghost. It's the fact that they look real but we know logically that they aren't real that makes them scary. I loved the friendly and cordial British caretaker who slowly reveals his evil madness and gradually influences Jack.It has a slow measured pace, but always stays interesting and entertaining. It's a consistent slow burn. I really don't know how Kubrick does it. He creates a movie that is relatively slow by today's standards, yet the movie doesn't feel like an old film with a plodding pace. It's constantly interesting and continuously revealing tidbits of info, and so compelling in the performances, that we are sitting on the edge of our seat the entire time, wanting to know what's going to happen next.It's more scary than gory. Kubrick relies more on mood, odd/surrealistic images, and brilliant cinematography than gore to make the movie creepy. The parts that are gory are quick and intense flash cuts, given by supernatural revelation. And they aren't typically gross but unusually gross. For example, the only thing grosser than a rotting woman is an old ugly naked rotting woman.It's a unique take on the "Haunted Mansion" genre. Rather than choosing a stereotypically scary hotel, like "Psycho" or "The Haunting" it creates a big luxurious ski lodge, where the horror is lingering somewhere in the big vast spaces and corridors. In other words, Kubrick creates fear out of an environment we've likely experienced, where there's nothing overtly scary, but covertly, our imaginations due us in. We've all been to hotels and motels, and there's something intrinsically creepy about being in a place with so much unknown history. The imagined horrors are far scarier than anything that could be depicted. It has a certain logic that gets more and more hazy as the film descends into madness. Kubrick gives a lot of exposition in the beginning of the movie, laying the ground rules for everything that is to come. We understand that the child has a supernatural gift for seeing things and hearing things. We know the chef shares that power. We know that the hotel has some bad things that are lingering and haunting the place, namely the vicious murder of a caretaker's family. We know that there's a history of mild domestic violence in the Torrance family. Everything plays out through its set-up, while creating more questions than it answers. Like, what is really making Nicholson go mad? What is the blood rushing out of the elevators? Who's the rotting woman in the room? Why exactly is Jack going mad? And eventually, we wonder why Jack's image is seen in a picture from the 20's. The logic keeps the adventure and suspense grounded and the audience involved, while the mystery keeps the horror alive.The movie doesn't rely on conventional camera tricks to scare us. Most of what we think is scary in horror films is really surprise. You know the feeling. You're sitting in the theater and suddenly something comes out of nowhere and the entire audience jumps, screams, and then laughs. But there's nothing to laugh about in "The Shining." Kubrick is so confidant that his story is genuinely scary, he doesn't have to trick us into thinking we're scared.In the end, what is horror? Horror is facing the illogical nature of madness and being trapped in it. Our dreams are the most illogical experiences that we encounter on a regular basis, so it makes sense that he would tap into that collective experience for this film. I can't think of a film that better expresses what it feels like to be in a nightmare than this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect. But, the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasn't good and didn't want to go. Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed. At this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. Scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later on, Jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things I've ever seen happen here. The ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is amazing from the beginning to the very end. You simply can't stop watching and the tension is present at all time. The first time I saw it, I couldn't move an inch, because I didn't want to miss a moment of it. I've seen the move for a few times now, but it still takes my breath away. It is amazing, that a movie, which was made in 1980 can get your attention at it's every second. Jack Nicholson appears as a real psycho and every time you see him appear on screen, there is this slightly uncomfortable feeling. His acting is of course astonishing! He can convince you completely through out the whole movie. But the thing I find most interesting is the ending. Because you have to think for a while to figure out what the photo means. And when you do...it just gives you the chills!</fullReview>

Now some people don't like Kubrick's version of The Shining since it doesn't entirely follow Stephen King's book but in my opinion both Kubrick's version,the mini-series and the book are all great.Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance.If you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch The Shining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we have Stanley Kubricks horror "gem" and it seems like a tradition that everyone has to bow down in front of their televisions when its on!Mr stanley 150 takes for a scene Kubrick really made one or two bad choices here.Jack Nicholson hams it up and over does things to a dodgy perfection....why cast him? there is no surprise when he goes mad in fact it was more like when he goes mad not if!Shelley Duvall is just in a constant state of hysteria and panic not much more to say about her character as thats all she gives us to judge.The boy Danny played by Danny Lloyd does a fine job and puts the other two herberts i have just mentioned to shame.Now let's move on to Phillip Stone and Joe Turkel as Grady and Lloyd the bartender. Their performances although small were top notch and chilling, the looks they give and way they deliver their lines really makes you believe they are evil.Not much to say about Scatman Crothers,his character sets the scene a bit, then after a epic trek back to the hotel is killed the moment he walks in....hmmm did't see that coming.Over blown and a over weight film which considering how long it had in the making still has the same amount of continuity gaffs as any other film. Last time i watched in the first five minutes i spotted the shadow of the helicopter,Danny eats through nearly all his sandwich in a second and the massive hedge maze that can not be seen from the air.Much better films to be had out there that where made on a lot less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's Johnny!........how horror should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films are associated with extreme and sickening violence/gore, lunatic killers and mostly focus on teenagers. They are mostly just poor excuses to put extreme violence on film to appeal to younger people, and nearly all, with a few exceptions such as Saw, are totally crap. Violence doesn't make a film good. In making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick has shown the world how horror films should be made.There are none of the predictable bad-guy-jumps-out-of-the-dark scenes to try and scare you. Instead Kubrick builds up suspense with the chilling musical score, and Jack Torrance gradually gets driven insane. Jack Nicholson is perfect to portray the character of Torrance. Not only is he a brilliant actor anyway, but he looks perfect for the part. He isn't your stereotyped perfect-looks actor, I don't think someone like Brad Pitt would be as effective playing his part. Pitt is a great actor, but you can't imagine someone like him going insane in a weird hotel! I think the cast is important to this film. Kubrick cast a proper leading actor and actress, rather than the randomly assembled casts of young 20 year olds you get in most horror films. And hey! The result is way better.There are a perfect amount of genuine horror scenes, such as the famous axe scene, and the scene in the maze, and it never goes over the top. There is also some unique horror scenes, such as when Jack writes about 1,000 pages of the same words, and the visions of the blood from the elevator and the little girls. They are bizarre but very effective in building suspense.The storyline is also much more effective than the usual story of teenagers being pursued by a lunatic murderer. A man stuck in a hotel for the winter with just his family who gradually goes insane is much more original and much much much more effective. Horror films are meant to be scary, and this really is. There are many scenes showing Jack's willingness to give in to temptation, and how he wants to get away from his wife and weird son. The camera-work is also excellent, as it builds up tension by moving along the corridors, and it also emphasises that Jack is feeling confined in the hotel.Stephen King didn't like Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, I can't believe how. Kubrick just made it better! This is a top film and is a landmark for horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whether you want black comedy or horror, Kubrick delivers it all with this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... This isn't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect, either. In Dr. Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation, and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments. Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course, but the dialogue is very knowing ("five months of peace is just what I want... ") and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit, but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other.I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness, which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment that he is in, however, then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness. In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there, the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man, and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return. He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives, but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off.Kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film, and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic. If you want a great viewing experience, then this is an example that well and truly shines...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great film this is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great horror film "The Shining" is! It is a well-known fact of film trivia nowadays that Stephen King "hated" the adaptation of his novel, and was bothered by Stanley Kubrick's "creative liberties" (his main complaint: the lack of hedge monsters). I hate to point this out to Mr. King, but his novel was a rather simplistic horror yarn - a classic of its genre? Maybe, but I feel there is far more depth in the movie -- and we saw the result of a faithful adaptation in the form of a late 1990s television miniseries starring Rebecca Demornay - the result was enjoyable but nowhere near the greatness of Kubrick's vision.In general, I'm not a Kubrick fanatic and I don't devour everything he's done. I consider "2001" and "Full Metal Jacket" to be overrated - but this is probably my favorite film of his (but then again, "Clockwork Orange" and "Paths of Glory" are superb, too). This was perhaps only the second truly epic horror film (the first being Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho") - and the direction is really amazing. The eerie nature of the movie is unsettling all at once without showing anything at all.Simply built on music alone, Kubrick manages to convey so many feelings. He pulls out to an overhead shot of a boy playing on a red rug. Coupled with the soundtrack it's terrifying. This is how all horror films should be. It shows what an impact subliminal terror has - an axe-yielding maniac can only have shock and jump value; seeing something this psychologically mind-screwing is utterly gut-wrenching.See this movie. Honestly, if you haven't watched it yet, please do. And avoid the edited TV version, which omits some of the more terrifying moments (I guess they're considered too "scary"?). Some omitted scenes are simply too risqué for television. One of these moments happens towards the end - I saw it as a child and it still disturbs me and has stayed with me after all these years. Shelley Duvall is running through the Overlook and she comes to a hallway, and in one of the rooms two party-goers (one dressed up as a lion or something) are performing some strange sex act. You only see it for maybe two seconds, and they're fully clothed, but it's impossible to forget. The TV version simply shows them sitting next to each other on the bed - odd enough, and still freaky, but the uncut version of the scene is even more so.Truly, the only word to describe this movie's vibe is "freaky." I'd place it as one of the top five horror films of all time, and in my own personal opinion, I'd probably rank it right below "Psycho" as the most masterful and epic of them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick's The Shining will go down in my book as the best horror film ever, even beating The Exorcist which I thought was great. First off, the story makes for such a great horror epic. It stays pretty loyal to the book and did not disappoint me for a second. Many people complain about the pacing and how slow it is, but I believe that even heightens the terror when some real climax scenes happen. Jack Nicholson is absolutely incredible in this. I can't think of another actor that could have done a better job than him.If you have not seen The Shining by now, I urge you to do so.Great Horror Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen it, don't bother. I have no trouble understanding why Stephen King hated this movie so much he had it remade (though I haven't seen his version, so I don't know if he actually did a better job than Kubrick).Jack Nicholson does a fairly good job as Jack Torrance; although he seems incapable of acting normal when he's supposed to (mostly in the beginning), his character goes mad fairly early, and mad is Jack Nicholson's middle name. The best scenes are definitely those that show Torrance's gradual descent into madness; they almost (but not quite) manage to save the movie.The rest of the cast varies from fair (Philip Stone as Delbert Grady) to passable (Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance) to indifferent (the hotel staff, the firemen) to bad (Scatman Crothers as the stereotypical genial black cook with the most annoying laugh you've ever heard) to abysmal (Shelley Duval as Wendy Torrance): Lloyd is so-so, with on one hand his laughable conversations with his imaginary friend Tony, and on the other the excellent "Redrum" scene, which is slightly reminiscent of The Exorcist, while Duval - well, let's just say you'll spend most of the movie hoping she gets brutally murdered at the end.The plot is simple, predictable and uninspired, and is not without its fair share of holes, which is surprising (and disappointing) for a Kubrick movie. There is also a distressing number of continuity errors, though some of them can be explained if one assumes that more time passes between scenes than it seems - but either way, they're annoying.One of the movie's few saving graces is the photography - ranging from good to excellent - which manages to convey the strangeness and isolation of the Overlook Hotel very well, and help set the mood in those scenes that actually have mood (which excludes most of the scenes featuring Duval, Lloyd or Crothers).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as "Shocking" as it tries to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No other director has had every one of his works so ridiculously over-analyzed as Stanley Kubrick. Endless throngs of critics have spent page after page after page poring over every minute of every one of his films, scrutinizing every frame for possible nuances of meaning that Kubrick subtly worked into the film. Most critics, when reviewing any Kubrick film, hardly ever mention the actors' performances, all they talk about is Kubrick, and how every nose twitch that every actor made was cunningly crafted by the director, and communicates volumes. If an actor gives a bad performance in a Kubrick film, it's the actor's fault. If they give a good performance, it's the director's doing.I am not saying that Kubrick was bad. He most certainly was NOT bad, in fact, he was darn good... most of the time. Kubrick had his ups and downs, and this was one of his downs.Anyway, enough general comments about the director, and now for the film. Maybe I would have liked the film better if I hadn't read the book first. As is, I was expecting a film to stick at least SOMEWHAT close to the original story, and for the first half it sort of did (although there was only one scene in which the dialogue was really the same as in the book, and that was the party scene), but in the second half, Kubrick changed the story from a spectral ghost tale into a psychological terror/thriller, which in itself is a bad enough decision, but the ending itself... well, I don't want to spoil it, but let's just say that someone besides Kubrick should have made the decision about how to change the ending. Kubrick was excellent with ambiguity and loose ends, but he seemed a little too aware of that talent, and so he insisted on working those elements into every story he worked with, even the ones where an ending didn't fit.What I mean is, when a book has a, unhappy or unresolved ending, it is a bad thing to change the ending to a neat-and-tidy happy one for the film version (because it's Hollywood and stories have happy endings in La La Wood). But it is equally as bad to change a happy ending in the book to a scary and ambiguous ending in the film, just for the sake of being "shocking."Most of the performances were good (Shelley Duvall hammed it up a little, but not too badly, and the actor playing Danny was terrific), except for, unfortunately, the most important one: the performance of Jack Torrance. I'm sorry, but Jack Nicholson was an incredible ham, he overdid almost everything, almost a parody of his best performance (as Melvin Udall). His line delivery is so absurd as to be comedic, and his movments... not much to be said.A few parting words: Roger Ebert finally got around to writing a review of this film, and, of course, he does exactly what everyone else does with a Kubrick film: Reading way too much into every little thing in the film. I think I can sum up my opinion of this whole issue with this parable:Suppose, just for a moment, that some other director had made this exact same film. No, I don't mean that they would lend their own creative vision to the film, what I mean is, suppose some other director made this EXACT film, word for word, shot for shot, expression for expression. Suppose the only difference between this mythical film and the actual one was which director's name was stamped all over it. What do you think would have happened?I'll tell you what would have happened: The critics and audiences would have ripped this other director to shreds. Fans of the book would be out in angry mobs over the ridiculously changed ending, and the film critics would be shaking their heads at Jack Nicholson's incredibly overacted performance. The film would not be anywhere near any critic's "top one thousand films of all time" list. No other director would get away with this film. Stanley Kubrick got away with it for one reason and one reason only: He is Kubrick.Now, many people who adore this film haven't read the book, which I strongly recommend they do. The ambiguity and changes of the film would probably have worked fine were the film not pretending to be based on the novel (if Kubrick had just changed the title, character names and the dialogue in the party scene, he could easily have passed it off as an unrelated movie and I probably would have liked it much better), but I did expect something that at least SOMEWHAT resembled the book. If it weren't for the party scene, I wouldn't have believed that Kubrick and Diane Johnson had read anything in the book besides the blurb on the dust jacket.</fullReview>

First, Jake saw a naked "ghost" and he was so happy. that's not right, he is married. and how come he just acted like nothing happened. He said he will do anything for the son, but he just let those "ghost" control him and hurt his son and wife. And then the rest of the movie just a crazy guy how to kill his wife. He is just crazy people, I don't understand why people think the movie is great. Because Jake is crazy? I think watch this movie is a awful experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just seen the doco about Kubrick, and then taken the plunge with Eyes Wide Shut after being warned against it by everyone I know, I expected wonderful things from this film. After all, Jack Nicholson, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest! This was gonna be amazing!JNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN! WRONG!Quite simply one of the worst films I've ever seen. The editing alone was a travesty. What amateur crud! Could this be the same mind that gave us Easy Rider, Dr Strangelove and 2001? Clearly our Stanley had a rather nasty turn prior to making this film, that or it ran way over budget and the studio employed some lacky fresh out of 'make your own home movies in 24 hours'to whack it together overnight. Then there's the music, the Bartok was perfect, but all the original synth stuff was absolute rubbish. I really think I must be missing something critical here - or was he trying to make a statement about how pathetic horror movies are, cos that rang out loud and clear.Well, look, if you want to see a plot that is full of holes, if you want to see the helicopter shadow in the overhead shots at the start and catch some awful, sad and pathetic acting from Shelly Duval and then be left wondering why Stan even bothered beating this dead horse of a C movie - sure, rush down to the movie store, I emplore you. Do it. Do it now.Seriously, I love Stan when he puts his heart into it, but I teach editing and I have people who come in with no knowledge cutting up better narratives in their first day just by letting them play with MS Movie Maker. That just makes me sad.I should also temper this with some context. 1. I can prove by simple logical argument that Stephen King is a hack, chiefly because he writes like a three year old. 2. I love being challenged and having something to think about. 3. Why oh why can't our Clairvoyant friend or his 'Shine' brother foresee his untimely and really badly played out, plot-killing, anitclimatic death?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a stumped writer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a stumped writer is in the midst of "writer's block", Jack decides to sign a contract stating: he would be willing to take care of the Overlook Hotel for the winter. With the pen to the paper, and signing the contract, Jack has the idea and motive that taking care of the Overlook Hotel will help him push through writers block and help him continue his profession amidst the struggles his family deals with amongst each other. As time continues to tick, the block remains with Jack for an extensive sequence of time, leaving him stressed and more frustrated each minute that passes by. Jack is a recovering alcoholic who isn't too focused on the "recovering" aspect so much when the stumped feeling he's struggling with leaves him sitting in the Gold Room, acting crazy. Throughout the movie, Jack becomes more insane and chooses to make some irrational decisions. We also are introduced to Jack's wife-Wendy, and his son Danny. Danny is psychic and having disturbing visions throughout the movie, because of the hotel being haunted. Although disturbing things happen with Danny, this is not the main focus of the movie. Where Jack is insane and mentally ill, this becomes the focal point. Throughout the movie we see how unethical and immoral it is that Jack's justifying many issues and events that many "normal" people wouldn't choose to participate in. As the wife thinks her son, Danny, is just "hurt"; she thinks it would be best to take him to the doctor's office. She decides to confront Jack and let him know she wants to take him to the doctors. When she goes down to the main lobby-where Jack seems to always be working on his book- Wendy comes across the pages he has been writing through their stay at the Overlook Hotel. When Wendy looks over his work, all which is written for pages, states: "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." She automatically sees and feels that there is something wrong. As Jack discovers she may have found his secret. With much chaos going on throughout the movie, it only adds to the suspense and excitement that we expect to come from a movie such as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary movie with artistic merit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie I highly regard, namely for demonstrating some great artistic merit (some other movies in this category are "Cat People", "A clockwork orange" and "The baby of Macon", which I've also reviewed here).When I first saw this movie as a teenager, I must say I was very disappointed, as it was a movie that was hyped for its shock value, and I didn't find it that shocking.Anyway, the plot of the movie concerns a family who move into a hotel during winter to act as caretakers during the off season. The father is a man who has struggled with alcoholism in the past. His son seems to have some sort of sixth sense, which gives him some very disturbing 'visions' in the hotel.As winter sets in and the isolation becomes more pronounced for the father, he returns to drinking. He starts behaving erratically and violently and may be interacting with his own demons or actual demons in the hotel.I don't want to give away too much more about this movie. In the past, I tended to think of "The dead zone" as the best adaptation from a Stephen King novel. Having seen The Dead Zone many years later, it struck me as being little more than a midday movie.So, what made me change my mind about The Shining? One scene. It's the scene where the caretaker's son rides his tricycle inside the hotel...over floorboards and carpet. It struck me as great art-the sheer acoustic sensuality of the sound of the wheels travelling over various textures.It's odd, I know, but I really value that kind of art in a movie.The movie does contain some very creepy scenes, so it is not just a horror movie with artistic flourishes. I'm sure that many of the scenes will haunt you for a while.Just by the by, some years ago, I saw a mini-series of this story, which had Stephen King's involvement. I must say, I did find King's own mini-series to be really awful-especially the ending. Normally novellists complain bitterly about directors ruining their vision. In this case, it was all King's doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the Shining Book does for Literature, this movie does for film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now everyone always says that, "Oh well it was different from the book... or the book was better." Typically that is the case, because movies cannot provide such intricate details as a novel can.And yes, Kubrick changes the ending, again, and it is a bit of a different story than the book tells. So if you have been living in a cave and have not seen/read either, know that beforehand.Now...Stephen King's novel plays such an interesting story about the effects of past ghosts, suppressed issues, mistrust in relationships, tension, pressure, and of course a haunted hotel on a family on the brink of falling apart. It is unique, well thought out, and nearly perfectly paced. Like always the characters are completely believable in their actions (minus some paranormal happenings) and it makes quite a good piece of literature.So how the hell can we expect Kubrick to remake that on the film? We cannot and we do not need to.He brings his own genius to the screen with his use of chilling photography. Jack N. plays the perfect Jack Torrance FOR THE SCREEN and for the purpose of what Kubrick was doing. It was an interesting combination of cinematography, writing, music, imagery, and suspense. Just as King's elements made for a good piece of literature, Kubrick's made for a good piece of film.I recommend both the movie and the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick+Nicholson= A successful horror movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though Stephen King is proclaim the Master of Horror in literature, Stanley Kubrick uses everything to make his last movies from sexual fantasies, racial slurs, sadistic madmen and realistic behavior to mess with the human mind. Though "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Full Metal Jacket" were two of his last films, the third of his last movies "The Shining" is a masterful movie of drama and straight execution of psychology to make you have nightmares.Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance, a writer, teacher and a recovering alcoholic who has an arrangement to meet with managers at a hotel plantation in Colorado where for the next couple of days of his life, he's going to be the caretaker of the estate while starting up a novel. He takes his family, wife Wendy (played by Shelley Duvall) on the brink of insanity while smoking cigarettes and their little boy Danny (Danny Lloyd) who can read things with his mind and see things before they happen and shows expressions as if being abused. After packing and leaving to the resort they meet with the managers and cook Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) before the workers leave. Dick finds out that Danny can read minds where they both talk to each other afterwards and not to say anything about this to their parents.Days go by as Jack tries to write his novel but is distracted by everything from his wife's generosity of food to his son's interruption where things aren't what they seem as they live in the hotel longer. Strange things start occurring where Jack starts seeing people that didn't think existed or left the building. Noises are being heard across the hallways. Visions are toying with their minds. And Jack Nicholson starts to lose his mind."The Shining" is a great accomplishment in horror movies where not since "Dawn of the Dead" and "Halloween" has a scary movie takes its time to show characteristics rather than cut through the action. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece is not going to leave anytime in our DVD collection or our minds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is Stanley Kubrick's famous horror film, starring Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, a former teacher who stumbles upon a winter maintenance job in the Overlook Hotel. He brings his wife and child, and then is isolated for the winter. The isolation and creepy hotel history ends up effecting each character differently, slowly bringing psychological chaos.Kubrick uses several disturbing images to build up the suspense, such as an elevator spilling out blood and two twin ghosts meeting the boy, Danny. There is also some unconventional, even alien, music. The acting is realistic. At first I did not like Shelley Duvall's portrayal as the wife, but the desperation and anguish is so convincing that it won me over. Jack Nicholson, as expected, is perfect for his role. The boy, played by Danny Lloyd, is suitable (the Tony sequences were more than a little weird).The atmosphere is probably the key factor in making The Shining such an effective horror film. The set design is great; the hotel rooms are decorated with tapestries and ornaments. A real sense of isolation is created, although it is clear that another entity is involved.Although not Kubrick's best film, the Shining is among the best horror films around. How scary it really is depends on how you watch it. It is not the fright or sudden surprise, but the suspense and atmosphere that makes it chilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is how horror movies should be. When I first watched this, my mom was complaining about how there was no real given explanation for all that was happening. Oddly enough, that's one of the reasons I love it so much. Kubrick understands the nature of fear, and knows that the unknown is infinitely more frightening than the explained. You can interpret it any way you want to. And I think this film is better than the book: there is no sunny happy ending, or at least it isn't shown, which is good in my opinion as it really didn't fit in with all the darkness and dementia. And Kubrick made another departure that I prefer: instead of having Dick Halloran save the Torrances, he is killed which just escalates everything while at the same time being a kind of release. And Kubrick manages to make the film scary before anything bad actually happens. It takes skill to make a little boy riding a tricycle terrifying. And then there is the photograph of Jack at the end. I haven't even tried to figure that out (I've been using all my brain cells for 2001).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson seems like he was born for roles like these. His face will immediately tell you that the character is mad, but he is mad as well. It explains us so convincingly the performance. He is quite mad to play so good as such, said Martin Landau.Besides Jack Nicholson riveting, unworldly acting that transposes madness slowly in the most subtle, cleverly professional way I've ever seen, the movie is the Grandfather of suspense films. Technically, it innovates on the standard of the "backwards camera" that makes you feel that you are actually in the scene, following the characters in their solitude like we were omnipotent watchers. But we are just witnesses in the upcoming Odyssey.The setting is a vast, isolated hotel that is settled on the snowed valley of Colorado. We can almost feel our skin wrinkle, our hair freeze. The atmosphere is cold, giving a great sense of loneliness. The snow will act as a curtain of natural power that will cover the scene from others and seclude them from the outer world.The movie's pace is fantastic, while you long for some heart braking scary moments, you will find that the movie will twist your mind not ultimately with the supernatural but with the deviation of the Human psyche on the film. It's men who you have to fear, mostly.Did I feel the change on Jack Torrance's mind. The transformation is bitching, moving us restless while introducing us in the most hideous basement of the human Mind."The Shining" will not disappoint you, Im sure. It's tricky all over, and will manipulate you with fear, suspense and at the same time, will hold you tight to the chair sensing that in any moment you will get a heart attack. But trust me, your heart won't get an attack. Your brain will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the outset of this movie, i just new i was in for one hell of an experience, and that's exactly what i got. It is totally encapsulating. Unlike many films of the horror genre, The Shining is a very well rounded package of brilliance. In stanley kubrick's uniquely adapted style, you can sense the undercurrent of fear and corruption bubbling up as if you have a new found sixth sense. He captures each characters essence and reverberates it around the hotel. Danny on the his little trike riding through the corridors is a perfect example of kubrick's mix of uniformed militance and raw emotion - there is no need for music to build the tension, the silence serves as a better substitute and allows you to hear the devestatingly good sound of the wheels running over the wood, then the carpet, wood then the carpet. Like a heartbeat. This, for me, is part of what gets this film under your skin, and plays around with the very roots of our emotions- the now very real possibility of a murderous father. Utter vulnerability.</fullReview>

The Shining is another example of a great Stephen King adaptation. Everything is great about it - the directing, Jack Nicholson, the cinematography, the horror - accept one thing.

		<fullReview>What can I say to all the fans of the novel The Shining and not fans of Kubrick's The Shining? You're not fans of the novel at all. I know you hate to hear it, but it's true. The novel is my all time favorite by King and no one (no, not even King himself - as he proved) could've adapted it better than Stanley Kubrick. I ask the fans of the book who don't like the movie to do one thing: Remember how you felt when you read the book. That's all. Now watch Kubrick's version. Weird isn't it? Kubrick brings out the EXACT same emotion that King does with the novel. You feel frightened. You feel cold. You feel alone. You are in that hotel in the movie, just as you in that hotel in the novel. Kubrick is a genius. He brought to life a novel that would've normally been impossible. Look what happens when you make a word for word account of a novel - The Shining (mini-series) was deplorable! Sure, filmmakers who adapt want to tell a story with respect to the original, but moreover they want you to feel the same as you did when you read it. They want you to be scared if you were scared when you read it. Kubrick delivered a cold, isolated environment, just as King did. The novel was flawless. The film was flawless. The adaptation was flawless. Enough said - case closed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best, ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the movie made some significant changes from the novel, it is still very good. It's one of those movies that every time you watch, you notice something new. The hotel is fantastic and creepy. When most horror movies try to go for the cheap scare or thrill, this movie builds the suspense from the opening frame and music. There is also surprisingly little blood/violence as well, (Minus the Axe attack on the black dude and the bloody elevators). This movie still holds up well even for today. The music and the visuals are great. I've seen this movie probably 10 times and I still don't understand what is going on (the picture at the end???). Everyone who sees it kind of has their own take on what it is all really about. I thought it was about child molestation and there really weren't any ghosts at all, but that's just me. Anyways, a great classic that is worth your time to view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The shining is a timeless classic. I can watch this movie over and over again and i always watch it at least once a year. I cannot find any flaws in it.This is perfect example of a good horror movie. It has great terrifying music. The Shining's ability to build up suspense is great. It has perfect first, second and third act. Stanley Kubrick's directing is great and unique.Jack Nicholson's performance is one of my favorite performances of all time. He portrays the characteristics of a mental ill person amazingly. You are really invested in his character. He is definitely one of the best actors ever. His facial expressions are absolutely great.One of my favorite things about the movie are mysteries that it creates. The movie creates more questions than it answers. Always when I am watching this movie again I discover something new. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece. In my opinion it is the best horror movie of all time and it is definitely in my top 3 best movies of all time, if not my favorite movie of all time.</fullReview>

This time, believe the propaganda of the cover of the video. (Zombie) Just a curiosity: A week before The Shining open in theaters, Kubrick changed the end of the movie and took an entire sequence: After you see the pictures on the hotel wall, the scene would dissolve and would be taken to a hospital. Wendy is resting on a bed and Danny is playing in the waiting room. Stuart Ullman appears and tells her that the body of her husband was not found. When Ullman is leaving, he gives a ball to Danny - the same ball that mysteriously rolls down the aisle before the boy being attacked in room 237. Ullman then chuckles and walks away while Danny looks at the Overlook Hotel</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie The Shining is a psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick. This movie is definitely one of the most scariest horror movies of all times! The eerie music always made me tense during the film. Nowadays, there are some good horror movies, but most of them are jump scares and the chills don't last that long. However, this movie gave me so much chills and freaked me out throughout the movie and even after the movie! Jack Nicholson did a great job acting as Jack Torrace and I was especially impressed with Kubrick's determination. Apparently, he made Jack Nicholson do method acting which was why his acting was outstanding! Another interesting fact was that the kid didn't know that this was a horror movie until he was 17! Finally, there was this one scene where an elevator door opened and blood flooded the entire set. And according to an article from MoviePilot, that blood was actually real blood and it took 6 months to completely clean up the set!Overall, this movie was eerie and I recommend this movie for people who are obsessed with horror.96/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor treatment of King's characters aside, Kubrick's direction was brilliant. What he lost in characterization, he made up for with some of the best camera work and set pieces in horror history. Although Jack Torrance is portrayed as insane from the first scene of the movie version, Jack Nicholson makes the unhinged Jack Torrance work as few other actors could have. Nicholson's work is unsettling and unforgettable. I will even argue that Shelley Duvall did a marvelous job portraying Kubrick's vision of Wendy, even if Kubrick's characterization of Wendy is deeply flawed. Kubrick's pacing is strong, too. Although the descent into madness is evident from the opening scene, the tortuous pace which ensues induces feelings of claustrophobia in even the most seasoned horror aficionado.</fullReview>

I love Jack Nicholson his acting in this movie was very believable a can see how something like that can happen to someone in those situations. There is a painting in the movie that is actually in our home, it is the picture in the Torrences room at the hotel of two little girls warming themselves in front of the fireplace after a bath. Shelley Duval was very convincing her acting was amazing and really brought chills to me and really felt her fear, as though I was in the hotel with her. I wonder how I would of acted if I was in her situation. I have read the book and the movie pretty much stayed true to the book. My brother and I watch the movie when ever it is on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In all honesty when watching The Shining for the first time i was sat there thinking that it was a tad weird at the beginning. I was so right. The whole movie is undoubtedly one of a kind. Being a bit of a horror movie fanatic I have watched many horrors where they have since tried to recreate the story and atmosphere. I can recall several movies who have taken elements of this film and tried to rearrange it into their own production, but not once has it worked as well as it did in this one. I always knew this as 'that film where the guy says "here's johnny"' but now I can see so much more than that.The cast fitted their roles so well, almost as if they were designed around the actors.It has a very on the edge of the seat, eerie atmosphere and you're never sure what's going to happen next (unless you've watched it as many times as I have). However it is still such a classy production with excellent location, not to mention how well the movie was scored.I will forever be utterly obsessed with this production, and definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief Summary/Analysis of The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a family that decides to look after a hotel for the off season in Colorado Mountains. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is looking to finish a book and feels the solitude of hotel will help him do so. His wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) accompany him on this trip. While there they experience delusions of the people who have been there in the past. Jack eventually goes completely mad as does his son. Wendy tries to get herself and Danny away from Jack who eventually throughout the film loses his mind completely.The theme in this film is mainly emotional effect or mood focus. This film is scary from start the finish. Once the family arrives at the hotel for the off season, we start to see a change in Jack's behavior and even Danny's. Wendy reminds the same pretty much throughout the film, but does have a few episodes of hallucinations towards end once Jack has completely lost his mind. Jack and Danny's emotions and mood throughout the film really play into the creepiness and intensity of the story. Jack, we see him in the beginning as a stable guy just looking for a job. As soon as their stay begins at the hotel, his demeanor and actions start changing quickly as his delusions take over and by the end he is completely insane. Danny same thing, he gets hints from his imagery friend Tony to not go to the hotel and that something bad will happen, but obviously his parents don't take him or what Tony said seriously. When Danny arrives at hotel, his delusions and mental state starts to go quickly as well. He sees the two girls that were previously murdered by their father (Mr. Grady) and he also sees a wave of blood fill a hallway of the hotel on several times.The title is significant in this movie. We find out from the head Chef Mr. Hollorann (Scatman Crothers) that "Shining" is a way of hearing people's thoughts. He spoke of having the ability himself while talking with Danny over ice-cream. Danny at this point isn't sure what to think, he knows he has the ability to hear people's thoughts (ex: when Jack kills Mr. Hollorann, Danny sees his Dad doing this act. Danny was in a different part of the hotel at the time of the murder). This was a good choice for the title. Jack Wendy and Danny all struggle at one point with reality and delusions.The camera angles throughout the film are great at capturing the emotions of each character. This also adds to the creepiness as Jack begins to descend into madness. The scene where Wendy is questioning Jack about what happened when Danny went into room 237. The camera is moving and go back and forth from Jack to Wendy. Each time we see Jack his face looks more psychotic and angry. At this point, Wendy notices he's losing his mind and needs to figure out a way to leave. Another great angle was when he axed his way into the bathroom and his head pops through the hole in the door and we hear the infamous words "HERE'S JOHNNY". The bright lighting and scary musical effects in this scene also add to the terrifying intensity of that scene. An example when Jack is searching for Danny in the maze, its snowy out and the lighting is very hazy. It adds intensity to this scene, whether or not Danny can escape the maze without being caught by his deranged father, we hear Jack yelling for Danny with faint intense music in the background. The next morning we find Jack frozen in the snow. The lighting in this scene is bright and as the camera angles towards Jack face we see that he froze to death (although I always think his eyes will pop up or jump up out of the snow bank).Another Stephen King novel turned film, is IT. This movie about a Clown that takes over the minds of a group of young children. Like The Shining plays into the minds of people who end becoming delusional and doing things to harm themselves or others. It seems to be a theme with a lot of Stephen King novels. Playing into the characters psyche and the audiences' is a great way to introduce fear into the mind.In conclusion, The Shining is a great classic horror film, even to this day almost 30 some odd years later scaring those who have seen it once or several times. This film does a great job at making you question the human psyche and what solitude can do to a person. This film has great editing, lighting, camera angles and sound/music effects that really capture the true horror Jack, Wendy, and Danny experienced at their stay at the Overlook Hotel.</fullReview>

He takes the job as a caretaker for the hotel, giving him plenty of time focusing on his future book. He brings his wife and kid with him for the winter.

		<shortDescription>Another Kind of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1980, the new beginning of decades in cinema. And Kubrick brought the most memorable horror of all time. I think it's not a horror after all, it's an unclassified-genre, a Kubrick's very own genre. For me, it is not scary, maybe because the cultural gap between the western and eastern. The Asian-horror, usually frightening young woman appears as ghost, is my cultural-horror. I mean, you know ghost, in every culture is different. At the one hand, if you believe in ghost or those mythical things, this movie is worth to watch, it's from Stephen King's novel itself. In the other hand, if you don't believe, don't worry, Kubrick make another alternative to enjoy this movie. Watch it as a psychological-problem-movie, with suspenseful scene in it. So, two perspective in a movie, who could believe that, but Kubrick made it true. And about its difference from the novel, I don't know if you are a novel reader or what. But, I do appreciate King as the writer, he has good sense in writing mystery-novel. I haven't read the novel though, but King as writer, had done a great job. For Kubrick, you may say, he had torture the masterpiece of writing. So, King is right to defend his work of art. But Kubrick also had a fantastic sense of cinematography, that's why it's okay for him to change the story a little too far. Anyway, I adore both of them."The Shining", however, is pure entertainment in my opinion. It doesn't criticize the culture, society, beliefs, or anything else. A magical movie construction with little jumbled sequence and undefined evil spirit in it. It's okay for me, what audiences really seek is the intense-scene itself, not the comprehension of the symbol in movie. It gets wrong when the movie is bad and boring, but not for "The Shining" which is very genius in that very era. Kubrick doesn't add twist, just leaves the movie-mystery behind. To make the audiences keep wondering, and that's good. Nicholson did a really intimidating-acting, one of the best act from him that I've ever seen. The story itself, I mean the screenplay from the movie, is just so tremendous, though-provoking, and cold. I just can get enough claustrophobia from this film. And what's very touching is "the shining" itself, people that can shine, or has talent to communicate with spirits. The way the movie leads to point a very different way to understand such a weird-talent. You know, children, they are really plain and honest, just a tiny kick for showing new view.Nine out of ten, I rate this movie. With small-amount of moral value, I usually don't rate movie as high as this. But the cultural- impact of this movie is remained until now. Not just in America, but reaches my country also, Indonesia. "All work and no play makes Jack adult boy" comes in my English assignment. Look, it is from the 1980's cinema and still leaves trace until now. With not so many awards, it gives so much unique pleasure. The accomplishment of great cinema-inventiveness. What a charmed feature!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is not a typical hack-them-up slasher film nor it is a simply a ghost/haunted place movie - it is a combination of both in a roundabout way. It's a must see for film connoisseurs and horror movie buffs.The movie is so well acted out by the cast. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance so well that you almost believe that he is that psycho in real life - he's so convincing in this movie! Shelly Duvall was outstanding - I felt like she captured the emotions and torment of Wendy perfectly.The movie has spawned satires and jokes since it first grazed the silver screen in 1980 due to it's popularity. But the movie is not a comedy - no joking matter - it is a seriously dramatic twisted horror film that is not easily forgotten.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Show any conspirator a Kubrick film and they can give you a theory. But no film of his has sparked more confusion, restlessness or frustration than The Shining.One hesitates to even call it a film. Because it's so much more than that. It's an experience. And regarding the experience, Kubrick has somehow managed to record every personal or close feeling you've ever felt and translate it into celluloid. Indeed, there certainly is something very dubious, dangerous and deeply personal about this movie that is difficult to define. But I think I speak for everyone when I say that there is no escaping the unsettling paranoia when one feels when viewing this film.The dark, foreboding tones of the film do little to put the audience's mind at ease. During it's over two hour run time, we have to endure the harshest psychological mind games that visual story-telling can abide. From a setting standpoint, The Overlook hotel is so much more than it appears to be. It's a danger zone for paranormal energy and madness. Watching the film is like descending into delirium. And in plainer terms, the film reveals a savage father's hatred for his family...as ghosts and spirits coax his inner demons out from where he tried to bury them.The Shining is more than a simple movie. It's an experience unlike any other. Watching it once is not enough. You have to watch it a few, even several times before you can finally understand all of it's complex and inter-woven concepts. But even then, no one can really say for sure what the film is trying to say. Though we have tried desperately to decide on what it means....34 years later...we still don't have a clue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is both terrifying and surreal, but not too much to make it unwatchable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally tend to steer clear of the 'horror' genre, because it's not really something that appeals to me. The concept of the "Saw" films is something that disgusts me, and I don't quite understand the appeal. The only foray I've made into the genre is probably "Psycho", which still has scary moments but is not overly terrifying. It was with some apprehension, therefore, that I purchased a copy of "The Shining" and decided to sit down to watch it, not really knowing what to expect. Thankfully, I enjoyed it immensely, finding it both terrifying and surreal, but not too much to make it unwatchable.The film stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, a man hired as caretaker in a strange and isolated hotel during the winter months. A previous caretaker of the hotel went mad and murdered his family, but this does not affect Torrance, and he comes to the hotel with his wife and son, played by Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd. His son has supernatural powers which give him visions and premonitions, and some of these visions provide for thrilling viewing, including the iconic image of the two girls in the corridor. Over the course of the film, Torrance goes steadily madder and ends up trying to murder his family. The film gets more bizarre as it progresses, with imagery becoming more surreal and events getting scarier. Among these interesting and bizarre things are the strangely crowded hotel bar, the blood pouring from the lift, and the final shot of the film.The film's overall pacing is quite steady, and Kubrick allows for a lot of build up until Jack actually goes 'axe-murderer' mad. However it is not uninteresting, and a lot of focus is put on the eerie hotel and how it affects the characters. Nicholson's performance is fantastic and incredibly creepy. We aren't too sure what to make of Torrance from the outset, and Nicholson makes him a fascinating person to watch. Duvall is occasionally quite annoying as the constantly crying victim of her husband's rampage, but it doesn't jar too much. Kubrick has a fantastic visual eye for the film, helping the pacing to be slow and subtle. The moving shots which follow the tricycle, the symmetrical corridors or vivid colours used all help to give the hotel an unearthly quality, making the eventual actions scarier. It's occasionally hard to follow, because some things don't make any sense, but it doesn't feel too confusing because the world of the film doesn't make much sense in nature.And yes, it is a scary movie. There are a lot of really creepy scenes, such as one shared between Nicholson and a lady in a bathtub, and a lot of outright terrifying moments. The chase scenes and Nicholson's now famous axing down of the bathroom door put your heart right in your mouth, and are completely gripping. There are also a few jumps, but these don't feel gratuitous, and simply help to add to the excitement of the film. With "The Shining", Stanley Kubrick created a deep-thinking horror film which manages both to creep out its viewers, and give them an enjoyable time watching it.</fullReview>

It's truly terrifying (even the trailer, which is still scary even by today's standards) and Stanley Kubrick did a great job. Jack Nicholson had an amazing portrayal of Jack Torrance, and he gave us probably the most popular horror movie quote: "Heeeere's Johnny!" If Jack Torrance was played by anyone else this movie I would expect it to not be nearly as good as it is now. Danny Lloyd was pretty good too for his age, although Shelley Duvall had some pretty bland acting, except for when Jack was terrorizing her (In a lot of parts, she wasn't acting, Jack was actually scaring her to death). You can probably tell I liked it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining, based on the incredible Stephen King novel, is one of the most famous horror films ever made, and deservedly so. A family of 3 look after a hotel for the winter and while the son suffers horrifying supernatural visions, the father slowly descends into madness. Stanley Kubrick directs, and he is a very diverse director who made films of many different genres. His sole journey into horror is one of the best horror films of all time, and probably the one with the biggest influence on popular culture. Truth be told, it's not the masterpiece some say it is. While the book is an extremely powerful drama and character study wrapped up in a haunted house master-class, this is just a haunted house master-class. Danny Lloyd gives one of the great child actor performances and Jack Nicholson's legendary turn as Jack Torrance is one of the greatest performances in horror history but Shelley Duvall gives the worst performance in a good movie ever and I'm pretty sure Jack going mad wasn't just to do with the hotel. It's also a bit too long, which is something which is a common complaint with Kubrick.Minor flaws aside, this is the closest a horror film has come to being art. With it's brilliant use of lighting, endless silence, beautifully composed frames, terrifying tracking shots and never-ending sense of isolation, this is one of the most haunting films ever made. The script has some interesting hidden meanings and the film is open to interpretation, which adds to the experience. The chase sequences, making great use of steadicam, are brilliant, and there is an endless sense of claustrophobia. What sets this apart from other horror films (I'm not a big fan of them to be honest) is that from the beginning it's beautiful, icy and chilling, and the direction is so dazzling it draws the audiences in almost instantaneously. Kubrick has the best use of wide shots in film history (Except for maybe Terrence Malick) and his direction and Jack Nicholson's acting make the movie, although the script still has some depth and with fully lit corridors, endless silence and a snow covered maze creates arguably the scariest haunted house (or hotel) in history. While not up there with Carrie, this is a graceful, haunting adaptation which the horror genre can be proud of and Stephen King should be proud of even though he isn't.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been well documented that Stephen King wasn't very happy with Stanley Kubrick on account of how he adapted his novel The Shining to the screen. I myself haven't actually read the King book but I am a big admirer of the Kubrick film. But it does appear that this movie is one that divides opinion like few other horror films. While there are many like me who love it, there are equally many others who find it unscary and unengaging. Not only that but, somewhat bizarrely, it seems to have also attracted a lot of conspiracy theories surrounding supposed hidden messages and subtexts buried within the film. If you don't believe this, watch the recent documentary Room 237 which presents several of these, in my opinion, utterly stupid theories. Basically, there seems to be little middle ground when it comes to opinions on The Shining.I can only speak from the point-of-view of someone who thinks this is a bit of a masterpiece. Kubrick was a director who seemed to make films in different genres that still retained his very personal stamp. In this example I think he shows that the horror genre was pretty well suited to his sensibilities. The cold detachment his films are famous for works really well for this particular story. The setting is a remote isolated hotel in the middle of winter after all. His meticulous attention to detail is evident from the first beautiful soaring shot over a cold lake right until the final extreme zoom. Visually the movie is a tour de force. This was one of the first films to use the Steadicam, which allowed for very smooth mobile camera-work, most notably when we glide through the corridors of the hotel following the boy Danny on his trike. The horror genre also gives Kubrick ample opportunity to construct nightmare-like imagery such as the river of blood that flows out of the lift shaft. But it's the atmosphere that really makes it all work. There are several standout suspense scenes, like the famous axe moment and the ghostly little girls but also others such as the very disturbing encounter in Room 237. Then there is the hotel bar that Jack Torrance visits in moments of despair, replete with swinging 1920's guests. From here we have one of the standout sinister parts of the whole movie, where Torrance has a conversation with the ex-caretaker (and very dead) Grady in the toilet. The conversation is cold and disturbing and sets the wheels in motion for the final horror. Sometimes, though it's the very simple, subtle ideas that generate the biggest chills, such as when Wendy discovers just exactly what it is that her husband has been spending his whole time writing since arrival.The cast is small but excellent. Jack Nicholson is admittedly very over-the-top but he is pretty convincingly intense, Shelley Duvall is very good in a tough role, young Danny Lloyd is one of the rare breed of child actors who can actually act and Scatman Crothers, who plays the cook who recognises Danny's shining ability, is always a welcome presence in any film. But really, the real standout character of this film is the Overlook Hotel itself. Everything happens under its bright lights, there is no typical horror darkness here but this only adds to the terror if anything. It's a place that seems to hold a secret and its vast empty expanses become somewhat sinister once the guests and workers have finally left. Wendy Carlos unusual score accentuates this by punctuating certain moments with tones that imply impending dread. On the whole, The Shining is a movie that doesn't really have any faults for me. It's an immaculately constructed horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heeerrrrre's a review for The Shining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Off the bat, I have to say that this is the scariest movie I've ever seen. It's entirely creepy. A psychological horror. It is scary the whole way through. The Shining is even more chilling than the icy Colorado setting it takes place in. It is the only movie that I can say has truly lingered with me when I think about what the scariest movies are. Second off, The Shining doesn't just earn a 10 because it's so very scary. This is a cinematic masterpiece. A horror masterpiece. Thank you, Stanley Kubrick. The Shining is timeless. Every single scene is crafted exquisitely. The set of the Overlook Hotel is luxurious. Kubrick's direction is immaculate. Stanley's camera throughout tells one wicked tale from frame to frame, as it's always lurking and ever present, overlooking the characters themselves as if it's the Overlook Hotel watching them. What some people describe is 'boring', and 'slow', is actually setting the tone beautifully for the tensest scenes. The Shining's not slow. That's why it's so great. The Shining is a movie that I just love. It's so awesome. I do have a hard time watching it over and over again because it scares the living bejeebies out of me, but whenever I do watch it, I fall right back into it and it is so good. Jack Nicholson as Jack is incredible in one of the very best and most referred to roles in all of cinematic history. Shelley Duvall as Jack's wife, Wendy Torrance, is just as exceptional. This is Stephen King's best on screen adaptation of one of his novels. Kubrick's ending is superior to King's. The Shining is insanely scary. I sure would not like to be trapped inside of that particular hotel with this guy! Heeeerrrrre's Johnny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie while chilling and creepy,is absolutely amazing. Its the kind of creepy that will give you weird nightmares. I love this movie and usually watch it every time it is on. There are some intense scenes that might not be suitable for the younger audience, I watched this for the very first time when I was ten and it made me have really odd dreams for a month. I've been a fan of thriller/horror movies for sometime now and this one has topped my all time favorites. I am not going to give any spoilers for those who have not seen it yet. But just be for warned its super creepy but in a good way. I hope you enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's do the time warp dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writing about a Kubrick movie is intimidating. Not just any director inspires that kind of tin-foil hat devotion. There's obviously something more going on in his anally retentive wax work movies, I've read so many obsessive dissections that I'm no longer sure what I'M even looking at when I put on one of His. These ornate puzzle flicks are like formally perfect movie Rorschach blots beyond their plots. They gradually bloom on further investigation, revealing all sorts of sweet gooey layers- kinda like real life. Wheels turning within wheels is my favorite description. You don't even have to be clued into Kubrick's brand of mind games, you just FEEL there's so much more going on underneath: everything is heavy, charged with import.It's frustrating as hell if you're not used to it though. It leaves the virgin viewer stranded at the surface screaming from the sidelines that there's nothing spe-cial here AT All. What's all the fuss about? They just seem like big, hollow pretty movies. Nice expensive pictures flattened of any kind of vibrancy, any passion whatsoever. Sterile, lifeless. That dry pressed, left brain quality really turns some people off. It's too controlled and fussed over, there's not enough spontaneity. Everything has a sheen of painterly artifice that further enforces a chilly remove from the material; it makes people assume Kubrick just plain despises them. They reduce the great director to an aspie nerd making marble busts of a species he loathes. I know I kept watching THE SHINING convinced there was more going on beyond the stiff theatrics but blind to whatever it was. It bugged me, the surface plot was too threadbare for all the portent thrown about. it was too loaded and elaborate.One thing I'm sure of now at least is Jack Nicholson. The criticism goes that he was wrong for the part because Jack already comes off crazy from the start, lapsing into self parody by the conclusion. That this was somehow not deliberate. No. To Kubrick people are already robots, clockwork oranges acting their parts. To stand out in the first place you need a performer with an added layer of self awareness. Enter Jack, the original king of irony. The whole world's a stage, that's Jack's thing. Those eyebrows, that sh*t eating grin- he isn't taking any of this seriously.Jack Torrance is playing Jack Torrance but unlike the others he KNOWS he's playing Jack Torrance and the strain of having to keep up appearances while everything goes to hell has him frayed round the edges (also, Kubrick cast a guy called Jack to play a guy called Jack; that's a clue right there). Moving into the Overlook just uncorks what's already there, amplifying it out. Jack has no more authentic self, all that's behind that forced leer is a black hole, he's become the entire surface drama, shouting TV punch lines while dashing around with an axe. All he has left is to blow up what he was already doing to ludicrous proportions, to become 'Jack Nicholson/Jack Torrance' incarnate. That's what the baroque acting style is about- Jack's hilarious impression of 2001 in reverse, from man to monkey in two hours and change.It's immaterial whether there are 'ghosts' here, the demons in Jack's head are the demons in the hotel and vice versa. Spirits you drink and spirits that drink you. There is no clear demarcation, the whole family is subject to the split; it's the same system- family/hotel, as above so below like the opening shot with the mountain range reflected in the lake. The characters are inseparable from the surroundings, the hugeness of the Hotel swallows them up. It *is* them. Whatever meager defenses the family had before is no match for this architectural monstrosity. You're right there with the characters in this strange castle, ants isolated in a vast panorama awed at your own insignificance. This is what really freaks people out about Kubrick I think, his focus is so unflatteringly zoomed out that human beings become just more props on the stage, there and gone. 'This is how you really look' he seems to be saying. 'BEHOLD, PUNY MORTALS!' The overwhelmingly open space is like an explosive decompression on the families' clogged septic tank- all that repressed trauma, all those bad feelings come pouring out in a noxious tidal wave. The miasma of sickness blends with the questionable history of the Overlook to take on a life of its own. King's novel was a straight supernatural scare story. To him the devil really did make Jack do it. You see King says in his book, 'they're really ARE ghosts. But what exactly, Kubrick replies by way of his movie, do we mean by 'ghosts'? The horror in THE SHINING is the horror of being trapped in the labyrinth of your own mind, projecting demons outward so that they morph and mix with the surroundings to take on a different face. Each of the trio inhabits their own special suffering zone and communicate with each other distantly if at all. Living together and a million miles away. This is the rule rather than the exception; Peoples' refusal to know themselves makes the surrounding landscape a frightening place where shadows reign. Kubrick doesn't just spin a yarn of a family going mad from cabin fever, he encodes in the very fabric of it how it feels to lose your mind, subtly undermining everything we thought to be true and on-the-level. It's a slow burn, like the gradual onset of snow blindness.The closer you look the more uncertain things get and then Kubrick's Chinese finger trap has you, examining online maps of the Overlook and discussing the possible occult symbolism of the closing ballroom photograph at 3am with other True Believers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When compared to the King novel ~ wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie SO many times (prior to reading the book) and it never fails to scare me each and every time. Jack Nicholson, of course, was born for the part of the lead male but I have found that the Jack of the movie is not necessarily the Jack of the book. On its own, the movie is one of the best in its genre but if you have never read the book, do yourself a favor and do so. Having never read a King novel before, I was impressed. The book was excellent. The depth of characters is so vastly different from those depicted in the film. You actually like the Jack of the book! You 'feel' for him. You understand him. Some of the action of the story too has been altered in the film, and in my opinion, not for the better. I plan to watch Stephen King's The Shining now as I understand it more closely resembles his original story and is more in line with what the author wanted the Stanley Kubrick film to be. The real reason for Kubrick's reinterpretation can be researched, as it too is an interesting read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in the Seventies when Stephen King's horror novels were coming out, I would challenge myself to read them in the dead of night with the rest of the lights in the house off and no one else around. Most of the time I could force myself through a couple of chapters, but every once in a while King's narrative would stimulate the imagination so wildly I'd have to put the book down. Like the Sandy Koufax card in 'Needful Things', or the clown in the storm drain in 'It'. With 'The Shining', it was the idea of those dead twin girls inviting little Danny to come and play.I only saw this film once before when it first came out and thought it was a masterful representation of the Stephen King book. Watching today, I thought it was a bit slow and too deliberate at times in it's exposition, with Nicholson's character Jack Torrance a little too over the top in the early stages. But you have to admit, he carries over that crazed catatonic look of Randle McMurphy from 'Cuckoo's Nest' quite effectively. By the time he turns into a would be ax murderer at the finale, he's firing on all cylinders and his manic performance is a wonder to behold.For me, I guess the scariest moment of the film didn't have anything to do with murder and mayhem. It was catching Wendy's (Shelley Duvall) reaction to those dozens of typed pages of manuscript bearing a single sentence over and over again in various iterations. At that moment, you knew that Jack's mind had unraveled to a point of no return and he had completely lost it. Imagine the frustration and paranoia of typing the same thing repeatedly until the mind simply snaps. That was just a powerful scene.Anyway, going back to my opening thought, the idea here would be the same. Try watching this one in the middle of the night with nothing but the TV set on and the room completely dark otherwise. No cheating now, you have to watch the movie all by yourself.</fullReview>

Upon hearing this I went into the garage, pulled out an axe and began to hack away at my friends bathroom door. OK I didn't but I wanted to!It is just amazing! Jack Nicholson is AMAZING and I can't believe Stephen King didn't want him as the starring role! Why? The Shining IS Jack Nicholson.......he makes the film what it is.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed it to what my young mind could take in.I remember thinking that my dad would come home with an axe and kill me! Of course, that is highly unlikely. But even at that age, I very rarely got scared. And for a movie to make me feel that paranoid is amazing. It is a vivid brilliance I cannot stress enough.The characters were fantastic. The directing was beautiful. I can honestly say that I will never find a film as entertaining and gripping as The Shining.Kubrick was a genius. He made me feel as if I was there. I felt as if my real life was non-existent, and the movie was my life.Kubrick's film is much better that Kings adaptation to his own novel, which, must be very difficult to accomplish.out of ten- ten.</fullReview>

In order to provide for his family, the troubled man goes to the remote and Overlook Hotel in Colorado to work as the caretaker. At the hotel in 1970, the caretaker Charles Grady killed himself and his family. While he didn't tell his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) about this, his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) has a gift that the hotel's claravoyant chef, Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) calls "the shining", which gives him visions from the past and future.The hotel is haunted. The family is snowbound. Torrance is struggling with his demons and the hotel's, he eventually goes on a complete mental breakdown and tries to murder his family which the hotel's spirits convince him are "keeping him down".The film is a very well-crafted horror film. Nicholson gave possibly his greatest performance in it. I love it and will never forget it. This film is very special to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen the shining many times on television, on DVD, at Halloween at friends houses or just to scare myself stupid sometimes when the moment calls for it. To me, this movie is one of the greatest pieces of cinema I have ever witnessed from its superb camera work, to the lighting effects and terrifying soundtrack to the overall feel of and pace of the movie. It takes time to lay the groundwork in the beginning but once it gets going, the movie unravels in a chilling and thrilling spectacle of terror and horror. I can genuinely say that this movie is a wonderful piece of horror cinema and is a piece of creative genius from the way it was imagined by the late, great Stanley Kubrick. It plays with your mind and stays there for weeks on end gnawing at your core and wanting you to unravel the story further and delve deeper into the madness that is the shining. Although I am young, I have seen many a film in my time and can boldly say that I am fully aware that the shining is one of the greatest if not the greatest psychological horror movies to ever grace the silver screen. If you have seen it, you know what I mean. If you have seen it and don't like it, watch it again to try and fully grasp it. If you haven't seen it yet, get up and rent it NOW! You are doing yourself a great disservice to miss one of the greatest works ever.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Torrance family head to the vast Overlook Hotel, of which they will be the only occupants for the next months. Great for Mrs. Torrance (Duvall) who enjoys the outdoors and a house-keeping challenge. But not so good for sensitive Danny, who feels the influence of the horrors committed by the last caretaker. And definitively not good for Jack Torrance (Nicholson), whose planned seclusion to write his novel leads not to artistic inspiration but to murderous madness.In adapting Stephen King's book, Kubrick turned it and the horror genre on their heads. All the common principles of horror are twisted: things happen in the stark, white daylight rather than at dark, silence induces the terror rather than spooky sounds, and the undead are far less dangerous than members of one's own family. Rejecting the ghosts-as-frighteners theory since to him life after death was a positive prospect, Kubrick tore the film down to Jack Nicholson's slow, frightful mental unraveling. It works wonders (in the most horrible of ways imaginable): Jack Nicholson directed by Kubrick is far more terrifying than any monster could hope to be.Kubrick being Kubrick, nothing is left to chance: every frame is completely calculated. This has earned him a reputation for being cold in some quarters. One can easily imagine what effect this gives a film such as "The Shinning". Sweeping shots of eerie corridors (the birth of the steady-cam), slow zooms into Nicholson's crazed face, the labyrinth scene... Kubrick weaves a tapestry of cinematic tension and unease and psychological violence with every element at his disposal. Stephen King hated it of course, convinced that the "scary" ghosts from his source novel were what made the horror work, and remade it his way two decades later. the result was a sorry dud of a film."The Shinning" is among the best horror films ever because at its heart it holds that sordid truth that the most frightening thing out there is ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very chilling ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never in my entire life have I been bothered by a film as much as this ? I must say this film is simply the most astonishingly shocking horror I have ever watched, and ironically I loved it, despite being petrified at the time.Jack Nicholson (One flew over the cuckoo's nest, as good as it gets) is simply outstanding as troubled winter caretaker Torrance. To play a character who is stressed, enthusiastic, deranged, weird and simply crazy is beyond me and this is one performance which simply is a must watch, because it is probably his best performance I have seen.Despite criticisms I thought Duvall (Roxanne, Popeye) was simply charismatic in her role as the wife to Jack. Her expressions when terrified are funny but down right frightening to say the least; I was scared to the bone.As well as fantastic acting, the story is very gripping and fits the horror genre perfectly. It is emphasised well with Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange) directing short scenes with extremely low and slow sounds to make the scenes very chilling. There are quick flashes of Danny's visions which are also very unsettling. I found that the use of the ghosts was an extremely powerful device to make audiences scared, I was especially chilled by the twin girls, and their expressions were horrific.It's a very consistent plot which always keeps the viewers on their toes as to what is going to happen next. It's all about staying in control and withstanding certain situations and many stubborn people may argue that it is a predictable horror but nevertheless it is extremely gripping, chilling and down right exciting.Being set in such a claustrophobic area adds to the tension and mystery behind an astonishing plot.One particular scene I found fascinating was the blood elevator scene which must be a landmark in horror genre history. Slow, captivating and wondering, brilliance by Kubrick.I wouldn't recommend this to people who get scared easily. If you like tension, uneasy characters, personality changes and chilling ghosts then it is a definite watch.The reason this film for me doesn't get a 10 is because I found it so unnerving, not really my type of genre. Absolutely nothing else wrong with it though.</fullReview>

Most of the time you wanted Jack to kill her so as to stop her incessant prattling. The actor who played Danny was superb. However, the manifetation of Tony was ridiculous. Also, the idea of the maze was laughable. I admit to being biased though since it barely resembles the book.I would recommend this movie only if you have not read the book.

It isn't just about a recovering alcoholic caretaker suffering from a bout of cabin fever, it focuses on his growing hatred for his family, and his growing love for the Hotel, as graphically described in the book (just for the record, I prefer the movie). Kubrick's obsession with the Stedicam, chasing Danny through the long winded, carpeted halls of the Overlook Hotel, the score and the beginning music: "Dies Irae" from the Symphony Fantastique by Borodin all add to the truly amazing, terrifiying and fantastic roller-coaster of a ride that is The Shining.If you haven't seen The Shining, you are missing out on a film where every frame is a piece of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing Horrific Power Makes For One of the Most Terrifying Films of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King didn't care for Stanley Kubrick's adaption of his novel "The Shining" at first, but appears to have warmed to it, particularly citing it as an important contribution to the horror film genre in his nonfiction book "Danse Macabre". There are perhaps a half-dozen horror films which terrify on one level and yet explore greater, deeper literary themes. Horror often forces the introspection concerning the nature of the inner and outer realities of human existence. William Friedkin's the Exorcist is one such example, which explores the issues of religious faith within the context of a priest determined to save a girl possessed by a demon. "Interview with the Vampire" is another, in which the "monster" is all too human, exhibiting all the emotions of their mortal counterparts rather than being deranged and mindless. And "The Shining" directed by Kubrick is another, which explores the vulnerability of the family unit, confronting forces far more powerful than itself, and whether that unit can survive.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a writer with an alcohol problem hired to be a caretaker for the Overlook Hotel during its off-season months in the Midwest. Towards the end of the interview for the job, he learns that something evil had occurred many decades previously by one of the caretakers. Torrance resolves the same won't happen to him. He and his family move to the hotel with the purpose of taking care of the hotel allowing Jack to work on his writing projects. Jack, his wife Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) travel to the Rocky Mountains where the hotel resides on the cusp of the winter months. When they arrive, the hotel is about to close for the winter and Torrance will maintain the hotel while it lays dormant. The manager offers them a brief tour before everything is closed down and the Torrance's are left with only one other employee and the large ominous building, which rings of hotels made 100 years ago in a by-gone era.From the get-go, the Overlook Hotel seems strange. After the regular employees and management have left for the winter, the hotel creaks and moans, as if stirring from a long sleep. One of the fascinating elements of the film is that the hotel itself is a character as interesting as the human characters. The only other employee who stays during the Winter is Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers). Hallorann befriends Danny and learns the boy has a secret: he is receptive to ESP, which the older man calls "Shining". The boy senses through his ability something is wrong with the hotel; it has an evil presence and energy. He begins to see horrific images throughout the hotel. In one of the most frightening images ever portrayed on film, Danny, while riding his big-wheels around the hotel encounters a ghostly apparition. And as the hotel's secrets begin to reveal themselves, so is the family forced to confront its omnipresence whose malevolence targets the Torrance's.This is one of the most astonishing and terrifying films ever made, and not for the feint of heart. White some other writers and filmmakers, like Clive Barker and Anne Rice, can certainly disturb through their works of Dark Fantasy, King's visions have the ability to terrify readers and film-goers almost like no other. When apparitions appear in a King work, they are not just spooky, they are blood-curdling monstrosities forcing all those they encounter to face death at its most horrid and gruesome. Kubrick's The Shining is perhaps the essence of King's horrific vision realized on the large screen. Best to watch this one with a loved one, hopefully with a blanket so you can hide yourself from the supernatural baddies. Of course, luckily, those ghostly creatures can't find you if you're hiding within a blanket!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is one of the best horror movies ever created, and one of Kubrick's most remember-able and well produced films. The soundtrack is terrifying and haunting, it keeps the audience on their toes throughout the entire film. The cinematography is very cinematic, including numerous tracking shots, making the film looks beautiful and makes the location seems more real. The performances are good for most of the cast but Jack Nicholson's performance is over the top, his performance could have been more restraint early on in the film. But it does make the film more entertaining and remember-able. Characters could have had more development to define the characters more; this could have made them more interesting. Also some back-story could have been used to define and to make them more interesting as well. Good dialogue that works in the film. A very intriguing plot that only gets better as the film goes on. I enjoy how the plot unfolds growing ever so creepy and unpredictable as the time goes on. Great unique visuals are used frequently giving the film a interesting look. Amazing set design of the overlook Hotel. Good characters, they are not all are amazing characters but they work in the film. The Shining is an iconic must see for any movie lover, mainly for horror film fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining (9/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is considered one of the top directors for a reason, his adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining is a tremendous piece of cinematic history. The scenery and music in the opening credits are eerily horrifying right off the bat. The character of Jack Torrance would not have a better role if it wasn't done by Jack Nicholson. The small supporting cast of Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers and Barry Nelson were equally great in the film. Although there were terrific performances, the real star was The Overlook Hotel and the masterful way Kubrick portrayed the evilness of the place. The film develops itself very slowly and builds itself into complete insanity. The horror scenes that include the twin girls, Room 237 and the stairway are all freaky and expertly shot. When the ending comes it does come as a shock because the vast majority of viewers have no idea what just happened. It takes multiple viewing and additional research to completely understand King's and Kubrick's deranged story that is The Shining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm used to the gore and cheap jump scares of modern horror, so I was expecting the scariness of "The Shining" to have dulled over 35 years.Nope.Psychology, that's where the real horror lies. That, and the claustrophobic atmosphere (pretty snow on the outside, encroaching madness on the inside). Hopeless isolation. And it doesn't help matters that Kubrick plays on your emotions. He just wouldn't let up with the often-terrified expressions on Danny Lloyd's face, but it is extremely effective. And between the tracking shots, movements and unbalanced camera angles, it's just watching the maestro at work, turning the screws just a little bit more. Cold and calculated.And let me just say that, even though it's never mentioned alongside the other famous images ("Heeere's Johnny!", the twins, REDRUM, the blood), the woman in the bathtub scene was the scariest. The reveal in the mirror, her cackling, the unrelenting strings - Jesus Christ, "unnerving" would be the understatement of the year. Kubrick turns something erotic into . . . that?! Maybe it's because that's the movie's first real scare, but that scene left its mark, no question.What a movie!9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this horror masterpiece from the Kubrick of Stanley (Stanley Kubrick), I personally never understood nor entirely loved, but with this re-watching; I accept "The Shining" is something on it's own level and deserve it's labels, "first epic horror film." I may have seen it over and over, so much so I reference it in other reviews as a fine film, the film itself is an enigma to me, which is why I watched Vivian Kubrick's the making of The Shining just before sitting through the real thing, hoping it would help me have a good conclusion on this orchestra of a horror film.I think there may not be a huge massage behind his weird and irregularity of showing you something profound and questioning, I think his huge IQ helped him understand a film that is hard to pin down is just entertaining throughout, never once is "The Shining" or Kubrick or other unique movies (Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove) boring. I'm thinking it is all to keep the suspecting viewer on there toes, like a game of chess. Get ready for this craziness, the owner of The Overlook looks a lot like John F Kennedy and the American flag on his desk as well as stenciled name on his desk is well, and his saying goodbye to the beautiful girls walking by as he shows Jack around, JFK was a ladies man. Kinda like the fake moon landing theories addressed in the reality poking documentary about "The Shining," Room 237. But leaving secret massages out of it, it is just an excellently made film, stating the obvious of course, with it unquestionable Kubrick style that can not be cloned or even reached in today's cinematic experience. It's movies like "The Shining" that proves what a daisy of beauty the art form of film, can be.Jack Torrance (Nicholson) with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and his psychic son Danny (retired: Danny Lloyd) are gonna spend the rest of the year util May in The Overlook Hotel, Jack Torrance has taken the job as the caretaker for the empty hotel, because of the frost biting snow storm that hits leaving any body inside stranded. Leaving Jack with a abundance of time to get through writers block, that seems to be caused by his family more the seclusion of the Hotel. Wendy cleans and cares for the hotel while Danny enjoys the spoils of a child, while he keeps getting weird premonitions from his psychic ability, the cook who also has some supernatural ability tells him in the beginning it is called the shining, it seems his shining is centered around room 237, which the cook, Dick tells him never to go inside. When Danny finally breaks the advice Dick gave him and walks through the threshold of room 237 he sets in motion unintentionally, an uninvited, gruesome set of events that leads agitated Jack Torrance on a roller coaster of inanity, or could it be the ghosts of Overlooks past dealing a contract to execute a gory unjust killing.I feel Kubrick exploited his cast in this- Jack Nicholson's talent to express raw emotion with his iconic acting and Shelly Duvall's beautifully weird looming presents equal of annoyance, to perfectly get the same felling her role is given to Torrance, of unintentionally annoying him to the point were we see through her acting in itself making us hate her as much. Keeps this horror/frightening presents in every frame like a stretched jumpscare. With the kids plain acting skill for him to dully and act frightful in a bowl of elixir of casting along with Stanley Kubrick question mark of direction and brushed screen of weirdly dark purple and red colors painted on the Overlook canvas of plain white. The output is something that baffles and amazes whoever watch's and always finding something with this film with every watch, pushing the unanswered question that looms in the form of horror what exactly is happening on screen in this simple plot that seems to become trivial compared to the unquestionably masterclass look of movie magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What it takes to be remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the Shinning is about being recognised and remembered. Yellow is a symbol for fear, being afraid, red for aggression, green for shelter/security(the labyrinth is green) and a few other places. The history doesn't remember the writer as much as it remembers the bloody days(holocaust jews, indians being murdered), also there's a reference about a past murder at the hotel. The OVERLOOK hotel, our main character wants to SHINE, not to be overlooked, there's a quote from the movie: "Places are like people, some shine and some don't", Jack wants to shine, wants to be remembered. He cares about his reputation, he tried to obtain it the right way by writing ( 'Have you ever had a *single moment's thought* about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought, for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers? Has it ever occurred to you that I have agreed to look after the *Overlook* Hotel until May the *first*. Does it *matter to you at all* that the *owners* have placed their *complete confidence* and *trust* in me, and that I have signed a letter of agreement, a *contract*, in which I have accepted that *responsibility?* Do you have the *slightest idea* what a *moral and ethical principal* is? *Do you?* Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future, if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities? Has it ever occurred to you? *Has it?*'), but realises how dull it is and so, sadly he won't be remembered( "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"), intensionally spelled wrong on the papers Wendy found, as he is going for the wrong ways now, same for REDRUM( backwards MURDER ).In the end he is frozen and forgotten, though there is a picture a black and white picture at the end( reference to Holocaust ), giving 'hope' that he would be remembered for what he did.Another great movie by Stanley, 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a better review than mine, I guess one should turn to the one by Robert Ebert which does the movie justice.The movie is Stanley's Kubrick interpretation of Stephen's King novel, The Shining. Apparently, Stephen King himself wasn't entirely happy with the movie, so he went and made one of his own, which, in my opinion, is inferior in every way.While the direction is masterful, as one could expect form Kubrick, the acting performances stand out. As someone who has had psychotic episodes, I can testify first hand the Jack Nicholson performance as the writer slowly going insane is spot on. Shelley Duvall is great in the role of the terrified wife who must deal with her crippling fear to defend herself and her sun from the strange father. There is a delicious psychological tension between the members of the trio Danny, Jack and Wendy. The supporting task is also great, with a special mention to Scatman Crothers, "the outside party" brought in by Danny's shining.The cinematography is beautiful. Images have vivid colors and great lighting and bright red dominates. Combined with the sound they underline the isolation and creepiness of the Overlook hotel.Action builds up slowly towards the conclusion. From the wonderfully ominous opening sequence to the last scenes, tension builds up with every frame. Although it's a horror movie, there is little blood, but, however little it is more than effective.I didn't really consider this one a scary movie. I watched and rewatched it because it was beautiful and I truly enjoyed Jack Nicholson's performance. It is my impression that Kubrick find the idea of a father turning against his own family more disturbing that the cabin fever caused by some restless spirits residing in the Overlook hotel, and that is probably what Stephen King would rather play on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Shining Piece in the Top Echelons of Cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a curious motion picture. While Stephen King (on whose novel 'The Shining' the movie is based) was largely ambivalent about the adaptation, for legions of filmaholics, it is an example of directorial bravura and an exemplary study of psychosis and unreliable terror. With its intensely suffocating sense of personality disintegration, The Shining is as unsettling as anything Stanley Kubrick made during his distinguished career.At its core, The Shining is a simple haunted-house story. Jack Torrance (Nicholson) takes up a job at the unbelievably remote Overlook Hotel in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado (a place where many depraved incidents have happened, it has become something of a library of malevolent psychic energy) with his wife Wendy (Duvall) and his son Danny (Lloyd) in tow. They are to spend six and a half months as the winter caretakers for the hotel, separated from the rest of humanity by an unforgiving alpine winter. Jack's personality seems on the edge and we soon learn that he's a recovering alcoholic. Wendy is the kind of meek wife who follows her husband's lead while Danny has a disconcerting habit of conversing with himself, implied to be a manifestation of his psychic powers. Very soon, bizarre occurrences start happening and the movie flails off into an orgy of psychological terror. Wendy becomes concerned that her husband is losing his grip on sanity. And with a winter storm howling outside, the spacious hotel becomes a penitentiary. And the weirdness and danger escalate further as Jack slips over the edge from sanity to madness.Nicholson's centerpiece performance is so absolutely terrifying and raw that it's no wonder he's spent the rest of his career in its shadow. Duvall as the mousy, jangled wife makes the most of her natural wide-eyed innocence, while Lloyd is equally compelling as the young boy who has the gift of the (paranormal) gab. The real star here, however, is Kubrick's direction. Kubrick creates a twisted environment in which mental stability, supernatural malignance and the sense of space and time shimmer and twist to dreadful effect. Kubrick presents much of the movie from Jack's point-of-view, and it becomes apparent that Kubrick wants us to become mired in the maelstrom of his disintegrating sanity. He however, never answers the questions about whether Jack's ghoulish visions are real or fabrications of his increasingly warped imagination, which adds to the eerie discomfort. By the end of the film, every inch of the hotel hints at something sinister and every frame is infused with a sense of the macabre.With Kubrick's majestic fingerprints all over it, The Shining easily finds a place in the top echelons of cinematic achievements. A totally visceral experience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson makes you forget that it barely resembles the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The directorial artistry of the late Stanley Kubrick and a powerhouse performance by Jack Nicholson are the primary selling points of 1980's The Shining, a chilling and atmospheric psychological thriller based on Stephen King's most famous novel.This version of the story stars Nicholson as Jack Torrance, a severely blocked writer with a wife and child, who agrees to take a job as the off-season caretaker of an isolated hotel called the Overlook, located in the snow-buried rocky mountains of Colorado. He thinks the isolation might aid in his writer's block, even after learning that the previous caretaker went crazy from the isolation and killed his wife and twin daughters. We then watch Jack move his wife, Wendy and his son, Danny into the Overlook and the viewer watches and wonders if the same thing is going to happen to Torrance. We also learn that young Danny has a connection to the hotel that his parents know nothing about.Despite the fact that this film is basically a shell of the novel it is based on, it is still bone-chilling entertainment, thanks primarily to Kubrick's ability to unfold such an intimate story on such a huge and menacing canvas. The claustrophobic atmosphere that Kubrick creates here is so effective...the Outlook almost feels like it's on another planet, it seem like it's a billion miles from civilization and the fact that everything we see is blanketed in snow makes it seem even more removed from reality. Kubrick creates a cinematic atmosphere here that is chilling and completely engrossing.Jack Nicholson is absolutely electrifying as Torrance, an everyman with issues that he would like to bury but his isolation at this hotel and unhappiness with his own life, which he is in denial about, that makes Torrance's journey into insanity so riveting...it's not just the big moments but watch Nicholson when he learns abut what happened to the previous caretaker, or when his son begins to question his and his mother's safety, or my personal favorite, his conversation with the imaginary bartender in the hotel's elegant ballroom...even though we know this is all going on in Torrance's mind, Nicholson's investment as an actor makes us believe everything we are watching. Shelley Duvall is shrill but effective as Jack's wife Wendy, a woman who begins unraveling, torn between devotion to her husband and protecting her life as well as her son's.Almost in the tradition of Scorsese and De Niro, Kubrick and Nicholson created a formidable director/actor collaboration that, sadly, didn't develop into further work, but it should have. Kubrick and Nicholson created a classic here that should not be missed. Later remade by ABC television as a 4-hour miniseries with Steven Weber as Jack Torrance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ghost Story? A Psychological Horror? Either Way It Gets Better With Age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, If there was anything that hasn't been said about "The Shining" I've yet to hear it. After watching the absurd "Room 237" (2012) documentary, it proves that this movie continues to age extraordinarily well considering how many people continue to interpret it. To me and 15-20 of my mates who have sat down and watch this so many times, I decided it's best to take it for what it is. Read into it lightly at the beginning, and dissect it in depth on repeated viewings.As far as plot goes, it strays FAR from the source material and Stephen King is known to not be a fan of it (Once declaring Kubrick's treatment of Wendy as one of the greatest misogynistic portrayals of woman in film ever). A surprisingly thin premise, a man who has taken up a care taker position of a hotel for the winter, eventually loses his sanity and endangers his family. Like all of Kubrick's work, the film is shot so well it captures a unique look that I love about the camera in general. It becomes the ghost, and other perspectives in the room. That's not my interpretation on just this movie, that's my quasi-opinion on all movies in general. This one just happens to be shot by a master of his craft, and that opening with the sweeping tracking shot of the mountains screams ghost doesn't it?And of course, it's another one of those films where Jack Nicholson just gives his absolute best. At the time where he was playing crazy a lot and actually gave up remembering his lines due to the ever changing script, I believe he STILL makes the role his own &amp; unique. What TALENT Mr. Nicholson possesses, and I don't think this picture would have aged so well without him. Shelley Duvall does very well, and course the arguments with Kubrick on set clearly show what lengths she had to put herself through. Even to this day how they managed to film around Danny (Danny Lloyd) and make him not realise he was in a horror film baffles me.I consider "The Shining" to be the first psychological horror film I ever saw (This was pre "Cat People", "Persona" &amp; "Les Diaboliques"). To me it falls more into the realm of an art-house film, yet the sense of lost and isolation portrayed including the mental effects YOU may possibly feel, have never really felt quite surpassed. The film has the same look as a TV miniseries, trudges along at a snails pace, and I always found the whole experience humorously nonchalant when it came to lacking the usual large opening credits. It's charming to know that Harry Dean Stanton almost played Lloyd the bartender, and that Kubrick sat everyone down and made them watch "Eraserhead" (1977) to emulate such a heavy atmosphere.Final Verdict: Not really horror, and not entirely scary. "The Shining" is more about testing the meta of the horror genre, and evaluating the results. Those results really show in the eyes and thoughts of each individual. Anyone can write or talk about it, but to actually experience it is something else entirely. 10/10. Essential viewing if you love the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Another) Kubrick Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely my favorite Kubrick movie, despite being also a die-hard Stephen King fan, I love what he did to this adaptation. It really did change the very essence of the characters from the novel and went to completely different grounds. Jack Nicholson gives an (as usual) over-the-top performance as Jack Torrance, and I think one of the great things about it is that he combines utter psychopathic behavior with a dark, sarcastic humor..which i'd attribute to Kubrick's writing. Still, needless to say, it's an amazing masterpiece. The atmosphere of isolation and eeriness it creates is beyond anything i've ever experienced in probably any other horror film. It's not one of those movies that makes you jump in your chair or feel disgusted by all the gore and killing, in fact, it does the opposite of what we'd expect. One example is that scene where Wendy discovers all the "work" Jack that has done in the past few months, the pages filled with endless crazy repetitions of the same sentence. In that scene, we see Jack as he is approaching her, which gives us a heads-up of what's going to come next, even though it still scares the crap out of us when he finally appears before her. That's one of the reasons why it's still frightening and relevant even after 34 years!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to horror movies, there's many types of them. They're either the slasher type or the psychological type. But "The Shining" is a different type of horror movie. Stanley Kubrick was in his own little world when he made this movie, and the finishing product is something like no one else has done or has done since.Based on the novel "The Shining" by Stephen King, he really took it beyond what the book was about and made it into his own creation, straying for the most part from the original source material. Even though this film is more of a psychological type of horror movie, it really doesn't follow the formula of other well known films of this genre like "Psycho". There's such a wide variety for the surreal in this movie, that Kubrick could've have basically done anything with the film. Other people say it's a slasher movie. I tend to disagree because there's really not much of a body count, and only one character dies. I don't want to spoil anything, but it happens so quickly, that you hardly notice. The only "shocking" moment in the movie is the old lady in the bathtub scene. It disgusts me. If Jack Torrence wasn't played by Jack Nicholson, this film wouldn't have been as scary or it would've been a totally different movie. You can't take your eyes off of him; when it comes to playing crazy characters he is the best (i.e. "Batman", "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"). Throughout the whole movie, he's a ticking time bomb. The movie does a great job in building up the tension of his insanity until he's chasing his family around the hotel with an ax. My favorite scenes are when he's talking to the bartender; now whether it's his imagination or it's a ghost, it's not explained. The way Jack acts in these scenes are priceless and crazy; but Lloyd is oblivious to this, acting like everything is OK. Later in the movie, he talks with the waiter in the bathroom and treating him with respect (despite his psychotic nature). It begins with small-talk, but it gets serious; moreover, the gradual transaction to that is just brilliant.It ends with Danny being chased by Jack. But there's no establishing shots, so we never know if Jack is gaining up on Danny or is he far behind, trying to catch up. The whole idea is to make the audience feel disoriented, and it serves as a great climax to the film. This movie makes me feel like going through that maze in the cold, and being lost. But to be fair, had the plot been more clear-cut and had definitive answers, it wouldn't have the same effect as it does now. The whole movie makes me feel like I'm descending into madness. It's a unique horror film with a disturbing, yet fascinating techniques in filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson and Duvall are superb in a true classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw The Shining when I was about 13 in 1983 in the UK. Back then I knew I was watching something quite special, and was taken aback by Nicholson's performance, and how chilling the movie was.Having just watched the full length edition on Blu-Ray, I am simply awestruck.All the people who slate this movie must be mad! How anyone can give this film 1 star (as some IMDb reviewers have) is beyond me. Even if you don't think it is the masterpiece it so obviously is, you're telling me it's only worth 1 star?!?! The performances, the sets (I can hardly believe this was filmed on a set in London), the photography, the script, the costumes; everything about this film is remarkable. I won't go on to review the story and plot, others have done that, but I am motivated to make a few further comments about Shelley Duvall.Having only recently consulted the 'great internet' about the details of this film, I am totally shocked to learn that so many people hate Shelley Duvall's performance; and indeed that her performance was disliked by critics at the time of the film's release, and that she was nominated for a Razzie.Well NEVER has there been such an injustice in the history of cinema!! Shelley's performance is absolutely breathtaking, and the film would not be anywhere near as frightening without it. Her conveyance of fear and exasperation at Jack's descent into madness is absolute. Many people seem to have a problem with her being weak and feeble, but hang on; that's the character Kubrick wanted her to play!! It's called acting, and she was superb. Cruel comments about her looks are also as absurd as they are irrelevant; she was a very pretty woman. It is cinema folklore how Kubrick treated her like dirt on a near year long shoot. Perhaps the glorious ends do indeed justify the means, but Duvall gave it her all and was a real trooper; 45 takes to do the staircase scene! The scene where she discovers Jack's writing (all work and no play make Jack a dull boy!) and the following staircase scene are cinematic gold. Shelley has been immortalized by these scenes.How Duvall didn't get an Oscar, let alone a nomination, is completely beyond me. And to think that Sandra Bullock got nominated for Gravity!! The 70's (this movie was made at the end of that decade) was a time when 'unconventional' looking actors could star in films (Hoffman, Hackman, Duvall etc.) because they had talent. How I wish cinema was more like that today.Anyway she gave a stunning performance in an iconic film that will forever be remembered. I wonder how many of her internet snipers can put that on their resumes?</fullReview>

Going into the mountains in Oregon, then going to the hotel was a great experience for me since I had been shown the movie when I was a child by my mother and father. I strongly suggest anyone who hasn't seen the movie to take the time out of their day and snuggle up close to someone in the darkness of their home and watch the movie. It'll be a great way to spend a date. Now since the movie was made in 1980 it'll be different than the type of horror people from the 2000 generation will be use to, so be ready for a real down right fear for your life scare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like "The Shining"? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time.So, the plot is fairly simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and his family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season. The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls. What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean.This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as "scary". It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music. Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one. The score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it.Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie. This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe.There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one. R.I.P. Stanley.</fullReview>

But I already talked about those in my comment on the mini series. But, I missed a few. The film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot.

		<fullReview>The Shining Directed by Stanley KubrickThis movie is really scary. It deals with recovering alcoholic Jack Torrence taking care of The Overlook with his wife Wendy and very creepy son Danny. That's all I will say.The one thing about this movie is Stanley Kubrick's extraordinary directing. He makes it so confusing you can not follow except for the fact that whatever is going on is bad. You can't tell what's with the kid, if Jack is doing what he does to himself, or if the hotel's to blame. It's really crazy and scary.30/30 Directing 30/30 Acting 30/30 Quality 10/10 Achievement in Goal Film wishes to accomplish100%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is great work from Kubrick, and has all the hallmarks of his films; innovative camera angles and movement, blocks of solid colour and structure, quality acting and just a dash of bizarre. The Shining is not for the easily scared, but for those with an open mind it is chilling, surreal and completely captivating. Some have said The Shining has not aged well; I disagree. If anything the *slightly* dated setting and structure of the film just add to the sense of surrealism and detachment, which is a good thing in this case.If The Shining had been made today, it would have been a turkey, because there are only four actors who spend any amount of time on screen, the dialogue is short and sometimes cryptic, and it would probably be too unsettling to stare at Jack Nicholson's 'psychopath' face for pretty much a solid minute as you have to do in the film.I love this film; it's excellent work.p.s. It bears some resemblance to The Thing (1982) with it's claustrophobic setting and copious snow - I won't go into more detail for fear of producing spoilers, but I recommend you watch that film if you like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror movies ever made with exceptional performance by Jack Nicholson and stunningly directed by Stanley Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family formed by a father (Jack Nicholson, Stanley Kubrick considered both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams for the role of Jack Torrance but decided against both of them) , mother (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd , first choice to play was Cary Guffey, because Danny was so young and since it was his first acting job, Kubrick was highly protective of the child, during the shooting of the movie, Lloyd was under the impression that the film he was making was a drama, not a horror movie) heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. The struggling writer named Jack Torrance accepts a position as the caretaker of a great summer resort hotel called Overlook during the winter season . But then the writer becomes possessed by it .Having turned down directing a sequel to The exorcist (1973), Kubrick made his own horror film: The shining (1980) , today regarded as one of the best terror movies ever made. Stephen King (whose novel the film was based upon) reportedly didn't like Kubrick's adaptation . One of 'Stanley Kubrick''s favorite films was Eraserhead, directed by David Lynch , he cited the film as a creative influence during the making of The Shining and screened Eraserhead to put the cast and crew in the mood he wanted to achieve for the film. The director keeps things at a snail's pace , but he carries out scary moments and amazing scenes . Nicholson' s performance approaches high levels . There is a great deal of confusion regarding this film and the number of retakes of certain scenes . According to the Guinness Book of Records, the scene where Wendy is backing up the stairs swinging the baseball bat was shot 127 times, which is a record for the most takes of a single scene. The picture is shot in the Academy ratio (1.37:1) and features shots down the length of tall, parallel walls, the maze and hotel corridors in . And Steadicam operator Garrett Brown accomplished many of the ultra-low tracking corridor sequences from a wheelchair on which his invention was mounted. Excellent costume design by Milena Canonero and magnificent production design by Roy Walker , all of the interior rooms of The Overlook Hotel were filmed at Elstree Studios in England, including The Colorado Lounge, where Jack does his typing. Because of the intense heat generated from the lighting used to recreate window sunlight . To construct the interiors of the Overlook, Stanley Kubrick and his production designer, Roy Walker purposely set out to make it look like an amalgamation of bits and pieces of real hotels, rather than giving it one single design ethic. Kubrick had sent many photographers around the country photographing hotel rooms and picking his favorite. For example, the red men's bathroom was modeled on a men's room in the Biltmore Hotel in Arizona designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Colorado lounge was modeled on the lounge of the Ahwanee Hotel in the Yosemite Valley. Indeed, the chandeliers, windows and fireplace are nearly identical, so much so that people entering the Ahwahnee often ask if it's "the Shining hotel". Colorful and luxurious cinematography by John Scott , Kubrick's usual filmed on location in Colorado, Glacier National Park, Montana,Going-to-the-Sun Road, Glacier National Park, Montana,Saint Mary Lake, Glacier National Park, Montana, Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood, Oregon, (Overlook Hotel exterior), Yosemite National Park, California and Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England, UK . Creepy and eerie musical score , Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind wrote and performed a full electronic score for the film, but Kubrick discarded most of it and used a soundtrack of mostly classical music , only the adaptation of Hector Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique" during the opening credits, a few other brief moments survive in the final version . Rating : Above average , it is considered to be one of the history's best horror films . Despite receiving generally unfavorable reviews upon its initial release, the film is today deeply regarded In 2001, it was ranked 29th on AFI list. In 2003, Jack Torrance was named the 25th greatest villain on the Villains' AFI list. This well produced film by Jan Harlan was named the scariest film of all time by Channel 4 in 2003, and Total Film had it as the 5th greatest horror film in 2004. The motion picture will appeal to Jack Nicholson fans and Stanley Kubrick buffs .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has two things going for it: style and eyebrows.The visual style is quite handsome and well done. Intriguing sets, odd colors, and a sense of large, sinister space inside the hotel. This was the first movie to utilize the Steadicam camera, and it's put to good use.The musical style is also effective. Bizarre 20th-century classical works (similar to the ones in Kubrick's 2001) enhance the spooky and creepy nature of the action.And of course, we have Jack Nicholson's eyebrows. I don't believe they've been put to the test before or since. They're very effective in letting us know what's on his mind.But if you take all this away, you're left with a very confusing story. Okay, so the hotel is haunted. Somehow along the way we find that one of the characters may be from the past, and then that seems to be confirmed at the end. But so what? What does that have to do with the story? Why is that important? What does that have to do with the hotel? Why do the scenes from the past matter and how do they fit in with the story in the present? I saw the movie when it first came out, and just watched it tonight, 30 years later. I wanted to give it a second chance. But I felt exactly the same way both times. I found it boring, not scary, somewhat predictable, and ultimately unsatisfying. Style is grand, but it cannot make up for a story that doesn't make any sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror genre, The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a big fan of horror films, although one thing I have always felt that they lacked is originality. The stories all contain the same elements and the concepts were all loosely based on something supernatural rather then something realistic and something like body horror.The Shining was the first film which I thought had brought something original to the horror film genre. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumours of the place being haunted, the last resident went crazy and murdered his family as a result of the effects of the hotel onto his stability of mind. However, Jack is convinced that he and his family will be okay and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent man. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad? One of the scariest parts of the film is the extreme sense of isolation which Stanley Kubrick makes. The hotel is extremely large, with vast, empty rooms and the sense of eerie stillness as Nicholson's son, Danny, rides his tricycle through the deserted corridors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5% King, 100% Kubrick: a bona fide horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a weird example of adaptation: it has very little in common with the source novel, written by Stephen King, yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work. This is due to two factors: Stanley Kubrick's masterful direction and Jack Nicholson's chilly acting.Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a writer who accepts to take care of the Overlook Hotel in Canada during the winter period, unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place: he claims a nice, isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book. Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home of the Torrance family: Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their five-year old son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong: he has been told by the cook, Dick O' Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy, the titular Shining, which allows people like him and Dick to see flashes from the past and the future, among other things. Because of this "gift", the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in Danny, even though he is quite capable of resisting them. That is not Jack's case, however, as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts, triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break.The Shining works as a horror movie because Kubrick, though having never worked on this kind of film before, knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't, hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths. King criticized the director for changing most of the story, omitting most of the Jack/Danny subplot (merely hinted at in the film) that led to the book's emotionally strong climax, and while his disappointment is valid, the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption, albeit in an unconventional way, and redemption is a theme Kubrick, one of the most famous analysts of human decay, never had a soft spot for. What he is interested in is the mental, and subsequently physical, unbalance that threatens the characters, and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot (Danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).Another criticism King raised was about the actors, especially Nicholson: in the writer's opinion, his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate Jack already was insane, thus undermining the rest of the story. Now, it is true that Nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning, but it is equally true that Martin Sheen (King's ideal choice for the role) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as Nicholson's: from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal "Here's Johnny!" scene, it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part, and even though the TV version of The Shining from 1997 isn't bad the Torrance character is indelibly linked to the One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest star. As for Duvall and Lloyd, both add terrific support, the latter especially deserving a place alongside Harvey Stephens (The Omen's Damien) and Haley Joel Osment as cinema's great horror child icons. One might complain about Duvall being completely different from the book counterpart (blonde and beautiful) and not having much else to do but scream and run, but two things ought to be considered: a) back in 1980 the "scream queen" cliché wasn't one yet; b) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera, making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from Wendy's eyes.Irvine Welsh, the author of Trainspotting, once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work (and he should know, given the liberties Danny Boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen), yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad. The Shining proves said point to perfection: very little from the novel, approximately 5%, is included in the film, but in Kubrick and Nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest, most original horror pictures of all time, which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form.</fullReview>

See this freaking awesome movie!!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived. Every single one of his movies are masterpieces, including this one. The Shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies as caretakers for the winters, and get snowed in. Well, the house is haunted. The kid is psychic. The husband is easily impacted by evil haunted hotels, and...well...HILARITY ENSUES!!!! Not really. It becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions, and it gets scary. Not just the classic, "Here's Johnny" scene. It's memorable, but can't speak for the whole movies. It's one of those things where words don't explain it adequately, and you just gotta see it. So go on Netflix, and get it!

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of modern horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times, this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film. While Carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, Kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier. It's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it. I try not to compare it to the book ? which I've only read once, a number of years ago, and which scared me to death ? because the two don't have a lot in common, besides the story and characters obviously. It's almost as if Kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening. And it that way, it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made, as well as one of the greatest horror films.What makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares, not the blood and gore, not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time. It's the destruction of Jack Torrence. Some people have complained about the casting of Nicholson in this role, saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film, given his past roles and his appearance. I disagree. We know he's going to go crazy ? since most of us have read the book ? and Jack's appearance only furthers this notion. But it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared. He's calm, quiet, patient. He engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family. And with a wife and son as irritating as his, it's a small wonder that he manages to do so. But once he gets to the Overlook, he changes. He becomes irritable, angry, on edge. The scene that always shocks me is when Wendy interrupts him typing, and he utterly loses it, telling her to "leave him the f*** alone". This is the first f-bomb dropped in the film, and it's a shock to the system. From then on, all bets are off.Another thing I love is the multiple interpretations present in the film. We're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening. Many critics have noted that whenever Jack talks to a ghost, there's a mirror present, showing that he may as well be talking to himself. But what of the other characters? Wendy never sees anything until the film's climax, until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, but she is well aware that something is wrong, while Danny connects with the place almost immediately. His psychic powers are not in question ? how else would Hallorann know to come to the hotel? ? but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness? It's easy to claim that Jack merely loses it, being trapped in a hotel with his family, and Wendy later does as well ? seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that ? but what of Danny? It appears that his body is taken over by Tony, but how do we know for sure? None of these characters are reliable witnesses. Hallorann probably would be, and he warns of the dangers in 237, but he's killed as soon as he arrives at the Overlook (a scare Kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel). And that final shot. Has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema? Has Jack really been there before? Or was his body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel? When talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with Jack Nicholson. Shelley Duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history ? probably on purpose, to give Jack's character more of a reason to snap ? and Danny Lloyd is no better, but Jack is a powerhouse. Part method, part improvisation, he's simultaneously terrifying and appealing. For better or for worse, he's the character with whom we identify with, not the annoying kid or nagging wife. We all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season, be able to do whatever we want. Who cares if it's haunted? Of course, the technical aspects are terrific. Kubrick's long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror. The use of colour, mirrors, long hallways, and every other motif only heightens this. And don't even get me started on that score. I don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting, electronic tune. Its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel, the mood, and the entire film itself.I know King doesn't like this film, but King's input on cinema is nothing to brag about. As great of a novel writer he may be, his screenplays are terrible, and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed. This is not a very faithful book adaptation, but it doesn't need to be, and it really shouldn't. Part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on; there's no reassuring source material. Kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more. If only for that, this is one of the most innovative films in any genre. And it's got everything else on top of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A, um, Shining Example of the Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a terrific film. When you let Kubrick have his way with a story like this one, you can almost guarantee success. The book is?if possible?even scarier than the movie version because there's a frightening topiary scene and a scarier subplot that Kubrick didn't or couldn't explore. But the movie is still one of the best horror flicks ever made. I think it works so well because the Torrence family is so isolated. They are essentially beyond help once the snows come, and if you've ever traveled on mountain roads on which you may run into a forest service gate blocking the roads in the winter, you know what that isolation feels like. Go past that gate, and they may never find you. So I think that's what is effective in the original book, and Kubrick masterfully employs that theme throughout (isolation of the family from society, isolation of the family members from one another, and isolation of the individual). Between Danny on the tricycle, dead twins, bleeding hallways, a creepy dead bartender, one of the scariest still photographs ever, the decaying chick in the bathtub, Jack hacking through the bathroom door, Dick getting axed in the chest, Wendy seeing Jack's "novel," and the final scene with him frozen in the maze, the film has more than its share of scary moments. Wow.</fullReview>

But 'The Shining' took me to new levels of psychological terror.The entire film, works together as one tense, frightening atmosphere. From the moment Jack Torrance says that his family will 'love it', the viewer is plunged into the dark and unpredictable story of madness and blood.Kubrick uses incredible visual techniques. I find myself skipping a breath each time Danny turns a corner on his tricycle. I found myself skipping several more where Kubrick makes two twin girls seem utterly terrifying.Enriched with colourful ideas, a closed set (used to amazing effect), fantastic acting and the most memorable madness and supernatural experience you can find in modern cinema.This fantastic and iconic story, with startling music and fine dialogue remains one of Kubrick's finest pictures</fullReview>

The flawless filming stile, the acting and (Kubrick's all time number one skill) the music - make it THE masterpiece of horror. I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and I had my hopes about this when I got a hold of it. IT BLEW ME AWAY!!! It is far better than I ever imagined it. It starts slow (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense. The intro scene is a classic by all means and I watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film. Also the film doesn't offer a lot of gore (it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless) a trend that I hate in recent day horror films. Just watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miserable adaptation of a great book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the worst screen adaptations of a novel I have ever seen. Kubrick seems to make the wrong decision at every turn, and the result is a terribly long and incoherent film that does a terrible injustice to Stephen King's terrific original story.First of all, the story is about a man going SLOWLY insane; Nicholson seems more than halfway there at the start of the movie, robbing his character of any suspense.In general, Kubrick has (as usual) ignored his actors shamelessly, with the result that none of them gives anything close to the right performance.Another bad mistake: in the book, the relationship between the father and the son is an unusually close and loving one; this makes the resulting horror all the more tragic. In the film, the father and son seem to have no relationship at all. The mother, a strong and purposeful character in the book, is here something of a ninny.Worst of all, perhaps, is that in the book the boy is the focus of the story; the movie shifts the focus to the father and therefore cuts the guts out of what was a pretty complex story.Also, like most of Kubrick's movies, this one is simply WAY TOO LONG. There is absolutely no reason for this film to take so much time to say, in the end, so little.</fullReview>

Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens.

		<fullReview>Do not waste your time on this movie. It is one of the best examples of a botched translation from print to screen ever. It has been inexcusably "Kubrickized" to make it fit in more easily with the rest of Stanley Kubrick's body of work.Kubrick takes the basic idea from the book-- and I do mean the most absolutely basic outline of the story-- and changes it into something that is not even remotely scary. In the book, the Hotel itself is the fourth main character, slowly driving Jack Torrance insane. In this utter waste of film, Jack was crazy when they got there, and the isolation from the outside world is what takes him over the edge. In this bastardized version, there is no point in having Danny possessed of psychic powers, nor of making the Hotel itself haunted. Those two points, which should be the two most important facts of the story, instead take a backseat to a very predictable, very generic story of an already unstable man finally snapping.Do yourself a favor, and instead of this absolute SIN of a film, watch the made-for-tv mini-series starring Steven Weber. It is much more faithful to the book, and therefore a much better and well worked story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started reading the book on the Thursday before a long weekend. From the time I picked it up, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. While I'd loved Salem's Lot, it paled next to The Shining. When I heard it was going to be made into a movie, and Stanley was directing, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I stood outside the theater hours before the tickets went on sale so I could be the first to see it.Why Stephen King didn't encourage his fans to boycott this film remains a mystery. It's well known he was not pleased with the production. I'm with him. The book was about the Hotel and our own demons.Unfortunately Jack Nicholson decided he need to take over the movie and make it about himself. While there are times and movies when Jack's over the top portrayals are amusing and spell binding, this was not the film he should have used or misused his talents.Years later, Stephen remade The Shining, casting Steven Webber as the father. It was a much more interesting version, focused more on the story and less on one egomaniac's stealing of the spot light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The shining is probably this worst adaptation ever. I saw this movie when I was 8 and it didn't scare me then I read the book which is one of the most interesting page turners I've ever read and realized that this movie is just style and no substance.Plot: A family of 3 move up to a hotel to take care of it during the heavy winter season. And wouldn't you know it the hotel it haunted and the ghost make dad go crazy say the hilarious line "Heeeeeeeeeere's Johnny" and try and kill his family.The acting was dumb except for Shelley Duvall who I think did an amazing job and she was the one who was nominated for a razzie. Why not nominated Jack Nicholson or nominate it as the worst picture of the year. Note: Friday the 13th was nominated for worst pic the same year and the movie is 100% scarier and better than this movie.Now to Stanley Kubrick, what went wrong man? Mind I've only seen four of his work (five if you count A.I. but i don't cause he didn't direct it) which are A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Full Metal Jacket and this, but the other were so much more than this (although i really gotta watch 2001 again cause i really didn't get it)but I'll forgive Stanley for this atrocity of a movie but for a long time I didn't see any of his movies because I thought they'd be as bad as this.Bottom Line: Read the book before you slap a 10 on this and call it a masterpiece and I can see why Stephen King didn't like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen about 3 Stanley Kubrick movies. A Clockwork Orange, Dr Strangelove and now this - it might not be as much as I hoped but I have to start somewhere. Being hailed as one of the greatest horror movies of all time and hated by the author I'm going to side more with the crowd that loves this even if when reading up on what the book had in it that the movie could have benefited from including in it.The plot is that Jack Torrence is a writer that is asked to take care of a huge maze of a hotel built in the very early 20th Century, miles from anywhere during the winter. He accepts because he needs to have peace and quiet to work. His wife agrees but his son, Danny's imaginary croaky-voiced friend warns him otherwise. Danny has psychic powers and so does the hotel's head chef who explains to him to not go into Room 237. However Jack's mental state... Well, being in a frozen over mountain hundreds of miles from anywhere for months on end, it's almost enough to drive someone crazy.Okay onto what I enjoyed. As is standard for a Stanley Kubrick movie thew cinematography is excellent, I seriously cannot imagine a better creepy hotel location. I also love the sound design, it's enough to be unsettled the whole way through but never in such a way that it ever goes over the top. I also think Danny Lloyd did a really good job, seemingly blending in perfectly with the character. There's also the fact that it has an unsettling nature entirely throughout and yet the first death comes 100 minutes in and the only other horror movie I've seen successfully doing this is The Exorcist.What didn't I like? 2 words. Character development. Jack and Wendy Torrence pretty much begin and end with Jack being a frustrated man with a steadily deteriorating mental state thanks to the ghosts in the hotel and Wendy gets pretty annoying pretty fast. Jack Nicholson does fine as the agitated turning crazy writer but when watching it, a serious question arises as to whether the ghosts at The Overlook possessed him or if they're the devil in the shoulder figure in the cartoons that just influence him to make the decision. I know that's not what Stephen King intended in his novel but all thing's considered I'm seriously considering the option B when it comes to the movie adaption.All in all this is a damn good horror movie and considering how rare those are I would suggest watching it if it sounds like your thing. There are some problems (namely summed up in the above paragraph) but I would recommend it to horror fans and people wanting to check out the works of Stanley Kubrick. What can I say? He's damn good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, full disclosure, I was a massive fan of Stephen King novels in the 70's, 80's and 90's, and read The Shining when it first came out. Sadly so much was changed between the novel and the movie, it tears the very beating heart out of the story and renders it meaningless. Even the Shining, as Halloran dubs their abilities, is swept under the rug and seems irrelevant in the film after which it is named. Other major changes from the novel, well it's hard to know where to start there are so many. Just about all of the back story around Jacks alcoholism is ignored. The history of the Overlook is all but ignored. All three main characters differ vastly from their literary counterparts, right down to their hair colour. The Topiary of animals becomes a maze, the roque court, a major element of the novel, just disappears. The pieces that do survive from the book just end up being confusing asides without the background. The casting is very poor, Nicholson comes across as maniacal right from the off and continues to over act his way through the entire film. Duvall seems completely out of place and Danny Torrance displays all the charisma of an empty paper bag. The jarring musical soundtrack is often irritating more than it is effective. I know this is a massively popular film, but for me it was a failure of epic proportions.</fullReview>

Having signed a contract to be the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in the mountainous region of Sidewinder. A job that carries five months of smothering isolation admits the cold as the resort is normally snowed-in during this stretch.Except, they won't be really alone. For the Overlook has its share of ghosts?and a dark past. While Jack battles alcoholism and his rage through writing, something malevolent has taken a shine to the family. If they are to survive this place, the talents of their five-year-old son Danny may be the only thing that can save them from what became of the previous off-season custodian and his family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall and Danny Lloyd star in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror film based on Stephen King's novel. Nicholson (Batman) plays Jack Torrance, a school teacher turned writer who becomes the caretaker of an old Colorado hotel, "The Overlook" located in the mountains. He takes his wife, Wendy (Duvall) and young son, Danny (Lloyd) there where they stay for the winter. Soon, strange things begin to happen as Jack tries to work on his book and becomes insane. Danny starts to have a psychic ability and sees strange visions learning the hotel is haunted. This is a chilling film that's certainly one of Jack's best. Wendy Carlos' score is also eerie and I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creepiness of Stephen King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King's intentions are simple: scare the s*** out of people. He succeeds every time. From the beginning, the movie seemed crappy and weird, but it specialized in the dramatic effect; building suspense. I don't like horror films, nor do I enjoy reading horrific stories, the paranoid coward I am, but this is one of those classic, memorable movies that needed to be experienced. I've experienced other works of Stephen King ("Secret Window", "Christine", "Carrie", "Pet Sematary"), and I noticed he leaves a creepy ending every time. I did not particularly like the way the movie was filmed. There weren't enough closeups, when there should have been; but maybe I'm just used to the 21st century way of filming movies. My not-so-best description of this movie would be, creepy and weird. But I suppose that's the point. Jack Nicholson did a phenomenal job in portraying the major creepiness of the main character. This movie kind of freaked me out (as it was supposed to) and reminded me of the craziness that resides in normal people. You just never know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Stanley Kubrick. Written by: Stanley Kubrick, Diane Johnson, Starring: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers, Barry Nelson, Joe Turkel.Kubrick's intense film based off Stephen King's novel follows the story of a writer (Nicholson) who takes his family to an abandoned hotel, which causes a violent reaction from him as surreal images flood his mind. His wife (Duvall) does not know what to make of her husband's sudden descent or their young son's strange behavior. Much horror follows this up.Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King had well-known creative differences over the project. King had a more paranormal approach to the haunting of Nicholson's character which is more straightforward in why these events are happening. Kubrick's adaptation is more focused on the dehumanization of Nicholson's character and less clear on what his evil behavior is coming from.That is the reason Kubrick's version prevails is because it is hazy. The film could be a psychological reaction to the claustrophobic environment of the hotel, a schizophrenic fantasy, or like King would have it, a response to the paranormal entities of the hotel. Or it could be all of the above. Perhaps Nicholson's character is provoked into violence by the spirits.The next question we must ask is if it should be taken literally or as a work of symbolism or both. Kubrick is not stuffing words and explanations to the change of character into our mouthes, but he gives us enough explanation to at least make sense of the horror going on. Nicholson is excellent in the main role because his change in attitude is not too quick nor too slow. Pairing him up with Duvall, Kubrick contrasts the two personalities and better shows Nicholson's hatred as in comparison with Duvall's innocence. Duvall gives Kubrick and Nicholson a frame to work with in order to display how horrible the lead character really is. The genius of the film is how Kubrick portrays his characters in a claustrophobic and hallucinatory backdrop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A round of applause for a 31-year old film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--- my review does contain a few spoilers.---I had heard of this movie a couple of times before i decided to watch it. They say it is very scary and probably one of the scariest films ever made. I viewed this film about two hours ago at a very late time of night. And yes, it is still quite late.First off, I will say that the film was done well even in comparison to modern day films, which made me at first think that people must have had nightmares for three months after watching this movie in 1980. Then, i found out that they didn't and i will deal with that later in my review. I will say that the movie was not incredible and did not have me on the edge of my seat, but it was still enjoyable.The movie is purely about suspense. Suspense is a great thing in my opinion. I will applaud the director here for successfully making the film scary with his suspense without having to add excessive amounts of gore and blood or scenes where some ugly monster pops out of the mirror or something and makes the audience scream. The storyline is extremely slow-paced and the music was made so that we could really get into the movie.Some good acting in my opinion. (not awful like some reviewers said) most of the actors put up good performances. That other guy who had the ability to see things as well, however, was awful. I guess it's because Hollywood at the time was still getting used to African-American actors. The guy might have even been new.The script was good, although i had felt that the African-American guy was given awful lines of dialogue on purpose because of his race, which seemed unfair.The characters seemed well developed. They seemed convincing to me and we could certainly feel emotions for them.The storyline had a nice flow. I will mention again that i like how the director made it slow-paced to add on to the suspense. Some questions still end up being raised at the end. Who were those two girls the boy kept seeing? Who is Tony, Danny's split personality or some voice he hears or something? Why does the hotel room make jack go mentally insane? How does it turn out that jack was the same age in 1921 as he is now? Is he some spirit or ghost or something that is insane and thinks he is human?I would encourage a remake for this film and i suppose the gross revenue would have been $700+M if it had been done. If i had done a remake, i would probably do the following:Replace the actor who played as Jack's wife. She is ugly. Jack's wife seemed to have enough of a psychological breakdown. But to make the audience more hooked on the movie, i would make tweak things up a bit and make the breakdown twice as bad."redrum" is written with crayon. I would have haven it written with blood.I would have an explanation as to why the father is going crazy. I would make the two twin girls look scarred and scabbed and covered in blood.I like the suspense, but i prefer horror movies that are generally suspense? suspense? suspense? POP!! I did mention that this director managed to create a good movie without that element of surprise, but i still think it could've been better with it.As i said before, i finished watching the film thinking that the audiences back then ended up having nightmares for months on end after seeing this. BUT other reviewers confirmed the complete opposite and said it was because it did not stay faithful to the storyline of the book. I'm not a big fan of steven king's and i have not read any of his books, but i will say that the movie was probably overlooked back then. Audiences were disappointed when they found that the movie completely deviated from the storyline of the book. (at least, that's what they say). I suppose they expected it to be completely like its book. Before, i always thought that movies deviate from the storyline of the original work are not great but after remembering the Prince of Persia movie, i decided that i guess it might depend on the film. The POP movie wasn't incredible, but it was still good despite the way in which it stayed completely away from the storyline of the video game. It may also depend on the acting, script, and character development. I watched 30 minutes of the 1990 version of lord of the flies recently, and it was the worst movie i've ever seen. If anything, that movie was the one that should have been booed and jeered at. Here, i guess the changed and already awful storyline looked even worse because of the abominable acting and script. So, my message here is this: don't into the theatre expecting a film to be 100% like its book. If the director decides to change the storyline 90%, then try to adapt to the changes and enjoy the film. Those of you who still want to rant on about how it was not a good book-movie adaptation, i suggest you go read lord of the flies and watch the 1990 version. Not the 1963 version, because that stays faithful to the novel's storyline. The 1990 version will be the most awful piece of motion-picture you've ever seen in your life AND the worst book-movie adaptation.Anyways, i'm done writing this review. And again, another round of applause for this 1980 movie that still appears enjoyable and scary even in 2011. I'll even mention my rating once for this film.8/10 for good quality horror film entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a rewarding horror movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining starring Jack Nicholson as Jack, Shelley Duvall as Wendy and Danny Lloyd as Danny, tells the story of the Torrance family taking on the duties of care taking the overlook hotel in Colorado. However things take a turn for the worst as super natural forces force Jack into a severe case of cabin fever. As more and more mysterious things take place Jack begins to lose control and beings to take his responsibility as the caretaker to a dangerous level. Jack finally reaches a breaking point and attempts to attack his wife; she defends herself by giving Jack a blow to the head. Shortly after waking up Jack loses all sanity and goes on an axe wielding rampage, attempting to kill Wendy and Danny. His family is able to escape the hotel as he is left to freeze to death in the hedge maze.Several different themes present themselves within this movie including supernatural aspects and the effect of isolation on the human psyche. This film holds a very special place in my heart as one of the first true horror films. This film doesn't use a ton of gore or "jump" moments but it creates such a creepy atmosphere and a feeling of realism that it takes horror to a whole different level. The performance of Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance is the stuff of legend. From the moment Jacks family reaches the hotel we are treated to one of the best acting performance we've ever seen. The character of Jack Torrance is one that will stick with viewers long after they have seen this film. The scene of Jack axing through the bathroom room and shouting "here's Johnny" is etched in Hollywood stone. I don't think enough can be said about the director (Stanley Kubrick) and his vision of this film. The camera work of Kubrick following Danny on his big wheel really gave a different perspective and was truly groundbreaking. Several other scenes such as Jack backing Wendy up the stairs were shot using Steadicam which was seen as being difficult at the time but Mr. Kubrick pulled it off in stunning fashion. If you've never seen this film I suggest you watch it, maybe even twice. You will find yourself rewarded with one of the best acting performances ever seen and what's considered one of the best horror films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I love Stephen King, his novel "The Shining" just never really did anything for me. And as much as I love Kubrick, he can't really get me into it either. I mean, of course "The Shining" is a good movie. The cinematography is breath-taking (just check out the marvelous opening credit sequence), the acting is great and the multi-layeredness of the screenplay is perfect. But alas, it just doesn't move me. The elevator doors opening, the identical twins, the "REDRUM" scenes, I just don't find them as creepy as I should. That's kind of a problem, because the actual plot moves quite slow. Once Jack Nicholson (here cleverly named "Jack") finally turns crazy he sure as hell delivers, but it takes him a while to get there. The last half hour of this movie is the part most people remember, before that a lot of the scenes seem too stretched out and in some cases just plain redundant. "The Shining" is a classic, just not one I'm particularly fond of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As do most, I can clearly remember the first time I saw 'The Shining (1980).' I must have been thirteen or fourteen, and had just read Stephen King's novel. There was something cold and clinical about the film that really shook my spine; I could never quite put my finger on exactly why. Perhaps it was the drab colours, the detached camera-work, an overwhelming sense of apathy towards the characters' fate. Just recently, I took the opportunity to see 'The Shining' at the cinema (on a double-bill with 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)') and my appreciation for the film hasn't faded. An unhappily-married couple (Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall) are employed to caretake the Overlook Hotel over winter. As the long, bleak months progress, the Hotel's rich and dark history begins to manifest physically, and Jack's alcoholism and unstable psychological state begins to crumble into maniacal madness.Jack Nicholson's grotesquely over-the-top performance is terrifying, and hilarious, and insanely watchable; Kubrick encouraged Nicholson to overplay the role to its demented maximum. Not surprisingly, his favourite actor was James Cagney, who frequently eschewed realistic method acting in favour of a broiling intensity that suggested a time- bomb on the verge of exploding. Shelley Duvall, meanwhile, does a very good imitation of a complete mental breakdown (in fact, the director himself drove her to the brink with his endless insistence on re-takes, sometimes as many as 100). The exaggerated central performances are strangely at odds with John Alcott's detached cinematography, which surveys the carnage of Jack's mental breakdown with a disquieting aloofness. However, the camera doesn't merely act as an observer; Kubrick uses it to tell the story, his peculiar use of quick zooms serving to claustrophobically constrict the viewer's field of vision and emphasise an element of interest.Throughout the film, frequent (but irregularly-spaced) title cards signal the passage of time, as though counting down to a historical moment. Jack's plummet into insanity thus becomes set in stone, inevitable, and every preceding frame is plagued by the hand of Fate, gently nudging the man towards a predetermined end. In the film's ambiguous epilogue, Jack's image appears in a photograph dated July 4, 1921. Hence, even before we see Jack Torrance first enter the Overlook Hotel, he has already become a part of its history (just as the previous caretaker Charles Grady had formerly known the Hotel through his historical doppelganger Delbert Grady, the butler). Alternatively, these visions could be a manifestation of Jack's alcoholism ? note that, in every scene featuring a ghost, there is a mirror present. It can't be mere coincidence that Jack's axe-assault on a bathroom door was clearly inspired by a sequence in Victor Sjöström's 'Körkarlen (1921),' which concerns an alcoholic husband and father.</fullReview>

You are scared that whatever you are gonna say has been definitely said and you don't have time to read all those reviews to make sure you are writing something brand new.To cut the story short and to make it easy for those who have not watched it yet, one thousand something review is definitely definitely a very clear sign that the movie is a must see. You don't want to let a movie that has been seen by everybody else, do you? You love the idea of ghosts? does the idea of a vacant hotel which has rooms where a murder was committed attract you? Come on, it's a hunted hotel in a very cold place and nothing surrounds it but trees covered with stories of snow and a small family of parents and their little kid have to live in this hotel for months alone, and you don't feel the least tempted to watch?!One more final thing, the father is Jack Nicholson and the director is Kubrick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More an opaque gleam in Kubrick's eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick sounded a teaming to die for when announced in 1979. But King's straightforward horror premise has had to bear the burden of Kubrick's portentous cinematic self-importance. Still, he builds up the atmosphere pretty well at the beginning with those majestic helicopter shots of the Rockies, and of the lonely hotel beset by winter silence, given even more eerie dissonant resonance by Bela Bartok's music. The technical mastery, always Kubrick's forte, is there indoors, too. The immaculate camera-work (by John Alcott, who lensed 'Barry Lyndon'), with its severely symmetrical compositions and long flawless tracking shots, sets up the scenes superbly, especially when Nicholson meets or imagines the satanic bar-tender Lloyd.The problem is that as the story progresses it becomes worryingly clear that Kubrick has no firm idea of how to direct a horror film. When it comes to actually delivering the shock moments, all he can manage is a quick melodramatic zoom-in to try and startle up scenes that just fail to exude the frisson intended (the first appearance of the twin girls, the word 'Redrum' on the mirror, the ghostly guest who says "Great party!", or the clunking flashback images of the butchered twins). And was anyone sitting in the director's chair when Nicolson indulged his ludicrous, eye-rolling "Little pigs, little pigs" moment?Like virtually all of Kubrick films it's undeniably watchable. It's his most commercially successful film and, after shaky reviews, has gained a reputation as a genre milestone. Except it's really just an elaborate dead-end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With this many comments, it's doubtful if this one will ever be seen. The Shining, I believe, is one of the most terrifying movies ever made because it incorporates weirdness as well as a sense of physical and psychological threat. Yes, Wendy may be miscast; sure, she delivers her lines like she's reading them off a matchbook cover ("Over") But Jack Nicholson...holy cow! That lobotomy stare from Cuckoo's Nest, the claustrophobic feel to the whole thing. But my reason for writing this was to bring attention to something I never noticed in past viewings. The butler Grady was done before, although not in quite so threatening a manner, in the Spencer Tracy version of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. If Stephen King or Stanley Kubrick didn't have that movie in the back of their minds (right down to dialog "if I may be so bold as to suggest it, sir") I'll miss my guess. Seriously, check it out at your video store or Netflix, it virtually jumped out at me! The TV remake of this movie didn't even come close, and I've always preferred the Kubrick ending to "then everything blew up. The End", which, let's face it, is how most King novels wind up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel "The Shining" is generally considered one of the best horror films of all time. The film is a somewhat loose adaptation and one that takes full advantage of the screen's strengths.The story revolves around Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a struggling writer who takes the job of winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. He relocates there for the winter with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and child (Danny Lloyd) but before long they begin to experience strange phenomena.Stephen King was disappointed with the film mainly because Kubrick &amp; co-screenwriter Diane Johnson reworked his original story. In particular, King's main themes were not given the same precedence in the film. I feel that the themes are still there but perhaps they wouldn't be as apparent if I wasn't familiar with the novel. Apart from thematic content, the main changes from the book seem to have been merely practical considerations. Ultimately, I find Kubrick's vision more interesting due to the ambiguity of the plot.King wasn't pleased with the casting either. He thought that the actors didn't suit the characters that he had written. However, for the characters as Kubrick envisioned them, I think that the actors were well chosen. Jack Nicholson delivers a typically fine performance while Shelley Duvall provides the other half of an effective pairing. Child actor Danny Lloyd holds his own as well while Scatman Crothers contributes a memorable supporting performance.Kubrick's direction is superb, as usual, and the cinematography is attractive throughout. The music comes from a few different sources and does a fine job of setting the film's tone.Ultimately, "The Shining" is a horror film that delivers in both scares and technical prowess. The film's ambiguity makes it thought-provoking, though the screenplay is perhaps just a bit sloppy as well. Definitely a film worth watching, even if you're not really a fan of horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Jack Nicholson's defining performances proves menacing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you probably know, Stanley Kubrick's horror classic, The Shining, is a rewrite of a Stephen King story that helped define the modern psychological thriller genre. The strong direction and acting gives the film broad appeal, but it is too harrowing for squeamish audiences. Stanley Kubrick is a master at getting the most out of his screenplays, sets and actors. The riveting combination of the haunted Overlook Hotel and Jack Nicholson's powerhouse performance as Jack Torrance descending into violent insanity seems eerily authentic. But the film is far from perfect in conception and execution. It is held back by pacing problems, disconnects in the narrative flow (King was very upset that Kubrick strayed from the novel) and bizarre, often corny visions that only rarely raised the scare factor. Nevertheless, the scenes focusing on Torrance's inner demons and spiralling insanity are brilliant. It is hard to imagine any other actor but Nicholson being able to fit in this roll with such conviction and raw power. Beginning with Jack's job interview at the secluded Overlook Hotel in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, The Shining quickly reveals glimpses into its dark and supernatural theme. The hotel must close down every winter due to blizzard conditions and its isolated location renders any inhabitants snowbound. A previous caretaker went crazy from "cabin fever" and murdered his wife and two daughters. But Jack assures hotel manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) that being snowbound all winter is just the kind of peace and quiet needed to "write the great American novel". Meanwhile, back home, Jack's son Danny (Danny Lloyd), who experiences paranormal images and premonitions, has horrible visions of the Overlook and blacks out. Jack returns triumphant from his job interview only to find his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) questioning the wisdom of moving to the Overlook with their son in a fragile mental state, but Jack grows aggravated and dismisses her concerns.After arriving at the hotel, Danny is befriended by the hotel chef, Dick Hallorann (Scattman Crothers). The cook has a talent for psychic abilities similar to Danny's. He tells the young boy to not be afraid--that some bad things happened long ago at the hotel. Hollorann explains that all places--especially old places--have a "shine" to them. "The shining" is the residual aura of accumulated experiences. But the Overlook has had a more violent history than most places, and when Danny asks about room 237 from his visions, Hallorann becomes visibly upset. He sternly warns Danny to stay away from the room. The guests already gone, Hallorann and the Overlook management depart, leaving Jack, Wendy and Danny to settle in for the long winter ahead.As the weeks pass, Jack becomes increasingly psychotic. He can't sleep and seems irritable and incommunicative. He spends his time wandering the hotel's hallways and working on his manuscript. One day, Danny is coaxed into room 237 by supernatural powers and his own curiosity. This immediately sets off a series of events and Jack goes from bad to worse. Wendy hears him screaming. He wakes up disoriented and disturbed, complaining that he had a horrible nightmare in which he chopped her and Danny to pieces. Before Wendy can react, Danny appears with his shirt ripped and bruise marks around his neck. Wendy rushes to her son, inspects his injuries and accuses Jack of attacking the boy since the hotel is empty except for the three of them.As Jack's psychosis becomes full blown, he has hallucinations of interacting with staff at the hotel. The interactions with former caretaker Delbert Grady (Philip Stone) become all too real as Grady calmly yet forcefully leads Jack to the unavoidable conclusion that he must act against his wife and son. Once Jack's murderous intentions become clear, the film cycles through spooky scenes with Nicholson's gleaming eyes and wicked grin as he bellows for his family. Kubrick's vision is manifest with critical impact as the film reaches its climax. Some of the images work, such as the unabated flowing of blood down the hotel's elevator shaft and flooding out into the lobby, representing the evil spirit and bloody history of the place. Some images don't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most spectacular camera work ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the masterpieces of one of the greatest directors. Based on Stephen king's novel of the same name it tells the story of the family of the caretaker of overlook hotel. The Overlook hotel, built on an Indian burial ground during its ling history has seen a lot and has a lot to tell. The hotel is closed during winter . Now Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family must fight loneliness and its effects in this huge hotel . The story is not told through narration or dialogues but progresses through moving camera . The camera moves across the long corridors of the hotel revealing step by step what gruesome history lies buried in those empty rooms of the hotel . The eerie music just carries along this effect with it. Time slowly drives jack Torrance crazy and his psychotic son starts having visions. The sets are amazing and needless to say HUGE . One of the most technically sound movie of all times</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a very good movie. Its one of the most effectively scary movies I've seen. It is probably not good for kid's under 15 though (mostly for a couple scenes with corpses but largely for the bad parenting illustrated in this film) This movie is probably the best horror of it's decade and arguably Jack Nicholson's most convincing role. He was so scary in this movie. He looked convincingly insane; more and more as the movie progressed. Danny Lloyd's acting as Jack Torrance's son was also very good and was very effective at playing a disturbed little boy. Shelly Duvall was pretty good too as Jack's wife, her acting was just a little too hysterical sometimes. (but she at least did not overdue it on the screaming as some actresses do in horror's). This movie was filmed in a beautiful location. The Hotel was the nicest one I have ever seen. This is the first Stanley Kubrick film I have ever seen and I must say I am very impressed with his directing. The Shining is one of the greatest horror movie I've ever seen. Its a good movie period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crawls under your skin... and stays there. A psychological horror masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining, a highly atmospheric psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick, was released in 1980 to negative reviews. Now, as of the 2000's it has been re-reviewed and analyzed and is now considered a masterpiece of film making. Kubrick was ahead of his and our time. He was an incredibly smart man who really knew how to make films. The symbolism, the imagery, the atmosphere and the acting are what make The Shining so memorable.With references and clues to child abuse, alcoholism, Native Americans and dreams this film succeeds in disturbing you without being what it was marketed as. Its surface narrative is a ghost story. But if you delve deeper into the story there is so much symbolism and cryptic messages that make this more than just a ghost story. It's a story about America and its violent past. It's a story about a violent man with serious psychological problems.Now everyone loves Jack Nicholson don't they? Jack is a fine method actor who, 42 at the time of the film, was one of Hollywoods biggest stars. Stanley Kubrick couldn't of cast anyone better than Nicholson for the role of Jack Torrance. His descent into madness is truly masterful. One minute he is violent and explodes with anger, the next he can be hallucinating and hysterical. His over-the-top scenes are what fans didn't really like. But what if you are psychologically messed up? Can't you hysterical and crazy as well as violent and disturbing? That is what makes Jack Torrance so memorable in the film. This isn't a Hollywood film. This is a surreal mystery tale with a ghost story as its surface narrative. Jack's descent into madness can be analyzed a million times. Was it cabin fever? Was he a man who truly hated his family? Was he a violent racist? Or were there really ghosts? No one will ever know for sure.Shelley Duvall always gets the bad press for her role as Jack's needy wife Wendy. Her role is very demanding. She is verbally abused by Jack, she is constantly in a state of hysteria, she cries a lot in the film and much more. You can tell Shelley put her heart and soul into this role. This isn't a page for page adaption of Stephen King's novel. Stanley Kubrick took ideas and put his own unique vision onto the screen. In the book, Wendy is strong and determined but in the film, Wendy is abused and needy. But Shelley should get thumbs up for her performance as Wendy.The atmosphere of The Shining is incredible. With the perfect set design (can you believe the Overlook Hotel is really a set!?), the long, tall hallways and rooms, the black and white photos all over the hotel, the disturbingly colourful rooms and the snow provide a chilling and mysterious atmosphere. The slow tracking shots takes us on a journey through this hotel with Jack and his family.It is a journey you don't want to miss. The Shining is the most atmospheric and psychologically terrifying thriller you will ever see. With a loose story you can discuss this for days without getting bored and plenty of surreal and disturbing images that will stay in your head for the rest of your life. Now go and watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am impressed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was originally going to give this a slightly lower score, but it really is a very good movie. But let's be serious; as a book-to-movie adaptation this pretty much fails, as it takes an entirely different view of the story as compared to Stephen King's original novel. For the first half hour or forty five minutes of this movie, you will be questioning why certain things were not added, why certain things were changed and why everything else, but by the end you'll be hooked because this movie knows how to pull the scares with efficiency and great measure.The problems are as follows: there is barely any tension in the beginning of the film, no descent into madness or inner conflict with the Jack character. Where was that? This movie just skipped all of that and sort of jumped right into things, and while I enjoyed it, it could have been done better than it was. It didn't make any sense the way it was here, and the character development was pretty much a zero for every character. The first half of this film just sort of speeds by without really setting much up ? don't get me wrong, this is great for what it is, but it would have been a real masterpiece if we had been given a slightly altered beginning that showed us more of Jack's "normal" side, given us a reason to doubt his spiral into madness later on. And I don't think this movie really elaborated on the whole "shining" concept much, which is silly considering the name of the movie, but whatever.We really do have to work with what we're given, and honestly, this really is a horror classic when you get down to bare bones. I mean, once things really kick off at about the hour and a half mark, the movie takes no prisoners. And by the two hour mark, it doesn't matter whether or not you want to see stuff from the book on the screen, because Stanley f*cking Kubrick is SCARING THE HELL OUT OF YOU. Seriously, the last half hour of this movie rules, everything about it does.Another great thing about this movie? Jack Nicholson. At first I thought he didn't fit the part of Jack Torrance, but really that was just because of the inconsistent pacing I mentioned above. No. Jack Nicholson's tremendous screen presence is one of the best things about this. He's just so entertaining to watch, even when he over-emotes things a bit. He does a really great job, even just playing "himself."One thing this whole movie does really well is suspense and tension, with ruthless camera angles creating a horrific portrait that you will not forget. This movie might be lacking as an adaptation, but that's the thing I've been learning lately with these things: you can't have a great movie that is also a book adaptation, because they're just two different mediums that require different things in order to be good. Yeah, Kubrick changed a lot here, but what came out in the end was really a very successful and well made horror movie that succeeds at what it is trying to do. The Shining is a blood-soaked horror classic that you won't want to miss if you haven't seen it already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Shining"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I just got done reading the IMDb FAQ page on Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror-thriller "The Shining," and I still don't have a clue about what to really make of this film's events. I just see it as a brilliant example of a pure and terrifying descent into madness that is heavily influenced by malevolent supernatural forces.An adaptation, or should I say, re-imagining of the Stephen King novel from which it's based, "The Shining," to me, is a film that is very open to all sorts of interpretations, which also makes it hard to categorize as a straight-forward horror film even though it seems to throw in some haunted house theatrics as well. But make no mistake, this is one of the most eerie and unsettling horror films ever made.The film is set at the Overlook Hotel in Colorado, where Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their psychic young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) have arrived to serve as the winter caretakers until the Spring the next year. The Overlook's beauty hides a dark and horrific history that eventually comes to claim the sanity of Jack, and the troubled man comes to act upon the supernatural forces at work in the hotel that are driving him into complete madness."The Shining" is an epic horror film, perhaps the first (according to some). Nicholson is loony from the start; he's not some well-meaning family man who succumbs to evil supernatural forces at work in a haunted hotel. It's a trademark performance from one of the most skilled actors to ever work in Hollywood. His acting, as usual, is over-the-top and menacing, but once he begins to act upon his own murderous impulses and begin terrorizing his family, it's all the more greater because of Nicholson's sense of timing. His trademark line - "Here's Johnny!" - is one of the most famous and memorable in the horror genre, and cinema history, in general.Kubrick, a master craftsman who co-wrote the film with novelist Diane Johnson (after first rejecting a script from Stephen King himself), sets up the film brilliantly so that it all goes downhill from the get-go, especially with its eerie opening sequences and musical score. The Overlook is vast and labyrinthic, and we get a sense of just how vast and labyrinthic it is through the various - not to mention, ingenious and groundbreaking - unbroken steadi-cam tracking shots. I also find it hilarious, and an example of how in-control Kubrick was of the material, of the numerous takes he had his actors make during this film. This sort of technique can be overly demanding on actors and crew members, but I see it as a master filmmaker demanding nothing but perfection from his actors and crew members, and the hell he puts everyone through really pays off in the end. (James Cameron, my personal favorite director, has the exact same reputation.)Kubrick also has a real taste for horror imagery: he's able to make simple human figures - a beautiful nude woman in a bathtub, for instance - instantly become an object of pure, unbridled horror in one of the film's most infamous and unsettling sequences. It may seem gratuitous, even voyeuristic for some tastes, but the way Kubrick handles it is pure genius. There's also those famous shots of blood pouring out of an elevator, and lastly there are the two twin girls - who are supposed to be objects of innocence due to their age - that come to haunt the Torrances' young son Danny in some of the film's most frightening sequences."The Shining" probably ranks third on my list of Kubrick films, behind "Full Metal Jacket" (1987) - often cited as his weakest for some reason - and "A Clockwork Orange" (1971). "The Shining" is an example of a film adaptation of a famous book that actually supersedes its source material and becomes something else entirely. King says he dislikes Kubrick's film, because it strips away many of the finer elements of his novel (King would later have greater say in the 1997 made-for-TV movie). But "The Shining" is one of the damn finest, most well-made and scariest horror films I've ever seen, a perfect example of a master filmmaker at the top of his craft.10/10P.S.: This movie has also been parodied to death. It was parodied in one of the "The Simpsons Treehouse of Horrors" episodes as "The Shinning."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Modern horror movies just don't live up to the good ol' days, and I say this as a 90'er. Whenever I see a modern horror movie, I can always know to expect gore and screams; this one does it with very limited amounts of both. It kept me up at night, and I'm the type who likes to go to sleep with their lights off completely; even after watching a horror movie. Any actor attempting to rival the performance of Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall would have a formidable task before them, and being relatively young, this film introduced me to Nicholson, who would become one of my most admired actors; not for his looks, but his sheer skills. The background music and editing is excellent, and my friends screamed when all the music built up to was a black screen, white font 'THURSDAY'. The mood and atmosphere is top-notch, and I can enjoy it over and over again (in fact, I've watched it three times in two years) and still be surprised at the twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's May 5th 2009 and I've just seen the Shining for the first time! I say that because it's a classic and I love horror movies, so it's a crime that I've taken so long to see it. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it had 1 scene that didn't make no sense what so ever and it was a little too long. Also, being a black man, I almost took offense to a scene where someone was referred to as a "nigger" 3 times! But I realized that the derogatory remark was made from a ghost in 1921 (a time where Blacks were outright called "niggers"). I don't know if Kubrick was a racist ass, but I would've felt a little better if he'd used the term "colored" or not at all. However there are 2 black actors in the movie, so I don't think they would willingly work with a blatant racist. A lot of the beginning could have been chopped out in my opinion. But nevertheless, excellent work from Kubrick. If u are a Jack Nicholson fan, u're gonna love love him in this one! He truly brings "insanity" to realistic definition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The big Kubrick with Nicholson (9.3)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shinning left the unavoidable mark of the teacher of all the goods in the tray of entrance of the terror cinema. Until that day, the movies of this noble family possessed two inherent characteristics to her: the effect blows and the dimness. With The Splendor, Kubrick concluded the gender and it took it forward a step. It didn't look for the public's empathy in the face of Jack's existential adversity, but rather it prefixed the obvious resource of the novel of St. King to cook a gradual increase of the tension distancing the spectator of the acts of the great Nicholson emotionally. That was one of their biggest successes. The second, and that it puts title to this critic, the revolution that supposed to scare to the respectable one with more volts of light than a concert of the Village People was. It was a pleasant surprise to check in meats like a moonstruck one hitting a ball against a wall he/she gave more fear than any left zombie of ultratumba. The light showed us a mind perturbed with the same precision that the scalpel of a surgeon. And the sound terrified us: the wheels of a tricycle have more than enough wood and moqueta, the knocking of the ball against floor and wall, the keys of the typewriter even, how not to comment it, the great Verónica's bent voice Forqué creaking in a sublime way with each appearance in screen. What does it produce more fear? To listen to peal against the wall or against some keys the solitary blows of a psychopath in crescendo minute to minute... or to contemplate to a malote between darkness and dress of black with a hook in the hand? Personally it scares me twice as much the first thing, since it brings near me to their reality in a clear and brilliant way. Nobody has been able to depict those better "labyrinths" of the human mind as Kubrick in this stranger taken a bath movie of light and wrapped up by their sound, amen of giving us technical prowesses as that travelling level with floor that has gone by characteristic merit to head one of the best sequences in the cinema of all the times. TEACHER WORKS "Danny, exists places that are as people, some they glow, and other no."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film made good by Lack Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Stanley Kubrik is a brilliant director, he took Stephen King's masterpiece and reduced it to a horror film with good cinematography and one good performance. In the novel the main character is a good man with many personal demons, but The Overlook Hotel is the entity which is evil and influences the main character. In the movie Stanley Kubrik makes it look like Nicholson's character is evil from the very beginning and that the hotel has hardly anything to do with his madness. Another problem with the film is that the role of the wife is horribly miscast. In the book she is desperate to protect her son and terrified by the transformation in her husband. In the film she comes across as some idiot wielding a knife, and is neither capable enough of protecting herself or her son. The ending of the movie is completely wrong, and conveys none of the sacrifice he finally commits at the end of the novel. Substituting the main character blowing up the Overlook and himself with Nicholson freezing to death in the maze was hardly right, and left me completely unsatisfied.</fullReview>

Of course, it's got all the great things that make horror films fun to watch, but it goes to the next level. I don't get scared easily, but this is the only horror film that ever kept me up at night.

Now this is his horror movie! It's gotta be scary!2. MUSIC The Shining's score is indeed the best score in history, not one of the best, it is the best! Music to film is like colour to picture, yet, in The Shining, music is even more vital, because it is an invisible actor. It plays all of the ghosts in the movie. So deeply powerful, petrifying!3. SETTING Just imagine... Freezing winter with heavy snow, isolated huge old house, maze of rooms in the house...4. CASTING This should never be ignored. Casting for Danny and his mom is just perfect.5. CINEMATOGRAPHY AND EDITING ... ...(about this, speechless I am)6. UNKNOWNNESS Many remain wondering about the idea and theme of The Shining after seeing it for many times. They guess and argue. There has come out so many explanations now, some of which are truly imaginary! But regardless of how much people guess and argue, the movie is still like a mystery. Yet it is just the unknownness that has made it so intriguing, so enchanting, so...horrifying... Exactly like the director himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a very special movie for me because it was the very first Stanley Kubrick movie I watched. Adapted from a Stephen King novel it tells the story of a couple(Jack Nicolson and Shelley Duvall) and their young son(Danny Lloyd) who move to a hotel when Jack Nicolson gets a job as a caretaker. The hotel however has a horrific past,years ago it was the scene for a grisly murder where a man murdered his two daugthers. The caretaker's son happens to possess 'The Shining, which is a gift of second sight. Even before they move in the son starts to have horrific visions of the the murder that occurred years ago. Very soon Jack Nicolson starts to get possessed by the spirit of the man, the very first example of that is in the scene where he says to his wife that he has a feeling that he has been to the hotel before when he knows he hasn't. Add to that the fact that to save costs the hotel is shut for most of the year and you have a superbly compelling horror movie. In the superb climax Jack Nicolson attempts to murder both his wife and his son. The star of the show has to Jack Nicolson who was simply phenomenal, in fact I would call it his best performance I have seen. His transition from a mild mannered man to an axe wielding psycho was simply wonderful. The stately pace works very well in it's favour. The Shining is one of my top 5 horror movies ever made and is highly recommended by me to tose who haven't seen it.</fullReview>

I can now see how this movie launched his career. The actress playing Wendy Torrance played her role pretty well, as a pure hearted mother. The actor playing Danny Torrance did a great job as well.The storytelling was amazing. You actually will feel sorry for Wendy and Danny. Jack was a different story...in a way I felt sorry for him, but there was no stopping him, and you'll find out why.In conclusion, this movie didn't need amazing special effects, lots of gore, or cheap scares and shocks.

		<fullReview>In a way, Stanley Kubricks 16 films all represent a package of cinema art that will seldom be equaled by many film makers in a lifetime of work. This film does a credible job bringing master writer Stephen Kings novel into a film.Though a lot of folks find this very disturbing, I find it is not quite as disturbing to me as Clockwork Orange which is the ultimate disturbing work from Kubrick on film. Still, this one does a pretty good job of being almost as horrible.This film is one of many now where Jack Nicolson provides a fine performance. No doubt that this film is the best film on Shelly Duvals resume, as this is by far her best role and the best film she has ever done.Kubrick always seems to be trying to top himself with each film he ever made, and always seems to find a different direction to go in. Kubrick not only often makes the view think or feel what he want them to feel, but he often plays his audience like a fine musician plays their audience.</fullReview>

The smooth transitions, the beautiful composition of symmetric screen settings, the marvel of the Steadicam, which enables us to follow Danny's tricycle, floating on the Overlook corridors. And the images which are imprinted on the mind of the viewer even more effectively than the story itself, telling a story of their own. These are the images you think of when you talk about 'The Shining'.Moreover, there is always a mention of Stanley Kubrick's strict and demanding attitude towards Shelley Duvall during the making of this film in documentaries. It must be Kubrick's technique to get her in to the mood to play that particular part, and the kind of feeling she needs to be experiencing in order to respond according to that of the character. This is mere speculation, but you never know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is a movie that I like better and appreciate more over the years since I am not really a horror film or Stephen King fan. On the first viewing the shock value is much higher, like riding on a new roller coaster for the first time. However, even without the shocking gimmicks being a surprise, you still have a great movie.I am a Stanley Kubrick fan because of his innovation, and his ability to deliver something special and fresh with few or no disappointments. His movies leave you knowing that you have not seen nearly everything interesting there is to see about a place, but enough to satisfy the story. The locations are places I want to experience.Jack Nicholson, and the rest of the cast are very good. The great location looked realistic even at the studio, and is based on one of my favorite locations, Colorado.The first time I saw this movie, I was not that excited by the Stephen King style "blood bath", and other horror show gimmicks. Once you see it, the movie becomes more about what caused Jack to flip out, just "cabin fever" or a form of demonic possession that has everyone seeing things.It is nice to have the story end on something of a positive note, but like the Stephen King stories I have seen there is plenty of pain and carnage along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson, Stanley Kubrick and Stephen King, what a team, what a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to watch a really mind-messing horror, this is for you. This is my number one favourite horror film. Jack Nicholson fitted the part of Jack Torrence extremely well. Atmosphere was extremely tense and raises the tension beautifully.This is also my number one horror novel. There are differences to the book and film, but I really liked the differences. For example, the two Grady girls and the ocean of blood from the elevator. It would have been cool if they added the animal hedges, which was from the book. I understand that they couldn't do it because they did't have the technology available at the time.I also thought the music fitted really well. It was strange and gives you an uncomfortable feeling. What a genius idea for Jack Nicholson to bring one of the most famous quotes of all time, which is "here's Johnny".One thing that I was disappointed about was Shelley Duvall, because her character in the book was tough, argumentative and cool. But in the film she came across as was pathetic and rather hysterical which got really annoying!Other than that, I think its an amazing film, I really recommend it. Jack, Stephen and Stanley really make a great team!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...that's probably one of the best written lines ever. Jach Nicholson, my favorite actor of all time, does an incredible job as the creepy Jack Torrance in this amazing film.I first saw The Shining when I was about 10. Then, of course, it scared the !@%&amp; out of me, and it still does. Since then I think I've seen it more than 10 times. Even though this film is 28 years old, it's more terrifying and beautiful than any horror movie today. As an avid fan of Stephen King, I've, of course, read The Shining. The books is far better than the film, but that don't mean Cubricks version, which is different compared to the book, is a bad film. On the contrary, it's actually one of the best horror movies ever made. Cubrick's fantastic talent as a director gives us not just a horror movie, but also a piece of art. He has shown before that he truly is a master, especially in 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.Danny Lloyd and Shelley Duvall, as well as Scatman Crothers did some really good job in this film. I don't understand why Jach Nicholson didn't win an Oscar as Jack Torrance, he really deserved it. I especially love that part in the film when he threatens Wendy, as they walk up the stairs - "I'm not gonna hurt ya, I'm just gonna bash your brains in. Bash them right the !@&amp;? in". Throughout the whole film I sit there, almost paralyzed. This truly is one of the best movies ever made, and it SHOULD be in your DVD-collection.I give it 10/10.</fullReview>

This whole film is fantastic the opening music is very fitting and jack Nicholson played a memorable role as jack Torrance, i don't know who the butler bloke was who persuaded jack to kill his wife but he did the part very well the ending in the maze is brilliant the perfect setting for the chase between jack and his son. I don't of many Kubrick films except the ones everyone has seen or heard of (clockwork orange,full metal jacket and this). There is only one thing I'm really annoyed about that involves this film and thats those idiots at the golden rasberry awards who gave Shelly duvall worst actor and Stanley Kubrick worst director first why put them as an option and why the hell did people vote for them whoever voted should be found and put in that hotel.

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kurbricks finest moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kurbrick is among one of the most brilliant and influential directors of all time, and The Shining is his perfect example. Mixing high calibre acting, bone chilling cinematography and searingly elegant directing Stanley Kurbrick weaves a story so mesmerising and unforgettable that it would be impossible to not come out feeling horrified. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall give perfect performances that at times are so eerie and tense that you could definitely consider them Oscar nominees. Each haunting stage Nicholson goes through throughout the film becomes a tour De Force. From a well mannered and well respected person through to a delusional and utterly insane maniac Nicholson gives genius as well as wit.The Shining to conclude is Kurbricks finest moment. Filled both with grand horror, searingly well crafted acting, a powerful and imaginative story and a work of genuine powerful film-making.</fullReview>

The film is beautifully shot...the hotel looks both inciting and forbidding. The score is memorable. Performances by the cast is commendable. Of particular note is the boy who plays Danny and Scatman Crothers as Mr. Ullman. The mothers performance is effective enough to induce sympathy from the audience. Elsewhere, Jack Nicholson is brilliant in one of his most recognizable roles. He is both hilarious and terrifying at the same time. Overall, The Shining is a decent adaption that is pulled down by its unfaithfulness to its source material. Though its not a Kubrick masterpiece, the film is worth seeing for Nicholson's performance and cinematography alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome, but to be honest, I didn't get it. The stirring cinematic performances although brilliant, but they seem to have no purpose. For instance, how does Jack's image wind up in that picture from the 20's? What is the symbolism behind the bartender and the twins? We never really know are they his hallucinations, his past, his present, are they ghosts, is HE a ghost? Why is there a fountain of blood (which they had to do in one take by the way, talk about the work of all that for a shot that makes no sense)? Although cabin fever is a clear component of the fear factor of this movie besides human instinct there really is no enemy. Also, what is up with little Danny talking with his finger, who is Frank? This is portrayed neither as just a little kid doing this because he's weird, nor as a mental illness, nor as him being possessed or being a ghost or any of the above but an odd mixture of the three. And who was murdered? Was it Jack? Is Jack a reincarnation of the murderer? Or, is Jack just crazy? Why does Frank try to warn them of Red Rum when there is no "Murder" to warn them of? Everyone I've spoken to about this film has raved of its genius, without however being specific. When I admit that I didn't understand the plot exactly, the person usually exclaims with great relief that they didn't get it either. If no one gets it, and we're all pretending we understand it...what is the point of the movie? Movie-goers it is time to come out of the fear closet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the very few movies I'd recommend a friend to see at any cost.We witness the degradation of an author's mental condition while he is taking a few months off to live in a hotel, with his wife and son, where he'd get inspiration for his next novel.The master point in the movie, in my point of view, is how the director and great actor Jack Nicholson manage to gradually show the condition of the main character (played by Nicholson) going definitely wrong. We start with a very common writer who turns out to become totally insane by the end of the movie, but all that takes place in the hotel which somehow seems to be haunted by dead souls.Excellent acting, chilling atmosphere in a perfect scenery makes you feel quite lonely and stuck with the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how the Shining shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1980 was a year where timeless classic 80's teenage flicks began. But the Shining gave horror a big smack on the back. The Shining was a film depicted by Stanley Kubrick by using music, acting, and pure terror to frighten the audience. Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance. Shelley Duvall is Wendy Torrance. And an innocent little boy, Danny Torrance. Jack Nicholson is a father, whose mind can go nuts and claustrophobic when in the right situation. He can be a loving, optimistic, father. And he can be a crazy man who just loves causing destruction and terror to those around him. The beginning you can say went differently from other movies. Unlike The Exorcist, which is another timeless horror classic, it went smoothly, and didn't keep you close to your T.V. waiting for something to happen. A family goes to a hotel to watch it and take care of it during the long, cold winter. Nothing to do, but to stay inside and try to relax yourself from everything. One of the main focuses of the hotel is the little son Danny. He's unnatural, in a way where he sees things that no one else can see. He has the Shining. And he's natural, for having his imaginary friend, Tony, who is his index finger. A family going to a hotel, normal, nothing wrong there. You walk around, exploring the hotel, and read, watch T.V., run around the hallways and confront two English girls. The Shining gives that tremendously crazy heartbeat that makes you nervous and frightened. This film will frighten you, for many reasons, and you may never want to spend another night at a fancy hotel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Torrance family...Jack (Jack Nicholson), Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) go to take care of the Overlook Motel during the winter months when its closed.As soon as everyone else leaves, Jack starts slowly descending into madness, and Danny starts seeing visions of dead twins. Danny also has an ability called "the shining" by cook Hallorann (Scatman Crothers), who also has the ability, which allows them to communicate without speaking.As Jack delves into madness, he starts to hate his family, and soon leads him to try and kill them.Based on a Stephen King novel and directed by one of the world's best directors (Stanley Kubrick), "The Shining" is listed as one of the best horror movies ever made, with good reason. The movie freaks you out! From Kubrick's stunning directing to the camera (how it shows the characters in the background, making the hotel look like one large evil place), to the music, to the sounds (like when Danny is riding on his little bike through the motel, hearing it run across the wooden floors, tiles, and carpet), everything about this film is just spectacular. And no surprise since it came from perpetual perfectionist Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In general, i don't particularly like horror movies, they are cheesy, dumb and make it extroadinarily gory to make up for the awful acting and dreadful directing. However this on the other hand, is something special, it really shines through. I saw Stanley Kubrick on the cover so i thought it's got to be worth a watch. I'm so glad i did, it is in my top ten list of greatest movies for it's sheer brilliance. It center's around a family consisting of a writer named Jack Torrence (played by the fantastic Jack Nicholson), his wife named Wendy Torrence and their son Danny Torrence. Their job is just to look after the hotel during the winter season. Jack Torrence, a struggling writer seems to be getting more insane as the days go by from either writers block or it could be something in the house doing it. That's the eary feeling your left with at the end, there is evidence to support the hotel doing it but also evidence to support it was of his own decent. Stanley Kubrick really couldn't be more of a genius with a camera, i mean just the unnerving shot of the camera following the children just a foot behind so when he turns each corner you don't know whats coming next and in one particular scene, whats next sends a chill down my back. Just a brilliantly crafted movie, Jack Nicholson is sublime in it, but credit goes to the location, the huge rooms give an eary feeling of not knowing whats in their and that anything could be behind those huge pillars. The humongous maze outside gives a cat and mouse feel to it during the chase and the fear that the next turn could be a dead end for Danny. Ingenious, loved it 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining is a creepy, zany, and overall great horror film from the 80's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply enough, "The Shining" exceeds everything that makes a good horror film. It is very cheesy, an abundance of memorable scenes throughout the film, great humor and it's scary! The film doesn't have a cast of great actors, but "Jack Nicholson" gives a very zany performance as Jack Torrence.Is this Oscar material acting, production values, directing, etc.? No, I don't think it deserved any awards that great, nor does it deserve criticism or speculation that great, but it is a very enjoyable and memorable horror film that contributes heavily to pop culture and the horror genre.The movie begins as the Torrence family moves to an isolated hotel, where the father soon becomes possessed by a former-guests ghost to kill his family. While his son Danny has visions from the past and future relating to the hotel. These visions are both creepily effective and some of the most memorable scenes in the movie.The film is both a psychological thriller as much as it is a horror. I can't say this is one of Stanley Kubrick's best pieces of work, but it is still one hell of a horror film, even today. If you're a horror fan you probably haven't missed out on "The Shining", because it has been discussed, spoofed and referenced so much in pop culture for you not to have seen it, or at least heard about it. Whether you are or are not a horror fan, like cheesy movies that still have decent production values or just like horror movies, "The Shining" is definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick Takes His Vision of the Horror Genre and Makes it Unforgettably His Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick was far more of a visionary in every way of the word. Despite however avant-garde and controversial his movies may have been, they have always had an inexplicable touch, a true mark of a gracefulness and greatness of a devoted man's lifelong work. No matter what genre of movie he has delved into, he without exception has bought unforeseen creativity, thoughtfulness, and honesty into it, never bearing what others thought of his work and not moving just to please some demographic or publisher, and has become endlessly influential to ambitious film makers young and old.It is without surprise then that Mr. Kubrick can easily make the horror genre his own with The Shining, and be able to do with only a single attempt something most NEVER could. What follows in the movie is 142 minutes of jaw-dropping imagery and truly terrifying and bewildering moments that have yet to be paralleled in their context and overall fear factor.The story itself is loosely based off of Stephen King's novel of the same name, and concerns writer Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson), who decides to take up a job as a caretaker in the massive and elegant Overlook Hotel during its off season, and also take his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall), and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) along while he tries to also get some time to relieve his writer's block and rest. The hotel is nice and cozy enough for more than the whole family, but it has a dark history. And Jack starts to soon find he might be as alone as he thinks , and he might not so new to this strange place...or is he? And as the happenings around the hotel grow all the more bizarre and creepy, what will befall him and his family? The story relentlessly keeps building up to its epic and ever famous climax, and is ending will keep you thinking for a long time after. The entire story may even be enough for you to wonder about for a very long time. Unlike Stephen King's story, nothing is explained and everything is only as we see it. Just the fact that you see so much and are never given an explanation, and you know you never will get one, is enough of a horror in its own. All 3 main characters, including the support character Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers)are all that are seen for the very large bulk of the film (that is besides the numerous happenings), and are all excellently portrayed by their respective actors. Kubrick really did know how to put his actors to work, and this is nowhere more true than with Jack Nicholson's performance. This is safely one of the very best of this industrious actor's career, and it is truly amazing what he does with his complex character. Jack seems to represent the sum of the darkness that is hidden deep within ourselves. What does he truly think under his vise? Where does he truly belong? What does he see? What is really there? Is there a difference? It is enough to drive anyone mad. It might be even more accurate to say that everything somehow resolves around Danny. What does he see? How does he know what he knows? Who is his Anthony, and what is he really? What do he and Hollorann share? What can it mean to truly Shine, and how is it different from the darkness? Between Danny and Jack, Wendy might seem very confused in the mix, and her confusion can be more than enough to make her feel like an unwilling prisoner of something much larger than herself, and of a struggle that she should never be a part of. And indeed, whether this is a pure haunted house story, or a psychological horror mix, the ride is not something I think you would want to take soon.As usual, Kubrick's technical work in , his film is groundbreaking and beautiful. In typical style, any detail, scene, angle, name, number, or even background is very important, both obscurely and obviously, and especially for a film of this essence. Despite however obsessive Kubrick has been convicted of being, it is here where that obsessiveness truly works and is even necessary. The cinematography here is innovative, especially the lighting and set design, and they only add to the vast scope and isolation that the movie is meant to convey, and the subtle and unknowable horror that will leave your head spinning and still very wary on distant nights alone. The all punches camera shots are so flowing to every scene and, and the editing works so well with the horror aspect you may find yourself feeling everything the characters themselves feel: completely afraid, alone, and in the dark. As with the horror parts themselves, which are so out of the blue, and so inexplicable that you may never find an equal to what they can do to you. Just imagine a elevator opening to a massive river of blood, or a head splitting "encounter" in the bathroom. Kubrick will help you redefine what horror really means for you.As what Psycho, The Exorcist, Jaws, and Halloween did for the horror genre, The Shining has helped very much shaped everything that it is thought of today. With all of its lurings, technical excellence, and unforgettable chain of events, it is no less deserving of all the publicity and acclaim this film has gotten over the years. Kubrick's films all too often are very obscure in the public eye, and with this being arguably his most ambitious and popular of his latter day work, I'm sure he would be very proud to be strongly remembered for this defining moment in the genre (nah, probably wouldn't). Don't be surprised if you have any doubts of ever wandering around a vacant hotel, or any building ever again.</fullReview>

I find it a bit of a guilty pleasure to uncover all of its enticing secrets and hidden messages. One of my favorites is that in the main title sequence, when Jack is driving the yellow VW, The only other cars on the road are either heading in the other direction or they are stalled. When i pointed this out to someone they said 'maybe its because Kubrick was trying to show that Jack is on a road that will end in tragedy.' (I.E.- The overlook in the beginning at the end of the literal road and the Maze in the end of a figurative one, or a journey.)The use of the newly invented Steady-Cam was fantastically done.

		<shortDescription>Terrifying, Brilliant, Stunningly Well-Made, Astonishingly Creepy Classic Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Torrance is a struggling writer with a wife and young son, who takes a job as the winter caretaker at a remote hotel in the Colorado Rockies called The Overlook. He hopes the isolation will help his writing, but slowly the hotel seems to exert an insidious and malefic influence over him ...I think horror films are my favourite kind of movies, and I think The Shining is my favourite horror movie. The reasons why are hard to explain. It's an almost perfect movie technically, its plot is gripping, terrifying and extremely original (notable within the notoriously repetitive haunted-house sub-genre) and the performances are truly iconic, but it's more than that - it's something intangible in the atmosphere. I find the ghost story often works great in fiction but not so well on-screen; in The Shining the music, photography and art direction somehow combine to create an incredible atmosphere of dread and unease. The Overlook (all of which was built on sets at Elstree Studios) really becomes its own character in the film - the ultimate Bad Place - and when Jack finally descends into his rampaging homicidal lunacy for the finale he literally becomes The Overlook personified, as if the hotel has somehow gradually poisoned his soul until there's nothing left of the real person he used to be. It's this amazing sense of the evil of the place, as Danny tracks his trike around the corridors and the camera prowls around behind him, which somehow leaps off the screen and chills the blood. It's a metaphysical horror film, and it's the best one ever made. It's also scary in the best entertaining traditions - there's something delicious about the way it sets up this unusual, isolated family trio, and all the scares come from your anticipation of something bad happening to them; there is very little actual violence and only one on-screen death. The golden rule of horror storytelling is to create characters worth caring about, and this is, beg pardon, a shining example of how to do it well. Upon first viewing, Nicholson's tour-de-force performance as Jack (the loony par excellence in his extended gallery of loonies) tends to dominate, and it is exceptional, a wild study of a man losing his mind, but both Duvall and six-year-old Lloyd are incredible too. Duvall plays the living end of vulnerability and hysteria to perfection, and Lloyd delivers a beautifully innocent child's performance - watch his scenes with Crothers (who is also wonderful) where he just can't stop staring at him. There are many many great scenes in this movie - the astonishing opening credits helicopter swoop through the mountains, the creepy hag in room 237, the ghostly ballroom soiree, the all-work-and-no-play-makes-Jack-a-dull-boy moment, the blood in the elevator, all the incredible low-angle Steadicam shots through the hotel, Danny running through the snowy maze, the attack in the bathroom - but more importantly it all melds together so beautifully. The film is simultaneously exhilarating (watch out, Jack's gone nutty), deliciously enigmatic ("I'm sorry to differ with you sir, but you are the caretaker. You've always been the caretaker."), and visually gorgeous. John Alcott's photography is simply the best - I cannot think of a film with more extraordinary and exquisitely tailored photography. Some people complain there are too many of Garrett Brown's incredible tracking shots - rubbish, there are exactly as many as needed and no more. I also love the sets, by Roy Walker and Les Tomkins, which are both amazingly convincing (the only real hotel shots are the few very wide exteriors, which are of the Timberline Lodge in Orgeon's Mount Hood National Forest) and amazingly disturbing. After viewing this movie you feel you know that place and could walk around and orient yourself, which is a great testament to any film. Because of the new innovation of the Steadicam at the time, the sets were deliberately built as a full space (as opposed to the usual three-walls principle), which only adds to their aura of gloom. Finally, there is Kubrick's typically inspired use of music; weird electronic shrieks and crows by Wendy Carlos which first unsettle us, and then an indescribable battering-ram of avant-garde symphonic screeches, thuds and growls by Bela Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti and Krzysztof Pendericki, which hammer us into submission. Watch scenes like the one where Jack chases Danny through the maze, and you'll see photography, art direction, music and editing in simple perfect harmony. There's a lot of weird stuff about this movie which I can't help talking about, purely because it's one of my all-time favourite flicks. Oddly, it was shot in quite a narrow ratio, 1.37:1, and then blown out to 1.85:1 for projection. This review is of the European cut, which is 115 minutes; the US version is thirty minutes longer (and equally good) but the only differences are a few extra shots, a lot of very slightly shorter sequences and two missing scenes, one with Anne Jackson (as a doctor) and another with Tony Burton (as a car rental guy). The movie makes substantial changes from Stephen King's brilliant novel (which is an absolute must-read); the book's central metaphor is the hotel's boiler (which eventually explodes), there is a hedge topiary of animals (which come alive) rather than a maze, and Jack's alcoholism and weak character is much more to the fore. King and Mick Garris made an excellent four-hour TV version in 1997, which is highly recommended and much more faithful to the original story, but not the masterpiece that Kubrick delivers. There is also a hilarious parody called The Shinning in The Simpsons 1994 episode Treehouse Of Horror V. I simply can't rate this movie highly enough - it's everything a great horror film should be and so much more, and it's a showcase of what real cinema can do, made by an absolute master of the craft. Watch it over and over again and be amazed at the genius of Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies I've seen, and I have seen a lot of horror flicks. It may not be follow the Stephen King version, but it still manages to have an intensely eerie tone to it, even though it is quite slow and traces of a plot are left absent. Jack Nicholson gives a great performance, and his transformation from sane to insane is very entertaining but at the same time maintains the codes and conventions of horror. Stanley Krubick has been called mysterious, and there is no doubt about it in this movie, almost every scene has some sort of obscurity to it, some mystery, and it forces to the viewer to feel at least a little bit frightened. Krubick is actually quite brilliant in the way he transforms almost every seemingly normal thing into something menacing, such as the snow-bound atmosphere, a set of twin girls, and even some shots of hallways and rooms generates uneasiness into the viewers. "The Shining" may be criticised for its lack of substance, clarity or depth, but you can't help but be impressed by it's strikingly different style and effect. It is certainly one of the most exceptional horror movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching The Shining, it's hard to determine whether Jack Nicholson was just acting or if he really went crazy. His roll as Jack Torrance is one of the most convincing performances I have ever seen, and I give him major props.. And a lot of people who haven't seen the movie think it's all about Jack Nicholson breaking through a door and saying "here's Johnny." But it's so much more than that. It goes into some very deep stuff. And that's what I love about Stephen King. He doesn't just give you the answers. He lets you decide for yourself. A lot of people don't like that. They'd rather have the movie think for them. But this is one that forces a second viewing, and it's one of the creepiest movies you will ever see. I didn't think it was as creepy as the book by any means. Much like Pet Sematary, you have to read the book to really get scared. Nonetheless, it's a good scary movie that I definitely suggest seeing if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely brilliant! How many times have I seen it now? Its so impressive. Kubrick goes far here with horror as 2001 he does for Sci-Fi if you ask me. I can't imagine any playing this role as well as Jack Nickolson, the part seemed to have been specially designed with him in mind all along. The guy is just as mad in between takes here. Even Shelly Duvall and the kid are great here. I love the lack of clichés and the fact that this is sheer horror, not being stalked by a guy in a mask. I like how the only possible hero almost like a Saint makes it all the way to the hotel travelling long and hard when he is supposed to be on holiday, but he is concerned like a saint, we take it for granted that his efforts will be fruitful but NOOO! I also love the ghostly scenes with Nickolson at the ballroom, absolutely bizarre and the conversations with the ghosts are really far out. i can go on for ever about this kind of film, Its all good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick plus Stephen King plus Jack Nicholson=!@@##$</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several movies that a person must experience in their short period on this Earth in order to truly be living life. This is one of the most prominent ones that come to mind. The Shining is the chillingly blended mix of two of my favorite flavours: Kubrick, and Stephen King. Both of these wizards have made their mark upon the canvas that is the collective movie experience and together they create a picture that is so good it must be fattening. King's novel is a mind stabbing classic and provides a brief glimpse of his twisted(and genius) mind. But this is not his masterpiece. When taken to the screen, the gods of motion pictures must call upon Stanley Kubrick. His version of The Shining is breathtaking in it's visual splendor and sadistic thrills. It never quite crosses the line of brutality that Kubrick has trampled in his past endeavors( A Clockwork Orange, Full metal jacket), but this film is a good combination of art and pure horror. The triangle of cinematic perfection needs only a protagonist and Heeereees Johhnnnny! Jack Nicholson creates a Jack Torrence that no Author or Screenwriter could ever dream up(thank you Stanley for casting him). Nicholson comes close to singing us with his inner rage and insanity that he always seems to have inside him. He is in his perfect environment and he's killing off the competition. In the end you still cant help but love him even as he's attempting to kill his son. The movie best portrays the morbid terror of having your own family turn against you and makes you think about what you might do in the same situation. You could call it cabin fever but something got to jack Torrence in that hotel, and you will have to watch this movie to find out. If you don't, I'll kill you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a classic, no dispute.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No words can describe the feeling one gets when watching a classic such as this film. Whether you found it scary or not, this movie still stands as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Its simple, yet shocking techniques in film making, as well as the thoroughly unmissable performance from Jack Nicholson; is what made it a classic, and stand its time, amongst the rubbish that they are creating today. Few slashers today can measure up, i can only think of two of the top of my head, that being Psycho, and Halloween, also ground breakers in the sub genre. The only difference is (thank god), no body dared spawn sequels from this one. This is definitely something everyone should have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pioneer in the Horror movie, which has achieved the ability to scare with a perfect balance of gore and anticipation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly the greatest Horror Film of all time. This film does not fail to thrill, excite and entertain with every aspect of the action and buildup. It has always been a true pioneer of the horror industry, seen somewhat as a marker for what all horror films should aspire to. The film stills are iconic, with shots of the darkly atmospheric corridors and of the twin girls, having many homages paid to them in films since then. I am not usually the biggest fan of the horror genre, as I often dismiss them as being overly cheesy, predictable and never quite scaring me enough. I believe for a film to be scary and successful you mustn't ignore all the finer qualities of a film, the misé en scene, lighting, sound and acting must all be spot on, as fear is a difficult human emotion to capture within an audience in a horror screening. Many films have recently tried to recapture some essence of fear in the modern cinema goer as films no longer provoke the controversy they once did. Films such as Cabin Fever and Hostel are excellent examples of the overexposure audiences are being subjected to. What I think these horror directors mistake, is that it is not fear their audiences are feeling, but disgust. People will often leave the cinemas feeling ill, rather than feeling like they got out of a chilling tale they felt akin to, and enjoyed the after movie buzz. The Shining has found the balance perfectly, and has the ability to really chill its audience with its compelling tapestry of horrors. Which are best achieved within the film as they do not oversaturate the blood and the gore, but it has all been thoroughly thought through and considered with the build up giving the gory bits maximum bite. A masterpiece by one of the greatest directors of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack is super in this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How much do I love this film? Love Kubrick's vision, direction, camera management and of course, Jack himself. I have read the book 'The Shining' by Stephen King and although Kubrick's film is an entirely different interpretation, I love it! I enjoy how the whole film is panned out so you think you're inside somebody's mind, either Danny's or Jack's, and it is played out like a dream sequence. The essence and eeriness of the characters of the Overlook Hotel affecting Danny's and Jack's minds and how Kubrick directs these events is breathtaking! He's taken horror films to a whole other level and played on the more psychological side of the viewer's mind.What mostly scares you about 'The Shining' is that it is about a man who has been hired to be caretaker in a beauteous hotel for the winter, and has taken along his wife and son. He appears to be (in the book) a caring family man who, although it is clear that he is an ex-alcoholic and a struggling teacher, is trying to make a go of life with his family. In the film, that is never really brought across and I have to admit that Nicholson didn't really portray Jack Torrance as being a family man right from the start. In the opening half hour he seemed moody, edgy, irritable towards his wife, and hardly spent any time with his son. You couldn't really sense any closeness with the family and you couldn't connect to the characters, so I have to admit that when the ghosts pushed Jack into snapping and attacking his wife and son I really wasn't that shocked by it. That having been said, the scenes in which he does are brilliant. Perhaps this was Kubrick's intention, him being the amazing and original director that he was. He intended to just hit the viewer with this character and wanted to simply draw us into his madness. I have to admit that there were times when I found Wendy simply whiny and annoying, but that just goes to prove what a great actress Shelley Duvall is, and this is the exact reaction that Kubrick wanted. You are there with Wendy and Danny, sensing and feeling their terror as they run from the man they both love and trust. It's an emotional and terrifying movie and it's definitely one you need to watch over and over and over again to fully appreciate. One of the best horror movies ever made, no doubt whatsoever in my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's only real attempt on making a horror movie, has turned out as one of the best horror films ever. While all the actors do a great job in this movie, the real main role here plays the Overlook hotel. I can't think of any other film, in which the location of the story makes a contribution this big to the atmosphere. The huge hallways and rooms and their extraordinary great interior equipment are frightening just for what they are, partly because of the emptiness and isolation suffered by the main characters. Undeniably great are, of course, also the steadicam shots of Danny in the maze and him riding through the corridors of the Overlook. The degree of technical perfection that Kubrick delivers with "The Shining" is stunning. Further big contributions to the film's success are made by the haunting and effective music, as well as the source material by Stephen King, which was adapted and provided with some major changes by Kubrick and co-writer Diane Johnson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting review of The Shining by Bill Blakemore.(link)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a masterpiece and the quintessential horror film. Sadly, most people fail to see it as anything more that just that. Like any other Kubrick film, The Shining is filled with (sometimes not so) subtle references to an underlying theme. I had to write a critical response to Bill Blakemore's review of the Shining for college. It reveals a side of The Shining that few people notice. The Shining is about the Native Americans, and of course, America OVERLOOKING their genocide. There are many confirmations of this theory throughout the film, and after reading the review by Bill Blakemore, I can guarantee that you will want to watch The Shining again just to pick up on the motifs.Read the review here: http://www.geocities.com/fleta9/shiningreview.htm</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that The Shining was a great horror film. It was probably the best horror film I had ever seen. It had really good casting for starters. Jack Nicholson was great in this movie (he's just naturally crazy, his wife's face is just creepy, perfect for a horror film, and that boy was pretty freaky too. The movie also had some really freaky music that kept the mood. If your going to make any movie based on a Stephen King book, its going to be pretty freaky. If anyone who is reading this has not seen the movie yet, I think you should read the book first. The book was better than the movie, but the movie still kicked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film...great for watching during Halloween, or any day for that matter...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since this film has already been praised so highly by so many people, I'll try to be brief here?this film is so wonderfully scary that even those who are not horror movie fans will enjoy it. I am one of those people. Simply put, it's a brilliant, thought provoking film that is both a work of art and a horror masterpiece. But you need to be in the mood for it before watching it, as with any film, and also forgive the very loose screenplay adaptation if you've already read the original Stephen King novel. It's also a perfect film for classic ghost story lovers, especially those who love films like THE UNINVITED (1944) and POLTERGEIST (1982).Stanley Kubrick's direction is absolutely perfect here?he knew what he was doing all along despite all his never-ending retakes, which were intended to make the actors feel the hysteria and anguish of their characters on screen. The slow pace of the film helps heighten the suspense and terror within the long, empty hallways of the isolated Overlook Hotel, despite the film's lengthy running time. And the sets and lighting design are astonishingly realistic, despite the fact that all the interiors were filmed on soundstages in England. The frequent tracking shots and Steadicam cinematography, by Kubrick veteran John Alcott, are breathtaking, beautiful, brilliant, and very atmospheric. Kubrick knew exactly what he wanted behind the camera. Even the music score, selected by Kubrick himself, is very appropriate?it includes eerie, disturbing avant-garde orchestral pieces by Wendy Carlos (using synthesizer), Bela Bartok, and Krzysztof Penderecki that are incorporated throughout the film. The score also includes soothing, pleasant vintage 1930s songs at times, especially during a ballroom hallucination where all the ghostly guests are present. Never was music used to such an advantage before in a horror film.Let me just say that I thought Jack Nicholson's performance was superb?how else would a homicidal, violent maniac act? His performance is terrific: Nicholson injected bits of over-the-top comic relief in his terrifying, violent performance, and it truly worked for me. It's a performance worth laughing at and cringing at simultaneously while watching him on screen. As with Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan, Jack Nicholson IS Jack Torrance?even Steven Webber couldn't pull off the role as well in the more faithful TV miniseries version of Stephen King's book. Nicholson's flexible facial expressions are both extremely sinister and comedic throughout the film, making Jack Torrance a fully-fleshed character whose loneliness and isolation slowly drive him into total madness.The other performances are equally good. Shelley Duvall's performance as his terrified, neurotic wife is also top-notch. Danny Lloyd, as the Torrance's little son (who, under Kubrick's manipulative direction, was fully unaware that he was acting in a horror film until years later), and Scatman Crothers, as the hotel's head chef, give completely sincere performances as two characters who share a supernatural ability. And Joe Turkel and Philip Stone give brief yet memorable performances as two sinister ghosts of the hotel's haunted, ominous past.And here's a brief explanation as to why I love this film: it's beautifully filmed (especially during the main titles and the climatic chase scene through an illuminated, snowy hedge maze in the dark), it's intelligently and atmospherically directed with much thought and care by Kubrick, it contains bits of black humor within (for example, there's a brief, amusing scene featuring a cheerful dismembered party guest ghost), and it avoids the clichés that have plagued many a horror film (for example, some of the scary scenes take place in well-lit conditions in broad daylight here, and the gore and special effects are minimal here). Plus, it's so intriguing that it's worth watching again and again.An excellent film that will live to intrigue?and yes, terrify?viewers for generations to come.P.S. One scene that is highly upsetting and difficult to watch, especially for a horny teenager like me: Jack Torrance's visit in the malevolent Room 237.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't watch movies to get scared, anyway.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who cares if this is "scary" or not, in the traditional sense. If I wanted to get scared, I'd go ride my bike on the wrong side of the busy freeway. I'm in for a good story, or whatever you can absorb from a movie. And that, the movie had a lot to offer. I can't tell whether it's because we're not in 1980 anymore, or if it's about Kubrick's style, but I didn't get scared at all. But let's see: right from the beginning, you can tell what's going to happen. Every frame of the movie reveals there's evil stuff on the way. And when we reach the hotel, there's scary music being played *loudly* practically all the time. It's cool having dissonant classical movie being played on a horror movie, but it gets to the point of "okay, I GOT it already" eventually. And Jack Nicholson is freaky right from the beginning, anyway. There isn't exactly a crescendo of things going wrong; it's a crescendo of wrong things that have been wrong right from the start. And if I have to talk about a scary movie that isn't scary, I think I'd pick The Exorcist instead, and mention how that one *does* effectively create the growing sense of impending doom, that something that NEVER should happen will happen eventually.The Shining, on the other hand, is too obvious all the time. The camera following the characters around huge halls and long corridors, as if something was about to jump out at them, followed by the aforementioned loud dissonant music, gives the impression of evil that just isn't there. It ends up feeling like Kubrick is pulling our leg, *pretending* the movie is scary when it isn't. But then again, it's supposed to be atmosphere, and it works when things start getting tense. The story, in essence, is very simple, but there are those strange, complicated twists along the way. I'm not going to tell the whole plot, since you can find it in almost every review here. Jack Torrance, suddenly, is transported to a 1921 party (as we can see by all the dancers on an *empty* hotel), drinks bourbon without being charged, and talks to a waiter that once was the caretaker of the hotel and killed his family before committing suicide. He is, clearly, being possessed by some kind of evil force that we can never discern, while his psychic son calls for help from Mr. Hallorann, who also has that power. Eventually, Jack chases his family with an axe, providing some exquisitely over-the-top performances, and all those ghosts and dead people start appearing. And after his wife and son manage to escape and he freezes to death, we learn that he *was* there before, in 1921. I don't find all that particularly confusing, since it's rather open to interpretation (I don't know whether that was the intention, but then again, I never read the novel). If *you* don't see sense on the story, you can find explanations out there.To me, it isn't really about the story (I just don't like Stephen King), but the way it's treated. It's very masterfully shot and well executed. As the story progressed, I found myself captured by it, and that's what I want from a movie, really. The climax of the movie, while a bit disappointing considering all the build-up, was well made, with the chase in the hedge maze and Wendy seeing all those ghosts (including the guy in the costume with some fella who looked like George Bush). In particular, the moment when the blood pours out of the lifts was extremely well made, and the final result is very, very impressive - seeing that on wide screen, on the trailers, would have been utterly shocking. The performances, well, I can't praise them too much. I'm not sure whether I liked Jack Nicholson or not, but it certainly was a unique performance, and I don't doubt it inspired the hilariously awesome performance of Stefán Karl on the children's TV show LazyTown, even if only a little bit (I'm a Robbie Rotten fan). Shelley Duvall's constant whimpering and shrieking got on my nerves a bit, but it did look believable at times, and *thankfully* her character didn't fall on the famous "stupid victim" trap at any point. And Danny Lloyd was effective as young Danny (especially when you consider he DIDN'T KNOW he was making a horror movie, thanks to Kubrick's protectiveness). He didn't impress me - neither did Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense, so maybe I'm not very interested in child actors, though I'm a stark raving fan of Jonah Bobo (Around The Bend, anyone?). So, who knows. I think this movie deserves to go down as a classic, since it's very unique, interesting and hard-hitting. It's BOUND to. And like every classic, it polarises opinions, and gets all sorts of passionate reactions. I won't add it to my list of favourite movies ever, but I wasn't disappointed by it, I don't regret watching it, and I'll definitely see it again if I can. For now, the aforementioned The Exorcist is in the top of my list. Maybe a Mike Oldfield soundtrack can give The Shining a boost? Everything is possible.</fullReview>

I was wondering if Jack had been reincarnated or what. But this movie is a classic on so many levels and it is just another Stephen King thriller that is such a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*******SPOILER ALERT******** Just got finished watching this film (a TV version that was being played on A&amp;E) and I have to say that it has scared me in more ways than I can count. Well, at least the first half where Jack is slowly drifting off to insanity. I was terrified of the entire buildup because of how eerie it was, but the events surrounding the climax were not all that terrifying as I thought they would be (besides the part where Danny picks up the knife and is chanting 'redrum', I thought he was going to knife his mother!) However, the long take on Jack after being frozen the following morning in the hedge maze was really eerie and the gradual zoom up to Jack in the picture of the ballroom was probably the part that creeped me out the most. But, I felt the climax was not all that scary and just had your typical thriller qualities to it. However, I can easily see that Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrence's plunge into insanity is the reason why the film is on the list. Fantastic acting on his part.All in all, an incredibly enjoyable film from someone who isn't even a huge fan of horror.</fullReview>

Have I missed something or am I plain stupid? We know that Danny has some sort of sixth sense and Jack was a bit crazy so it makes sense that they'd see ghosts but Wendy? Had she also started seeing ghosts? She had an encounter with two engaged in a sexual act and also met that other creepy guy. Or is it the plain and simple answer that the place was already haunted. If so, why din't previous residents report sightings? Thanks.</fullReview>

And totally disagreeing with the 2 raspberry nominations. Oscar nominations is more accurate.Jack Nicholson is remarkable for is transformation from being normal to becoming insane. Despite Shelley Duvall's razzie nomination, she did a good job with her expressions of terror. Even newcomer Danny Lloyd did a great job. Actually, all the acting was excellent.The directing, the camera angles, the score, all successfully mixed together into a truly terrifying atmosphere. Excellent adaptation. If only Kubrick did this to other of King's novels before he died.2001, Dr. Strangelove, the Shining, definitely makes Stanley Kubrick one of the best directors of his time.</fullReview>

Kubric had a different view of Jack and his family, their stay in the hotel that winter, etc...and he brings that to the screen with chilling imagery, eerie subliminal flashes, and Jack Nicholson's performance as a wild-eyed madman. That being said I enjoyed the film for what it is--Kubric's the Shining. Not King's the Shining. The scenes were creepy, frightening, and unsettling. Blood pours out of elevators, The ghosts of twin girls tell Danny "come and play with us" as the images of them chopped to pieces flashes in front of our eyes. Sure, it's not King's original vision--which of course is excellent!But Kubric wanted to freak us out, give us the creeps, making us feel like we're watching someone else's nightmare. He's succeeded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally I love this film, I think it's a great movie and stylistically brilliant. But I'm obviously not going to change anyone else's opinion on this film, so I won't try.I'd just like to say that most of the people who seem to hate this film hate it because it doesn't follow the exact plot of Stephen King's book (which I have read and also like!) Well, it's an adaptation of the book not an unerringly faithful cover. It's Kubrick's version of the story- like a cover version of a song, and you'd probably feel a bit ripped off if the cover version was identical to the original, no? Other famous adaptations have changed source material- I mean The Godfather leaves out an entire subplot from Mario Puzo's book and I haven't seen anyone mark that film with one star because the source is changed! Approach the film without expecting to see exactly what is in the book and you might enjoy it a bit more. Make your own judgement on Kubrick's direction, but some of the tracking steadicam shots are undeniably great and the creepy visuals really get under your skin.The one point I will concede to the 'haters'(sorry chaps can't think of a better word at the mo) is the ambiguity concerning Jack Torrance's character at the start of the movie. Is he already supposed to be crazy? He is a bit over the top to begin with.* In short, though I love this film i can understand why some people might not. I just don't think a good reason to hate it is because the source material has been altered.*Not sure if this counts as a spoiler but I'm just covering my back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well if the best criterion to rate a horror movie as good lies in its power to scare you I must say this movie is scary indeed. I won't exaggerate if I say this is maybe the greatest horror movie I ever saw. The horror here, if you overlook a few ominous ghostly apparitions in human shape some bleeding some not but always in broad light, lies more in the narrated situation developed through a series of scenes all of them well illuminated. As a matter of fact we don't have here the usual dark atmosphere nor lots of vampires, monsters or deformed ghosts. And if the haunted hotel house when seen from outside is sinister indeed all the interior scenes are filmed in broad light and the scenery is shown mostly in light colours contrasting with the omen always present almost from the beginning chiefly through the eyes of the little boy who has got supernatural knowledge powers. That makes it even more terrifying by creating the idea that it could happen to any of us. It's indeed the story of a nice normal couple with a beautiful young son that suddenly becomes a whirl of horror by the power of some hidden evil forces. I must confess I liked the performance of Shelley Duvall in the role of the frightened but courageous young mother better than Nicholson's. Though he is doubtless a great actor and has a good performance here, in the second part of the movie he is a bit too Grand Guignol for the general atmosphere of the movie with too many facial tics and grimaces. I wouldn't like to finish this comment without referring to the last scene of the chase of the boy in the snowy labyrinth which is thrilling indeed. Summing it up, it's an excellent movie with an excellent story (inspired in a Stephen King's novel), very well directed and with an excellent cast and an excellent scenery of interiors with inspired frames.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now without doubt a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that age well. Very controversial in its time, I think it is now clearly a classic. Should Nicholson have gotten an Oscar over DeNiro's performance in *Raging Bull*? No, obviously not--Nicholson is borderline hilarious in this, as is Shelley Duvall and for that matter even the great Anne Jackson (Scatman Crothers is, unambiguously, intentionally hilarious). But Kubrick's movies are not about "good" acting in the usual sense, and Nicholson's most over-the-top, eyebrow-popping, tongue-flicking, scenery-chewing mugging here works like a charm in a way it could not in any other movie because Kubrick was a complete original and a genius. This movie simultaneously amuses, engrosses, terrifies AND alienates. I'm not here to say it's Kubrick's best movie, but it's certainly the one I've gone out of my way to see the most times so I suppose it's my favorite. It's not the scariest movie I've ever seen (that would be *Halloween,* and at least half a dozen movies rank above this one on that scale), but I defy anyone to genuinely watch this film with an open mind and not have the snot scared out of him/her at least 20 times. And it is certainly more artistically ambitious than all but two or three of the films I've seen that are scarier than this one.I hope my review displaces the absolutely boneheaded one that was up on this movie's page when I checked it out (what exactly is a "prodding" screenplay?). This is not one of the 10 best movies I've ever seen, but it may be one of the 100 best, so it deserves more respect than it's getting on this site at the moment.</fullReview>

He hears from the Hotel's manager that the caretaker of 1970 killed his wife and two little girls with an axe and then shot himself with a shotgun. Jack brings his wife Wendy and his son Danny with him. Danny has a psychic connection with the hotel's cook Dick Hallorann. Hallorann warns Danny about the hotel's past and tells him to stay out of Room 237. ONE MONTH LATER, Danny is having weird visions in his mind. Blood pouring out of an elevator. Two little girls stalking him. The mysterious word "redrum" on a door. Jack is having some weird experiences of his own. A ghost bartender has been selling him drinks for cash. Jack runs into the previous caretaker! He tells Jack to handle his family the same way that he handled his. Meanwhile, Danny tells Wendy that there was a crazy woman in the hotel.

Jack Nicholson, in possibly one of the greatest performances of all time, oohh, it just chills my spine how intense and crazed he seems to be.Jack: "Wendy darling, the light of my life, I'm not gonna hurt ya-"Wendyl: "Jack!"Jack: "You didn't let me finish my sentence, I'm not gonna hurt ya, I'm just gonna bash your brains in": ect...That is just a taste of the beauty. Stanley Kubrick's cinematographer rivals that of Martin Scorsese and Orson Wells. A beatiful soundtrack and visuals that still haven't been rivaled, AFTER 23 YEARS!!! Shelley Duvall puts up a sturdy performance, as long as with Danny Lloyd ("REDRUM!!"). Na dits always great to see Scatman Crothers. A clear work of art, that rivals every horror movie since "Frankenstein" (1931)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An elegant and well-crafted masterpiece form the undisputed king of wit and humanity, Stanley Kubrick.Remarkably, in less than 3 hours (!!), Mr Kubrick presents with great subtlety the compelling message that descent into madness is possible if one is to marry an unattractive, third rate actress and spend the Winter with her in a snow-bound hotel. Really, quite brilliant.Other fine touches include the repeated scenes of blood pouring out of elevator doors. While some reviewers have apparently interpreted this symbollism as a clever device to warn audiences of the risks involved in standing too close to elevators full of blood, it seems more likely to me to be Mr Kubrick's highly original way of satirising the sort of crassness and pretentiousness which prevail in movies other his own. Masterful!All in all, this movie is an inspired tour-de-force, replete with depth, meaning and intrigue. I happily grant it a full 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that defined the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie two years ago, but I can still remember that it scared the CRAP out of me. Granted, I usually scare easily, but not many movies truly terrify me the way this one did.Being a huge fan of Stephen King's books and having seen almost all of the accompanying movies (The Stand and Shawshank Redemption are the only 2 that come to mind that I haven't viewed), I decided this was worth a look. Naturally, I read the book first and loved it. Now, normally, a book is better than its corresponding movie (which is the case with the majority of King's books), so I rented this movie with fairly low expectations. Boy, was I surprised at how well this movie was directed. The actors were amazing, the scenes were shot perfectly, and it was suspenseful in all the right places. To watch Jack Torrance slowly go insane is horrifying. This movie is true psychological horror; not just another "mindless slasher" movie.*****MINOR SPOILERS***** The two most horrifying scenes in this movie, in my opinion, were the scene with the lady in the bathtub and the scene with the twins. No wonder Danny was so frightened; I'm 17 and that would scare ME (heck, it would probably scare ANY normal adult).As I said in my summary, this is a movie that truly defines the "horror" genre. Suspense is present throughout nearly the entire movie, from the beginning to the terrifying conclusion. Kubrick did an excellent job directing this movie. The phrase "redrum, redrum" will forever be etched into my mind.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is one of the scariest films ever made. It can't match up to The Exorcist but it comes a very close second. Jack Nicholson is great in this movie as the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel living with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and his five year-old son (Danny Lloyd). The son has a very special talent called the shining, which is something where you can see things that have happened in the past, that are happening in the present and that are going to happen in the future. He can see blood gushing out of lifts, ghosts of the old caretaker's two daughters and various other creepy things. Like the book, the caretaker becomes very isolated and shut-down from the world to a point where he tries to kill his family.Stanley Kubrick does a good job in directing this masterpiece. He has other good movies but none like this one. The Shining is a masterpiece of modern horror and see it as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Was A Technical Breakthrough...A "Cinematic Masterpiece".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining was the very first movie to make extensive use of the Steady Cam, a camera attached to a special device which acts like a balancing beam that allows the cameraman to run and jump and make quick, jerky movements while filming, all while keeping a super-smooth shot. You will see the Steady Cam in action if you watch the "Making the Shining" if you bought a newer release of the movie.Besides the introduction of new cinematic devices, the film also was the first ever to make use of the Moog Synthesizer. This electronic keyboard was used for the duration of the movie to produce it's eerie sounds. Did you think that the music in the movie was that of an orchestra? Well, it is not, as I found out in one of my physics classes. It was an electronic synthesizer capable of producing thousands of different sound effects. (All thanks to the musician Wendy Carlos who adapted composer Bela Bartok's original movements and performed them on the Moog synthesizer).The Shining is probably best known for the blood spilling out of the elevators, which was most likely produced by building a small model of a room, and filming blood pouring out of the model at a high rate of speed. Thus, when the film is played back at normal speed, the action appears to be happening at normal speed, but is actually replaying at slow speed.I love this movie because I praise it for being innovative and ground-breaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Care to Shine?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure whether I've come to admire Kubrick or not, but, in a bizarre way, I think you can't help but stand still and stare, while in awe, at a man of his artistic discipline and rigorous vision. Brilliant films such as the Clockwork Orange or Dr. Strangelove are undoubtedly tremendous achievements, Lolita remains an interesting experience, Full Metal Jacket put me in a strange mood, something between amusement and deep reflection (oh, well, maybe not so deep), Barry Lindon was just too awkward and long, despite showing off with some great costumes and art design, but The Shining...where can I put that? After having read the story, I wouldn't really say that the book version was better, yet I don't have the conviction to affirm that the film is either. OK, so what it's about: a couple (the Torrance's) with one child travel to this lonesome, yet luxurious hotel somewhere in the mountains and get a job as caretakers, thus having to inhabit the hotel only by themselves for the winter period. All alone, desperate to put together a play, Jack Torrance takes a slip towards insanity...and it seems that being locked away with the same bunch of people over a long time frame can have quite devastating effects on the psyche.SPOILER I will just ask one question, which remains without answer from my perspective: why let Hallorren die after all that effort? It just doesn't fall into place and keeps me thoroughly unsatisfied. I wouldn't try to argue saying Stephen King's version of it was better, because it was too "soft and predictable", still Kubrick's choice leaves me puzzled.END OF SPOILERThe film is truly entangled in its own weary life, wavering between its characters, delightfully portraying Jack Torrance's desperation. Nicholson is simply brilliant in doing it. On the other hand, Shelley Duvall is just a mess...she's so bad, I'd have normally expected her to ruin the whole movie. But this is the funny part: she didn't. Kubrick maintains some balance within the story and between the characters, although the ending kind of leaves me staring in a blur, due to it being somewhat meaningless, even absurd. It simply doesn't convey an acceptable solution, that's my issue.On the whole, however, "The Shining" is definitely worthwhile, although not as impressive as Kubrick's other works. If you have any doubts whether watching the movie is productive or not, just imagine Jack Nicholson at his best. It's not the mysterious and terrifying King here, it's the pragmatic and analytical Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest horror movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Sure, you could say it is not faithful enough to Stephen King's book, but it is still excellent. The fact that it isn't faithful to the book is actually somewhat of a good thing, because it makes it a work of its own."The Shining" has excellent build-up that is rarely seen in horror movies. Some complain that it is too slow, but really, it is perfect pacing. The problem that I see with most horror movies is that they try too hard to be scary at all times. In this film, however, every minute in the story is another piece added to the puzzle that will eventually become one of the most intense climaxes in the history of cinema. That isn't to say it is not scary until the climax. It is actually scary throughout most of the entire movie. The build-up is so strong, so suspenseful, that it makes it scary.Stanley Kubrick's direction adds to the creepiness of the film. It is brilliant, to say the least. There are certain shots in this movie that are true cinematic masterpieces. Well, what did you expect from a legendary director such as Kubrick?Shelley Duvall's acting is the worst part of the movie. Her acting is the main reason I didn't give this movie a 10 out of 10. Her acting sometimes ruins the disturbing atmosphere of the film. Jack Nicholson's acting is another story. His performance is as scary as they get. He has the power to make us really believe that he is a complete psycho, especially in the last half hour or so of the film.So to sum it up, "The Shining" is a horror classic that delivers the goods.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick's delve into horror succeeds in one level that most horror films fail on - it's actually scary. Nicholson's performance is fantastic - yes, over the top, but perfectly fitted for the role. This movie contains some of the most genuinely frightening scenes ever committed to film. The common criticism is that Nicholson goes crazy to quickly, but it is a full hour into the film before he even begins to, let alone actually does. This building anticipation towards the actual event is part of what makes this such a great horror film. On top of all this, the film is technically masterful, with some of Kubrick's best camerawork, including some impressive long tracking shots. Not just for horror either - there are lots of Kubrick themes and symbols woven into the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-crafted psychological tale of slow derangement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of Kubrick's works, The Shining works on you after the initial viewing. The sounds, the images, the dialog resonant ? almost hauntingly in this case. Many were disappointed by this film when I first saw it in 1980. But, such is the case with all of Kubrick's efforts after Dr. Strangelove. Upon further review and the required multiple viewings you find yourself humming the tunes, chuckling at many of Jack Nicholson's lines, and reveling at several of the film's brilliant images and steady-cam shots. Nicholson and Shelly Duvall both give terrific performances. Duvall's has been particularly underrated. Try sustaining the sense of sheer vulnerable terror that she does throughout the second half of the film and you'll see what I mean. The carefully selected music accompanying the film is among the best of any movie in history. It is a crime that there is no `official' digital soundtrack available ? though there are a couple of decent bootlegs out there if you look hard enough. Those expecting to find the traditional horror flick in the vane of Stephen King's novel will be disappointed. This is horror Stanley Kubrick style. It is a well-crafted psychological tale of slow derangement, of helpless isolation, of the traces of the past that linger on to speak to those with the mind to listen ? those who `shine' - whether they want to or not. It's not the `boo' that scares you, it's the effective build-up and juxtaposition using all that the film medium provides to place the viewer inside a metaphysical construct. Audiences aren't used to this approach to the horror film. They are accustomed to surprise and in-your-face abruptness. The Shining is more subtle. And it lingers. Much like all those things that have never escaped the lure of the Overlook Hotel itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stranger In A Stranger Land</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director, and watching The Shining recently on DVD reminded me why. Kubrick has an uncanny way of setting up normal-looking objects and places so that they have an alien, spacey, distant quality. There are so many other adjectives one could use. He uses lighting, especially in The Shining, masterfully. The Shining, visually, is all about glows and indirect lighting, putting us in the mood for a ghostly story. Strange repeated geometric patterns, which Kubrick shoots with obsessive care, provide more mood, illustrating the relentless heartlessness of the icy world outside of the small bits of quivering, vulnerable warmth known as human beings. (The interlocking geometric carpeting which young Danny plays on, and the fabled hedge maze outside The Overlook Hotel are two prime examples of this.) Finally, even the camera work in The Shining contributes to its otherworldly, inhuman feel, as the camera flows down the hallways and around the corners of The Overlook like a ghost sweeping through a graveyard, or, even more relevantly, like the tidal wave of blood sluicing from the elevators in Danny's visions. The inhumanity in the way the camera moves - which is contrasted with the clumsiness of the human subjects the camera inevitably follows - causes the sneaking feeling that there is something "out there" which cannot be stopped.Like the best horror films, The Shining works its fear by building dramatic tension. Jack Nicholson's performance explores all the rage, delusion, and confusion needed to lead us down the path from normal world to the other-world of The Shining's darkest moments. When he does go over the top, he plays right into the movie's hands. Even Scatman Crothers' jovial performance, seemingly at odds with the movie's tone, allows something Satanic beneath the surface. Shelly Duvall's Southern neurotic is somewhat unexplained, but she does her best, and visually she could not be more perfect as the dark-haired willow in the haunted hotel. Danny Lloyd as "Danny-Boy" holds his own in the surprisingly large number of scenes he is required to carry. His creepy 10-year-old voice screaming "Redrum!" as Shelly Duvall sleeps may give you chills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better or Worse than...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen The Shining before (until last week), nor did I ever read Stephen King's book. I liked the movie. It definitely WAS creepy. Not super, but good. I thought Nicholson was hair-raising good. Didn't like Shelly Duvall alot, a bit silly she was. But hey! tastes differ. Everyone has his own opinion, and that's just fine...This is mine: Why do people always have to compare movies with the books they're based upon. Or even the inverse. Movies and books are very different media! Think about the 'consumption time'. A book can take two week to finish (or two months in my case). Movies are fast-food. With books, what you see is your imagination. With films it's the director's point of view. You just cannot make comparisons!!!! It will never be 100% okidoki! Ardent readers will always critic the movie on being not faithfull to the book. Who says it has to ???? It's like a cover song. It's the other artist's own interpretation of the song. Some covers may even be much better than the original... or they may be total and utter crap.I experimented: Lord of The Rings (Fellowship of the Ring). Never read the book, saw the film, liked the film alot. Afterwards I borrowed the book from a friend and read it, just for science's sake!. It's okay if you like the genre. I'm not a fan, but I liked it. I've found it rather boring though, to much facts and details which don't really give the story extra value. Opposite to that, Peter Jackson didn't made such a wise decision by cutting out some characters and scenes which could have given the movie some extra 'swung' and more background information. Two weeks later I started to read the second episode (The Two Towers), just to make sure that I finish it before the release of the movie. Now I'm waiting on the movie! Will it be worser than the book, just because I've read the book first ??? Actually if it will, I won't care. The book is Tolkiens vision, the movie is Jackson's...My opinion is mine, yours is yours. Just try to see the movie as a vision of..., and not as a copy of the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the scariest movies i've ever seen. Until towards the end when the family just fights. There were a whole bunch of scary parts if you just think about what's happening. This is about a family that are going to look over a haunted hotel. But they don't know it's haunted until later. They are all happy until things start happening. Jack (the dad) gets cabin fever and goes crazy. That's exactly what happened to the other people that looked over the hotel before Jack and his family This movie is not very gory but it is one of the scariest movies of all time. I think you should see this movie if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion this is one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest film, alongside A Clockwork Orange. Not only because it follows a story-line that appeals to a mainstream audience, but also due to the intense, mind-blowing performance from Jack Nicholson. The Man Was Nuts!!! Kubrick films are always something special because you know each scene was probably filmed over fifty times before the director and actors were happy. As well I love the many tracking shots using the steadicam scattered throughout the film. Plus the location the movie is shot at, genuinely creepy. If you want a psychological horror film and not a slasher movie, check out The Shining. (8 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The #3 Definitive Horror Film (Spoiler?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's vision of the classic Stephen King novel has scared audiences for years and will do so for years to come. Most of the film takes place in a Colorado Hotel called "The Overlook." A man named Jack Torrence has been assigned the job of taking care of the hotel over the winter. He takes his family to the hotel and slowly, things begin to happen. The movie spirals into a creepiness not found it many films. The characters become believable and the story stays strong throughout most of the movie. I will have to say that the Video/DVD release is not my favorite version of this film. My favorite was aired on A&amp;E. This version cut out the scene where Jack goes into a certain hotel room to see if a woman is in there that shouldn't be. I think the suspense of not knowing what's in the room makes the movie scarier. I have watched this movie several times, and I know I'll watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute masterpiece and one of the greatest horror movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest horror movies I've ever seen. One of the best films of Stanley Kubric as well. The landmark coldness of his style is very appropriate as we see the continuous alienation of the bitter loser heading to the insanity. Nicholson meticulously paces his part and equally perfectly depicts the slow transformation of the exhausted writer into the furious guard of the hotel's secrets and the emotional burst in the final. Vast spaces of the hotel halls, continuous use of the image of labyrinth act as additional personae of the story. Visuals in this picture are vivid and stunning.Unforgettable opening shot with flight over the northern landscape remains of a "Space Odyssey". Masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the house haunted, or not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that Kubrick was trying to make his audience wonder whether the hotel was haunted or, did the characters share some delusive dream?Kubrick's films tend to build up, layer by layer, into a mounting avalanche that the characters cannot control. One miscalculation sets the avalanche tumbling down, taking on a personality of its own.Stephen King tends to create battles between good and evil...The world is full of characters with either halos or horns..Kubrick does not. He sees clashes of interest setting characters against one another and isn't trying to convince the audience to "like" or "hate" someone or something. The people we are at odds with in life have a view...and it's not all invalid.Each time I view this film I see something I missed earlier. In my latest viewing the scene with Danny playing darts drew my attention. As he approaches the dart board a portrait suggesting a faceless woman is on the distant wall. As, he turns, he sees two small girls holding hands...In the background is another portrait...an extremely gruesome one of a woman on the distant wall...When Danny is riding his big wheel down the hallways, he comes face to face with the two girls again...In the background is a window with drawn semi-transparent drapes...Behind those drapes is the figure of another woman looking on and slightly blurred..Second and third return takes then make the viewer feel that it was only a reflection of the hallway lights that created this vision...but a short rewind can create debate in a household quickly...The figure is more pronounced.Kubrick was not trying to frighten his audience...just make them ponder.Imagine some child in a mall....Mother just let go of a hand. Some kids panic while others run...Some feel abandonment while others feel a freedom to explore. King was the first of these while Kubrick cherished getting lost...Which are you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is one of my top 10 favorite horror films of all time for many reasons. One reason that is very clear is Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack. Stanley Kubrick (who happens to be one of my favorite directors) does a great job with making the movie scary as hell. Although many will complain that the movie is a lot different from Steven King's book (and it is) it is still a great movie and that shouldn't bring it down. The Shining is unlike most horror movies. It relies on images for frights and the formula works good. The blood in the elevator, the twins' ghosts, and all the different images of ghosts of the overlook hotel give the movie an intense feel. Overall The Shining keeps the viewer glued to the screen and delivers images and psychological thrills like no other. OVERALL: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw The Shining at the age of 10 and I thought it was the scariest movie I had ever seen. Well at the age of 24 I am still scared every time I watch it. Jack Nicholson's performance was amazing in this film. I tried to read The Shining and even attempted to watch the tv remake a few years ago, but nothing could compare to Jack Nicholson and his "here's johnny".

		<shortDescription>A very, very long analyse of the film, from a person whose still learning English.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people don't seem to understand that its impossible to compare King's novel with Stanley Kubrick's movie. In their own way, they are both psychological masterpieces. The problem is that they are so different one another that you can't say which is better. But there's something I have to say, and it is that they both scare the hell out.A lot of people may think that Shelly Duvall's performance was clumsy, and they do, even Shining fans, but actually she deserved an Oscar for her acting and I'll tell you why. I liked this movie so much that I made a little research and I found out a logical explanation to everything that happens in this film. Wendy is hysterical, and I mean in the literal way. The Shining has something horrible that is that there is nowhere to hide. If your husband is trying to kill you, your son is epileptic ?and I'll tell you later why-, your salvation is a Negro who is dead, and your trapped miles away from civilization you would look like her to. And now she is a woman.Wendy has lost the only person she could ever trust when Jack went crazy. His psychopathic from the moment his borne, but is only now that he really thinks that he is drunk, and that there people in the hotel. He hasn't drink any alcohol buy that sickness makes him think he has and know he is up to hurt his family.After the bathroom scene, Wendy has suffer so much that she hysterical. She can't move, because she is so scared, but also she has to look for Danny, which is in danger. Compare Shelly performance with a normal hysterical person and you'll find no difference. She start to see things because of the trauma, she moves so weird because her sick body is paralysing her, but she also has to move. She is not a psychopath, but a neuropath. The bloods from the elevator, the skeletons, even Grady are obvious creations of her hurt mind, and she knows it, that's why she can continue her search for Danny.The reason she sees something, is only because she is hysterical, and a hysteric woman exaggerate things, feels things, moves strange, and has a clumsy face. It's natural under the circumstances. You watch at Duvall, knowing what Kubrick wants out of her, and you scare the hell of because her expression of terror is so real ?not to say that she is ugly, and that helps, believe it or not- that you became and hysteric too, been scare of blood coming out of the elevator, when that is something funny under normal circumstances.Danny. Danny is an epileptic, and the reason of the entire disaster at the Overlook Hotel, both the movie and the book, but in Kubrick point of view, everything you see is dicing to make you ask yourself `The ghosts are real, or are they all in their heads.' They can be in their heads. The phenomenon of Collective Hysteria is common, and examples of it are human waves. Someone starts it and the mind invents the rest.The moment Tony ?which is a symbol of Danny's psychosis-, shows him a little example of what may happen if he goes to the hotel, a disaster starts and no one notice. Danny exaggerates thing, and goes to the hotel thinking he is going to find terror in there. He tells that to his mother, and she assimilates it deep in her mind. When he starts to see thing, his terror grows, so as his illusions. The Collective Hysteria presents because they are only three and their stuck alone for too much time.By their own reasons, every one of them starts to think, even as a game, that there is people are ghosts with them that wish to hurt them. For Danny it starts when Tony talks to him at the bathroom, for Jack, when he imagines that his talking to Lloyd and drinking at the bar. This gets worse every time (the way Kubrick scares you) and then he believes he is actually drunken and wants to kill his family because they want to destroy him.Until now, Danny divides his personality and his now Tony entirely. Wendy is obviously frighten because of that, and realizes that she is the last conscious person in the place. That is too much heavy for her, and that's where her problem begins.After Here's Johnny, she is hysterical and then begins to watch things.You see, The Shining has an explication in real life. But if you want to talk about the atmosphere, Kubrick is also the master behind this. The Overlook is too beautiful to be true, its decoration is perfect, and the white painting in every wall makes you thing that is extremely clean. But anyway, you'd rather been burn in oil before walking around all alone in those places, whether they are the rooms, the halls or the kitchen.The contrast between white and the zigzag carpet makes an atmosphere that in no comfortable for the view already. Then, the sick full music starts to make you wonder what's going to happen. The contrast between beautiful scene, and terrible music is fantastic, and then, the actual terror.It is not like in normal pictures, when you scare in one exact boo moment. Kubrick, for example, shows that killer and victim know exactly where they are each other and they even talk during a long time. When Wendy reads Jacks novel, her expression disturbs you, the music, the way she continues to look at the pages even thought she already knows they all say the same thing, and watching Jack from the behind, who is not dissimulating his presence; all that disturbs you, but when you mix them all, the terror goes beyond boo classical scenes.In that particular scene, Kubrick could have simply make Jack appear from nowhere and start attacking Wendy, and that would have make people scream at the time. But no, the terror Kubrick used was psychological, and he shows Jack coming in a normal way, and announcing his presence before he even starts to play with Wendy.The terror grows, and I remember I couldn't sleep for weeks because of the bathroom scene, and it still scares me because of Shelly's expression. This scene took the 127 shots before Stanley Kubrick considered it perfect. I'm sure Duvall hated him for a while, but in a time so did Malcolm McDowell. The death of Halloran represents not only the racism in America, but the idea that there's no place to hide at the Overlook Hotel, and if you thought that he was going to safe the day then you are mistaken. But the most terrifying scenes of the whole movie, believe or not, are the times when they tell you the day and situation. This is because it's a boo moment that means nothing, and makes you wonder in panic, but nothing really happens.Slow motions makes things beautifully horrible, and the ending is satisfactory after the log waiting when you start to know that this characters love each other, but there's allways something to interfere with that ?like the wish to kill them all-.The twins are just the scariest thing ever imagined, and that was another of Kubricks original ideas for the scrips. As I told you, the terror grows, and you see the twins for one second for the first time, for a minute the next, with horrible music later, and finally the both present themselves to Danny as the evil thing they are, and even better because after so much time behind Riding Danny the last thing you were expecting to find was two murdered sisters.The reason this movie is so great, is still a complete mystery. But I think it is not one thin, but the mixture of thing, of giving the audience what they're expecting or not to, the music, the set, the slow motion, the one-second-long shots, the never-ending suspense or the masterful performances of Jack Nickolson, Shelly Duvall (God, I love her, even thought shes so ugly on that film) and, why the heck not?, Daniel Lloyd. He is the only really scary sick child, not like the Poltergeist's or even Haley Joel Osmend. They are good, buy Lloyd was the first scary child.Stephen King hates this film, because it is not practically his book. It is weird that the movie is so different than the book, considering that A Clockwork Orange has a storyline practically exact to Anthony Burguess' novel. But you have to understand, and me being a Stephen King Fan, than a movie can't be exactly like the book, because that wouldn't be original, artistic, and several thing wouldn't have the visual impact a movie needs. The problem with the Shining, is that is too different. Carrie was half different, and it was perfect as a film, and still is a King film.The Shining only takes some parts from the book, and the rest is the artistic vision of Kubrick. That isn't bad. In fact, that is very good, because it tells you that the writer of the script has an imagination of his own and for owing the right, he can even make fun of the original novel. If you don't understand this, then I'll put an example:Chocolat is a fantastic film, and it is extremely different from the book. Five Oscar nominations, well deserved. Harry Potter, a copy from the book, a pathetic movie that has nothing artistic to offer, but the fantastic voyage of magic.The Shining is a masterpiece in every way, and with The Others, the only movie that didn't let me sleep the night I watch it. I recommend it very much, but I can guarantee that you'll like it. It can get boring if you are not like me ?I like Barry Lyndon, may God help me- or like most of Kubrick's fans. But make your own opinion. I have mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most horrifying horror movie of them all..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is unrelenting in its effort to scare the living daylights out of its audience. Stanely Kubrick is ruthless in grabbing every frame, every scene, and every cue to keep hammering on the nerves of the audience. Not even a single moment is wasted on humor or sentiment. Stanley Kubrick is sincere in his aim to scare and scare he really does.The plot is simple. Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) has to spend 5 months alone with his wife and young kid in a hotel in the lofty heights of Colarado.He has the job of looking after the place when it is closed for the winter. The hotel was built on an ancient Indian burial site and the previous caretaker went completely insane and after butchering his wife and two daughters, he put a shotgun to his mouth and shot himself.This is one movie, which is extremely beautiful, yet scary at the same time. Kubrick's genius can be seen in almost every frame of the movie. The opening scenes, extremely beautiful give a wide panoramic view of the mountains, yet focus on a small subject like a lone car motoring along the mountains. This somehow manages to create a very lonely, eerie atmosphere. The hotel is extremely luxurious, brightly lit but is also very odd and eerie. Kubrick manages this by walls that are painted white and very eccentric carpets having intricate designs, which somehow offsets the balance of the place. White walls with orange carpets having a very zig zag design seem very odd. So is the feature of every room in the hotel. The kitchen also has the same kind of effect having a combination of white and pale green walls. Every room in the hotel has a luxurious yet distinctively uneasy appearance.Kubrick just takes this and makes a movie that completely leaves you exhausted after 2 and half hours. Jack Nicholson is fantastic. Shelley Duvall although at first glance is seen miscast comes into her own in displaying the helplessness and hysteria in having to cope with her husbands insanity. The movie is a roller coaster hitting at the viewers nerves at every instant and works its way to the finale, which just leaves you a little flustered. Stanely Kubrick although explaining very detail leaves a few unanswered questions, which will be talked about as long as the movie is watched.Altogether, 'The Shining' is one of the most scariest movie out there.....</fullReview>

All I know is that the first time I saw this film it scared the heck out of me. What's scarier is that it still scares the heck out of me.Everyone has a scene they found the most interesting or scariest. To me, it was the twins in the hall. To many people it was just Danny riding around on his bike, REDRUM, "Here's Johnny!", or the scary maze chase scene. All those things scared me. They still do. The end was also scary.Jack Nicholson was fabulous, as expected. The young boy who played Danny was great. Is he still doing movies? Shelly Duvall... er... let's not go there.

		<shortDescription>What more could anyone ask for at 3am?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read the novel, I was 10 years old, and naive beyond all comparison. A year later I saw the film for the first time, alone at night.I wondered until now as to why my little brothers had nightmares from just hearing the soundtrack from their bedrooms at the other end of the house. I was so stupid, that I thought that REDRUM was meant as in a RED ROOM. So much has changed. With the invention and distribution of DVD, I can now sit and watch this film in its UNCUT version (which has never been aired in Australian cinema), at 3 in the morning, and on a big screen, thanks to digital projectors. It was so terrifying to me (even though I know the "Shinning", of the Simpsons off by heart). The music was spine tingling, with a most frightening moment in the film actually being the cutscene, with the word TUESDAY. (The music built up to a climax, and was paid with many a scream) This is a masterpiece in almost every way. Jack Nicolson has always been scary looking, but this is undoubtedly the freakiest he has ever looked. I can almost go as far to say that he is the scariest monster in horror, and he barely spent 10 minutes in the make up room. The laugh of the old woman still haunts me, (and my little brothers) although not nearly as much as the Tricycle that Danny rides, and his many misadventures. Here is my question for anyone out there: What is the deal with the man dressed up as an animal. Was that in the uncut? Because I can't remember it. It was strange, completely off track, but frightening in its own way.It also occurred to me, that the Hotel seems a lot scarier due to the 70's interior design. You may laugh at me, but room 237 was a lot scarier for me, due to the purple and green carpet. I strongly think that this film in its new and improved sense, has scared me. But really, if you want to let a child see this, even if they are tough, make sure that they understand what they are watching. For me it has made all the difference. Kubric did a great job. The film is so intense, that it has even made an episode of the Simpsons, and Rocko's Modern Life, quite chilling and freaky. I just wish that there were more horror films that were actually scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best made film to scare me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is not the most frightening film ever made. For me, that honour belongs to the underrated cult film "Angel Heart." It is not the best horror film ever made, for me that is "The Exorcist." But "The Exorcist" cannot match this film for sheer psychological chills, and "Angel Heart" cannot match this film for sheer technical brilliance.Stanley Kubrick is my favourite director (He should be everyone's favourite director) and his detatched, dehumanising style creates a kind of horror that is uniquely disturbing. For Kubrick, humanity is merciless and without compassion and, denied this for shelter, the audience has nowhere to hide. Most horror films spend time allowing us to bond with the characters, allow for comic relief, or create moments of human passion that remind us that no matter what happens we will always find comfort and protection somewhere in the human heart. That is not for Kubrick. Even before he goes insane, Nicholson's Jack Torrence is an isolated, cold and distant man, while his wife seems too preoccupied with controlling her own hysteria to demonstrate any compassion for her son. Danny's only friend is a spirit child named Tommy who talks to him through his little finger. The only man to show him a warm smile dies as soon as he returns to the hotel. The spare, clinical emptiness of the Overlook is a metaphor for Kubrick's style. Watching this film is like being trapped in a plain white room with a killer; there is nothing for us to dwell on but our fear. Evil is never more terrifying than when conveyed by a cynic, and Kubrick is possibly the most cynical artist in human history. That is what makes "The Shining" so good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking. Disturbing. Unforgettable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though author Stephen King (who wrote the novel that inspired this Stanley Kubrick masterpiece) confessed that he despised this translation, and that Kubrick had no talent whatsoever at directing horror, I don't think anyone can deny that The Shining is one of the eriest and creepiest films in its genre. It was also -- believe it or not -- very daring for the time at which it was released: two dead little girls walking through the hallways of a hotel, a decaying woman rising from a bathtub, and a father attempting to hack his family to bits were all taboos that were broken by this 1980 horror epic. Sure, it was ignored by Oscar and "honored" by Razzie when it first came out, but in the past few years it has secured a place in the top 10 lists of horror fans everywhere (it is currently at #90 on IMDB's list of the best 250 films of all time and at #29 on AFI's list of the 100 most thrilling movies of all time). How can a movie about a family taking care of a hotel in Colorado be so horrifying, you might ask? Well, first of all, that is not really what the movie is about (for more information regarding this matter scroll down to the end of this review), and secondly, Kubrick is just an incredible director. If he can make a two-and-a-half hour space opera with only forty minutes of dialogue keep you on the edge of your seat, imagine what he can do with a horror story? The results are simply amazing. Jack Nicholson proves himself to be one of the finest actors of all time (again) in a role that is considered by many to be his best. Danny Lloyd is perfect as the terrified child with a cursed gift (ironically, when they were filming, he had no idea he was starring in a horror movie) and Shelley Duvall gives a decent performance. I had to knock off one point due to several scenes that are a bit too disgusting to be enjoyed, but overall, The Shining is an unforgettable classic of modern horror.Overall rating: 9/10~*~ SPOILERS ~*~Please: do not continue reading unless you have already seen The Shining and are a little confused as to what Kubrick was trying to say through it. If you have never seen it or read the novel, stop reading NOW! Okay, for the rest of you, here's the deal: many people think this movie is about a father who goes crazy from solitude and tries to murder his family. That is not even close to what this movie is really about! This is what's truly going on: in the 40's, there was an explosion in the boiler room at the Overlook hotel. Everyone in the building died, and it was reconstructed several years later. The ghosts of the people who died in the hotel were still haunting the place, however, and they were particularly bothered by people who stayed during the "off-season." In 1970, a man received the same job Jack Torrance has in the movie and was persuaded by the ghosts to kill his family and himself. When Jack has the job, he is also persuaded by the ghosts to kill his son and wife... at least that's what the audience is supposed to think. What the ghosts REALLY want is Jack, who was one of the ghosts killed by the boiler room explosion that somehow managed to escape from the hotel. How do you know this for sure? Well, the picture in the Gold Room that is shown at the very end of the film depicts a 4th July ball in 1921, and Jack is in the picture (which explains the strange feelings of deja vu which he has throughout the movie). The ghosts aren't exactly trying to get rid of Jack's family, they just want him back so he can play with them... forever... and ever... and ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.k., this is one of those films where I can't point my finger at why it is so good. Don't try to find logic or common sense in this film, sometimes things just happened without an explanation. Nor even try to find a plot, there ain't much of one. The thing that stands out of this film is the acting and the way it is presented. There were a few really well done scenes in the film and is used/sproofed by many other films. Sometimes the 'scary' music gets used once too many times and it does get alittle rediculous. The way the atmosphere and emotions created is excellent. The acting by Jack is outstanding, but I guess it is not surprising since he did star in "one flew over the cuckoo's nest".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gorgeous film. I have never seen such beautiful cinematography. This is an all around great film. One of the truly great horror movies. Kubrick basically re-wrote the script on the genre with this film. Since it's release much of it's content has become clichéd through its use in other films. In many ways this movie mocks the conventional horror film. There are many occasions where the plot builds up the the point you would expect the typical boo or surprise, but Kubrick then side-steps to something else. The terror in this movie does not come from boo's or things jumping out of closets. It is a more realistic attempt to portray what the supernatural might be like. The scary elements come from slow pacing, mood, character development, and an objective camera point of view with the steady-cam. Many people also tend to miss some of the symbolic subtleties of this film. Many complain about the black man dying in the movie when in the book he saves the family. However this is essential to Kubrick's underlying message which is the suppression by white american males of women, children, indians, and blacks. This film also takes time to comment on child abuse, and spousal abuse. As well there is a commentary on the weak female figure who refuses to acknowledge what's happening. All in all this is a movie that works on so many levels. Truly horrifying. Great ensemble cast with toned down performances early, which really accentuate the over the top performances in the latter part. This is definitely a must see. But if you want gore, lots of boos, and rather unrealistic dramatical structure then this is not the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is one scary movie. But you will be more surprised and "suspensed" if you see it, haven't read the book, and if you do not know a THING about the story/movie. It happened to me, anyway! There I was, at the edge of my seat anticipating and expecting every move they're making will be freaky.The great thing about this movie is that it makes you imagine all sorts of things and makes you expect "scary stuff". Anyway, Jack Nicholson one scary actor in this movie. He fits in his role like a glove, complete with his haunting eyebrows. Shelley Duvall, I must say is a great surprise. From watching too many Fairy Tale Theater, I didn't know she could look really scared! Stanley Kubrick is a scary genius. And that's from only one view point since I have yet seen his other movies. We can never tell what goes on his mind... The Shining is a great movie, take you friends and family to watch this Classic and make sure to dim the lights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the film better than the Stephen King novel. The film is quite simply a masterpiece. The atmosphere of the film develops a building and nagging sense of horror that will envelop you. It is one of few horror films that achieve their goal not from shock value, via sudden jumping or loud music effects which are today's gimmicks as a shortcut to trying to be scary. The images, acting, and atmosphere of this movie will stay with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining- Best Horror ever....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the Shining (it had drama/comedy/horror and even slasher horror thrown in when the elevator bled, the girls were hacked by Grady) Danny Lloyd (Danny Torrance) was so amazing, this little guy knocked my socks off with his "acting" i have never seen a child act this good, too bad he didnt stay in Hollywood, he really had talent and what was he, like 7 years old??? Jack Nicholson was superb as well (i.e. Wendy, im not gonna hurt ya, im gonna bash your brains in) LOL he was comic in that scene.... This movie rocks, but only true King fans will totally understand the dark nature/gruesome stuff here.... The Book is better, but the movie has personality of its own..... The Shining would not have worked without Nicholson,Duvall and Lloyd, i even heard the boy from Poltergeist almost played Danny, well im glad they went with fresher acting Lloyd, he was the best.... The Shining is 10 stars in my book......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is the greatest horror movie ever made, period. In a genre plagued with lackluster directors, corny scripts and horrible actors, The Shining stands out as an absolute gem. Anyone who saw One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest must see this- Jack Nicholson looks even crazier here. And unlike many horror movies, this is genuinely scary. Stanley Kubrick plays on the viewer's emotions ruthlessly until one is ready to scream out loud. I am 17 and I still freak out watching it alone. The Shining is by far one of Kubrick's greatest films, and a must for anyone who calls himself a horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wendy, I'm home." It has been deemed the first epic horror movie, and this is certainly true. S. Kubrick adapts S. King's novel to the screen in a beautiful, hypnotic, and haunting way. Nicholson is by far the best actor here, while the remaining cast fills in adequately. Like always, Kubrick doesn't spell out everything for the viewer, but slowly reveals pieces of information about the characters and the history of the hotel. Unlike other horror films, Kubrick builds tension slowly, and often chooses the least scary angle for shots. I believe The Shining is about the lasting effect of death, exploitation, &amp; murder. The Overlook wants the Torrance family to join it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifying but the book is a lot better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie by Stanley Kubrick is excellent, fun to watch, and scary, the novel The Shining by Stephen King is much more than that.It is way more frightening and descriptive than the movie. I really don't think Kubrick understood what the story was about. The story the Shining is about a boy that has a strong perceptive power not about a nut that is possesed who trys to kill his family. Although these two things are the main part of the story the actual main idea is the boy Danny who has the power called the Shining.You may have heard that the movie doesn't follow the book very well and it really doesn't there are some major differences between the two.For example Jack's weapon of choice is a rogue mallet in the novel and an ax in the film which one is more scary to be chased aroung with is for you to decide, in the novel the hedges are actually topairy animals that come to life, in the movie it is just a hedge maze. In the novel Hallorann is beaten but not killed by the rogue mallet and in the film he gets the ax put through his chest.To sum up all the differences there is no blood coming out of the elevator. In the novel there are more characters to make the novel interesting and in the end(SPOILER FOR THE BOOK) Jack snaps out of the possesion of the hotel only to be possesed again to kill himself with the rogue mallet. (EXTREME SPOILER FOR THE BOOK AHEAD) ************************************************************************ In the end of the novel the hotel explodes because before Jack dies he forgets to check the hotels boiler.Just to tell those of you who are completely baffled by the ending of the movie, when you see Jack Torrance's face in the portrait this is simply tells you that when a person dies in the hotel like when he froze in the hedge maze their spirit or ghost haunts the hotel and since jack died at the mercy of the hotel his spirit now haunts it with all of the other people who have died there. The book does not state this because the Overlook blows sky high in the end of it and all the evil dies with the Overlook. This may or may not be the reason Jacks face is in the portrait, but if you read the novel and see the movie you probably will agree with me.I would rate the movie an 8.5 and the book a 9.5. They are both great and entertaining.Thank you for reading my review of the Shining film and novel I hope it has been helpful and enjoyable to read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once misunderstood...now a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many of Stanley Kubrick's later films, The Shining was misunderstood when first released. I remember hearing about it when it came out in the summer of 1980, and how fans of Stephen King's novel were disappointed with the film version. King himself has been outspoken about it--he hates it. So much in fact that he filmed his own version in 1997, (a made for TV movie with Steven Weber). But this is Kubrick's film, not King's film, and it remains one of the most intense horror films I've ever seen. The film has a terrific build-up and Kubrick's touches (the music, the sound effects, the "date and time" title cards, etc.) add to the experience. It is not a film for viewers who love quickly-paced slasher movies. The horror comes from the build up and the atmosphere. There is little bloodshed (except for Mr. Halloran's demise--a scene Kubrick put in the film to compete with Friday the 13th, perhaps?) What the viewer remembers most about the film is not the hammy acting by Jack Nicholson (his performances in his later hits like The Witches of Eastwick, Batman, A Few Good Men, and even As Good as It Gets can be traced back to his portrayal of Jack Torrance), not the much-maligned but brave performance of Shelley Duvall, and not even Kubrick's now-legendary camerawork behind Danny's Big Wheel. They remember the Overlook Hotel, arguably the most eerie setting in the history of horror cinema. I still avoid hotel rooms numbered 237 because of this movie. King's "approved" TV version just pales in comparison. And how can Steven Weber even attempt to play Torrance when Jack Nicholson will always be Jack Torrance? This is one of my favorite horror movies, and one of Kubrick's greatest works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kubrick chiller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is synonymous with Stanley Kubrick fans everywhere as one of the scariest movies ever made. Jack Torrance (Nicholson) takes his wife Wendy (Duvall) and son Danny (Lloyd) to look after the Overlook Hotel which is closing down over the winter because of bad road conditions.Shortly after they arrive, weird things start to happen. Danny sees unsettling things in the hallways, the snow's getting thick outside, and Jack (a recovering alcoholic) is going cuckoo and socializes with the dead that once resided in the hotel.While reading the novel by Stephen King, I discovered some very silly differences. In the book, the dreaded room number is 217. In the movie, it's 237. Book: Jack's weapon is a croquet mallet; movie: axe. Book: hedge animals; movie: hedge maze.The TV movie made in the nineties is much more faithful to the book but is missing the horror that Kubrick has added to the 1980 version. I still love this one despite the flaws that I previously named.Jack Nicholson's fine and psychotic performance is very underrated and should have earned at least a nomination for a Golden Globe or Oscar. Very memorable and worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I have to say the obvious. Jack Nicholson is an excellant actor and Stanley Kubrick is an incredible director, but this movie is actually a hodgepodge of confusing clues and vague images that doesn't make much sense. Kudos do have to go to the masterful and artful creation of the chilling images, the female twins with the huge foreheads for one, but at it's core, this movie is actually one very chilling ghost story set in a haunted hotel that turns into a giant sensory deprivation tank for the hapless couple and child trapped in it. The blood and gore plot is unnecessary except as a way to establish the increasing intensity of the script. The real star of this movie is the hotel itself with its vast rooms and endless halls; I for one would love to visit this hotel and look for ghosts if it trully existed. I hold these set as a standard for ever large looming edifice in almost every haunted house movie I have ever seen. The movie is weakened by a confusing back story and phony history that doesn't make sense. Too much was left out of the original King material to explain why the place is haunted and why it centers on Jack much less his son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is probably one of the few decent horror movies out there. It has horror, suspense, great acting, and outstanding directing by Stanley Kubrick. I admit, this movie was pretty slow at times, but aren't most movies? Some scenes were sort of disturbing ( SPOILERS ) like the 2 little girls chopped up in the hallway, and the part where Hallorann ( Scatman Cruthers ) gets an ax driven into his chest. Stuff like that. But one thing about this movie is it didn't follow the book in some ways. The writers thought up ideas of their own, which helped the movie alot. It still would've been cool if they had added some scenes that involved the playground, like Steven King wrote about in the book. That would've been good also. Well anyways, this movie is very good, and i recommend this to anyone. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never really got around to seeing Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" for a while. I had always heard of it but never really knew to much about it. But boy i thought Jack Nicholson was Crazy in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest" I was wrong. When I first found out that He starred in the Shining i decided to check it out. This movie is awesome. Jack Nicholson acts like one hell of a Psycho in the film which is exactly how he was supposed to play the role. I have to say the acting was perfect with Jack N. but the rest of the cast wasn't anybody special and the acting wasn't great but good. I suggest for people that are interested in Horror films to go see this classic film. I give "The Shining" 7.7 out of 10 stars. GO and see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the 110 min version when I was 14 and was disappointed but have since grown to love the longer 140min+ film. I've never found it scary, only unsettling at best but what I think Kubrick manages really well is to portray the sense of seeing someone you know turn into someone you don't (ie Jack Torrence). The film as a whole does not work very well - it's the scene-by-scene thing that makes it great, the best of them being perhaps the Wendy with baseball bat sequence.Personally, I think this is one of Kubrick's best. There are many things to enjoy - you might need to watch it a few times to find them all but chances are any expectations you have prior to viewing will not be met, this is Kubrick creation after all and he doesn't tend to follow the puffin genre-guidebook to making movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have always BEEN here....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mild SPOILERSIn the same way Kubrick's comedy Dr Strangelove wasn't necessarily funny, so The Shining isn't necessarily scary. By that I mean, it's not a film that you appear to be scared whilst watching it, but it is scary in the way it lingers long after, deep in the subconscious. Images, dialog, The Shining is pure psychological terror, and it is that psychological terror that makes the film what it is. Kubrick has to go down in history as a true cinematic force, everything used in The Shining makes it all the more offsetting, the long tracking shots, the predominantly red colour scheme, the slightly black comedy performances. It all remains in the memory, the powerful and disturbing images that most people don't even pick up on, for instance, take a look at the picture in the closing shot, and no I'm not talking about Nicholson, look at some of the other faces. Subtle eh, that's Kubrick for you. There are also some unbelievably perverse images in the film, if it wasn't for the fact that most people miss them I'm sure the film would have been more controversial, check out the scene where the man in the dog mask is giving "oral pleasure" to another man, it's pretty messed up, but theses are the images that I'm talking about, they get under you're skin. The photography by John Allcott and stediecam operator Garret Brown should also be commended, the use of symmetrical framing and over lighting make scenes seem real, yet at the same time completely removed from reality, if that makes any sense at all, like in the scenes where the man with the hole in his head toasts Shelly Duvall's character in the corridor.This brings me on to the acting, like I pointed out, there played with an almost comedic feeling, but this only helps to make light of the bizarre extremes the Overlook hotel is creating. Nicholson has been much better in films like The Last Detail, One Flew over the Cuckoo's nest and Chinatown, but his fame will always lie with his bravo `Heeeere's Johnny'. Shelly Duvall was also a lot better in Altman's Three Women; here she seems a little uncomfortable with the material (and anyone who's seen The making of The Shining will know she had a serious case of the flu). But Danny Lloyd impresses with his first film and Scatman Crothers helps gives his slightly under written role a real human side. My favourite scene in the film is with Jack in the bathroom with Phillip Stone's eerie Delbert Grady (`I Corrected them')... Brilliantly written and shot in order to build the feeling of isolation that Jack is going through. Let's not forget that that is what the Shining is about - isolation, a man struggling with his inner demons. So if you're a Kubrick fan and you haven't yet seen this film then act now, it's one of the best psychological movies ever made, and I took the liberty not to call it a "horror" film.9/10</fullReview>

I loved the actors/actresses in the movie, but after I read the book, I thought to myself why did edit the movie so short...why was everything so different. Then I watched the Tv series that was on ABC I think. It made a whole lot of more sense than the Original movie did. Don't get me wrong the movie was still the best, but if you liked the movie (I Did) then you'll love the Tv series even better. SPOILERS AHEAD-TV SERIES!!! In the movie-it had a Labrynth in it, and in the book it wasn't a labrynth it was hedge animals that came to live. The relationship of Jack and Wendy were more explained about the abuse and the drinking....Wendy had blonde hair in the book and tv show, in the movie Shelly Devull of course didn't...even though that is a minor part of it. Danny was more powerful, as he could get a hold of Dick Haloran by contacting through his thoughts...the movie didn't show that well enough the tv show did, infact so that Dick had bloody noses and almost falling over with a heart-attack in a store...1000 of miles away. Dick did not die of course in the book, and the show carried that out as well. (Which I liked Dick, I was glad he didn't die) In the book it mentioned Jack had to dump the boiler before it got too full or the hotel would explode...the movie didn't mention nothing about a boiler. Danny-having his episodes where he sees Tony, in the series it shows more details on Tony, that he can show the boy the future. Also in the book Jack chews on asprin for his frequent migraines...they did so in the series...they left so much out of the Original movie, it just sucked. I wish they would of had Jack Nicholson in the Mini Series though, because he made a better psycho than the other guy did...Well there are numerous other things I probably didn't mention but I could go on. If you haven't read the book, I would if I were you. Then watch the televison series...you'll be much happier with the ending I am gaurenteed, you will also be spooked out of your whits...lol</fullReview>

I read the book and I must say that the book is not as violent or psychotic. For one thing, in the book Jack uses a crochet mallet and abuses Wendy more with it. Also Hedge animals come alive in the book, does not happen in the movie. Still, the movie is great and sometimes scary but mostly it is creepy and twisted. Which undoubtedly makes the movie better. Both the book and the movie give off a horrific thought: What if you were isolated with a growing madness, isolated with an evil that was in the mind of someone you love.

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of the horror genre so usually I avoid these films, but this one and "Psycho" (as my favourite horror-movie) are excellent. Jack Nicholson made his best performance (surprised he didn't won an Oscar!) in this movie, but Shelley Duvall seemed very unprepared on the set. Well, I'm not saying she's a poor actor I just believe that she could have done better. The story is original, hence very good. I haven't seen any other movies of Kuprick's (except "Full Metal Jacket" which was good) but if they are as good as this one I'd better go see them...!

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I've never been a true fan of Stanley Kubrick. Most of the films I'd heard of with him directing just didn't appeal to me. So I was taking a risk and going on the advice of my mother when I actually saw this film. I only wish I'd seen it sooner.This is sheer brilliance, right from beginning to end. The vast open hotel, the creepy music, the visions of horror unlocked by the child, and best of all, the total descent into madness of Jack Torrance, played excellently by Jack Nicholson.This is the sort of horror that scares you, and doesn't give you buckets of blood and gore from start to finish. In truth, it is rare. As Torrance slips further into madness, the script was often funny, and I was left wondering whether wife and child would both escape, or just one of them, or neither, right up to the end.If Stephen King hated this film, he is a fool, and I don't care how good the book is. If Kubrick said this was his worst film, then he's an idiot. Because this is just so good.9/10.</fullReview>

This film is full of spooky things which'll make you leap from your seat but unlike other cheesy b movies, it's not a bunch of half naked teenagers running around being slashed to bits. No, this is a unique film which scares you in so many unique ways...The part where the little kid runs around in his tricycle was soo...different, just the fact that all you saw was the kid running around with it and hearing nothing but the wheels squeek....the tension building up then climaxing with his meeting with the twin girls followed by a brief image of thier HACKED UP BODIES ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH BLOOD OOZING FROM THE WALLS. It was brilliant! For those who haven't seen this movie I highly recommend you should, but I strongly suggest you watch it with your lights on. Remorse P.S. To resist is to ***s in the wind, whoever tries will wind up smelly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've all heard about it. "The Shining is wonderful," "The Shining is great," and so on. Well, my curiosity got the best of me and I rented it to view...Well, not to mimic others, but this film is fantastic! It is truly amazing how a film made 20 years ago can still scare you today. I won't spoil anything for you, but I would like to point out some wonderful things you can look for:1. The horrific images that Danny sees. Look for excellent directing, especially with the arrival of the two haunted girls.2. Jack Nicholson's fantastic acting (of course.)3. Shelley Duvall's atrocious excuse for acting (don't expect anything great, here.)4. Don't be fooled, this film is NOT for those who scare easily. If you do, plan to watch it WITH someone.5. Listen to the score. It's very simple, but quite effective.All in all, I loved this film. Be sure to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few genuine horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the problems with Stephen King is that ultimately, he's not good at writing horror. This isn't a harsh condemnation; very few people create convincing horror; the genre is so choked with bad writing and bad filmmaking that successful horror films these days are almost always of the post-"Scream" detached-ironic-half-parody variety; few if any know how to actually use horror to actually frighten a viewer anymore. So it's not bad that King can't write a convincing, terrifying horror story; it's just bad that King insists on sticking to this genre when his forays into sci-fi (The Dark Tower), drama (Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption) and apocalyptic epic (The Stand) are far more successful.So it's not surprising that "The Shining" is at best an unimpressive book. Good thing then that Kubrick makes it into an entirely new creature in his film. Kubrick downplays the showy gimmicks King uses to make "Shining" a flat-out haunted house story and gives us something far more chilling: a portrait of a man losing his mind.In Kubrick's film we are provided with the inverse of a haunted house. Jack does not go insane because the house is full of ghosts and murder; the spirits of the Overlook Hotel emerge almost in response to Jack's madness. Up until the end, it is unclear if this entire nightmare is supernatural or psychological in nature; it could easily be nothing more than the tale of a man going mad. Nevertheless, it is chilling in a way that the vast majority of horror films never manage to become; its presentation, and not its content, is what proves terrifying.Kubrick's slow shots of the hotel keep us drenched in atmosphere and setting more than the activities of the characters; the hotel becomes as much a character as the unfortunate family members are. Nearly all of the terror is fueled by the anticipation of terror rather than actual terror itself; without the slow crawl of the camera to the woman in room 273, her transformation into a laughing carcass would be far less upsetting.Some have balked at the movie's slow pace, or its excision of some of the more fantastic elements of King's novel (such as the reanimated corpses of hunted animals), but the movie's pace and subdued tone are flawless. I have never been scared by the cheap gore of many of King's books and movies, but Kubrick knows how to manipulate the emotions of an audience in a way that proves far more chilling. Fear is a psychological phenomenon, after all; only in a movie that dwells in the mind as much as "The Shining" does can one truly experience the fear that horror is meant to instill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a lot about The Shining before I seen it, and knew a lot of what was going to happen in it, but it still didn't spoil this brilliant film. Mostly, I didn't find much of it scary, it was more unsettling and eerie, apart from the parts near the beginning when Danny sees the little girls standing in the hallway. The Shining has to be one of the best horror movies ever : the setting, performances (Jack Nicholson is just brilliant) and visuals. I haven't read the book, but I plan to (and apparently Stephen King hated the film because it's changed so much from his book). You won't be disappointed with The Shining. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent portrayal of descent into madness by Nicholson in this Kubrick directed scary film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 5/28/2001 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Excellent portrayal of descent into madness by Nicholson in this Kubrick directed scary film based on a novel by Stephen King. What seems to be lacking to make this a great film is some consistency in what was truly possessing Jack to do what he was doing. We get clues that there was a murder in 1970 at the same hotel, and later that something similar must have happened around 1921 with the strange coincidence that the top dog of the hotel back then looked like Nicholson. We also have a series of strange hallucinations seen thru the eyes of Shelley Duvall's character that lead us to believe the place has been haunted for awhile. This type of uncertainty seems to prevail in many of Kubrick's movies so I guess I should have expected this, but it seems that more information(possibly in King's novel) should have been included. But as a scary movie, with a knockout performance by Nicholson, as well as most everyone involved, there ain't too many pictures of this type that beat this. Sometimes the way to determine whether a scary movie does it's job is if you don't want to watch the movie again -- which happened to me, so I guess Kubrick did what he intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Giving it another chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets I found out what a great actor he is so I decided to give The Shining another chance. I decided I really like this movie mostly because of him. My favorite part is when Jack as Jack Torrence mimics and makes fun of his wife after she reads the manuscript with the same sentence repeated and she is scared of him. Shelly Duvall irritates me especially during her crying scenes because she snorts like a pig. What I like about The Shining video version I bought is that before the actual film starts there is a documentary about the making of The Shining filmed by Stanley Kubrick's daughter Vivian. With this documentary you find out a little more about the real Jack Nicholson, but Shelly Duvall still irritates me even when she's just herself. There is a touching moment when Scatman Crothers is interviewed. Since I had seen The Shining before I saw Cuckoo's Nest I didn't realize this was the second time for he and Jack to work together I thought it so neat to see him working with Jack again. My favorite song from the movie was "Midnight With the Stars and You" which was playing in the background in one scene of the movie, at the end, and continuing into the closing credits. If you are a Jack Nicholson fan and even if you're not I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much diversity in opinion here. Well, I really cannot add much one way or the other. I never read the book(will and want to someday), and I enjoyed the film for what it is in itself. The compromise from bringing novel and film together is often dissatisfying for many. Sometimes I like to read the book first, and other times I like to see the film and then read the book. As far as horror films go, this film is chilling, haunting, and suspenseful. It is a Stanley Kubrick film all the way, from the opening shot of a vehicle driving on the highway in mountainous terrain to the final shot of a picture on a wall. Kubrick uses his camera to perfection in many scenes, and it's his use of the camera that makes this film stand out. It certainly isn't the acting. Both the leads are quite horrible. Jack Nicholson overacts wildly and says one-liners like he is trying to impress the boys in the bar. I found his performance to have very little credibility or depth. Shelley Duvall isn't much better as his whimpering wife. Scatman Crothers gives a nice performance and Daniel Lloyd is outstanding as the young boy with powers, however. But as I stated earlier, it is Kubrick and his arrangement of scenes and his power to almost transcend the ordinary with his lens that makes the film a classic of sorts. Too many great scenes to list. The hotel that serves as the central setting is marvelous as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a masterpiece in horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining has been both praised and criticized heavily on this website. One can pick apart a movie to the last detail and find undesirable aspects, but with this movie, and any other Kubrick work, it has to be regarded as a masterpiece of film. There is much that can be said about the production of this movie. In the grueling months it took to film, the actors and crew experienced much of what the Torrence family was experiencing at the Overlook Hotel. As was typical of the director, he maintained a relatively closed set and spent many hours confined in the set that was the hotel. Also, on set with Kubrick were his wife and daughter, who helped with the making of the movie. The actors too felt the role of their characters. Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall, and Danny Lloyd did not interact much with anyone outside those involved with production. Jack was in a sense married to Shelly during the production, and perhaps this and Kubrick's own stress of the seclusion is what makes for the great acting. With this movie Kubrick took on the task of making a movie based on a very popular writer's book. This is where many of the criticisms of this movie come from. People are quick to cite the differences between Stephen King's book and Stanley Kubrick's work. Alterations must be made for film. It has to be viewed independently from the book, as the book was only a foundation for Kubrick to build upon. This movie remains in history as one of the scariest and suspenseful of all time. Torrence's character development is where the horror lies, and as he develops into a psychotic killer and up until the point where he is an ice sculpture [which may have suggested King's statues] so too does the suspense. The viewer does not know what Jack will do next.I believe Kubrick's attempt at a horror movie was very successful. It differs from most in the sense that it is not saturated with supernatural occurrences, rather, it deals with social interaction to express human nature as inherently evil. The only thing that I would like to know is what the bear and suited man that Duvall runs into are to be taken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Kubrick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is not an easy movie to watch. I will admit that. Its a Kubrick movie and its one at its best. As I wrote in my review for Eyes Wide Shut i state again that Kubrick movies are like a wine or beer, its an acquired taste and its a taste that some will completely fall in love with and some will never want to try again. I can sympathize with both sides as i was once not a fan of Kubrick. Some where along the line i acquired the taste and for me, its one i never want to lose. The Shining is a horror movie for disturbed people (a common trait among Kubrick fans). It does not offer anything easily as most Kubrick films are. For those who love (saturated, watered-down, formulaic) Scream and the like i offer this advise; Don't watch a Kubrick film. Period. Not the Shining, not any. Kubrick films are as far from Hollywood norm as can be and The Shining does not break from his vision. The Shining excels in his vision. He offers tight, long views of hallways, confining you, creating a sense of claustrophobia and a deep rooted fear. A real fear. His use of sound and color to creep into your psyche is infamous. Take for example how he shows Danny riding his Big Wheel around, constantly. In one such scene Danny rides on and off carpeting and wood floor and the repeated badgering of quiet, then loud, jogs your brain to wonder what is going on. He makes you start to think that something is coming from it and then...nothing. Later, you see Danny riding the Big Wheel again but unlike before Kubrick jogs your brain with the terrific image of the two girls. Then quick flashes to the horrors that occurred in the hotel before. For me, the constant use of the big wheel several times gives you the sense of being in that big wheel. Sitting there, peacefully like Danny, and then being confronted with a living nightmare. As far as the acting goes Kubrick loves to draw out something different from his actors. All his films present very over-the-top performances from Alex in Clockwork to George C Scott in Dr. Strangelove, even to HAL ( i know he's not an actor) but Kubrick is an extremist and he shows you this with his lead actors and characters. He presents a minimalist, simple, dehumanized story with people out of their element and acting insanely. Most all his films offer this wild assortment of range within the confines of a man/woman. I tend to think of Kubrick's work as filmed nightmares. They may not be your nightmares but nightmares never-the-less. He brings you into a story where people are being animals in one way or another. As Alex being a physical animal and Dave being an animal one step lower on the food chain to the Monolith (and a human's own creation in HAL). Full Metal Jacket speaks for itself in this regard showing how our own government creates (or tries to create) animals for war when you can't afford to have human emotion. Dr. Hartford in Eyes Wide Shut wants to be an animal when his wife tells him of her fantasies and he goes out on the hunt but comes up realizing what he really is, a human, and his wife, a human, with frailties and shortcomings. In the end, since this is about the Shining and not Kubrick, i say you give the movie, on its own, not compared to the book a chance. Watch it with an open eye and don't wait for the typical. Don't expect a movie like Scream or even Halloween ( a horror masterpiece in its own right). The formula to Kubrick films and the Shining is that, as with life, there is no formula.Beyond everything that i have said here, Kubrick's film is definitely better than the later TV movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So what if it's not like the novel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay...we all know that Stephen King didn't like Kubrick's adaptation of his story. I haven't read the original work myself and perhaps I'd be equally miffed if I did.However, nobody can deny that Kubrick creates a tour de force. The use of Hector Berlioz' Symphonie Fantastique to create tension and terror was absolutely brilliant, from the first moment you see Nicholson's VW Bug winding it's way through the Rocky Mountains. More than anything, I see this movie's brilliance as a combination of factors that add up to a riveting ride. Think of all the little things that make the hair on the back of your neck rise. The jolting sound of Danny's Big Wheel as he rides over the rugs and hard wood floors in the hotel. Shelly Duvall shakily chainsmoking her brains out. Scatman Caruthers waking up in his Miami home to realize something just ain't right back in Colorado. The seemingly mundane sound of Danny's Road Runner cartoon. I won't even mention Jack Nicholson because everyone's said just about everything that can be said about his freaky performance. Yes, the movie runs a bit long. But I never tire of watching it because I usually notice something new I've missed before. What usually puzzles me most if how the characters of Jack and Wendy ever got together in the first place. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, scary, influential MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One comment about this film that always seems to strike a bad chord in me is when it is called a bad film just because it is not like the book. I'm not sure how many people have ever read the novel, Psycho, but I can assure anyone that it is very different from the book. Does that make Psycho a bad movie? Not by any means.Now, I'll admit that I never read the Shining...nor am I sure if I will eventually get around to reading it. I'll tell you something about the movie, though: It scares me every time I watch it.Much like the original Haunting it's one of those types of movies that are eerie the entire way through and never give you a chance to scream. It has surreal moments where you feel like you're in one of those bad dreams that you can't wake up from. That's why it's one of the scariest (if not the scariest) movies of all time.And personally I don't care if the book is one of the greatest novels ever written. The movie is still scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turning an okay Stephen King book into a horrifying masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember if I read the book before I watched the movie. All I remember is that this movie made it hard for me to sleep, walk into the bathroom without opening the shower curtain first, or even just walk down a hallway. The book was scary but nearly as much as Kubrick's version of the story. What surprised me was to find out that Stephen King actually hated Kubrick's take. That's why he wrote a screenplay for it and turned it into that overly done TV movie version which had better special effects I admit, but none of the psychological suspense of picturing what might happen since King made sure you could see all of it. Kubrick put in his artistical watermark with his imagery and colors and music choices. Sure, Stephen King provided the canvas and the subject for the movie, but Kubrick painted it into a masterpiece that continues to frighten audiences today. That is what is lacking in the scary movies of now. If you watch them once, you aren't frightened for subsequent viewing. I can watch this movie 100 times and still walk away scared out of my wits. And that's what makes this movie a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining, starring Jack Nicholson, is a horror film that only Stanley Kubrick could create. Several of the themes Kubrick uses in all of his later films (i.e. immaculate bathrooms, dehuminization) are just as apparent in this one. The thing I disliked the most was the, at times, bad acting on the part of Shelley Duvall. Most of the cast did a good job, including Danny, but Shelley just didn't seem to fit the role. In the "Making of The Shining" featurette on the DVD, Kubrick becomes angry at her several times for some of her awful acting techniques. It's actually quite funny. All in all, Kubrick has made better films, this one was still good, but too long and, most of the time, exhausting. The introduction is way too slow as is Jack's gradual descent into madness. This is definitely one of the better horror films I have ever seen, however. Much better than the ones that have been released within the past ten years (i.e. Psycho (the remake), Scream (that atrocious trilogy) and Blade). Good, but no where near Kubrick's best. See the "Making of The Shining" featurette on the DVD if you can.***1/2 /5</fullReview>

It's really unforgettable, how all those hallways, doors, people laughing, people screaming and little children looking right at my eyes still can't get out of my head since the day I watched "The Shining". Of course, we cannot forget Nicholson, the best actor in the world (along with Al Pacino), who's just a genius. He plays a the role of writer Jack Torrance, who's offered a job for the winter as the caretaker of a huge hotel in Colorado. The movie deals with how he goes crazy and tries to kill his wife and little kid. But wait, that's not all!!...uhmm...it's based on the novel by...Stephen King...yup...do you know what that means??

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece. A film of complex character discovery and probably the most known film of Jack Nicholson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to believe it's been two decades since this horror classic first puzzled us. Though I didn't see The, Shining until probably 1988 on TV after countless viewings I still have many thoughts and questions about this film. If you know anything at all about Stanley Kubrick and his directing and producing of film you know that he always leaves the viewer to think and ask questions. I for one think that film should be that way, I know film is for entertainment purposes but viewers should think it not only helps them enjoy film but also educates them in the process. Kubrick has no pressure on him he always has a good concept and finds his work fun and his emotions help a film such as The, Shining. Stanley likes the mad with realism to make it interesting, and that is the entire concept of The, Shining. Think what you want about The, Shining many see it as the greatest terror ever. Really behind it all is a film of strong character discovery involving the issues of alcoholism and child abuse. Though I never read the Stephen King novel but I didn't want to because I know what a perfectionist that Kubrick is at doing film but both the film and story work good together. Jack Nicholson gave a monster and memorable performance as aspiring novelist Jack Torrance, who takes the job of caretaker of a seasonal hotel in the mountains of Colorado. Jack gave the most wild and out of control performance for an actor in film history. Jack was always the greatest and being unpredictable he really makes his work fun and puts every ounce of heart and soul into his acting. Jack Nicholson is by far my all-time favorite actor! Jack Nicholson was one actor who hit the mark on Hollywood for the century. The most memorable and quoted scene from the film is when Jack hacks his way through a door with his axe while his wife (Shelley Duvall) cowers on the other side. Jack cuts a hole big enough for his face to be seen and cries out: "Heeeeeeeere's Johnny". That line made Jack even more famous and brought a certain injection of light relief into a particularly terrifying moment when you think you're being brought down. Think back to the scene between Scatman Crothers and Danny Lloyd the conversation they have gives some meaning and insight to help you understand The, Shining a little better. Call it ESP or special powers but as Scatman says the ability to shine or they call it shining meaning the ability to know the future and know about bad things that happened in the past or even communicate with people without speaking by mind reading. I must say that Scatman Crothers gave one of the most beautiful supporting roles in film history he really helped The, Shining along. The only weak thing in The, Shining was the performance of Shelley Duvall it was like Kubrick and others had to pull her lines out of her she seemed overwhelmed with the part. The musical score throughout this film is absolutely great it has that chilling and tingling feeling to keep you in great drama. The setting of The Overlook Hotel and the winter snow made this film even more chilling. The big question is answered in the end though it will take you several viewings to understand and answer honestly, and that is has Jack Torrance ever been to The Overlook Hotel before? You find that the answer lies in a ghostly time warp of madness and murder. You name it a film of different meanings and a conflicting of past issues that are discovered and even (Danny Lloyd) Jack Torrance's son gives a fine performance. You have it all in this horror classic the best actor alive Jack Nicholson and one of the all-time great directors Stanley Kubrick make The, Shining a film that is very important to history for the way it makes a viewer search for hidden messages in a beautiful and lonely scenery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Shining" as a form of hypnosis.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having first seen this film about 10 years ago I can't stop thinking about the nature of its influence on the audience. I am not going to waste time on discussing the script, the acting, the camera angles, etc. All this stuff has been addressed well enough in other people's comments, and I basically agree with them despite all their diversity, because the only important thing about such purely subjective matters as comments is the integrity of a person's opinion. From this viewpoint, there is nothing much left to say. Instead, I would like to take a look at the movie form a different perspective, which in itself is not original, either, but is still worth a little more attention, necessary to emphasize the basic difference in people's perceptions of this piece of cinematography. I will speak in rather general terms, for the most part without specific reference to Kubrick's film. It is hardly arguable that an essential element of horror is the incongruous. Hence, the effect of a good horror flick must be of hypnotic nature, so that you should believe in what shows on the screen in almost the same way as you believe in the absurdities of your own dreams. The essence of hypnosis lies in turning on your subconscious. Hence what you see before your eyes isn't so important as what's going on before your mind's eye at the same moment. It stands to reason that for its full effect an act of hypnosis doesn't have to look like a superstar performance. The same with a horror movie, which doesn't have to be a masterpiece, or something, simply to produce a profound sense of fear. Reversely, no artistic merits whatsoever can help if the movie fails to convey this subliminal message. I guess, there is hardly anybody who would measure the psychological effect of his or her own nightmares by their "artistic" merits. Nightmares are scary not because they have a convincing "plot", or anything of that sort, but simply because the person is asleep, i.e. in a special state of mind that submerges part of the conscious deep into the subconscious, thus bringing the rational into close contact with the irrational, which is exactly what is responsible for the worst human fears. People are susceptible to hypnosis in a different measure. Hence different reactions of various parts of the audience. Some people are not hypnotic enough, and the mesmerizing passes are lost on them. The eyes of these persons are not turned inward, but only outward as they keep counting the swings of the pendulum, as it were, instead of going to sleep. These individuals are evidently terribly bored, and are consequently at leisure to catalogue a lot of annoying details about the hypnotist: the tones of his voice are not convincing enough, the passes he makes are not impressive, and, for God's sake, his shoes don't hardly Shine as they should. If you don't like Kubrick's film, there is nothing I can do to talk you into believing that it's great, and if you do like it, there is nothing I need to say further. But if you haven't seen it yet, well, that makes a difference. Chances are you just might like it, but the problem is, this might be a little more than what you bargained for, because the subliminal effect of this horror flick, unlike that of tons and tons of others, seems to be virtually never-ending. It's almost as if the hypnotist is gone without waking you up, and you seem to be stuck forever in your mental Overlook, just like Jack in the end. Of course, it's all mighty personal, but who knows? Anyway, if you happen to be the suggestive type, be advised that an excellent relief for the anxiety of your white nights resulting from inadvertently watching this movie could be easily afforded by reading the numerous negative comments, which, luckily, never fail to appear, so you will always be quite comfortably provided in this respect. For a better therapeutic effect, you might even feel like writing some such comment of your own. A ready-made summary "Who's afraid of the Dull Boy Jack?" would suit the material just fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is a mediocre horror effort, I have been scared more by episodes of Dr Who. Although the novel is a very absorbing story, (me being a knowledgable horror critic) it does not deserve the praise it recieves. In the entire film I don't think I was scared once and certainly didn't have to "sleep with the lights on", the downfall however was not acting ability but an inappropiate screen adaption, which didn't force the viewer to think or at any time be in any doubt of what the that his/her perceptions were incorrect. Although it might sound it, I don't hate this film, as films go it is quite good, it is just not one of the top notch horror films that it is made out to be, better screen adaptions of Stephen King Novels are Misery and perhaps IT (bar the stupid ending), which I would much rather recommend.The Shining is a film everyone should see once (no more).7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I did the wrong thing, I read the book before I saw the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which may be why I gave this movie a 7, the idea of making a horror-noir movie like Kubrick did is a big gamble, but he pulls off some great work nonetheless.SPOILERS people! The shower scene is perfect creepiness, so are those twins just standing there (the lighting, directing and make-up for that still should be commended!) I can't really see how Delbert Grady is creepy in this movie, he's better in the book! Which is something that I must point out... this is STANLEY KUBRICK'S The Shining, not Stephen King's. The book I liked better and has more suspense, but this movie is practically nothing like the book, so comparing the movie would be unfair. Of course I have to watch the DVD on this one, it seems the editing makes this movie a little convoluted w/ continuity errors (why did Wendy start carrying that bat around? I know...) Jack Nicholson's ad-libbing in this movie does develop his character so well, I wanna be like him!! (Acting-wise that is!) Shelly Duvall was starting out her career it seems, I don't know how her character was supposed to be, also with Danny, you just don't quite know what's up w/ him! If you want a plethora of madness, read the book, if you want a creepy film w/ thrills to an extent, watch this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is an exceptional film adapted from Stephen King's novel,but with a completely different ending,and even some different twists before the conclusion.All in all,this film was extremely well made,well acted,and put together in such a way that the viewer is entranced in the atmosphere.This is a first-class horror film.Many critic's expressed lackluster reviews of the film,right down to the performance of Jack Nicholson.To me that is all inconceivable,since this movie has everything you need in a good horror excursion.The cinematography was incredible,and add that to an expertly creepy musical score and you have a true classic. Every film has its flaws,and the highly praised Halloween is full of them.Perhaps the best,most likable part of the Shining is Jack Torrence's (Nicholson's character) progressive slip into wicked madness.There are so many classic scenes in this movie.This a must see for any scrupulous horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Movie tells about one unclear family's horrible happening in the Hotel. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a schoolteacher and writer who is hired to take care of a hotel in the wintertime. He has a wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny). Danny can predict future and past. They know through Danny about Hotel's mystery. This movie is based on Stephen King's novel. Director Stanley Kubrick is famous for the most strict and detail movie director. He spends 1.3 million feet of film for this movie. Before he becomes a director, he was photographer so; He has eminent ability about an angle of view to make beautiful. A beautiful image was extremely harmonized with scare music. That makes the viewer in strain. Also, we can see Jack Nicholson's fine action. This movie is one of the best horrible movies. If you like horrible Movie, take it.</fullReview>

Jack Torrance is a caretaker who takes care of the Hotel. As he must take care of a hotel during a winter season, he is staying in the hotel with his wife Wendy and his son Danny. Danny is a boy who has a special talent. He can see the past, also he can predict the situation in the future.This movie used variety camera angle and sound music helps to make a scaring mood. It utilizes psychology of people about fear, which comes from isolation. And this movie deals with a nuclear family's negative side that common family style nowadays. `Shining' is not typical horror movie.So we can enjoy enough the fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very interesting. I don't like scary movies because I can't sleep at night. The movie so far has been pretty good and has kept my interest. There have been many scary parts in the movie that really scared me but it is less scary because I am watching it with the class. I do not watch scary movies on my own but only when my friends want to watch it. This is my first time watching the Shining and I don't like it because the story is about a killer who kills his wife and his daughters. There is a boy with a special power who can shine, and tell the future and look into the past. I hope the movie turns out good and the boy can escape from his father trying to kill him. I did not see the beginning and I do not know what happened but so far its good and I hope to see the whole thing without getting too scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest movie ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think of a horror film, any horror film. Don't think about little teeny-bopper movies I mean proper horror. The Shining may pop into your head as it is one of the most terrifying films ever made. From the opening scene of the drive to the Overlook and Halloran's speech on "Shining" you know that you're in for something special. Stanley Kubrick totally revolutionized the horror film (remember, slasher films were at their peak). He was one of the first directors to use the steadicam method extensively and it has never looked better. For me, the gluiding cinemetography really gives the sense that the hotel is haunted. The scenes in which we see Danny on his tricycle moving around the hotel could not have been as effective without the use of the steadicam. Enough of all that camera work stuff now. Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance is a career best and Shelly Duvall, although not the best of actresses, manages to give an excelent performance. The line "Heeeeere's Johnny!" never loses the chil-factor like the rest of the movie, even Hallorans offering of ice cream to Danny is frightning. Delbert Grady's story of how he had to "correct" his family is quite possibly the scariest scene in the movie. The slow-motion effects for the blood pouring from the elevator doors is breath-taking.The Greatest film ever made? I'll let you decide</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most artistic horror film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SHINING (1980) [not to be confused with the horrid remake in 1997, which in itself should have been an insult to Kubrick,] can be described in many ways.To start off with one of the most crucial details, one must realize that they are watching a Stanley Kubrick film. What characterizes a Stanley Kubrick film?, one might ask. Well, that's not easy to say, but a "Kubrickian" film encompasses a particular genre being advanced by pioneering cinematography, stunning visuals, strong (and sometimes explicit) dialogue, and a high level of metaphoric art and symbolism. One cannot watch a Kubrick film with a relaxed mind and expect to be entertained. In order to fully enjoy and comprehend a film by Stanley Kubrick, it is imperative to think. Go below the surface of what you see on the screen and find a metaphor or symbolism that each shot represents. THE SHINING is a perfect example of this idealogy. One must rememember that in a Kubrick film, each shot means something.Second, this film is very reliant on themes and imagery to support these themes. Foremost is the pertinent theme of reflections. Mirrors enhance reflections and are key elements in the movie. It is through a mirror that we watch Jack eat his breakfast, not be able to see Grady (but be able to see Jack at the same time,) Danny watches a mirror at the beginning of the film while he shines, and it is mirrors that finally reveal the true meaning of the phrase "redrum." Reflections play a major role in the unfolding of the story. From using them to see that Grady is a ghost, to finding Jack's true intentions.The acting in this film is also superb. Jack Nicholson (as usual) in top form and to be able to believe how great he was in this movie, you'd have to see it for yourself.Lastly, the cinematography in THE SHINING is breathtaking. From the credit sequence following Jack through the Rockies, to the renown steadicam of Danny on his tricycle, to the tracking shots through the maze, I have rarely seen better camera-work.There are many more elements to this film, more than I could write in this comment with a maximum of a mere 1000 words. I'm sure that if you see this movie, and you're ready to think and be scared by plot devices such as tension, climate, atmosphere, depth, color, and symbolism (and not get cheap scares from computerized images of green goblins in the miniseries,) THE SHINING is the movie for you.</fullReview>

I think maybe it might be the terror of being stalked and killed by the one thing we could never imagine; our father. The one person who nurtures us and brings us up to do good and live in a moralistic tradition. All rules are broken for Stanley Kubrick's haunting rendition of the Stephen King novel.Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrence, a teacher who is a wanna be writer hoping to make it as a successful novelist. Jack jumps on the opportunity to grab the caretaker job that is available at the Overlook Hotel. He slowly decends into madness as the Overlooks possessed frame draws him in to do evil and claim more souls for the old hotel.Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers and Patrick MaGee give stand out performances in this Kubrick horror film. The photography and dead pan acting approach brings out a dryness and simple horror finesse to the screen that seems to be unmatched. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have very mixed feelings when it comes to this film; some parts of it were wonderfully done, others just disappoint.Stanley Kubrick has made a film (based on a wonderful Stephen King novel) that really terrifies the audience but still seems to fall a little flat. Indeed, there is something missing from "The Shining", a nucleus to the movie which could make it a real masterpiece although I'm hard pushed to say what exactly IS missing. There is nothing wrong with the direction, quite on the contrary, this was hailed as one of Kubrick's best. He makes splendid use of the steadicam, this perhaps being the thing that springs to the mind when you think of "The Shining". He captures the cold and empty atmosphere of the Overlook Hotel as Winter closes in with immaculate efficiency and there are few who could claim hand on heart that this film didn't send a shiver down their spine or boast that they held no fear when young Danny Torrance first sees the two little girls in the hallway.There is nothing really amiss with the casting of the film either, Jack Nicholson is probably the perfect choice for the role of Jack Torrance, the caretaker who gradually descends into madness due to a mixture of isolation and the sinister spirits that reside in the Overlook. The one gripe would be that it is quite obvious right from the start that he is going to go insane and that does detract from the climax of the film ever so slightly. The character of Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) is portrayed very differently in the film to the character in the book, who was a very strong and determined woman. The Wendy Torrance of the film is on edge, fragile and spends most of the time screaming.It just feels that the adapted screenplay lacks something and because of this the film doesn't really work to its full potential. Still, it's a terrifying couple of hours and it's definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining is not quite so bright after all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not one of Kubrick's better films by a long piece of chalk but that doesn't mean it's over-hyped rubbish either. But in relation to some of his other films Kubrick falters quite badly when he tries his hand at the horror/suspense genre.I've read King's novel and to some extent it is far better than the movie. But why King and his die-hard followers keep on banging on about how "totally different" the movie is to the book should realize that Kubrick ADAPTED the book into a working screenplay. Perhaps people should look the word up in the dictionary before firing off loose cannon.What we are left with is a decent psychological/haunted house kind of affair. Jack Nicholson is a good choice as Jack Torrance who is contracted to look after the empty Overlook hotel throughout the winter season with his weak minded wife and gifted young son.But this isn't his best role in spite of his rather deranged &amp; some would say "hammy" performance. He certainly convinces us that he is losing his marbles with that trademark grin of his but it all happens a little too early in the story. In addition the film either focuses on his gradual dementia or the spooky goings on within the hotel itself. Very little development time is given to the supporting characters.Little Danny has psychic powers but the story never exploits this rather amazing "6th sense". Instead we just see Danny riding around the floors on his bike looking suitably scared &amp; witnessing ghostly apparitions while wagging his finger at everyone.Shelly Duvell fails quite unilaterally as Jack's wimpy wife. No wonder Kubrick made her shoot one particular scene over 120 times. Her physical demeanour, body language and facial expressions just don't add up to the kind of character Kubrick had in mind. Duvell totally misreads what is asked and is utterly consumed by the overpowering presence of Nicholson's Torrance which makes the film unbalanced and a trifle goofy.In addition, Scatman Crothers, just like Danny, shuffles in &amp; out of the film either looking spooked or concerned for the young boy since they both have the same psychic talent, which again isn't explored in the film. And his cheap demise is really nothing more than a metaphor for Kubrick not knowing how to properly develop the character, so instead he just kills him for no coherent reason.But Kubrick does a good job with the scenery and the interior sets, which certainly offers a lot of depth to the ghostly story but all this is rather secondary to what is going in Jack's mind, which is never fully underwritten. Instead Kubrick has to rely on physical set pieces to emphasize Torrance's mental state by using either the maze, room 237, the axe through the door etc.It is truly a scary movie first time round. But after repeated viewings you feel you want to look deeper into the characters. But you find there is very little there to wonder how these people got together in the first place since they're all so individualistic &amp; one dimensional with their own little character traits which are never explored.The Shining doesn't shine that brightly in my opinion. The book is better sure, but it's not really worth comparing the two because that would miss the point. The movie is good, if slightly hyped because its basically a Kubrick/Nicholson star vehicle. I would recommend it because there is plenty to see and think about. It's just a shame the Kubrick didn't spend a little more time fleshing out the supporting characters rather than concentrating on Nicholson's diminishing view of the world about him.***/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's adaptation of King's masterpiece takes viewers on a journey into the mouth of madness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's The Shining in short is about a struggling writer who becomes caretaker of a beautiful resort hotel w/ his wife and child while slowly degrading into insanity along the way. Although this movie is far off from King's demonic vison, Kubrick's adaptation is equally chilling. Kubrick focuses more on the degrading mental health of Nicholson. While King attunes the novel more towards the experiences of the boy. Remade in 1997 as a made-for-televison-movie. King has many times stated his dislike with Kubrick's film. Even though King himself worked on the script the hodgepodge of makeshift actors couldn't compare to the orginal. For example Steven Webber (WINGS)feeble attempts weren't even in the same ballpark as Nicholson's enraged pychopath. Kubrick breathed life into The Shining through weird camera shots and angles. His use of the elevator releasing blood in slow motion and the entire maze sequence adds a sense of reality, that in itself makes it more that just a "scary movie." In my opinion this is the innovator of the intellectual horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky, great, difficult film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is one of the scariest films ever made. The amazing thing is that, when you think about it, it doesn't try to use those usual horror film tricks to make us scared; the apparitions are as realistic as real human beings, the pace is leisurely and unlike many inferior horror films, this pace with its disturbing atmosphere is distributed equally throughout the film. The problem of the film is that there are those who whine on and on about the film not being loyal to the book. That's right, because it's a film and the tension that is created in the book in some 300-400 pages cannot be presented in a film format, nor should it be even tried; by not slavishly repeating the plot and the views of the book this film manages to shift focus more to the filmic experience.The major problem of the Shining, however, is that the premise of the story is not clear enough: many people (like Maltin) have obviously interpreted that Jack Torrance should be normal in the beginning, but in the end he goes mad. But the point seems to be that when Torrance comes to Overlook hotel, he is already a time bomb ready to explode, he obviously is disturbed and dislikes his family very deeply. The viewer is left to determine to what extent this is due to the supernatural powers of the hotel. This implies that, as in other Kubrick films, the HOW is what the film deals with, how Jack becomes a dull boy, not so much the WHY. Why is more or less left to the viewer to interpret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1 of the scariest movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, good old Stanley does HORROR in a great way. Based on S. Kin's story about a hotel filled with ghosts. I've seen this many times &amp; I can just keep watching it over &amp; over. The camerawork was very good &amp; set designs were great. The music was creepy. Jack Nicholsen gives 1 of his best performances. This movie is famous for seveal scenes-"Here's Johnny" with Jack's head in door &amp; "Redrum," &amp; who could forget the hallway blood scene-absolutely creepy. The 1997 mini-series of SHINING sucked, I suggest u keep watching this horror masterpiece. Its the very 1st great horror movie with color as well. NIGHT OF LIVING DEAD was chessy &amp; dumb. Well, if u havent seen this masterpiece, U SHOULD, its great, its a instant classic by Stanley-1 of the greatest directors ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both a brilliant and frustrating film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the grand scale of Kubrick's films this is disappointing:- it's no Dr Strangelove. The Shining has very poor character development for Scatman Crothers, Shelley Duvall and Nicholson's characters. Duvall really is irritating, and you can understand Jack Torrance's isolation and lack of decent company in the hotel. Nicholson gives an amusing, insane turn, with bizarre proclamations like "Here's Johnny!" and the dialogue of the scene at the bar. The set design really is some of the best ever in film, and the direction of the scenes where Danny is riding around the floor is perfect. Visually it's great, and the extensively classical music is utilised to the full: that Bela Bartok piece is superb. It succeeds as a film in metaphorical areas, and as always, AMBIGUITY is the crucial element. The outright best part of the film is where Jack enters the luxurious 1920s Ball; the music there (sung by Al Bowlly?) is haunting, and again the architecture is eye-catching. Philip Stone's enigmatic English valet Delbert Grady adds just the right touch. The ending with the photograph affects in a similar unnerving way. The other great moment apart from the 1920s Ball is when Jack's writing is revealed. His character's motivation and depth is conveyed simply by this and the scene in the lonely bar with "Lloyd". The disparate elements of set design, music, brilliant visuals overshadow the actors and the story: that is perhaps the film's problem. Nicholson's character is far more sympathetic than Duvall's. It would make the world of difference if you'd have had a more engaging female actress, who wouldn't be so easily overshadowed (Faye Duneaway perhaps...?). Then perhaps we'd be more unnerved by Nicholson. It's one of the best horror films despite the standard horror part of the story being one of the drawbacks. Rating:- *** 1/2 (out of *****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Great Horror Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie scares me every time I see it. The music will have your skin crawling just like mine is with every viewing. I saw a scene from an old black and white film called 'Curse of the Demon' with a scene of a character walking through a hallway with similar creepy music playing like the hallway scenes in 'The Shining'. I wonder if that film is where Kubrick got some of his inspiration for the mood of this flick. The visuals are both horrifying and beautiful. And like all Kubrick films there is a good dose of humor throughout the picture.Be sure to find a recent copy so you can see the short documentary on the making of 'The Shining'. Scatman Crothers was honored to the point of tears to be involved with this picture as you will gather from the short interview they have with him. Seeing Jack Nicholson brush his teeth before going back to set is also good from some grins. A feature length documentary and an in depth interview with Stanley Kubrick himself would've been nicer though. Kubrick was such a private person I guess we should be glad they got what little footage they did of him.Jack Nicholson gives possibly his greatest performance as well. Shelley Duvall, Scatman Crothers and the little boy Danny do terrific acting jobs too. See 'The Shining' and watch at night with the lights out and prepare yourself for a night of having the wits scared out of you. Later alligator...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Torrence vs. The Overlook; Stanley Kubrick vs. Stephen King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was watching The Shining I kept thinking why this movie is probably the most slammed Kubrick movie (maybe Eyes Wide Shut, but every Kubrick movie is disliked upon release then is regarded as a masterpiece down the road). I looked through the rest the rest of his movies and saw that all of his "best" movies had been atapted from novels. I read A Clockwork Orange and thought it was somewhat different from the novel, the book even had a different ending (and I've heard that Kubrick never read the ending when he decided to do it, but he heard about it during production, so...) It's because Anthony Burgess, Gus Hastvford, William Thackery, all the authors of the novels his films are based aren't names themselves. Kubrick always overshadowed them. In this case, Kubrick has to battle over a respected author over who was right. To me, King just wrote a horror story about a haunted house, though it was a little more than that, but, Kubrick made, sorry if it's cliche', a psychological story. It was his most metaphorical film (besides EWS maybe) and used over the top performances to enhance that idea. I don't think Kubrick films should be viewed in the same way as any other movies. He is definitley a latter day Freud. But that's my opinion, I could care less what anyone else thought. Then why am I posting this.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be seduced by The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick wants to seduce you. He wants you to get real close, drop your defenses, so he can SCARE THE LIVING HELL OUT OF YOU!That's what Shining does so well. It seduces you. If you let it, it will envelope you in pure psychological terror. Some have missed this point, and instead have been caught up with technical flaws (it wasn't faithful to the novel, the acting was overdone, cliched, or just awful, etc) These people were not willing to be seduced by Kubrick's vision.Put aside your rational mind. Be seduced by the dark side of The Shining.The Shining is first and foremost cinematic art. If you look too closely at individual details, you will see flaws. But like a work of great abstract art, the beauty isn't in the details, it's in the entire picture. In The Shining, the moments of Kubrick genius far outshine (forgive me :) the minor flaws.*Warning* The following paragraph contains a spoiler from one scene in the movie.Everyone seems to have their favorite moment of terror. For me, it was when the young boy turns the corner in his Big Wheel and runs right into the twin girls standing in the hallway. They look so solemn. They start chanting "Come and play with us Danny...." then the screen flashes with scenes of these girls lying in that same hallway, "forever....", you see the axe, "and ever...." blood is splattered on the walls, "and ever...." and parts of their dismembered bodies lay on the floor.**SHUDDER**!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lack of coherency</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those typical movies that divides its viewers in two camps: those who loved Stephen King's source novel and disliked the movie for bearing too little relation with it, and those who love Kubrick films and called the film his umpteenth masterpiece. As a occasional admirer of both artists, I agree with Kubrick's fans when they say that a filmmaker should be able to use a novel as a start off point - sounds to me like one of the fun things of filmmaking: taking an existing story and do your own take on it. I also agree with the film's advocates when they mention the visual beauty (direction; sets; photography) as one of its strengths. However, it's the visual beauty that underlines the inner emptiness of the film.The problem lies mainly within the film's screenplay: 1. I totally agree that for some movies a script is nothing more than a blueprint (like "Evil Dead", which has a cliche "story", but can totally rely on Sam Raimi's direction and Tim Philo's haunting photography), but when the phrase "psychological" comes to pass and the film evolves around only three main characters, I expect fleshed out characters and increasing psychological suspense, but we don't get any of that. The characters are astonishingly one-dimensional people who don't seem to have a past. 2. Nicholson is nuts to begin with and spends the remainder of the movie, at turns, being nuts-"normal"-nuts-"normal"-nuts. 3. There's no real (psychological) build up to the final, which just arrives after a rather meandering middle section consisting of incoherent sequences which without any problem could swap places. 4. There's almost no dialogue between the three characters (the first time I saw it, I kept waiting for an uncomfortable scene with Jack, Danny and Wendy around the dinner table - which would have been an ideal setting to return four or five times in the film to underline the falling apart of the family). 5. Nicholson plays mostly for laughs, thereby putting even more emphasis on the exterior and, alas, thereby also emphasizing the inner shallowness. 6. The all too obvious symbolism (like Nicholson dying in a labyrinth which is both physical AND metaphorical) 6. Kubrick's gives the obviously very tired Shelley Duvall ways too many close ups (especially in the final) thereby painfully emphasizing her rather mediocre acting. I had the chance to see it in the theatre about a year ago and people weren't afraid --and they were laughing at some of the meant to be eerie scenes, especially Nicholson's encounter with the naked lady that turns into a witch. King's TV-remake of the film may be a bit unnecessary (like one of his characters says in his novel "It": "Your book is in the shops and nobody can change a word in it") but psychologically and (too) emotionally, it's stronger than Kubrick's film. Nevertheless, I still give Kubrick's film 3 stars out of four, because he was a master filmmaker, a personal favorite whose lesser films are still ten times better than other directors best works. I have seen it five times now and everytime I thoroughly enjoy its direction, photography, and rich atmosphere. Try to track down Vivian kubrick's 'making of', too, because it's an enjoyable companion piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Kafkaesque style of writing makes "The Shining" a perfect horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick discussed Kafka's writing style--to him, Kafka's stories are "fantastic and allegorical, but his writing is simple and straightforward, almost journalistic." Kubrick didn't hesitate to point out that all the films that have been made of Kafka's work "seem to have ignored this completely, making everything look as weird and dreamlike as possible." Kubrick made a note of this in his film "The Shining.""The Shining" seems to be the simple story of a family of three watching over a large mountain resort hotel over the winter. However, it's more than that--it's a horror story dealing with the supernatural and the fantastic, elements Kubrick felt make up the "golden age of the 20th century." The film depicts life in the Torrance household as quiet and ordinary, with Jack as the aggressor in any arguments that may occur. Kubrick's adaptation of the novel by Stephen King (a clever but unserious work) is both satiric and serious, bringing about elements of the unconscious in scenes where Jack, Danny, and Halloran all have "shinings," or visions. Kubrick brings his blend of surrealism to the screen when he makes the world of the unconscious real, making schizophrenia in Jack's mind the focus of the film. The film itself starts out as a sort of brochure for the Overlook Hotel, told simply, yet with underlying tones of madness especially in the voices of Jack and Danny. And in this story, Jack's madness erupts without a glimmer of special effects or makeup, simply through Jack Nicholson's excellent performance.Surreal visions occur early in the film; we see Danny's shining of the elevator gushing out blood, an artery bursting in the Hotel body. Jack's mind is at first normal, real, during the interview with Ullman and during Closing Day. We watch him as he suffers writing block--sleeping in, messing around with his typewriter (or not), bashing the tennis ball against the wall, etc. This is all told very simply but with a tone of surrealism, as the hotel slowly takes over Jack's mind. His talk with Lloyd seems real, just two guys having a conversation, only the character of Lloyd is not real, but a figment of Jack's imagination. We the audience then feel that everything we see is all in Jack's mind, that what we're watching onscreen is the mental breakdown of a failed and embittered writer. Only when Delbert Grady frees Jack from the freezer, and apparitions appear in full form to the rest of the Torrance family, do we realize that the film has been a horror story after all, completely with ghosts and blood and suspense. This is Kubrick's style, in the spirit of Kafka--writing simple and straightforward yet with something deeper we may not initially see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The art of film-making, not Stephen King, were Kubrick's true inspiration..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sympathize with film-reviewers and fans of Stephen King who object that Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" is unfaithful to the original story and confusing because of the omission of certain narrative elements. But I tend to see these as positive, rather than negative, aspects of the director's interpretation, and for two reasons.First, whatever occurs on screen following Hallorann's conversation with Danny is sufficiently (though not completely) explained by what Hallorann says -- i.e. that the "shine" of a place is like the smoke that comes with burnt toast, which implies we are about to enter a world that is obscure, ambiguous, and (in the case of the film-genre called "Horror") nightmarish. Things aren't supposed to add up. Logic and reason don't necessarily apply. This is an uncertain ("smoky") place, where details are uncertain, images collide, and our horror is intensified.Second, Kubrick was a director of enormous imagination and artistic passion, and his chief goal was not to simply recount in literal terms what some novelist had to say but to compete with and surpass it using devices unique to the visual medium. Color, light, space, and the movement of figures through space draw us into the experience by EVOKING (not just describing) the unreal and horrific: the tidal wave of blood surging through the doorway; the silvery reflections and velvety white light surrounding the ghostly figure of the bartender Lloyd; the deep, tunnel-like perspectives down hallways and labyrinth; Danny's turn of a corner and sudden encounter with murdered (should I say "redrumed"?) little girls. In other words, the art of film-making itself, not Stephen King, were Kubrick's true inspiration.And this is what makes "The Shining" so darn scary. And even its harshest critics tend to agree that, if nothing else, it IS darn scary!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am 31 years old and I just saw this movie from beginning to end this past weekend. What can I say that hasn't been said. This movie scared me. As I said I am 31, and I have seen almost every horror movie made and nothing actually SCARED me like this.I remember when I was 13 or 14 and The Shining came on television. I didn't know anything about it, but I wanted to see it. As soon as it got to the part where Danny was riding his big wheel and he saw those twin girls I had to turn it off. It terrified me. I could feel his fear. Even at my age I could still recall those childhood memories of being afraid that something was there, that something bad was going to happen to me, those feelings of being AFRAID. If you watch this movie you will feel these same feelings. You have to, You can't watch it and not feel that way.The music was fantastic. The classical music just added to the fear. Even when Danny and his mother were in the azalea's in the beginning it was creepy.I have to give this movie a 10 out of 10 for the fear factor. This movie is so scary because it proves that evil can and does exist. It doesn't have to be in the form of the boogie man or a stranger. It can be anyone.</fullReview>

Perhaps because we somehow realize that the terror is real and we have seen it.

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick (1928-1999) needs to be remembered now if at any time by his most famous movie, The Shining. And I don't think it'll be a movie that people are going to forget too quickly! Although differing somewhat from the book, The Shining was quite a chilling tale with some very memorable words. We all know "REDRUM" and "HERES JOHNNY" and mostly memorable for the adults who were able to see the movie at the cinema when it first came out "ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY!" Personally I'm still trying to figure out whether it is better to be like the book or not? From my experience a book can be easily as scary as a movie if not more so. Should Kubrick have kept to the actual plot better? I'm not sure, but I do know that he produced a good horror movie and deserves credit for his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film had flaws, but thats not the point... (possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another outstanding film from Kubrick which is loosly based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. The plotline is basically similar to King's novel, however it lacked the character development and intriguing dynamic events.The two most memorable parts of the film were the following scenes: 1) When the Grady twins are staring right at the camera down the hall from Danny, and the shot changes back and forth from them being chopped up; and 2) After the bit where Jack hacks open the bathroom door and leaves, Wendy looks out and there's this buttler-type in a tuxedo and this person wearing a bear/dog costume kneeling beside the bed.The latter sticks out in my mind (dreadfully) because it happened quickly and had no apparent ties with the current events. It was a semi-scary bear suit, too.The character of Wendy is played very poorly, because she sounds incredibly uneasy when talking to Jack throughout the whole movie, even before he goes crazy. And the part when she was swinging the bat at him on the staircase was just pathetic.The only problem I have with the logistics of the movie is how he actually got out of the kitchen store room. Delbert Grady (which he got mixed up with Charles Grady, for some odd reason) was supposed to be a ghost in Jack's head. I thought this was true until they were talking there and he opened the door for him.The use of classical music was very effective, a real break from most horror movies with upbeat techno or rock music. The sound effects were great as well (Danny's trip through the hotel on the Big Wheel).As for any deeper meaning or religeous references that many people have commented on or suggested, I couldn't really find any stable ones. Basically, Kubrick wanted to make an artistic horror movie using amazing camera angles and music to create a creepy sensation. It was just a scary movie about a guy who got cabin feaver and tried to kill his family. It would happen to anyone. So as far as symbolism goes, there was none.I think that Dick Halloran wasn't used enough. He seemed so concerned about the family, flew all the way from Florida, and spent 6 or 7 hours driving. Then, as he walkes into the hotel, Jack comes up and axes him in the chest. There could've at least been some sort of struggle or battle of morals or something.The maze could have been used more, they just had it when Wendy and Danny went for a walk, and once more in the final chase part. I don't quite know what Kubrick was trying to say in the last scene, perhaps "Go read the book".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick is the MAN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS INCLUDED*First off, Kubrick was the most imaginative director ever! This film is one of the proofs to that. Stephen King may have hated the version of his novel (he remade his own version), but I think this was a way better story than the book. In the book, no one died except Jack (blew himself up) and a couple people in flashbacks. In the movie, Jack freezes to death and the death of the chef Halloran was included. The movie took the audience to places where the book could not. The constant flashbacks to the murdered children in the hallway was probably one of the spookiest things I've ever seen in a movie. The ending in the book: Jack forgets to tend to the furnace and blows himself up. Just not scary. In the movie: Jack chases Danny (his son) through a shrubbery maze and freezes to death searching for him. Still not incredibly scary, but the image of Jack's frozen body is rather "chilling." Also, the movie changes Jack's weapon to an axe, way more frightening than a croquet mallet. The axe also makes the added death of Halloran scary and gory. Let's just say that if King had a problem with this movie, he's lost his scary touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is one of the best horror films in all history. It doesn't matter how many times you see it, it never gets boring. Jack Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance, and is perfect for the role, playing a perfect evil bad guy. With many other memorable performances, The Shining is a film to add to any movie collection. A true gem, it is filled with suspense. Not many films today can beat this massive masterpiece.Rating: 8 out of 10"Here's Johnny!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>has been creeping me out for 20 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailers for this film on TV when I was 14. It's been creeping me out ever since. It's a film I always have to watch when it's on TV. So here are a bunch of random thoughts about it... The big quiet halls, the grand ballroom and giant foyers so quiet it's deafening, Danny's ride up and down the corridor on the Big Wheel and the ball rolling to him as he plays alone in the middle of the carpet. I just love the way Kubrick shoots this stuff. The sudden jump-cuts to something REALLY SCARY, and then cut CLOSER and then cut away. What's that guy in the dog/bear suit DOING, exactly? The score is heartpounding. I agree with whomever said that the manifestation of the ghosts freeing Jack from the pantry is not keeping with the rest of the story and may ruin it a little bit. You don't trust Jack right from the beginning... he's just a bad, bad man, and you feel it from the first frame. The twins, of course, are insanely scary. Grady's (remember him from Clockwork??) hacked-up wife in the tub. It's been my favorite horror film of all time for many years, only eclipsed now by The Blair Witch Project, which scared me so much I slept with the lights on for over a month. I recommend The Shining 100%. It's just a sinking, slipping feeling into insanity and then heartpounding tension and horror laced with the creepiest most ghoulish images you will ever see on film. Seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The music IS 'The Shining'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout Kubrick's creative life as a filmmaker he was drawn to using pre-existing music as an ingredient to heighten emotional effect. Most strikingly his use of Johann Strauss and Richard Strauss in "2001 Space Oddessy" amongst others has given this element popular appeal and been a memorable aspect of his works power. In "The Shining" Kubrick use the music of Bella Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti and Krzysztof Penderecki in a more precise and detailed way than in his previous films. The music here cannot in any way be regarded as a film score in the traditional sense. The music by the three composers aforementioned are well established and parts of the contemporary orchestral repertoire, and were written with no connection what so ever to Stanley Kubrick's film. It is unlikely that anything other than a small minority of filmgoers would be familiar with the music of Ligeti or Penderecki, and so would not recognise immediately, if at all. that this work exists successfully in itself in its own right. It sounds very much like an ordinary successful film score with the usual subliminal and emotional effect that a composed score is designed to produce. Kubrick's use of Bartok is however a little more risky in this effect. Though not a popular piece of classical music it is one which a good many people would be familiar with. It is a masterpiece of 20th century musical composition. It is probable that Kubrick was aware of this in his credit of the pieces full title at the end of the film, which he fails to make with regards to Ligeti or Penderecki. The Bartok piece here in question is his "Music for strings, percussion and celesta". It was written in 1936 and has no programmatic element. As a music lover, it is likely that Kubrick would have been very familiar with this piece. Bartok's music has a particular sound world which comprises a number of elements, particularly in the third movement of this piece which is a fine example of what is known as his "Night Music". The Night Music often made up the intense slow movements of his most important works, particularly his string quartets, regular features of which are atmospheric special effects produced by string instruments (Glissandi, Pizzicato, Harmonics and Tremolos) which contribute to a feeling of dreamlike unreality. This music has often been described as "nightmarish" or "supernatural" in its effect. It is likely that Kubrick was drawn to this expression of psychological darkness as part of his creative process. Ligeti and Penderecki have also developed the use of these musical techniques in their own work using Bartok as an antecedent thus making their music relevant and organic as the score to this film. The composition of a film score is normally the very last creative part of a project. A film composer would compose music timed, frame by frame, second by second, to an existing edited version of the completed film, which impose particular limitations upon the artists creative expression. No such limitations however were imposed upon the composition of the music already mentioned, which reflects in its complex quality, so in choosing particularly the Bartok, Kubrick would have to reverse the process and create much of his film around an already established dramatic concept. In a documentary film "The Making of The Shining" by Vivienne Kubrick, there are examples of rehearsal and shoots where the actors are audibly aware of the music that they are acting with. In this sense Kubrick could be described as a choreographer and his actors as dancers. It is likely that Nicholson and Duvall would have familiarised themselves with the music in order to better time certain actions and lines and rehearsed intensely in order to achieve the precision required. There are several examples of this precision which could not have been achieved in any other way and are beyond coincidence: the swiping out of paper from Jack's typewriter; Jacks waving of hands through the hotel corridors; the punctuation of Danny's question to his father in the bedroom; Danny's ice-slide from the bathroom window (illustrated with help from Penderecki's Glissando, itself a slide on string instruments). These are just some examples of the relationship between the actors and the music. In other parts of the film the relationship is between film editor and music and would have been achieved in the editing studio. The whole general effect of these techniques is one of precision and power and must certainly have been a fundamental element of Kubrick's entire creative process in this project. It was a unique and original way of working with film. As a result of this process Kubrick was able to produce scenes in relation to particular sections of music which look very much like tableaux, like scenes from ballet. The emergence of the ghostly nude woman from the bath in room 237 to Penderecki's music is a particularly fine example of this choreography. Kubrick's choices, understanding and directional mastery with regards to the music make these techniques absolutely successful in their effect. Without this musical element "The Shining" could not have had its full effect. The music chosen has a surrealism all of its own. When it is heard the viewer knows that something supernatural is about to develop. The narrative steps out of reality and enters its own dream world. Kubrick owes a debt to the genius of his composers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To my recollection I was never so scared after watching a movie than I was after watching The Shining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that this is my favorite movie directed by the late Stanley Kubrick. Apparently Stephen King was not happy about what Kubrick had done with the movie because there was a second movie done, by King. I did not have the chance to watch the second one. To my recollection I was never so scared after watching a movie than I was after watching The Shining. It scared me to death then and it still has the same effect on me now. Every time I watched a scaring movie, my mother would just say: "this is just a movie!" I kept that in mind, but when "Danny Torrance " Danny Lloyd (Will: The Autobiography of G. Gordon Liddy) was riding his tricycle, and I saw the pattern of the carpet, I knew that he was on the third floor where he was not supposed to go. I knew the two girls would appear, that was shivering. Those movies about reincarnation, madness, pictures on the wall from decades ago with the same faces of people that are now alive, make my hands cold. I get so frightened!!! I tend to love comedy, and horror movies are very far from that, but this movie is a classic. It is not gory and has the psychological impact in a very Hitchcock style, where the audience knows what is going to happen before the character does. It makes a movie very eerie, because somehow, although we know it is a movie, we all scream trying to give notice to the character that he or she is in real danger. I recommend this movie because it is a horror movie indeed. That maze where "Jack Torrance" Jack Nicholson (As Good as it Gets) finally dies, is frightening. Danny was so good figuring out how to get back. Scary!!!! The music by Béla Bartók, Hector Berlioz, György Ligeti, that modernism and dissonance gives the movie even more realism. My favorite scenes: When they are driving up to the hotel. Danny meeting "Dick Hallorann" Scatman Crothers(Roots) and they both have the shining. Plainly speaking just telepathy! When Dick comes to rescue "Wendy Torrance" Shelley Duvall (The Portrait of a Lady). Most memorable scene: When Jack is getting to the bathroom door and goes: "Here is Johnny." Favorite quotes: Mr. Halloran: "Some places are like people: some shine and some don't." Danny: "Redrum! Redrum! Redrum!" Jack typing "All work and no play make Jack a dull boy..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre and frightening horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've never seen a Stanley Kubrick film, this movie will not make sense to you. If you have seen a Kubrick film, this movie will not make sense to you. Standard Kubrick fare, yet The Shining stands alone in the bizarre/frightening horror category, if there is such a thing. Jack Nicholson gives yet another parody of Jack Nicholson throughout The Shining, and that is probably what gives the movie any cohesion at all. If it sounds like I didn't like the movie, that is not my point. My point is simply this - if you like weird horror movies, and I do, then you will like The Shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the few horror movies I've liked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually dislike horror movies. Most horror movies are stupid in many ways, so the first great thing about The Shining is that it avoids many common horror movie flaws.Most horror movies are good at delivering startling moments, like villains jumping victims from off camera, but bad at gradually building suspense. They're often too eager to jump right into the gore, apparently working on the theory that if one bloody murder is scary, twenty of them will be terrifying. (But maybe such movies are just getting rid of the worst actors, leaving more screen time for the less-bad actors.) Kubrick knew that the threat that something bad will happen can be scarier than actually seeing it happen.The motivations of the villain are often poorly explained, in the rush to get to the gore. If we don't have some idea of why the villain wants to hurt the victims, it's harder to maintain belief of the movie in general. Explanations are typically simplistic; a few words suggesting that the villain is a "psycho killer", a "monster", "evil", or "possessed". Jack is carefully revealed as an on-the-wagon alcoholic with a temper he hasn't always kept under control, entering an environment that had been the scene of a past multiple murder and suicide, and the site of disturbed graves. We aren't told which factors cause his descent into violent madness, but we have plenty of possibilities, so his madness is entirely believable.Isolation from possible rescue is another horror movie convention, often done badly but here done right. Sometimes the victims remain isolated only because of stubbornness or stupidity. Often villains come up with a trick to insure the isolation that only works because the plot needs it to work. The Shining tells us from the start that the radio is necessary because the phones often don't last through the winter, and that the hotel is a very long snow-cat drive from the nearest civilization. Not only is the isolation clear from the start, it's also a possible reason for Jack's madness.Yet another horror convention this movie overcomes is the typical pattern of unnaturally stupid victims and villains who are unreasonably powerful or know things they have no way of knowing. (This paragraph contains spoilers.) Wendy may seem a bit dim to some viewers, but when Jack becomes clearly dangerous, she's no fool. Danny is clever in trying to escape the danger, particularly for a child. Hallorann is the only one who seems foolish in the face of danger; if his sense of need to come to the rescue was so great, it seems he should have been more cautious. Jack is no more dangerous than one could expect an armed madman to be, and often vulnerable. Only his escape from the pantry required powers that had to come from the hotel's ghosts rather than from himself -- making the ghosts real in that way was the movie's sole fault, in my opinion.The real strength of the movie, however, isn't avoidance of common mistakes of horror movies. It's great movie-making craft. The directing is Kubrick perfectionism. The cinematography is a matter of wonder, particularly in the Steadicam maze scene and the scenes of Danny exploring the hotel. The sound in the tricycle ride over wood and carpet is a memorable detail. The music is great, particularly the Carlos piece that had been meant for A Clockwork Orange.All of the acting was at least competent, and much of it was brilliant. Jack Nicholson's building madness was intense. Shelley Duvall's acting (even if she didn't prepare well on the set) was pretty good when she was just the somewhat annoying bored wife, and her terror face was outstanding. Danny Lloyd was cute and very competent, particularly when playing both Danny and his possibly-imaginary, possibly-supernatural friend Tony. Scatman Crothers was very good. All the supporting characters -- the ghosts, mainly -- were competent or better.The story has been debated extensively. I can't compare it to the book or the television remake, since I either haven't seen them or don't remember them. But it stands well on its own. Did Jack crack up because of inner madness, did the haunted hotel push him over the edge, or did the hotel choose him to be the caretaker because he was near madness already? Were the ghosts real, or figments of the isolated characters' imaginations? The movie doesn't entirely answer those questions, but leaves them to our imaginations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick is dishonest about the music scores......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst utmost respect is donned on the late Kubrick for this masterpiece, there is some dishonesty in the closing credits concerning the music.The three composers whose music he used are Bartok, Ligeti and Pendereki, and Kubrick only gives full credit to Bartock. He names the piece.This is because any music lover would identify the piece by Bartok because in the music world it is too well known. He HAS to fully credit it. However, why no full credit to the other two composers? The pieces used are lesser known, but any musician would know them well.....Kubrick knew the POWER the chosen scores gave the film, in many of the scenes the acting was choreographed to the music rather than the other way round. The music is what completes the brilliance of this film.The only reason Kubrick chose not to fully credit the music scores he used is simple. He wanted the credit himself! Bartock was the original creator of the style of music. Bartok's "Night Music". Ligeti and Pendereki created music of the same style using Bartoks original creations as their inspiration. Bartok is well known, Ligeti lesser so.Kubrick KNEW he could probably getaway with it as only a serious musician would notice.KUBRICK OWED A DEBT TO THE GENIUS OF HIS COMPOSERS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relentlessly scary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is (I think) the very first movie directed by Kubrick that I ever saw. I can't say I've ever looked back. There is little to tie all of Kubrick's films together - one of the greatest things I admired about him was his ability to triumph in a number of different genres. And this is certainly a triumph of horror."The Shining" is the only movie that really makes me scared any more - and it doesn't get any easier each time I watch it. The atmosphere is so intense, it will leap out of the film and invade your house. When you leave the cinema, or stop the video recorder, you will look at everything around you very differently. When I saw the movie a couple of years ago, and I had a live-in job at a hotel, I could not help but shiver as I wandered through the corridors late at night to check the fire doors and so on. It is a film you will never forget.What's clever is that Kubrick deftly manages to avoid making you sympathise with any character - you feel sorry for Shelley Duvall, certainly, but you can also see why Jack Nicholson might find her so irritating. Scatman Crothers as Mr. Halloran is also an interesting character, although his position in the film is one open to debate: is he there to symbolize hope? To provide the kid with the knowledge of his powers and that he is not alone?Classic scene follows classic scene; when you think it can't get tenser, it does; when you think the images and sound can't unnerve you any more, they will - this is a film that constantly surprises, shocks and genuinely frightens. Strange, then, that Stephen King - who wrote the book on which the film is based) should dislike the film so much (he once famously stated that Kubrick knew nothing about horror). The acting is good - Nicholson as the questionably mad/possessed/tortured author, Duvall as the irritating wife pushed to the limits, Danny Lloyd as the troubled child.But the true genius lies in the steadicam sequences, the stunning set, the brilliant cinematography and sound, the interspersed shots of horrors past and the inevitability of horrors future. This is a stylish film, the work of a true genius, recently voted the scariest film of all time by "Empire" magazine in the United Kingdom. It is a film that you will remember, simply because you won't be able to forget it. How many films can you say that of today?Horror has come a long was since 1980 - the re-writing of the slasher movie with "Scream", the introduction of new and exciting premises of horror such as "The Blair Witch Project", and slicker, and more intelligent thrillers like "The Sixth Sense". (I appreciate these are recent films, but I cannot think far back enough at the moment!) However, all horror films have a long way to go before they can measure up to this film - one of the most intense and inspired horror films cinema has to offer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would take a 200-page novel to fully explain everything explored in Kubricks The Shining.It would take more than 1000 words to give high enough praise to Jack Nicholson for managing to give a performance that is at once incredibly horrific,and at the same time,darkly comic.Nicholson portrays Jack Torrances slide into madness vey subtly,giving us only clues to the approaching insanity that will lead us through room 237,dead black chefs and doorways in desperate need of carpentry work. Kubrick allows the film to start off excruciatingly slowly,and we get to know the hotel as almost human before it starts to exert itself on the mind of its inhabitants.The cop-out that The Overlook was built-on-an-indian-burial-ground is merely an excuse for the viewer not insightful enough to see the true reason for Torrances decline:isolation,and the paranoia it creates.While Danny can see the past and the future,there is nothing really supernatural going on at the hotel,merely psychological. The film supports the theory that all of Kubricks work is devoid of emotion,there is no happy ending,no moments of tenderness,no fleeting declarations of love,but why should there be ? This is a horror film after all,with all the requisite features:decapitated children,waves of blood,naked women and an axe murderer.What more can you ask.And its all masterfully portrayed by Grandfather Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading a lot of comments and critiques posted here and elsewhere, there doesn't seem to be much else left to say about The Shining, but I agree with those who see it as a masterpiece despite its flaws. In fact, it's questionable whether some `flaws' were not in fact intentional ? for example, the paper reappearing in the typewriter. Either way, continuity fetishists and horror-film geeks who take the film at face value are totally missing the point.Although he's been criticized for gutting Stephen King's novel (haven't read it), Kubrick was too original and too savvy to simply ape genre conventions. His use of stylistic genres, well-known source material, and name-brand actors seems less an end in itself than a clever means to draw people to his entertaining films (How else do you explain Tom Cruise?). Once he's distracted you, he slips you the mickey. Among other things, The Shining is about the spiral of madness - by nature and by nurture - and the pressures of social responsibility. All work and no play?The horror of The Shining operates on a different level than the usual formula. While the haunted-house scenario makes the perfect recipe, the suspense of the film comes from a deeper level than `What's around the corner?' or `Who was that?' (Most of the time we know.) Visually, the film is constantly engaging, slowly unveiling the empty hotel's eerie splendor, with the camera's cold eye lurking like a ghost behind each character. But beneath the surface, it also questions the nature of `visions' and at what point they actually become reality. (`Click?') The confusion of reality and imagination leads to insanity. Ultimately, the two can't coexist, and since Jack has been seduced by the imaginary ? a glittering world where he is master of his own domain, rather than a failure with a feeble wife and a strange son ? reality is a bigger threat, so he sets out to destroy it.As technically brilliant as the film is, it wouldn't function without the subtle threads that Kubrick has woven into it. The effect is mostly subliminal, weeding its way into your subconscious. There is the strange theme of a dog: Jack's line about the `hair of the dog that bit me'; Danny watching Roadrunner-who is constantly pursued by a coyote; the man in the dog suit when Wendy runs up the stairs; and in the scene where Wendy discovers what Jack has been writing all this time, the camera slowly panning across a wall of photographs and then to her back as she looks at the typewriter before Jack's profile emerges at right of the frame, looking for all the world like a lone canine stalking its prey.And why the Doublemint twins are so disturbing seems like more than just strength in numbers: Danny, in a sense, also has a twin, and apparently - unlike us - they can see him.The theme of the Indian burial ground ? a perfect horror-film cliché ? has also been seen as a clue to the film's allegory of the white man's rape of America. If that was Kubrick's intention, then it's no mistake that Jack's predecessor (Grady) was an Englishman, and his incredulous words `You've always been here' take on another meaning. It also explains why Jack (apparently departing from King's book) picks up an axe: more than just a symbol of labor (`All work?'), it's a tomahawk. Not many directors could load so much into a single image, but in Kubrick's case it would be more surprising if he didn't.A lot of comments seem to view the ending as disappointment or a failure, mostly because it doesn't make sense or resolve the conflict. The only explanation that seems to make sense is that the ending is totally symbolic, and that the central conflict all along has been whether Jack can confront his inner self and keep himself from going mad. Maybe Nicholson is too mad himself to actually communicate the process ? he just flips a switch. But the maze is already established as a symbol of Jack's own mind (and, like Jack, it has `always been there'). At its center are the wandering, invasive figures of his wife and son. When Jack enters the maze, he is chasing after himself, in the form of his son, and his single intention is to murder the last piece of himself. He follows the tracks (that dog again), but they disappear, and rather than following them back out, he gives up, defeated by his own madness. He stands howling in the freezing cold, surrounded by bushes (trees) and armed with an axe. It's an ineffectual weapon with which to escape his lonely predicament, just as the typewriter cannot free him from the splendid isolation of the Overlook Hotel.</fullReview>

Most people I know who've seen it rate it as one of the scariest movies of all time. I'm sorry, but I don't agree. It has its creepy moments. Jack Nicholson does a fair job of becoming increasingly deranged, there is some tension there, but scary? I don't know. Shelly Duvall is horrid, I just keep visualizing her as Olive Oyl, and it doesn't work. She is whiny and ineffectual; it is hard for me to empathize with her, and I find the little boy more and more irritating as the movie progresses. But the primary feeling I get is not fright, but utter boredom. Everything moves so slowly, so languidly that I find it hard to be interested, let alone frightened. I am not a great Kubrick fan, with maybe the exception being "Clockwork Orange"...so I am sure those who like his style might find it appealing. To each his own...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistic horror - worth seeing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's complex film about isolation and the lunacy following out of that is a chilling art movie. It leads right into the labyrinth of human soul. Wonderful are the usual slow backwards, forwards and horizontal camera motions. Lighting and colours are appointed in an exquisite way. Even the few bloodsheded scenes are artificial. No doubt, there is pure dread in these cold, symmetrical pictures. Danny, the little son knows that. He can see in his mind what happened at the Overlook hotel and he can also see what will happen soon, while his father turns slowly into a perilous amuck runner. Danny meets the murdered twin sisters at the long corridor. He also encounters a long time deceased and decayed old woman who attacks him. The sequence when his father is lookins after her in room 237 is absolutely horrible. The show-down in the maze is overwhelming. The only failing, I think, are the actors. Shelley Duvall is not always convincing and Jack Nicholson is too excessiv with his mimicry. But the music of György Ligeti, Béla Bartók, Krzysztof Penderecki and Wendy Carlos is a guaranty for additional shiver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's films are always impressing. Since "2001" to "Eyes Wide Shut". We've missed the best director ever this year and nothing is going to be the same without him. During all his career, he had made many masterpieces, and never a bad film. The only time he tried to do a horror movie he had great results: "The Shining" is there to prove.I just had the chance to see it some days ago, and I have to say that it really impressed me, specially because of the intense psychological horror.There are not many subtle scares. As I said, what really impress is the psychological factor. Still that, there are some unforgettable horror scenes: the blood gushing from the elevator, the dead body emerging of the bathtub...If you are fan of this genre (horror) this is a must-see. You can love or hate it, but it will really disturb you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepiest movie I have seen... More than meets the eye.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not add to the mountains of adulation already posted about this film. I will just say that I agree with most of it. The Shining was a great film, but was more than just a horror flick. That is, the entire film can be viewed metaphorically. With this in mind, "The Shining" becomes an arcane yet clear commentary on American history. The Overlook Hotel was built on Native American burial grounds. The United States was built on Native American lands.Historically, America has tried to suppress or "overlook" this fact, trying to hide the truth that our nation was built on murder and blood. The scenes of blood rising through the floors are symbolic, illustrating that this truth can no longer be contained. The images of Native american art, tapestry, wall and floor patterns are pervasive throughout the film. The hotel, in a sense, is America itself. Contained within are ghosts which slowly pervade Jack's mind, turning him into a murderer. Much as a father passes his beliefs to his son, these ghosts represent people's belief systems passed on from generation to generation.The child is pure, being able to perceive what others can't. He is able to see the truth, and is fearful of his father's dark potential. The cook possesses the same gift, communicating with the child without words. His murder at the hands of Jack symbolizes the plight of the African race at the hands Europeans. Shelley Duvall is the feminine, maternal power which tries to placate Jack, but realizes that he has gone completely insane when she reads his manuscript. There is nothing more she can do but try to find a way to escape.I realize that this sounds pretty "out there", but if you watch the movie with these ideas in mind, you will understand what I am talking about. Besides, I wouldn't put anything past Kubrick. He has a flair for being mysterious and cryptic. Look for the native american designs, the calumet baking powder, as well as the other weird symbols.As a horror film, "The Shining" is very good. It is exceptionally creepy, and there are numerous scenes which remain etched into my memory - but I think that the metaphorical aspects are what make it much more than a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Am I Missing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read several of the other viewer comments before writing this post. So far the majority seem to vote that this is a brilliant horror film. Dare I say otherwise? Before watching the movie I'd already read the book and was genuinely excited about seeing it produced on the big screen. I also was eager to see Jack Nicholson in the role of Jack Torrance (I've loved him since EASY RIDER) as a crazed novelist whose dark side emerges from a case of writer's block.Although I sat through 2 consecutive viewings opening night almost 20 years ago, I could not convince myself that this was another Kubrick masterpiece. It was certainly no Clockwork Orange and I was more than disappointed that the images Stephen King illustrated in his brilliant description of scenes like the moving topiary were not even touched upon. Jack Nicholson is always entertaining and he really is "AS GOOD AS IT GETS" in any role he plays. Even though his now famous "Honey I'm Home" and "Here's Johnny" lines are classic, they seem to turn what set out to be a psychological thriller into a psychotic comic strip characterization. If you want to see Jack ham it up in a horror flick see the "Little Shop of Horrors." Getting all your teeth drilled without novacaine..now that's scary!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks The Original Character Concept, But Still Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining", directed by Stanley Kubrick, is an effective, atmospheric chiller but lacks the original concept of the characters as envisioned by author Stephen King.Snowbound in the Colorado Rocky Mountains at the Overlook Hotel, Caretaker Jack Torrance is losing his mind. The only other people with Jack are his wife Wendy and their son, six year old Danny, who has a gift for seeing images of the past and future, a gift which is dubbed "shining".Jack is a former alcoholic who lost his last teaching job at a Vermont Prep school because of booze. A former drinking partner and colleague at the school, who owns stock in the Overlook, arranged the caretaking job for Jack so he could dry out, do some writing, and return to the Prep School. Except for the alcoholism, the screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson does not address these other character elements. We do not learn that Jack is actually a good man with a weakness who becomes slowly, subtly seduced and possessed by the evil of the Hotel. We cannot see the contrast between the two sides of Jack, the battle in his heart illustrated in the original novel. In the beginning of the film we see a man who is emotionally detached from others and just continues to spiral into the abyss.But this detachment could be a fault in Kubrick's directing style. I have yet to see a Kubrick film in which any of his characters connect emotionally. In scenes where the characters are supposed to be friends, there is detachment, a wall between them. However, this worked in "The Shining". It is a moody, atmospheric, creepy film. The visions the Hotel spits forth in the last act of the film are truly haunting and frightening. The editing and set design cause genuine chills up and down the spine. What could be more creepy than being one of three people snowbound miles away from any help in a huge Hotel which contains the spiritual residue of the most horrible acts committed by people against other people? And then put a little boy in the middle who can "see" visions of the residue?For better character development, I highly recommend the Stephen King written TV movie version of "The Shining". For one of the creepiest horror films ever made, I recommend this version of the story. It is far more chilling than "The Blair Witch Project". But then again, so is an episode of "Scooby Doo".   </fullReview>

It has ghosts, evil family members, supernatural connections, and that killer hedge maze. The use of snow to show not only the isolation of the Torrances, but also the true cold nature of the hotel is just a small example of Kubrick's brilliance "shining" through. I've seen this film at least fifty times, and there are parts that still give me the chills...

		<shortDescription>Among the best horror films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the makers of such effect-induced, plotless, pointless movies like the more recent "The Haunting", "Deep Blue Sea", "The Faculty", and many other such films should be forced to sit down and watch this movie, maybe with "Vertigo" and "North by Northwest". Kubrick can draw more from a small group of actors, a non-alive house (except maybe the elevators), and axe and a small, repetitive manuscript than most directors these days get from $100 million dollars.Granted, this movie couldn't have been made without Jack Nicholson. This may be a backhanded compliment, but no other actor has the ability to play a creepy, crawling-under-your-skin, all out psycho like Jack Nicholson. This is one of his best performances, and here he is in expert hands.The whole cast and set is made to give the perfect effect. There is very little actual violence in this movie, but it's ten times scarier than most of the so-called "horror" films we see out today. Kubrick is a master at using suspense to a real effect. It seems that any type of movie he made, it became one of the definitive movies of it's genre, and this is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is an impressive horror film from Stanley Kubrick. The story is about Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson, in top form), his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall), and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd) going up to the Overlook Hotel for the winter. However, Danny starts seeing things about the Overlook that present it as an evil place, while Jack is losing his mind from writer's block, and the evil forces in the hotel. As with every Stanley Kubrick film, it's thought-provoking (esp. the ending!). The scariest scenes in the film are:*(Minor Spoilers)*The twins at the end of the hall ("Come and play with us Danny...Forever...and ever...and ever), The woman in the bathtub, Danny's possession by "Tony"The music is also haunting, and stays with you for a LONG time, as with many of Kubrick's films. While Shelly Duvall gets annoying at times, it's (in a way) necessary) Ranks up with the scariest movies of all time (Exorcist, Pet Sematary 1). See "The Shining" ASAP.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a great film, not just a horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really never get scared by movies, and saying about this film that "it's a really scary movie" seems to me demeaning and dippy. This is not really a horror film, but an ingenious study of psychological archetypes. I think it is a masterpiece, like pretty much everything that Kubrick has ever done. The direction is very original and very excellent. Groundbreaking use of the steadicam makes the hotel itself a ubiquitous and omniscient character. It is amazing how Kubrick can work preexisting masterpieces of classical music into his films so well that they seem made for the film. I have long regarded Bela Bartok as probably the greatest composer of this century, and Kubrick's extensive use of his "Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta" is incredible. Nicholson's performance is perfect and bizarre, and every line is delivered so meaningfully and memorably. Even seemingly unimportant lines like, "See, it's OK. He saw it on the television." Like I said, I don't ever get scared by movies, and I consider this almost more a black comedy than a horror film. I grin with delight throughout this film, sometimes bursting into laughter due to the intense wierdness of Kubrick's and Nicholson's flamboyant interpretation of the madman. Memorable lines include "I swear I wouldn't touch one goddamn hair on his goddamn little head. I love the little sunuvabitch!!" "'What'll it be sir?' 'Hair of the dog that bit me.' Bourbon on the rocks!' 'That'll do it.'" One more thing I have to add: rack zoom in on guy in dog suit kneeling down in front of a guy that looks like Charlton Heston as they both stare at Wendy. Awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was watching this film again last night and I cant believe how it manages to scare me every time I watch.I am a Fan of many Horror films but all of them seem to lose there impact on me after a few viewings and although I still enjoy to watch them again and again they don't scare me like this one does.The scariest moments in the film involve the character of Danny like when he encounters the two girls in the hallway, the way the sequence is edited to flash the images up on the screen is almost sublimable and those moments in the film when Danny's own face is quickly flashed on the screen with his eyes wide open staring at the camera gives me a chill every time. Another thing i noticed last night was during the scene when Jack has just been to see the woman in the Bathroom and is talking to his wife in the bedroom about Danny the conversation soon turns into an argument and Jack goes storming out of the room. Look at his face as he walks past the camera for a moment he stares straight at the camera and straight at us watching the film. I don't believe that this was a Goof during the making the film I believe that this was done to make the audience feel uneasy and it certainly worked on me.I love all of those massive sets that were used for the film they really give you a claustrophobic feeling when you see the characters alone in the Halls and Ballrooms and the way that Kubrick's camera glides down the endless maze of hallways. I also love the way that Kubrick kept his camera often far back from the actors leaving a lot of space above there heads and not often going for very extreme close ups which along with those massive high celling sets gives you a sense of the amount of empty space in which the characters are living in this deserted hotel.</fullReview>

The great direction and great story really keeps this chiller moving at an alarming pace. The sense of isolation and being trapped with a madman really pumps up the tension and the other subtexts (which come with every Kubrick movie) are left unexplained and mystical. The subtexts are very powerful, the duality of man (Jack is seen through a mirror a lot), the murderousness nature of man and the whole racism issue. Nicholson's acting is perfectly disturbing as he uses humourous tones as he kills. One of the best all time movies, directed by a genius at the top of his game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again I am too late to provide any new insight for a film, with it allready having been commented on 80 times on IMDb, but the only new thing I can add is give this film time to get going. Yes, the beginning is a bit talky, but it didnt bother me cuz it was pretty interesting. And thats basically what will make this work for you, if you find the hotel and its history intriguing or not. I was very drawn to the story because of the huge scale, like the BIG hotel, the looong running time, the climax that took about 45 minutes. It will all depend on what grabs you the most. There's plenty of memorable moments; redrum, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, the creepy twin girls, bloody elevators, heeeeres Johnny!, and that yucky old lady in the bathtub...ewwww. The finale is really drawn out and takes a while to unfold, but it just makes more time for spookiness. I mean when Duvall is running through the hotel and keeps encountering twisted image after twisted image, coupled with that chilling music, I was freaked. I'd also have to say this will take multiple viewings before everything makes sense (I had to explain a lot when my girlfriend watched it for the first time), with some of the characters not clearly defined enough. Like I'm assuming that bartender was one Nicholson knew from his drinking days. And for those who think this is boring, just read the book and tell me whats better. Kings novel is even moooore blah blah blah, with the ending here much better. Jacks and Kubricks best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting comparision to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's film version of THE SHINING becomes much clearer and more interesting after you've read King's novel. Many people tend to disparage either one in favor of the other, but both novel and movie have individual merits and are ultimately about entirely different themes.In the novel, King examines a flawed but decent man (Jack Torrance) who becomes the victim of a rapacious hotel with a mind of its own that wants to devour him and his family. Jack fights long and hard against the power of the Overlook Hotel, but the hotel overpowers him and eventually fully possesses him. King shows basic optimism in humanity when he lets Jack's remaining human personality poke through during his furious final rampage and allow his son Danny to escape. The Hotel dies an incerinating death as Danny, his mother, and the helpful Hallorann escape to a new life.No such optimism for Stanley Kubrick. Jack Torrance begins as a violent, slightly insane man who has managed to wear a mask of decency for a few years. The Hotel tempts Jack to remove that mask with its endless luxurious space, opulance, and promise of the immortality that has always alluded him in his writing. When Jack goes berszerk at the end, it really IS Jack in control, not the spirit of the Overlook wearing his shape. There is no humanity to appeal to in Jack (indeed, there never was to begin with), and Danny and his mother can only hope to escape him through their own wits.As a film, THE SHINING is a frightfully cold tale of humanity stripped bare, and Kubrick purposely distances the story from the emotional background of King's novel, which is a tale of temptation of the human spirit and its purgation. King's novel is freeing, symbolized in the exploding Overlook Hotel, while Kubrick's film is a prison, symbolized by the hedge maze that becomes Jack's demise. It's no wonder that King dislike the movie version so strongly, but both renditions are worthy of praise, and the comparison between them further emphasizes their individual strengths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The odd thing about Stanley Kubrick is that he can make a film exactly like the book it's based on (A Clockwork Orange, another favorite of mine) but he can also make a film that goes completely away from the book. The Shining was not only the first Stephen King movie I had ever seen, it was the first horror film I had ever seen. And thus far, it is the only horror film on the same level of scariness as the Exorcist and Psycho that I know of. Two names make this a great film. Any true movie fan should know these names. Kubrick and Nicholson. Let's start with Nicholson, shall we? Jack Nicholson is, simply put, the best actor ever. He portrays Jack Torrence better than anyone else ever could. Well, that was simple. OK, now let's move on to Stanley Kubrick, shall we? His vision of the future in A Clockwork Orange and his vision of outer space in 2001: A Space Oddessy are without rival, as is his vision of schizophrenia, alcoholism, parenthood, and insanity in the Shining. Well, maybe they're rivaled by Psycho and the Exorcist. But that's it. This film is a must-see for any horror movie junkie. But if you want Kubrick at his best, I suggest A Clockwork Orange. But that's just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge Stephen King fan and am almost always disappointed with the films made from his novels. "The Shining" is an extraordinary exception. Kubrick's interpretation and embellishment of the novel not only improve the tale, but make it what, in my opinion, is the scariest motion picture ever made. Never before or since has a movie used general eerieness and fear of the unknown so stirringly (with the possible exception of the up and coming "The Blair Witch Project" which I cannot wait to see). "The Shining" has an escalating menace to it that begins even as the credits roll and doesn't let up until the screen fades to black at the end. Danny's vision of the twin Grady girls in the hallway is undoubtedly one of the most chilling scenes ever filmed and Jack and Delbert's conversation in the Men's room is, to me, Kubrick's finest work as a director. Truly haunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Movie That Genuinely Scares Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I add to the many other comments on this film? Just that there are many horror films that utilize all the standard tricks and cinematic cliches to make you jump or build up suspense, but this is the only movie (The Exorcist included) that genuinely scares me and causes pause when I turn off the lights. I had not read Stephen King's book before I saw this in the theater during it's original 1980 release-- I have since and now view them as two totally different works that stand apart and individually. Kubrick understands how to penetrate the psyche to create a forboding, almost unbearable sense of something horrible lying in wait for you just around the next corner that you (almost) never quite see. The twin girls at the end of the hallway scare the bejesus out of me in a way that Freddy Kruger never could. Not even close. The Overlook's immensity and isolation leave the viewer feeling as trapped and vulnerable as the characters.The DVD version of this film includes Vivian Kubrick's (Stanley's daughter) documentary on the making of the film. It's fascinating to watch Jack Nicholson clowning and joking around and greeting people as he walks from his dressing room to the bedroom set. While others go about their business he suddenly changes, clothes himself in his character, and gives the prop axe a furious and enthusiastic swing, shouting "Axe murderer, kill!" You also get to see Stanley Kubrick berating Shelley Duvall on set, "We're f*****g killing ourselves out here and you've gotta be ready! ...Should we play mood music?" Great stuff for any fan of movie making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On October 31st, 1998, I witnessed what would be the greatest horror movie in movie history. The Shining came into my life, as I instantly fell in love to the movie known as The Shining. I loved the fact that they were alone in the Overlook Hotel. The movie had everything a horror movie should have: A killer chasing them, a haunted lodge with ghosts roaming around the rooms. Stanley Kubrick was a genius. Jack Nicholson really made the movie great. But Stephen King is the real mastermind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time several years ago. Since then it has become my favorite horror flick ever! I think Jack Nicholson was perfect for the leading role. No one goes nuts better then he does! I do, however, think that Wendy was the most pathetic part I have ever seen played. I understand that her character was supposed to be pathetic but that was just over the edge. For anyone who saw the new Shining, it was a horrible attempt to match the excellence of the old Shining. There is no way it was even 1/3 as good as the original. I did like how they left an opening for a sequel though. Also I really like it in the old Shining when a spider crawls down the screen and when Dick calls it the Overlook ho(stressed)tel(unstressed). Bye!!!!! Ps the original Danny is really cute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the reasons why Kubrick is one of the greatest filmmakers ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Shining' is, plainly and simply, one of the best horror movies ever made. It is also the best adaptation of anything that Stephen King ever has written. (Not that 'Maximum Overdrive' was a bad film, or anything ... wait a minute, nevermind.)This film kept me intrigued and on the edge of my seat at all times. The visuals are AMAZING, from the blood filled elevator to the freaky little girls to the naked corpse -- they were all among the best I've seen in any movie. This can be somewhat expected from Kubrick, a master of the art of motion pictures, but it's surprising even from him. It may possibly be his best film, based on the four or five of his that I've seen...It's also a very convincing film, which is hard to find in the genre of horror. The acting in this movie is GREAT -- unlike many other movies, you're actually convinced that Nicholson is slowly going insane instead of just blinking a lot more and drooling. You can also feel the fear of his family, who are watching him turn into this monster.I'm keeping this short and to the point since it's also one of the many films that has been reviewed to death on IMDB, but I will DEFINITELY tell you that it has the b. seal of approval -- rent this now. Own it. Buy me a copy. Trust me, it'll be worth your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a hotel with a gruesome past. Add a well-meaning caretaker there to spend a nice winter with his wife and child, and mix in a masterful filmmaker and a superb story teller (Kubrick and King), and you've got Stanley Kubrick's 1980 classic horror film, The Shining.While Kubrick's movie does not faithfully parallel the book (fans of King's novel may be disappointed), the film takes on a style of it's own, creating some of the most disturbing and horrifying images ever to be captured by a camera (murdered girls in the hallway, elevator full of blood, all work and no play makes jack a dull boy, etc).The Shining is yet another bright spot in Kubrick's stellar career. The Maze scenes are especially spectacular as well as the flowing hallway shots. Jack Nicholson leads a perfect cast that includes Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers. See this movie, it's absolutely brilliant; don't let anyone tell you differently.</fullReview>

It is now one of my top 5 favorite films and my favorite of Kubrick's masterpieces. It is indeed the scariest film ever made. But it is a different type of horror. The film doesn't make you jump into the air like 90's horror flicks, but rather implants visions into your mind (example: the twins) that you can't stop seeing when you close your eyes. Even the opening titles are frightening due to the howling music. Be warned: leave those lights on while viewing....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of horror films out there today, some of them eventually rise to the status of classics (Nosferatu, Dracula, etc.), others are cult classics (Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, etc., and others are pieces of crap that should never have been made (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Any Nightmare on Elm Street not directed by Wes Craven, etc.). This is a classic, and a great one at that. It's not close to the book by Stephen King, but it is a great standalone horror movie. I admit it, I absolutely hated this movie the first time I saw it, but I watched it again. And again. And again. I grew to love it. It is an amazing piece of work, great cast of only about 6 real characters, and only three of them are main characters, the rest are supporting characters. Jack Nicholson is a template for what many movie psychos should (and try, but rarely succeed) to be. I read the book after I saw this movie, and I recommend seeing this first then reading the book. Then watch it again. Lots of differences, but when you get down to it, it's the same story told by two different storytellers in their own way, King and Kubrick, much as the story of Cinderella differs from nationality to nationality. You may think that your version is good, but at least take a glance at someone else's. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film works so well because it is not only a very successful horror film, it is also a knowledgeable homage to previous horror films. Similarly, one can sit back silently and become absorbed in the narrative (in which case, the movie is terrifying), or one can view the film as a comedic piece (it is a VERY funny work of art). The film runs a bit too long and could have easily omitted at least 15 or 20 minutes of needless footage, but it is still extremely entertaining and thought-provoking (deconstructing the film leads to interesting results!).</fullReview>

The skills of Kubrick along with 2 amazing performances by Nicholson and Duvall (now this woman knows how to convey fear to an audience) make this an amazingly scary film. No moving bushes, no hero dad, no trying to pack complex relationship info into a 90 minute film, no contrived excuses for a character's motivations, -just great scenes- each one meant to effect the audience more than the one before.

		<fullReview>As I write these comments about The Shining, I write them with the knowledge that this films director, Stanley Kubrick, passed away earlier this year. It is a shame that we will only get one more film from this cinematic genius, but at least we get one more. The Shining is one of the great horror films of all time and my personal favorite. This movie has so much atmosphere that you feel like your inside the hotel with the characters. The set design is amazing and the opening helicopter shot is unforgettable. The score to this film, by Bela Bartok, is simply hypnotic. There is also great cinematography from John Alcott. Kubricks' films are always hard to forget, but this film also has a hard to forget performance from Jack Nicholson. Nicholson holds the picture together in a lot of respects, as he goes crazy, the audience begins to see his dementia as well. I've heard Stephen King didn't really like this version of his novel. I think that is a shame because Kubricks' films are like novels in many ways. This film, like so many of Kubricks' films, is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror springs eternal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is an incredibly intricate hedge maze of a movie lurking beneath a leering death mask of bloodshed and mayhem. Like Jack Torrance, Kubrick was undergoing a painful creative rebirth while making this movie, having traded in the spic-n-span philosophical certainties of A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove for a more ambiguous, intuitive kind of poetic logic. As a result, The Shining is not as satisfying as his previous films, not as surefooted or smugly self-confident. Watching it can, on occasion, be as frustrating as watching a baby larva squirm free of its shell. But it's also the most fascinating film Kubrick ever made, so odd and inhuman it's like something beamed down from another galaxy.It's hard to believe this gothic monstrosity had its humble origins in a Stephen King novel, but if you need proof, just look at all the clueless dingbats who prefer the "faithful" miniseries. Granted, King and Kubrick were uniquely ill-matched -- while the former is all about surface incident, beasties and aliens and spiders, the latter places the emphasis on subtext, what roils and stirs BENEATH the surface. Stephen King's novel of The Shining, like all his novels, is as flat as a pancake and profoundly unscary. That's why people read him at the beach.Kubrick grafts about twenty dimensions onto the painfully thin story and arrives at something altogether more ineffable and... "Kubrickian" is the only real word for it. He taps into a host of fears, most of them embedded so deeply in our psyches we don't know they're there -- or if we do, have long since given up trying to express them ( and I'm not talking about the fear of being attacked by a wigged-out Jack Nicholson, although more than a few motorists in this city are traumatized by just that possibility)Kubrick gets plenty of eerie mileage, for instance, out of our fear of not only death, but of obsolescence, as embodied by the gaily-attired reveller-ghosts of The Gold Room. The presence of this completely dead world, with its dead music and dead fashions, serves to remind us that the world we live in now is equally doomed, along with everyone in it. This lends a whiff of mortality to the proceedings -- a whiff so pungent it can even carry over into real life. Just go to a party after watching the movie and you'll see what I'm talking about. People appear silly and unreal, like chattering skeletons.There's also the primal and universal childhood fear of seeing our fathers turn on us, but this website is not the place to get into all that. For now, just let me say that Nicholson is a grinning Beelzebub beyond compare, Shelley Duvall is as impossibly elongated as a Kafka sketch come to life, and the gay guy in the bear suit really weirds me out.I recommend you watch The Shining back-to-back with Roman Polanski's The Tenant. Both deal with the recurrence of psychosis and the endless cycle of violence. Polanski's film is funny and kitschy, however, which keeps it from achieving the same kind of nightmarish stranglehold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick has proclaimed himself as not only the master of film, but the master of horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is one of the scariest films I have ever seen! It's also one of my favorites, due to the fact that it was crafted by the moviemaking god, Stanley Kubrick! I love all of his movies, and this time, he has set out and proclaimed that he too can make a good scary movie! One of the reasons that this film is so terrifying is that he was able to frighten us to the edge of our fears, and never resolve the pent up emotion and tension that has built up throughout the entire film. It also is a horror film that shies away from blood and gore, or visual pyrotechnics, because Stanley Kubrick knew that that kind of stuff wasn't scary enough to create the kind of effect that he wanted. Like Francis Ford Coppola's "The Conversation", it relies on the psychological fright factor, instead of the usual bag of tricks involving blood and guts. The only supernatural moment in the film involved Delbert Grady opening up the freezer, letting loose an animal of Jack Torrance. Notice how careful Kubrick was in not going overboard with supernatural activity, because most of the horror existed in the mind. Jack Nicholson's performance gives the character his meat, his madness, and he utters one of the most famous lines in film history(which was actually an ad-lib)! Moreover, this is a psychological horror film that keeps you thinking all the time after you've seen it, and that is what really scares me about this film. The more you think about it, the scarier it seems. I think that was what Stanley Kubrick was trying to achieve, because this film is so intricately riddled with subliminals and ideas, that all mean and lead to something. The only question is, what? It keeps people going and going, debating and trying to figure out what all of those little details in the film meant. Some say this was an artistic failure for Kubrick, which I think is totally wrong! I think that the characters were beautifully defined, and the detail and terror of the film is that of a master. This film is a masterpiece of modern horror and film, by the grand master of film himself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good though inconsistent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" has a powerful cult following of both Kubrick-philes and horror buffs. Although I found the movie to be very entertaining at times, and enjoyed Nicholson's performance, I find it overrated and a B+ movie at best.First off, Kubrick's use of music is spectacular as always. As in "2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick used pre-existing classical/art music for 95% of the film's score. This music is perfect for the movie; subsequently Penderecki and Bartok have been endlessly imitated in horror/suspense flicks.Secondly, the set is grand and effective. With Kubrick there is no question that the decor, color schemes, etc. are significant and revealing, and though I won't go into them here, several analogies can be drawn between the set and the rest of the film.And, of course, we have Nicholson. I can't think of anyone else who could have pulled off the role so convincingly. At times the dialogue is clunky and choppy (as he berates his bat-wielding wife, for example) and would be painfully poor in the hands of most any other actor. (I suspect Jack added many small improvisations to his performance.) And when he's given the meaty stuff he knows just what to do with it.As mentioned above, at times the dialogue could be much better--most of the conversations between Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, pre-stir-craze, have an intensely artificial feel to them, making it difficult to believe these characters are married. Having read the Stephen King book I'm aware of the tension between them as a result of Jack's alcoholism, but nevertheless the interaction felt wrong to me.And the movie is TOO LONG. The actual length is not so important as the pacing within this duration. After this movie ended I felt as if I'd seen a 4-hour movie, not a 2.5-hour one. Had it been done really well I wouldn't have noticed the length. There are boring, slow periods, but these are overshadowed by the movie's excellent suspense sequences--mostly.I enjoyed the movie a lot but would not put it on a pedestal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is about the movie THE SHINING as it is compared to the book THE SHINING. The book was the first King novel I'd read and it was enjoyable. It had better character development than the movie. Also Jack Torrance's insanity was much more gradual in the book. That was where the movie was weak. The movie was strong where the book wasn't. That was the ending. The book's ending was very weak and fell apart where it wasn't all that scary. In the book the the hotel was frightening up until the ending. In the movie however, the end was the most frightening and it left the viewer feeling very haunted. I don't usually say this, but I thought the movie was much more preferable over the book. It's structure remained strong throughout and the scares gradually built themselves up. One of the most chilling and scary movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. They did a wonderful job adapting the book for screen. John Alcott's straight forward cinematography never ceases to impress me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I completely understand Jack Torrance' anger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the comments, I wasn't able to realize how some of these people didn't understand how Jack went insane. I understand how and was deeply moved. All summer long I am cooped up with my parents without the alleviation of my anguish from my friends. If someone deep down dislikes or hates the people they live with and hold it in too long, they will slowly deteriorate. Jack hated Wendy because she was simple and she took his alcohol away from him, or he leads himself to believe that. There was never love there in the first place.I would also like to mention two mistakes that I think are worth mentioning. When applying, Jack mentions that he had been on the wagon for four, or possibly five, months. One month later in the story, he mentions the same number of months when it should have been one more. The second mistake is a technical flaw. In the opening scenes with the aerial camera following the bug on the sidewinder, out of the corner of the screen you are able to see the helicopter's shadow. This is when it first shows the car. The reason I mention this mistake is because Kubrick later acknowledges it in FULL METAL JACKET when the characters are flying in a helicopter one of the shots is staring at the helicopter's shadow from the helicopter. Kubrick always did have a terrific sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick is not talking about what he is talking about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The back of the box for FULL METAL JACKET says that it is the greatest war movie ever made. However, I do not think it is a war movie. The setting is the Vietnam War, but Kubrick is using this to talk about something else that he cannot talk about directly. The same is true for THE SHINING. This is not a horror movie. It has all the attributes of a horror movie, but Kubrick is using this as a vehicle to talk about something that he cannot talk about directly. So what is it that Kubrick can't talk about? Why was this story and the horror genre the proper vehicles for this subject? I don't know, and I am glad that I don't know. I first saw this movie when I was six. I've seen it a hundred times, and I will watch it hundreds more because there is something going on that I haven't figured out. I am sorry that I cannot remember who wrote it, but an article I read talked about the way Kubrick played with the viewers' horror-movie expectations. Throughout the movie, the viewer is wondering "where is the horror movie?" Then near the end, when treated to standard horror movie ghosts and gore, the viewer gets to relax - it is a horror movie they are watching after all. But the camera zooms in for the last shot of the movie, and once again Kubrick shatters the viewer's expectations.The first time I saw Alan Resnais' LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, I was convinced there was something else going on in THE SHINING. I feel that these two films are closely related (along with HIROSHIMA, MON AMOUR and the last half an hour of 2001).There are aspects of our world that we just cannot express with a page of prose or a ten minute speech. Real art puts us as close to these inexpressible concepts as we can be without actually expressing them. Even if I fully understood what THE SHINING was about, I wouldn't be able to say it. Kubrick needed to use a "horror movie" to point towards something he could not talk about; he was too much of a genius to do anything less (to simply decide he felt like making a horror movie). I think it would be a loss for someone to talk about this movie's scare-factor and leave it at that. I've struggled with this film for twenty years and will continue to do so. I strongly recommend to anyone who is intrigued by THE SHINING that they watch LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD and HIROSHIMA, MON AMOUR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can really be said about the greatest horror film of all time? There is no doubt in my mind that this film, although made close to twenty years ago, still is the scariest movie I've ever seen. A lot of people would say that THE EXORCIST is, but I gotta stick with THE SHINING, no contest.But like THE EXORCIST, it creates the perfect atmosphere for a horror film. Fans of Stephen King have serious problems with this film, but they need to get over themselves. THE SHINING is Kubrick's movie and I don't think there is a single director who could've made it better. I've seen King's version on television and laughed through the whole thing, that's how inferior it was.A lot of people also had a problem with the slow pace &amp; Mr. Nicholson's acting. Stanley Kubrick's technique of slow, drawn-out pace is absolutely necessary in a film like this as it was in BARRY LYNDON. It's used to absorb the viewer totally into the film and it's story. As for Mr. Nicholson's acting, how do you expect a man being confined in a large haunted hotel to behave? I think he did a great job, but the real praise I think belongs to little Danny.THE SHINING is a horror masterpiece, which is why I think, Kubrick didn't make any others; how would you top this? The story centers around a family struggling as caretakers of a huge haunted hotel. Although some people believe that THE SHINING is about the haunted hotel, I honestly focused more on the extreme cabin fever. I thought that the haunting was only secondary to the psychological deterioration of Jack Torrence. I seriously hope they decide to bring it back to theaters someday.****LONG LIVE THE SHINING****KUBRICK IS GOD****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining has some of the most memorable scenes of any film that I have ever watched on the silver screen. A superbly well crafted, and well written film that somehow falls short at the end.Wagner's opening music, genius art direction and strong performances from Nicholson and Duvall help create the feeling of subtle uneasiness in the first act. I only wish that the kid had been a better actor. He has very little screen presence. Kubrick does a superb job in giving the Overlook menacing characteristics. It's size and vast rooms creates the feeling that it is an object far too overwhelming for the Torrance family to fight, thus making Nicholson's slow crawl to insanity that much more convincing. I found the film to be more frightening on a cerebral level than on an emotional one. This isn't a movie that makes you jump out of your seat in fright or cover your eyes. Duvall's performance is the emotion needed to make the fear real even though I had a certain feeling of detachment throughout the movie. Though the final image of Nicholson is memorable, the ending somehow seemed anti-climatic.</fullReview>

Those two little girls (come and play with us Danny...forever...and ever...and ever) are the scariest creations in a horror film I've ever seen. They still give me the creeps! I also love those real quick shots of Danny in absolute terror as he gets "the shine." Jack Nicholson is really cool in this, but not believable at all. His performance is one of high camp. This was the main point of Stephen King's novel: Jack Torrance was a good and decent man who had a fatal flaw--alcoholism. The evil hotel played on this weakness and so corrupted him. In the movie, we have Jack looking bonkers in the very first scene. It just wasn't a cogent move on Kubrick's part to cast Nicholson in this part. Not to mention Shelly Duvall, who is horrible in this movie.I have one other gripe. The climax in the book was far superior to that of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best horror movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie first time in 1993 and I was stunned at how good it was. This Kubrick's best film also. I have seen the 115 minutes running version of it, because in Finland there isn't available the 146 minutes running version. I would like to see it. In the film the Steadicam filming is so excellent that it fells like you're floating in something. And the music is so creepy that it chills, especially the music in the titles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's vision of King's classic novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to note that Stanley Kubrick's film version of Stephen King's novel "The Shining" is considered one of the classic films of the horror genre - as it is also worthy of mentioning that many feel that King's book will probably be the most enduring of his novels in the decades to come. They however are entirely separate from one another. Kubrick created his own vision of King's novel and for that we must be eternally grateful. Stephen King has stated that he never liked Kubrick's treatment of his novel (this is why "The Shining" was remade as a television mini-series in 1997). I've seen both, and although I am a fan of King's writing, I must say that I still prefer Kubrick's film over the mini-series. Kubrick builds the suspense for well over half the film before unleashing the terror of the Overlook hotel. The mini-series, while more faithful to the original story draws on too long (I think it being split over three nights hurt it more, though, than the length. This is a very suspenseful story and breaking it up ruins the suspense.). This film, along with Kubrick's others, shows just why he was regarded with such admiration, not only by other filmmakers but with the movie going public as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who badmouths this film obviously does not get the hidden message of it. These people are too busy looking at the quality of acting or how this film isn't close to the Stephen King novel. This is Stanley Kubrick's film not King's story, so you should know you are going to be getting not only an artistic horror film, but also you are going to find that there is some sort of unexplainable hidden message. Anyone expecting to see a horror film where all you have is a murderer (or two), and a bunch of dumb stupid 90's kids who get bumped off one by one, well then you are going to be disappointed because this is a Kubrick film not a Wes Craven film.To get back to the hidden message: well I'll admit I didn't get it the first few times of seeing this film. I had to hear it from someone else (which is embarrassing because I usually look out for these things), and after watching the film a few times more, then it all started to fall in place. It is these types of films that make me love Kubrick for the genius he is. If you would like to know what the hidden message is, well it is about the White man and his terror on the country of the U.S. Just look for it.Look for: the name Indian, the amount of Indian objects used in the film, the blood pouring out of the elevator and what it truly symbolizes, the original British edition poster that was released before the film was in the U.S., the maze being used in the film and not the book, the way Danny tricks Jack by retracing his steps and moving through the bush in the maze to hide, etc. (Remember this is only mine and few other people's beliefs in the film, hell we may be wrong).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stunning horror film that could only have come from Stanley Kubrick. It is a terrifying, artistic, brilliant experience that has never really been equalled by any other horror movie. Definately one of the scariest, if not THE scariest, I've ever seen. It is also the most stylish horror film I have ever seen. The perfectly symmetrical shots, are much like those of 2001, as is the very slow pacing in parts. I've read many things about this movie where people speculated on the hidden meanings of it. Who knows what is the truth, since Kubrick is such a master it could mean anything, but it makes the film more interesting and mysterious. I've noticed many things about this film. For one, notice that Jack is shown very often talking while looking into a mirror - when Wendy brings him breakfast, at the bar, in the bathroom, when Danny comes into his room - and almost everyone else is shown talking with a very bright window behind them, so bright that it glares off the lens (usually considered a mistake). The only times Jack has a window behind him are when he has the terrible nightmare, and when he is chasing Wendy with a bat, and they are especially bright. Who knows if this means anything, but with Kubrick it is very possible, so watch for things like that in this film and his others. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the Shining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was an impressionable third-grader when cable television first appeared in my neighborhood. At virtually the same time, all of my classmates (and myself) were quickly exposed to Apocalypse Now, "10", Seems Like Old Times, The Warriors, and The Shining. I'm sure any adult would find it darkly amusing to see eight year olds running around a playground, little Col. Kilgores and Jack Torrances, uttering the lines that made those characters immortal - but hey - we're children of the 80's. The Shining scared the bejeezus out of me, and even now I recognize how disturbing this film really is. The book is also excellent. I think it's King's most frightening yet - when the hotel directs those "pychic blasts" at Scatman Crothers' character, my hairs stood up on end. We shouldn't forget that Kubric was a transcendant director, something which few directors have accomplished - only Coppola, Kurosawa, and a select cotiere of others can claim that. One thing that I haven't heard anyone mention is the excellent look of the film - amazing cinematography, and remarkable set design. Considering how dated some 80's films look, this one still looks pretty current.This film is not merely about madness, or a haunting. It's really about both, and about destiny. Shirley Jackson, a sort of precursor of King's (he is a big fan of her work), posits this question: "can a house be inherently evil?" King posits this question directly in Salem's Lot, and addresses it in the Shining. And amazingly, so does Kubrick. The Overlook Hotel attracts evil to its bosom across space AND time. And THAT is the main idea. The domestic horrors we witness are the grisly result, not the main objective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense Is The Name Of The Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those looking for a generic slasher might want to over look (no pun intended) The Shining because suspense is the name of the game here, not gore and jumps. Stanley Kubrick's classic film is probably the most suspenseful horror film I've ever seen. I'd rank it over any Hitchcock film any day. This movie is two and a half hours of suspenseful, disturbing scenes. Not for the faint of heart mind you.This movie, to me, is so well-made in every aspect. The cinematography, with it's dynamic and sweeping camera angles help draw you into the horror of the Overlook's long winding hallways. The sound effects are unmatched. "I love you Dan .." smiles Jack Nicholson at his nervous son as you hear the sound of bells descend and ascend in the background endlessly. The music is awesome. I sometimes view the movie just to listen to the music.On top of that, the dialogue is first-rate with it's share of classic one-liners and verbal exchanges. One of the few draw backs to the movie is Jack Nicholson's performance. While Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd are excellent in their roles, Jack Nicholson goes so over the top, that at times he moves out of the realm of being disturbing and eerie and into the realm of being comical. Just watch for the scene when Jack takes a trip to the bar. However, Nicholson's performance is classic otherwise and I don't see how anyone else could have acted the role any better.This movie is definitely not for everyone (especially people looking for an exact adaption of Stephen King's novel). The movie is very long, and drawn-out, but it's not like you'll be left unsatisfied after the movie is over. The climax is very satisfying and does the movies' long and suspensful build-up justice. I'd recommend this movie to anyone tired of the generic gory slasher films you'll see all around you today, and anyone looking for something a little different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "The Shining" again tonight, as part of the saddest, but most satisfying, personal video retrospective I've every decided to watch. Reading the comments here, I must take exception with some of what others say about Shelley Duvall's performance. Yes, she plays Wendy as a dim bulb, and dim bulbs are usually annoying. But her face is the last 30 minutes of the film is the most unnerving mask of terror I've every seen. It is like Munch's "The Scream" come to life.Remember that one of the directors who Kubrick emulated was Eisenstein, the master of type-casting. Though from comments I've read elsewhere I'm sure Kubrick wished that Duvall had bothered to learn her lines before the scenes, I think that Kubrick must have been satisfied with the shaky way Duvall lights her cigarette as she suspects she will have to cover for her bullying husband once again, with the way she stares at the larder door containing the raving madman who she knows will kill her, every nerve in her body straining to move forward and open it... it is certainly the best performance of hers I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If by some miracle you've escaped ever seeing this film, you may have some sort of terrifying, bloody picture in your head about what it must be like. It is, after all, touted by many people as the scariest film ever.But first, read the book. Although the movie deviates from it somewhat, you'll have a much better relationship with the movie. The reason is that when you read the book, you go into the movie understanding the motivation of the characters much more. This is important because, what makes this movie so scary and disturbing is the anti-Rockwellian portrait of domestic American life.Now, the basic plot is that Jack, an aspiring writer, gets a job as the winter caretaker at a hotel in the mountains. He and his family will live there for several months, keeping the hotel in good condition inside and out. The catch: His son, Danny, has "the shining," which is essentially a sixth sense that can detect supernatural things. Jack has a bit of it, too. Terror ensues and tension builds with the visions that father and son experience. Wendy, the wife/mother, attempts to keep stability in the family without fully understanding what's going on.This movie is a 10 all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great work this is. How frightening! As a horror film this was extremely successful. But this of course is a much deeper film. This is a film about alcoholism; about child abuse; about domestic violence; and about "the shining". One feels strange about thinking of Jack as the victim in this film.Jack was not obviously a great writer. All he could come up with was, "All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy". He continued to type it on hundreds of pages, so that his wife would think that he was making progress with his book.Jack was subject to "the shining" of the negro caretaker? That most proper, level headed negro, with the picture of the hot mamma in his room. Jack continuously hallucinated. Jack's son also hallucinated talking apparently to himself constantly. He thought he was talking to a little "imaginary" friend. Jack had probably been involved with the child protection state agency before, when he hurt the boy's arm while drinking. Wendy may have called them herself.Truly a great film. Jack Nicholson's nonsensical movies are often quite meaty for the thinking person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a masterful blend of suspense and psychological thriller, with just enough blood to possibly term it a "slasher movie". However, this movie is far too well-made to be called a mere slasher movie. Horror movies tend to emphasize killing off nameless supporting-cast members and blood, while this one focuses on the plight of a single man going insane, with a fairly small supporting cast. Of the possible "horror" equals to this movie, only "Halloween" and possibly "Carrie" could match this movie on any fronts. The only modern movie I have seen that can exceed the same kind of abject terror (not shock, terror) and suspense is "Silence of the Lambs".</fullReview>

Nicholson was criticized for "chewing the scenery" but I thought his performance was excellent for the part he was playing. Kubrick was also much maligned for opting for the hedge maze rather than the topiary animals coming to life, claiming that it was unworkable. Naturally, a sequence such as that would have required extensive special effects and/or animatronics. Kubrick is not the type of director that crafts such films, and Warner bros. should have been smart enough to realize that going in. Kubrick's films always center on dehumanization which require brilliant acting, not to mention the ever present steadicam and slow zooms to the actors faces. The only real problem that I have with the film is Shelley Duvall's atrocious acting. Pretending to be hysterical is not her strong suit(see: The bathroom scene where Jack hacks his way through the door).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>like it or not, this is a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the people that really hated this movie are the same people that require their horror movies to be chock-full of blood, gore and slimy aliens. The Shining accomplishes its purpose not with blood and guts, but with an unbearable build-up of suspense, first-rate (if a bit over-the-top) acting by Nicholson, and eerie camera angles. Kubrick is a modern genius. As in his other masterpieces, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, and even the underrated Full Metal Jacket, there is a sort of white, shadowless, "frozen" quality present in many of the scenes, and that eerie, "upward-angle" lighting of Nicholson's face during certain pivotal moments that is truly unnerving and nightmarish. The movie is similar to a nightmare in other respects as well: chilling music by Bartok, a desperate sense of isolation, bizarre room angles/lighting, and events that don't seem to make sense logically (such as the elevator pouring blood and the spooky diorama/maze scene early in the picture). For me, the most truly terrifying scene occurred around the middle of the film, when Wendy (Shelley Duvall) is leaning over Jack's typewriter, snooping at what he has been "writing." Without mentioning anyhing else, suffice it to say that it is at this moment that we realize that Jack has descended completely into madness, and from this point on, the movie's mood shifts from uneasiness to sheer terror.There is something far more frightening about one's loved ones losing any semblance of sanity (although truth be told, Nicholson seems slightly insane even in the beginning of this movie) than any amount of blood, guts and slimy monsters so prevalent in most horror movies today. The sense of isolation here only underscores the terror. This movie terrified me so much I had trouble sleeping for weeks. While it's true that it does not follow King's book precisely, I forgive it that for it is so well-crafted in its own right (also, I read the book *after* seeing the movie). Truly a masterpiece of horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST film-adapted Stephen King story and a classic horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who know of Kubrick and his great work, and love this movie then you need not read on. This is for those ardent Stephen King fans who hate this movie and LOVE the mini-series. The main reason this movie is so great is because King had nothing to do with it- or should I say that Kubrick would not let him anywhere near it. When Kubrick makes his films he becomes an autocrat- he has to if the film is going to approach the vision he has for it. King laid the groundwork for the plot, but Kubrick shaped it into a cinematic masterpiece. Let us not forget that King is a WRITER. This is a point which most people-who are fans of authors whose books become the basis for films- tend to overlook. A film is 50% SOUND and 50% VISUALS. It is the filmmaker's responsibility to create the best audio-visual experience he/she can while remaining true to the story. The mini-series pales in comparison to the film because it tried to follow the book exactly. Point in case- what is scarier when being swung at your head- a croquet mallet or an axe? Everyone who reads the book visualizes it(and eveything else) differently, but on the big screen an axe has a more direct emotional impact. Some of you may feel that I am a King-basher and I am unfair. That is not the case. I thoroughly enjoyed It, the Stand, Eyes of the Dragon and the Dark Tower series. I even liked the Shining. But we are talking about making a STORY into a MOVIE. Just look at King's track record when involved in other films and TV projects. They are all weak and most are poorly done because a WRITER is trying to bring to the screen something that only exists in his head. King is a good storyteller, but to create a great, even good, film it requires different thinking and a different creative approach. If you see the film version of the Shining again or if it is for the first time then enjoy the sights and sounds of one of the greatest tales of terror ever told- one man's journey into isolation, desperation and madness. And for an added bonus look for the subtle link between the hotel and Native Americans. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7. The Shining (horror, 1980): Jack (Jack Nicholson) is a writer trying to get away from the city to start a book. He finds the time as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, high up in the mountains. He takes his wife and son Danny along. The owners tell him of a supposed haunting that has befallen the place, brought on by an act of violence decades ago. Jack brushes the story aside. But just days after, his son Danny falls mysteriously ill. As each day passes Jack also experiences mood swings and bad dreams. He's becoming mad.Critique: 'The Shining' is, simply put, a walking psychotic dream with lots of space, tension, noise, and spookiness. With this film director Stanley Kubrick was at his most technically assured. The themes deal with an unknown fear or intruder. Images and sounds that are seen and heard but just out of reach. Their source? Their meaning? It's all just a ghost story told by a masterful filmmaker. Nostalgia looms high and wide across the spacious hotel, which in turn seems to control each inhabitant. In '2001'(Kubrik's best known film) there's a scene towards the end where astronaut David Bowman goes through a series of light shows (as he enters the aliens' domain). He suddenly 'lands' in a 16th-century style bedroom. The room looks so quiet and 'shining' that you can even sense it. This is what 'The Shining' reminds me of, a longer version of that film's final, and hauntingly puzzling scene.Quote: Jack: "Here's Johnny!!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw "The Shining" at a film students' screening at UCLA shortly after it was released. Most of the LA reviewers had panned it, but being a fan of Kubrick, I wanted to judge for myself.At first, I agreed with the pundits, this thing was over the top and off the mark. As the plot developed, though, I noticed that the audience was laughing at all the "wrong" places."What the hell," I thought, "I may as well enjoy this." I joined with the students in looking for the humor. And, finally, it dawned on me: this is a satire of horror films . . . duh!To all those King fans who complained that he changed too much of the plot - you all missed the point. Stanley was lampooning a genre with style, as only he can.Not until "Scream" has anyone done it better. Kudos to Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remarkable milestone in cinema. Kubrick has created a timeless horror masterpiece that puts recent genre movies to shame, and one that many directors should do well to study closely. It still hasn´t really been equalled. You are completely absorbed into the environment of the Overlook Hotel, thanks to the superb camera-work, scenography (It was entirely built on a soundstage), acting, and very importantly - the use of contemporary classical music. The blood-spewing elevator accompanied by Pendereckis "The Dream of Jacob" is an absolute masterstroke, one you´ll never forget. Kubrick´s adaption of the book has been critizised but I believe he actually made it better. It´s more abstract than Kings original story but all the more scary because of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate horror-thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The excellence of the cast, and the phenomenal Stanley Kubrick, combine to make this probably the most fabulous horror film of all time. Although it is integrally different from the Stephen King book which inspired it (which prompted King to make his own version in the 1990's), it remains a masterpiece in the horror genre.Jack Nicholson is at his peak in this role, where he plays a man who, although he's basically a nasty individual, slowly descends into madness after going to the Overlook Hotel. The scenery shots used in this movie are breath-taking, and you have to stop just to look at them.There are some things that could have been improved upon in this movie (Shelley Duvall would have made a great blonde, and could have used just a little bit of backbone), but it's basically an excellent film. It stands out from most horror films of the late 1970's and early 1980's in that it doesn't rely solely on nude women and massive gore to snag it's audience. Over two hours in length, it's also much longer than the usual horror film, which is about ninety minutes. What violence there is in the movie is well-played, and appropriate under the circumstances. There are almost no scenes where I was left wondering, "Now why on Earth did he do that?"If you haven't seen this movie, it's worth the time, if even to just see the differences between Kubrick's version and King's version. A definite five star thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of modern horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" was a high-water mark in horror movie history. The masterful direction of Kubrick makes this one of the eeriest films ever made. Kubrick jungles the subtle with the over-the-top beautifully. One minute he's slowly filming the haunted house and the next he's filming elevators filled with blood. Jack Nicholson makes the film with his slow descent into madness, gradually becoming more and more possessed until he's almost a comic presence. The people who have the most trouble with this film are gore-hounds (who probably didn't like the lack of violence) and fans of the book (who were disappointed that Kubrick, as he always does with his source material, made the movie so radically different).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The darker side of human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, like most of Kubrick's works is a lot more complex than it appears to be at first glance. In "The Shining" Kubrick seems to be cultivating the theme of the darker side of human nature which runs throughout so many of his films and while watching this film I get the impression that Jack Nicholson is playing not someone who is possessed but someone who's darker side has been cultivated by the influence of evil in the hotel. The hotel itself seems to be playing a very important role in the film as is reflected with the superb cinematography, most of the shots being of a wide angle nature to show the hotel as an integral part to the story. Finally it is important to note that at the end of the film Nicholson dies away from the hotel, away from his point of strength strength and influence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating movie about a man's descent into complete madness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is sometimes considered to be a movie about a haunted hotel; I believe it to be a documentation of the descent of a man and his family into madness. In this it differs from the Steven King novel from which it takes the name, the characters, and the location. Although this has offended many King fans, I, for one, love both, though for different reasons.If you love the book, keep an open mind; it's a tale of madness, not haunting, but it's still quite scary, and incredibly intense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much-maligned but still a great horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I loved the book. It remains my favorite Stephen King novel. Secondly, the TV adaption was well done. Still, I think Kubrick did a great job at creating the atmopshere necessary for a good, scary movie. It's full of incredible visuals, and great tracking shots (especially when we follow Danny riding on his big wheel through the hotel hallways). Sure, Nicholson gives an over-the-top performance but...that's what he does in almost every movie he's in. Have you ever heard of him giving a "restrained" performance? Shelley Duvall is okay. Actually, Rebecca DeMornay was a big improvement in the TV movie. I know King fans who absolutely hate this movie. They say Kubrick changed too many plot points and ruined the whole thing. I say there's more than one way to tell a good story. King did it very well, and so did Kubrick...just in a different way. I'd rank The Shining up there with the best horror films of all time, along side "The Bride of Frankenstein", "Psycho", and "The Exorcist", among others. It actually reminds me of another superb haunted house movie: "The Haunting", from the early '60s. Both movies create that sense of isolation; the fear of turning the next corner or opening the door everyone is afraid to open. It's also the best King adaption, although "Stand By Me", "Misery" and "The Shawshank Redemption" are close behind. If you haven't seen it, rent it. If you're one of those angry King fans, give it a second chance. It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Masterpiece - "Heres The Shining!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film "shines" on Jack Nicholson because of the way Kubrick uses his skill to show how Jack gradually goes crazy. The camara angles and the actors unique ability to give the film a scary, yet suspense filled atmosphere - help to add to the horror of the film. The special foot - hill of this film is shown in the camara filming, noticeable when the boy is pedaling through the halls, "Steadycam" procedeure helps make the boy also "shine." The catch-phrases are wicked - "here's Johny!" and my favourite - "All work and no play make Jack a dull boy" which is spoofed in many films and shows like the Simpsons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review for one of the greatest horrors of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" is a legendary film that will last forever. I first saw this a few years ago, having been drawn to it by its popularity (I am a big horror fan) and of course its infamous scenes. The filmography in this film is excellent, and the sense of isolation in the gloomy Overlook Hotel is well received. Though I wouldn't go as far to say it scared the wits out of me, it does leave a cold hand grasped around your heart as the final shot of Jack Torrance smiling at you from a hundred-year old photograph closes the film. However, one thing I guarantee this film is is confusing. In a brief summary, a writer and his family agree to look after a secluded Colorado hotel out in the mountains for the winter. Of course, over time the violent past of the hotel begins to work on the father and he becomes insane. Not particularly gory, the acting is very decent and is a nice lengthy film that takes its time for the first half hour. It is noted that Stephen King,the author of the novel that inspired this great film did not like the final release. Understandably, having read his novel myself, there are many upon many changes Kubrick decided to make to the book's story, characters and names. One of the most noticeable changes is that Room 217 becomes Room 237. But none of these changes really affect the film, and it is still golden to this day. For anybody who enjoys a long, gripping horror film (with no cheesy pop- outs or typical horror clichés), watch this film. It will leave you in deep thought as the credits roll, and if you watched it properly, you probably may never forget this masterpiece of modern horror. 9/10 stars. It would be a perfect ten if it weren't for the countless (and rather unnecessary) changes from book to film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) arrives at the mountain-isolated Overlook Hotel, which is 25 miles from the closest town, to interview for the position of winter caretaker. Once hired, Jack plans to use the hotel's solitude to write. The hotel, built on the site of a Native American burial ground, becomes snowed-in during the winter; it is closed from October to May. Manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) warns Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself. In Boulder, Jack's son, Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd), has a terrifying premonition about the hotel, viewing a cascade of blood emerging from an elevator door, and then falls into a trance. Jack's wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), tells a doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he dislocated Danny's shoulder following a binge.The family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour. The chef, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers), surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream. Dick explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls "shining". Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly room 237. Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel has a "shine" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good. He also tells Danny to stay out of room 237.A month passes; while Jack's writing goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze. Wendy becomes concerned about the phone lines being out due to the heavy snowfall and Danny has frightening visions. Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts acting strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining Main Theme - All Axed Up Mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, The Shining, written by Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick, and Diane Johnson, scared the BahJeeZus out of me when I saw it for the first time. I was young and at the age where scary movies give kids bad dreams. I must have had nightmares for weeks, if I remember correctly. I mean gawd, the whole scenario of a father going crazy - absolutely nuts - and hacking up his little girls, plus his wife, with an hacking tool is just completely sick and PsyChotic.... RIGHT !?I watched the movie at my Dad's place when he had us kids for the weekend... you know, divorced parents and being with one of the parents for a weekend or what have you. Anyhooo, so yeah, it's not like I got all paranoid of my Dad or anything, but I certainly hid under the blankets a lot when I heard noises at night.The little boy Danny, Danny Lloyd, has some phrases in the song, but not the one everyone loves to repeat... the creepy sounding "RedRum" that he did over and over while upstairs in his room and then inside of his Mom's - Shelley Duvall's - room. I just couldn't get the "RedRum" to fit right in the song and felt that the other samples of him talking about the little boy that lives in his mouth was more appropriate anyways. What I am referring to is putting this movie's Main Theme into a remix type tune to be as scary as this movie.AND of course you all will recognize the phrases from the little girl ghosts - Grady's Daughters - Lisa &amp; Louise Burns - asking Danny to play with him. I used them plenty because those were certainly the phrases that creeps me out the most when I watched the movie. Then there are certainly some samples / phrases from Jack Nicholson talking to the ghost, or Devil image, named Lloyd the Bartender. And then the most famous one from Jack saying "Here's Johnny!"I used phrases, or more like the screams, from Shelley Duvall and some phrases from her speaking and or yelling at different times in the movie.One sound that I sampled from the movie, which I guess was the best part of the movie for most people, was when Jack hit the bathroom door with an axed and Shelley is on the other side screaming her head off. I felt like that sound, the axed hitting the door, sounded almost like a snare drum, so I made use of a snare drum sound where all beat exists to help represent the intensity of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of terror/cinema art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes The Shining so good? Is it the acting? The music? The cinematography? The lighting? The set? All of the above. Horror can be a tough genre to judge because does a horror film have to scare you to be successful? And how do you know if you were truly scared or not? If you jump during a scene, does that make the movie scary and therefore successful? Or is the movie scary and therefore successful because you are thinking about it later and feeling a sense of uneasiness? The Shining fits more with the latter category of horror films. It's not a movie that will likely cause you to jump out of your seat with fear. It might not even cause you to lose sleep or feel a sense of fear when thinking about it later. However, it does make one think. Things like when did Jack start to go mental, did Danny have any part in that, why didn't the chef want to talk about room 237, why did the hotel staff leave a family there over the winter knowing what could possibly happen, and did Jack really exist in that photo from the 1920s? These are all unsettling questions you'll be asking yourself after watching The Shining. One of the major aspects that creates the horrific feel of this movie is without a doubt the music. During the most intense scenes, the music only adds to the hysteria unfolding. When Danny sees the girls, when Jack gets angry with Wendy for the first time, when Jack and Danny are talking about the hotel in the room, when Wendy discovers what Jack has really been typing, when Jack is breaking down the door with an axe, and of course when he's chasing Danny through the maze. The music in these scenes, reminiscent of Psycho or Jaws, is almost a character itself. The actual characters themselves were played with such conviction that sometimes it didn't really feel like they were acting. Jack Nicholson didn't really do anything different from what he normally does. He's known for being an actor slightly unhinged. I mean he played The Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 movie Batman and was a patient at mental hospital in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It was natural that he play an author losing his mind inside a haunted hotel. Shelley Duvall has a stressed out and abused look to her, as if she's constantly fretting about her husband's alcohol problem, money, and food. She's the battered housewife who is soft spoken, meek and she smokes. Danny Lloyd's face said it all. His reactions to the horrific scenes he witnessed were spectacular, and made you sense the fear he was feeling. The cinematography of this film is excellent as well. How the camera follows Danny on his tricycle as he goes through the vast hotel, following Jack through the wintery hedge maze?it was a masterful achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly overrated and only somewhat enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arriving at a secluded mountainside hotel, a man and his wife intending to take care of the establishment during the winter find that the stay there causes them to fall foul of mysterious supernatural forces in the hotel and must find a way of getting out alive.This here turned out to be quite a rather dull and overblown effort without a whole lot to really like. The most detrimental and rather unimpressive element featured here is the film's simple storyline that doesn't really allow it any kind of semblance to being a horror film as the psychological implications generate very little shocks or actual supernatural scenarios. The shots of the family arriving at the hotel and being shown around the grounds, procrastinating while he's trying to write and the continuous shots of him simply staring off into space as the camera tries to make us think he's building towards insanity is mostly pretty laughable as there's little explanation for anything throughout here. These scenes by themselves aren't considered normal horror scares for a reason in that they play more like the activities that occur in a drama which is what it feels like more often than anything, as despite the few times it really tries to swing things over into the horrific it's mostly window-dressing against the more common drama elements that are put into play far more often in here. Those scenes make it difficult to fully understand many other horror efforts present in the later half where it starts getting into the full-on effects of the meltdown which makes no sense, and that furthers another big highly problematic effort here in that the film is completely unsure about what's actually happening to him. Though it makes small mention of the building being on top of the burial ground, there's so much unsure here about the outline of events that cause him to become such an unstable maniac when there's so many other elements coming into play here to account for that change. Going from the idea of the burial ground to the concept of the tormenting spirits and then finally his own mental instability is a continuous series of explanations for what's going on gives this such a tonal shift with each explanation that it's nearly impossible to figure out what's going on to him as it really makes a case for any of them rather than signaling which one it's going for as a logical explanation. There's also little explanation here for what the purpose of the special cognition powers he has, which are so integral to the film yet there's little about what they actually are, where it comes from or what he's doing with such skills to begin with as it never really ties into how the film manages to tie into the possible story lines for the explanation of the supernatural events taking place here. With a finale that also doesn't make any sense tacked on for no real reason, these here are what hold this back over the few small areas that work. One of the film's better aspects is the atmosphere present, as the main reason for that is the hotel itself which is so massive and creepy that much of the suspense and atmosphere is caused by just seeing the hotel. All to often it takes up so much space and the characters are so small compared to it that an already massive building looks even bigger than it really is. With a powerhouse finale that includes the film's only real suspenseful moments and attitude toward action, they're enough to help this somewhat but not enough to overcome the flaws.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, full Nudity and scenes with children in danger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>36 years later, I finally got to watch the Shining, and what a thrill.Kubrick delivers to us; this masterfully crafted thriller that by its release date in 1980 must have been an absolutely horrid experience. And for generations after its release horror writers and directors have used and reused so many of the elements that make this so wonderful.The secluded settings, a mountain pass hotel with a gruesome history, well and thoroughly cut off by any outside intrusion due to its location high up in the mountains. And a "snowstorm of generations" to trap anyone who unknowing of its dangers have placed them self at this hotel. (cue our distressed family) The kid who start experiencing flashing visions. At first mere images and voices of people, but as the time goes by, increasingly more disturbed, grim, and finally to a point where the visions turn physically violent. Once again the viewer is kept guessing; is this visions of years past? Or warnings of an ominous future? The long winding corridors throughout the hotel that for the viewer feels claustrophobic, and with an uneasy sensation of being trapped. And the camera movement that follows the kid throughout said corridors leaves you constantly guessing what might be around the next corner. And of course the protagonist turned antagonist, as the already passive-aggressive family father, slowly turns into a full-blow psychotic murderer, thirsting for the blood of his own wife and kid.These classic elements are what makes this movie so great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shining is in my point of view a summary of a cult movie. When it first came out was killed by the critics and the audiences ,but over time it gather a devout following and it has become a classic of the horror genre as a whole and one of the best movies made by Stanley Kubrik. I can not say( OK write tactically ) for this one because what can you add on a flick which cane out in 1980 and it has been studied for literally decades!! A quick summary is that a couple goes to a hotel ,which is closed during the winter and after some weird events the father goes starts to lose his sanity ( to be fair is played by Nicholson who is born to play nut characters, for real his most famous characters are of their minds). Its scariness is not due to some stupid jumped scares, but the tone and the atmosphere is the true reason, it really makes the movie at times, creepy as f**k. It is also true that after the end of the shooting the building ,which was used as the hotel ,was buried to the ground ,no clue how did that happen!! So if their is a ghost there in the end then ,it may dislike the final product, man even in death some people do not have any taste. To conclude if you want to have some scary time ,them go watch it ,it is a great flick, in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is a fantastic movie about a family of a father, mother, and son where the father has been hired to be the caretaker of a haunted hotel in the Rocky Mountain wilderness in Colorado. The son has an ability to hear certain thoughts of people which the cook at the hotel has too and calls it shining, which is why The Shining is the movie's name. The son also has the ability to see apparitions. As the family are staying in the hotel, the dad gradually goes completely insane and tries to kill his family with an axe. This movie is very creepy and scary. The first scene is one of the legendary scenes. The camera follows a car through a mountain wilderness and very dramatic eerie music plays. There are others such as when the son comes across two ghost twin girls while riding his tricycle or something, when an elevator opens and what looks like blood pours out as if the elevator was full of blood, and when the father encounters a ghost in a room. This movie is NOT okay for children. I'd say it shouldn't be seen by anyone under 17 because of the level of violence and terror. And the nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A top rate chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer Jack Torrance takes a job as winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies hoping the solitude will help his writing; once the few remaining members of staff depart he will be alone, with just his wife, Wendy, and his son, Jack, for company. He is warned that the loneliness can get to some people, he is even told that ten years previously the caretaker had killed his wife and children before shooting himself, but Jack is sure he will be fine. As they are shown around the hotel Dick Hallorann, the head chef, takes Danny aside and talks to him; it appears that they share a gift that he calls 'The Shining'; a sort of telepathy. Once everybody has gone Jack gets down to his writing but it is clear that something isn't quite right; Danny keeps seeing two creepy girls and even has visions of corridors literally awash with blood! As more time passes tensions rise and ultimately Wendy realises that she and her son are in great danger from the person who should be there to protect them. Jack, meanwhile, starts seeing former staff members; he even has a conversation with the former caretaker who explains that he had to 'correct' his family and it is time for Jack to 'correct' his.If you prefer horror movies that have a high body count, inventive deaths and plenty of jumps then this might not be for you; if however you like a chilling atmosphere, a claustrophobic setting and a sense of near constant dread then this is the film for you. While there are few really scary moments there are plenty that are chilling enough to make ones hair stand on end; for example the two girls Danny keeps seeing and the caretaker who calmly explains murdering his family as 'correcting' them. The camera-work adds to the creepiness; often following Danny as he rides through the hotels long corridors or runs through the large maze in its grounds. The small cast does an impressive job; Jack Nicholson is at his scary best as Jack Torrance and Shelley Duvall makes Wendy's terror entirely believable. Young Danny Lloyd does a fine job as Danny. The story might not be told at a fast pace but I was never bored. Overall I'd recommend to any fan of Stanley Kubrick's work or to anybody wanting a genuinely scary chiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most scary movies use an abundance of cheap tricks, blood and gore, and other unoriginal ways to attempt to get a scare from the audience. This movie uses great camera angles/movement and quick cuts in order to create a sense of suspense and discomfort and ultimately makes The Shining one of the best horror movies of all time. This movie includes an abundance of shots with a hand-held camera in order to create a shaky moving shot that helps to show that things that are happening in the plot are uneasy and helps develop a mysterious mood that scares audience and keeps them on edge for the entire movie. The shots that follow Danny as he rides on his big wheel also help create an uneasy and mysterious mood as the camera is at Danny's level and is behind him which prevents us from seeing what is around the corner. This uncertainty of Danny's fate as he rides his big wheel keeps the audience on edge and helps create a suspenseful mood that makes The Shining such a great film. Often times in the movie, the director will quickly cut between multiple events that are going on. When Jack enters room 237, there are several quick cuts between Jack and Danny and there are many shots and images that the audience haven't seen before. This is a great trick that creates an uncertain and uncomfortable feeling in the audience and builds suspense and frightens the audience. Overall, The Shining isn't the average cliché horror film as the movie has incredible suspense unlike any other movie. This suspense creates discomfort in the audience and makes The Shining one of the best horror movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This atmospheric thriller is sure to creep you out with its pacing, eery editing and cinematography (those tracking shots are highly effective), and Jack Nicholson's powerful performance as Jack Torrance. Horror films often tend to divide audiences into genre fans who follow the gore and those who laugh in the face of so-called scares, insisting their own resiliancy to cheap thrills and lamebrain plotting.As a movie, The Shining is thoroughly watchable from start to finish. Jack Nicholson steals the show as the ex-alcoholic, ex-teacher who is looking for solitude for a 'writing project', and the Overlook Hotel appears to be just what he is looking for as he pitches in as caretaker during the snowbound winter months. Joining him at the Overlook are his wife Wendy (Duvall) and his talented son Danny (Lloyd), whose special ability to 'shine' causes him to fear (and rightly so) the dark secrets of the hotels past.Is Torrance simply going mad, or being influenced? What's driving him? Is it the ghosts of past events, or his own consciousness filling the void of isolation, or a bit of both? Despite the supernatural visitations you never quite know, and this is what makes this film so chilling and unbelievably bleak - Jack could simply be a victim of his own insane consciousness. Without ever resorting to extreme gore or shocks, Kubrick creates a vision of hell, a vision of the void that will sear itself onto your mind.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

While there are definitely some great moments and the final minutes are epic, this isn't the best drama or horror I've seen. I noticed that only people who were watched this at 1980 rate it so highly. Honestly it's good, but not the best, or even one of the best ever. I would advice you to watch it though, it is entertaining. Jack Nicholson's performance is totally extraordinary.In Summary, nice movie.......... period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many other Stanley Kubrick movies this one is a thought provoking masterpiece with many hidden gems that lie within. From the very begging this movie distills a feeling fear and loneliness from begging to end. On the surface it can be seen as a man going mad from isolation, until finally snapping and attempting to kill his portrayed dumb wife and innocent child. But alas their can be many interpretations of this film, like many other Stanley Kubrick films. If the watcher has a keen eye and an open mind. There are many hints that the mysterious Stanley is trying to convey, some as serious and unfathomable as genocide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Stanley Kubrick managed to take a Stephen King novel and turn it into an essential movie for the horror genre, and somewhat of a timeless masterpiece of terror and despair. And despite it being from 1980 then the movie still holds it own by today's standards, both in storytelling, terror factor and as a wholesome movie.The movie is every bit as thrilling and disturbing as the book. And that accomplishment is well-owned by the director, but also to the actors who were in the movie.The story told in "The Shining", which I assume that you should be more than familiar with already - and if you are not, shame on you, is about Jack Torrance, a former teacher turned writer, who takes on the responsibility of being the caretaker of the Overview Hotel as its secluded location makes it impossible to reach during the snowy winter months. Locked away at the secluded mountainside hotel, the desolation plants a seed which is fermented by the isolation and the Torrance family find that strange things take place at the quiet Overview Hotel.Running at 2 hours and 26 minutes, "The Shining" might be a bit too long for some viewers, especially since this is the type of horror movie that slowly builds up the dread and suspense. So don't expect to be thrown into a movie filled with scares from the very beginning.And it is this slow and foreboding building up of dread and suspension that really makes "The Shining" such a great movie, because it is done in a very skillful manner. And the progression of Jack's descent into madness is so amazing to watch on the screen."The Shining" is also the movie that really made me open up my eyes to the acting talent of Jack Nicholson. He is nothing short of spectacular in the role of Jack Torrance. And his mannerisms, charisma and physical appearance is so well-cut for this particular role. It really felt like the character was custom made with Jack Nicholson in mind. I can't really claim to be familiar with Shelley Duvall other than her work in "The Shining", but she really did a good job in this movie right alongside with Jack Nicholson.The setting for the movie really also adds a lot of depth and atmosphere to the movie. The Overview Hotel is a grand spectacular building in itself both outside and inside. And its secluded location in the mountains just adds so much to the feel of isolation and desolation that permeates the movie."The Shining" is an effective horror movie because of the build up of the isolation, dread and terror. And director Stanley Kubrick really cemented himself in the horror history with this 1980 movie. I dare say that he put a timeless horror classic to film with his accomplishment here.I am rating "The Shining" a well-deserved 8 out of 10 stars. And I can honestly say that "The Shining" is a movie that you can watch again and again with a few years in between.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is not exactly you happy family flick. It's a timeless classic that easily holds up with today's Thriller/ Horror genre. In fact, I believe it may be one of the best Psychological Horror movies up to this day. Living in an empty hotel on an isolated location sounds quite unsettling but it's Jack's Nicholson stellar performance as Jack Torrance that made this movie in my opinion. The overacting, memorable dialogue, and unnerving ambient sounds only enhanced the film adaptation of Stephen King's sinister novel. Unlike the child or Jack, I felt as if the wife lacked some personality. Her character seemed a bit flat. The ending was a bit anti-climatic but nothing that made me enjoy this movie any less. Definitely a must-see movie for the lovers of the Thriller and/or Horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning example of atmosphere, horror, and filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films are able to create a world separate from ours, create a place that has its very own feel, it can be wonderful, awe-inspiring, adventurous, etc. Studio Ghibli are masters of this, as nearly all there films (even the ones grounded in reality) feel fresh and they always make you want to enter there special place, except for maybe Grave of the Fireflies. Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is one of those very special films, but while Studio Ghibli's films were magical and fun, The Shining is terrifying and disturbing.Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time, he was a perfectionist in every sense of the word. In one scene a tennis ball is rolled down a hall, Stanley Kubrick shot this scene over fifty times, and The Shining also holds the record for the most times a single shot in a film has been re-shot. (but some of the crew members say the number was exaggerated) Stanley Kubrick was also vicious on his actors, even sometimes mistreating them to get the performance he wanted.The Shining is an adaptation of a Stephen King novel, and is about Jack Torrance a struggling writer, who is also a recovering alcoholic, who is hired as a winter caretaker of the summer hotel "The Overlook" in Colorado. (the manger says its to difficult to keep the hotel open with the heavy snow fall in the winter.) So Jack Torrance spends the winter alone with his family in The Overlook, but as can be expected of all horror movies, strange things begin to happen, and Jack Torrance slowly loses his mind. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, and many contemporary audiences have criticized Kubrick for this choice, saying that Jack Nicolson was a bad choice for the role, because he always plays crazy people so the transformation of his character would be non existent, this criticism is incredibly out of context. When The Shining was released Jack Nicholson would have been known for playing "free spirit" characters, like in One Flew Over The Cuckoos nest, or Easy Riders, sure nowadays he is known for psychopathic roles, but he wasn't known for them back in 1980. Another thing these critics seem to forget is that there isn't even the slightest hint of Jack losing his mind until 40 minutes into the film, and by that point we have already been exposed to several other horrors, that audiences that haven't ever been exposed to anything about the film wouldn't even expect him to go crazy, but there will never probably be an audience who hasn't been exposed to film in some sort of way, so many of the films scariest and most unnerving scenes, have been referenced and parodied so many times, that it causes them to lose their impact. This is probably The Shining's biggest flaw, and it's not even the films fault. I will not mention any of theses scenes here, so if you haven't seen the film yet, don't look up anything more about the it and watch it as soon as possible. But enough about how other people have ruined the film, let's talk about what makes it so great. I've already talked about Jack Nicholson's performance, but all of the performances in the film are prefect for the characters, Danny Lloyd deserves a special mention, because he was only 6 at the time and was under the impression that he was shooting a drama, not a horror film. You'd never be able to tell if you watched it. The soundtrack is also one of the best in any horror film ever, from the very first shot of the opening credits we are completely immersed in it, it's slow, creeping, subtle, and can match things like the Halloween score or the Vertigo score. The cinematography (done by John Alcott, who did many of Kubrick's other films) is also some of the best that you will ever find in a horror movie. The Shining is also often criticized today for being boring, much in the same way Alien is, and just like Alien these criticisms are completely unwarranted and make no sense. Some may have expected The Shining to jump right into the action, but it takes its time and slowly buries us in the vicious, creepy atmosphere of The Overlook Hotel, and there are several eerie scenes at the very beginning. So I don't really understand why people would think The Shining is "boring." One final thing, if you're an avid Stephen King fan, you will probably be disappointed, as Stanley Kubrick takes several "artistic liberties," while adapting Stephen Kings work. But please look at the film on its own, because it really is one of the greatest films ever made.10/10</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson is the cause to remind this horror again and again. but his performance is only the top of a film who has strong, deep roots in social tensions. and that fact does it more than one of the most impressive adaptations of Stephen King.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will save time for the people who think otherwise and stubbornly deny contradiction: I believe this was a bad movie. Also, I am not a native speaker. There we go. Probably half the public pulled up their suspenders, adjusted their glasses, popped a Lisinopril and left. That leaves us with the few people who have the courage to question Kubrick.Sadly, there are only a few, indeed. The Shining started off promising to be a good movie, however it's relevance slowly started to fade. And I don't mean this in a good way, as in adequately simulating madness. The problem is that Kubrick tried to capture the mysterious supernatural causes involved in the descent into madness of Jack Torrance. It simply failed to deliver. Sure, the metaphors are interesting, and original, having yet to be reproduced with success in films, to this day. But the essence is lacking. The psychological metamorphosis of Jack is lacking. It's there, but it's lacking. It's also not convincing enough. The whole idea was to have the secluded mansion play tricks on your mind, yet the only feeling we're being given is that Jack lacks inspiration for a goddamn novel and gives in to the joy of being a serial killer. I've been there with school assignments. But it doesn't stop here. He is even outwitted by a rag and a possessed child, though we're clearly made to understand that Jack's mental capacities have not been disabled, as is capable to simulate regret when locked in the freezer, in an attempt to free himself. So even though he is capable of such things, chasing those two down is beyond him. Even going through a couple of live fences or retracing footsteps is beyond him. And let's not forget the goddamn bunny suit. Donnie, get over there and teach Jack a lesson or two about what he should've done. So I could keep on going with the numerous mistakes or absurdities this movie has to offer, but frankly, I believe that those who would've been convinced have already been. In the end, it's not the score of the movie that matters, or what Stephen King thought of it. Not making the mistake of taking this movie for a deep critique of society ,or whatever, will suffice. A better example of what Kubrick can achieve can be discovered by watching Paths of Glory, for those interested.</fullReview>

The son has something special gift which is called shining; he perceives spiritual things. They enjoy the stay at first, but gradually the father goes mad. It's related to the miserable murder happened at the hotel before. I'm sure that no one could act the madness except for Jack Nicholson. Just small his behavior makes us scared. This is the deferent point from other horror movies in America. Kubrick creates the best madness without monsters and zombies. Also I guess this film has similar but different atmosphere from J horror films. We can see both of them show human's or ghost's curse, but in this film something beyond the curse is described and Jack Nicholson creates that point. We see the madness, but does it come from only the apparition of the hotel? Is there no relation to his loneliness or pain?</fullReview>

So there is possibility anybody become like him in such place, although everyone cannot do the same things. I also like its screen visual which makes me anxiety.

		<shortDescription>Intense and Intriguing psychological horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******Spoiler Alert****** The Shining is a classic thriller derived from psychological instability and a dysfunctional family dynamic. Jack Nicholson plays the part of Jack Torrance, a father watching over a spiritual hotel in Colorado while writing his book. Jack gets pulled into the dark spirits within the hotel and succumbs to their control. Sandy Duvall plays Wendy, the wife of Jack Torrance, a stay at home mom and an enslaved wife. Their son Danny is played by Danny Lloyd, he has the ability to see the past and some of the future, also known as "shining". Each play a part aiding in the suspenseful theme of evil sides of humanity and horror. The film depicts the small family that moves into a spiritual hotel that has an evil past. They are to stay there all winter as the hotel is closed. The setting portrays a sense of loneliness/remoteness and a feeling of being "swallowed" into nature, or one's own mind. We get the sense of a confused mind when we are able to see the maze on the hotel grounds and have a parallel view of Jack as he stares over the maze. This scene shows Jack's obsession with control and foreshadows into an evil plot. Each of the individual scenes takes you into a whole new depth of perception regarding the work as a whole. Nicholson plays a wonderful part, as a deranged psycho who falls into the evil within a building and ends up attacking his family. Selecting him to play that part has made it difficult for anyone to remake this film. Nicholson played directly into the intended meaning and storyline of the film, feeding his character with obsessive behaviors and erratic outbursts. The Shining led way to new movies that fed on a similar dysfunction and gore, such as I Spit on Your Grave directed by Monroe. These two films replaced, seemingly sane individuals with an evil obsession that caused outburst of violence and bloodshed. The camera angles used allowed us to feel a part of the suspense and literally feel anticipation for the coming violence. By zooming in on facial expressions and body language we are able to get a sense of what is to come. The lighting allows us to focus on the areas we are drawn. In most of the scenes the lighting is dim and tinted yellow, pulling an antique look to surroundings and allow us as the viewer to feel as though we are in a past date. Nicholson arches his back and places his arm over the back of his chair and cocks his head to one side when Wendy confronts him about coming to eat dinner. Jack releases an enormous amount of frustration on Wendy and simply tells her to never come into the room when he is working, his eyes are cinched and he looks at her with pure disgust. Each sophisticated technique pulls the viewer through the experience and thrills of a supernatural embrace. They show us the psychological break down of Jack and the "shining" ability Danny has. Each scene focusing on the parallel views portrays the sense of horror within the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the confusion part 10 is not enough for this movie. If i can i would rate it a 100 considering Jack Nicholson's performance which is outstanding. The movie is based on the story but however some scenes are made up. Like Wendy was actually a blonde and Jack's encounter with the evil forces was a gradual process. The movie is arranged in a way which glues the viewer wondering what will happen next. In my opinion , however the role of Jack Torrance seems humorous that this movie confused me that is this really a horror film? So many comedy elements and I was shocked that it was not in the comedy genre along with horror. Like the part Jack comes with the axe seemed actually funny and also the way he talks to Wendy when she finds out what he had been typing. All my little cousins found this movie (forget some scary parts) to be actually funny . The Loyd scene was ironic that it will always be one of my favorite scenes. Finally this movie could have been made much more thrilling to the viewers if the roles were well played and the plot was followed properly. To me Jack seemed quite funny. Not quite but very funny. Even due to this confusion I give this a 10 because it was a joy to watch due to Jack Nicholson's performance keeping aside the genre part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Overlook hotel. you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's Version of the Shining butchers Stephen King's fantastic novel. by stretching it in other ways and omitting important plot points and adding others and making changes to the Overlook itself and how the Torrance family reacts to the Hotel.That said. however Kubrick's version of the Shining is a outstanding and highly original look at King's novel. Which King hates. but Kubrick was a gifted director who knew what he was doing and he was a perfectionist which drove the cast and crew of this movie crazy. but Kubrick never lost sight of the story he wanted to tell. in the novel King explains that the Overlook is a large psychic vampire a large battery feeding off of the people there who had Psychic abilities . Making the Overlook a large battery that stores and contains the most emotional psychic moments of its existence. Happiness ,Death,Love , violence. all of these things go on and on in the Overlook . but in Kubrick's nothing about the Overlook is explained except in the barest of details .but that is more then enough. Here in the movie less is more. And while the Shining is Kubrick's movie it belongs to Jack Nicholson. while in the book the slide into madness is supposed to be subtle for Jack Torrance. In this movie he seems cheese and crackers right from the start which is fun to watch as you realize the cheese has slid off his crackers and he is dangerous . The best bit is the scene that leads to the staircase. Wendy stop swinging the bat Wendy..as he moves in to kill her in a moment of comic timing. Nicholson makes the movie his own. Jack is dangerous he is now a maniac bent of killing his family. But he has a sense of humor about it. which makes it creepy.To me the part that keeps me up at night while thinking about it is only hinted at. When we are told Delbert Grady went crazy and killed his family with a ax. And stacked them neatly in one of the rooms of the west wing like cord wood. and then shoots himself. In the novel Grady kills himself long after his family he kills himself by shotgun because he has broken his leg falling down the stairs . To me the most horror filled moment is when you think about the little girls being killed by a ax. while one little girl looks on and sees her sister being killed by her father and knowing she is next. Does she run ? does she hide ? can you imagine the horror she must have felt knowing her sister was being chopped to pieces by their father and their mother was already dead. and she was next. That's the one point in the movie that gets me every time and with every viewing. That's how you know its a great movie. film making of the finest kind. And after seeing that and letting your imagination run wild with little scenes like the one I described . You can forgive Kubrick for his butchering King's novel because he did what he sets out to do. Telling King's story from a different view point. And scaring the daylights out of us . Its a great classic and deserves to be !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Scary for Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest actors of all time, Jack Nicholson, shows what happens when he commits himself to all work and no play as he attempts to finish his novel. The scariest thing about this movie is how vulnerable his own family is to his descent into madness, as a blizzard whirls around their location in an empty lodge in the middle of nowhere with ghosts abounding.As the brilliant director, Alfred Hitchcock showed us in his movie "Psycho," the most bone-chilling horror can be imparted through subtle psychological means (the shower curtain, the bloody water circling the bathtub drain). And so it is with The Shining: A long, winding icy road up to the far-away lodge; 500 typed pages that all say "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy;" an endless labyrinth of hedges. Don't worry, there are horror, blood and gore aplenty for the rabid fan.A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the biggest must-see horror films for all fans of horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Stephen King but what Kubrick has done was strip away all the nonsense of the original novel and create a masterpiece in terms of haunting imagery, buildup, and suspense.After a writer and his family agrees to watch over the "Overlook Hotel" for the winter, a haunting presence causes him to go slowly insane as the claustrophobia builds up around him.This movie doesn't rely on cheesy jumpscares and unnecessary gore that many other modern horror movies rely too heavily on. The Shining builds up its scare factor with suspense and claustrophobia. This leads up to terrifying and well-executed domestic violence which is done phenomenal thanks to Jack Nicholson's outstanding performance and the great execution of it. His great acting contributes to several great scenes especially the iconic "Here's Johnny" one.Kubrick uses camera movements and techniques, sound design, disturbing visuals, lighting, colors, foreshadowing, and attention to detail to make this a truly frightening horror film which contains so much suspense. Also, the score is one of the most eeriest movie scores ever written because it contains sharp, high-pitched sounds, and it is perfectly timed throughout the movie.Sure, this movie did deviate from Stephen King's novel, but Kubrick expanded on the novel. It changed the things in the novel that didn't work that well and he changed them to make sure each aspect of it was as effective as possible.This is clearly one of the best horror films of all time. It uses suspense, claustrophobia, and camera techniques and it delivers them effectively to provide several scary and suspenseful scenes. Topped off with an excellent performance by Jack Nicholson, this is clearly one of the biggest must-see films for all horror movie fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where a hedge maze becomes a hall of mirrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The music, the hedge maze, the empty ballroom, the elevator doors opening to a tidal wave of blood, Nicholson's celebrated hook; in terms of cinematic iconography, The Shining is unrivalled. However, to applaud the film simply because it has cultural appeal would be a great discredit to director Stanley Kubrick's subtle use of subtext and skillful creation of a sustained atmosphere that is tense and genuinely creepy. This is one of those supposedly scary films that does chill - even if it never quite makes you jump out of your seat in terror - with Kubrick blending elements of intense, psychological horror with an almost soap-opera-like melodrama to give us a film that really goes beyond the limitations of the horror genre to create something much more substantial.From the outset, Kubrick makes no explicit allusions to this being a horror-film in the traditional sense, since there are no creatures in the shadows, or jolts and jumps; with the shocks coming from the juxtaposition between the film's created-reality and the more outlandish spiritual elements from Stephen King's original novel. Instead of generic scare tactics, the director creates disturbing images out of the most mundane of situations, with the most lingering images including skeletons dressed for a ball, children and their toys and wounded guests that refuse to leave the party. The images come from this idea of marital collapse and the guilt of the adult protagonists filtered through everything from 20th century war atrocities, 18th century literature, Scandinavian art-films, crime scene photography and the images of Diane Arbus.For an excellent example of this idea in full effect take a look at the scene between Jack Torrance and the women in the bathroom; which not only seems surreal on a purely superficial level, but also taps into the guilt of infidelity, crushed masculinity, death, decay and old age. Later in the film, Wendy's fear of her own husband is interpreted via implied homo-eroticism, when she stumbles across a man receiving oral sex from a spectre in a dog-costume. However, the figure in the dog-costume could easily be a woman, so perhaps this is a signifier of Wendy's own infidelity to Jack. This scene - like the rest of the film - is open to interpretation.The ending of the film hints at spiritual-transcendence, the playing off historical coincidences and internal-mirroring. Here, the ending offers us a number of plausible narrative explanations. The most common explanation being that Jack has been driven mad by isolation, and, having heard about the previous caretaker who went mad and butchered his family, has psychosomatically descended to that exact same mental state. This leaves the final image - and the enigmatic questions that are raised - completely unanswerable. A second interpretation would be that the 'story' we believe to be real - the one taking place in the late 1970's - is actually the story being written by Jack. That he never really suffers from writers block, but instead, rather like King in reality, uses the writers block, coupled with his isolation and the pain of his inner-demons, to write the story we see unfold (The Shining).A final possible ending, and one that proves to be the most complex and complicated, deals with the mirroring of past and present, the re-occurrence of different characters within different time-lines, such as the two incarnations of Grady and the two incarnations of Jack; who, in the words of one character, has "always been here". This ending is the most unsatisfying in terms of overall denouement, but is the most fun when it comes to re-evaluating Kubrick's subtle use of imagery, dialogue and subtext. To me however, regardless of what interpretation you choose to apply to it, The Shining is simply a great film; one that rewards with an interesting, continually fascinating plot rife with possible interpretations and Kubrick's always interesting use of cinematic composition, editing, music and performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another viewing of Stanley Kubrick's 'The shining'. The iconic scenes and acting will probably never lose their creepy 'charm'. I recently found out that Stephen King wasn't too happy about the lack of character development for Jack Torrance (he's pretty much crazy from the get-go), which is why King later directed his own interpretation. I never read the book, and I remember little of his version, but this film is more than fulfilling on its own - I didn't miss character development that much.Iconic images (and sounds), that is what 'The shining' has to offer. The carpet riding, the elevator blood flood, the labyrinth hunt, Jack Nicholson's intense craziness, and so on and so forth. The film is a claustrophobic experience from beginning to end, in which Kubrick excels as the creator of an otherworldly place which before and after has seldomly been equaled. Seeing is believing.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

I never noticed that at the time because I was too wrapped up in the movie and what was going to happen next.What can I say about The Shining that hasn't already been said? The Shining, like Carrie, was an early Stephen King creation that did well and shocked viewers everywhere. The Shining is what all cabin fever movies aspire to be. Jack Nicholson was stellar and Shelley Duvall held her own. The Shining is a must see if for no other reason than to understand the origin of "redrum".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best King adaption ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick nails it again with this adaption of Stephen King's boring novel. King is a great idea man, but his writing style is a bit droll. Luckily Kubrick took the best elements and made it his own. The Shining is a horror masterpiece, right up there with John Carpenter's The Thing and Nightmare on Elm Street. The music and cinematography are hypnotizing and Jack's performance is a tour de force. There is few horror films that feel this epic. It's a classic in the truest sense if the word. It's gotten better over time and the creep factor remains strong. I try and watch this every Halloween (along with the movie Halloween). I wish there was a way to view the 144 minute version- so curious as to what was cut out. So for you horror fans out there, this is mandatory viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick great job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stanley Kubrick. Well he did an excellent job with Jack Nicklson &amp; Shelly DuVall. He was especially the staircase scene when Shelly discovered Jack wasn't writing anything of worth... Shelly was swinging the back all the way up the stairs! I enjoyed the ballroom scene when he spoke to Grady in the restroom. Loved it. This is a must see horror film. It was filmed in the eighties and is still enjoyable by today's standards.The caretaker who went on vacation was good he was able to "shine" with the little boy. And the red rum scene was well executed. I believe it was filmed in Canada in a remote hotel. The hotel was a good setting for a cold fantastic horror film. Do enjoy this movie. A true classic.</fullReview>

It can, and most often does, contain Symbolism and Deeper Meanings. At its Best it touches all of the receptors. The Eye, Brain, Spirit, Soul, Heart, and Subconscious, are Tickled, Massaged, or Radically Retooled.Such is the Film work of Stanley Kubrick. It can be Enjoyed, with Razzberries, Booed, Praised, Thumbed Up or Down, Middle Fingered, or hailed as a Masterpiece. One of the Kubrick things is that the Director makes Inhuman demands on His projects and devotes Years and Yearnings at the expense of all who Dare Inhabit Kubrick-Verse and many have found the Journey Demanding, Grueling, Rewarding and a Singular Experience at the least.The Shining can be watched as a Horror Film, Drenched in the Red Stuff with Disturbing Images and heart pounding Suspense. On the Surface a Professional, Artistic, and well done take on the Low-Brow Genre that only Occasionally Rises above Trash, Exploitation and Cash-Ins. But the Film can be Subliminal and so Deep that a Dissection can Result in a Labyrinth worthy of the Overlook's vast Corridors. A Maze of infinite Meanings and Cultural, Iconic, and Philosophical Innerlooks. It is possible to Rent it, Buy it, put it in the player, Nuke the Popcorn and have a Scary Night on the couch in front of the Big Screen?or?if the Inclination presents itself, begin the Doctoral Thesis on the Director's Visions, the Modern Horror Film, Movie Messaging, and Movies as Therapeutical Theatre. As Kubrick Movies go, this one Mirrors and invites about as much Reflection as any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the shining is a great film, it is always in the top 10 of people's lists of their favourite horror movies. It is not one of my best horror movies has i prefer something more upto date etc but it was a good one for an old movie and i think many people who haven't seen it yet would like it.The main character is great, the actor plays this part amazingly and perfectly. The film itself is quite crazy (as he becomes crazy), it does draw you in and i found myself wanting to watch it all the way to the very end.This film would be sure to scare those easily scared people out there and would be great for watching with friends or family (adults of course).I think it deserves a 7 / 10 at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think of the greatest terror imaginable. Is it a monstrous Alien? A lethal epidemic? Or is it this harrowing masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, is it fear of murder by someone who should love and protect you-a member of your own family? From a script he co-adapted from the Steven King novel, Kubrick melds vivid performances, menacing settings, dreamlike tracking shots and shock after shock into a milestone of the macabre. Jack Torrance arrives at the elegant, isolated Overlook Hotel as off- season caretaker with his wife and child. Torrance has never been there before, or has he? The answer lies in a ghostly time warp of madness and murder. This film stars: Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall &amp; Danny Llyod This film is a scary film, I watched this with a friend and he was literally bricking it throughout the film, In my opinion it is not a great film but it is a film that I can watch and be scared like I should in a horror film, it doesn't deserve 8.5 in my opinion but I can see why people love this film. I highly recommend it, just don't plan on having too much sleep the same night as it will leave you shocked &amp; scared.***/***** good film</fullReview>

Even though they made many Steven King books into movies and none of them were quite as good as this one. The acting by nickleson was very good the woman who played his wife was no good I thought but the child actor was great.This is about a writer who goes and takes a job as a caretaker for a giant mansion. While inside this mansion weird things start to happen as he starts to lose his mind.This movie was really good. It was made back in the day where horror movies actullay had style and substense.

		<shortDescription>Just A Review: The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it's been a month and six days I have been gone. Missed me? I had my grandparents and cousins come over from Mexico, so that's why I haven't been very active, and why I haven't been working on scripts. But they went back yesterday, so I may have more time to work on scripts and such. So anyway, the Shining. I watched the Stanley Kubrick version yesterday, and I can see why it's one of the most famous movies of all time. The story is about a family moving into a hotel that is apparently haunted, and it possesses Jack, the father, to kill his wife Wendy, and his son Danny. It's a story that keeps you in suspense. The whole time, I didn't know what to expect. And it show's it in a very scary way. With Jack growing more insane by the minute. Speaking of Jack, the characters are few, but great. Jack starts as this normal father, and slowly turns into a murder crazy monster. And it makes him so entertaining to watch. Wendy's fear for Jack, and the fate of Danny is shown in an excellent way. Though, that's all she's good for. Danny scares me because he is always thinking freaky thoughts like how he saw a wave of blood move all around a hallway in the hotel. He even made the infamous "Redrum" writing on the wall. Not only that, but he is the one who is ALWAYS in danger. You begin to worry for Danny. And hope that Jack doesn't kill him. What I love most about this film is of course, the suspense. You never know when Jack is going to strike, or what will happen next. It will always keep you on the edge of your seat. If you're watching this on a couch or chair or whatever... SPOILER WARNING STARTS HERE: My only problem with the movie was at the end, after Jack freezes to death with his Me Gusta face, it shows a picture of him at this hotel in 1923. Wait what? That confused me so much. SPOILERS END HERE: In conclusion, the Shining is an excellent movie. With a haunting atmosphere and suspenseful story, this is truly deserving as one of the best movies of all time.Story: 8/10 Character: 10/10 Horror: 9/10 Overall: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like this film very much. I agree it's very entertaining, well directed and has a creepy atmosphere (mostly because of the background sound and Nicholson's acting), but it is not enough to qualify this as a great horror movie.In the beginning of "The Shining", Torrance already looked like a freak. It's not like in the book that he's a regular guy and transforms into a monster; he's just strange at the very beginning. Not to mention that the family conversations before going to the hotel were very amateurish, you could easily notice they were acting. Also, the little boy speaking with that strange voice was ridiculous; they could've made a much creepier way of speak.So that's it, the film has some good points but nothing really happens to satisfy the spectator. It's a bunch of non sense happenings. Nicholson's acting and Kubrick's directing are what make this film be watchable and respectable, since the plot/story was very weak, leading to nowhere and delivering such a bad (and frustrating) ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well deserved classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first viewing of Stanley Kubrick's classic 'The Shining' left me somewhat...underwhelmed. As a 15 year old boy, my underdeveloped, action oriented brain, desired gore and cheap thrills...something that this film avoids. Viewing 'The Shining' as an adult however, was a truly unforgettable experience. So here are my two cents....Hearing the term 'adaptation of a Stephen King novel' makes me want to vomit. With such duds as 'Storm of the Century', 'Rose Red' and 'Tommyknockers' falling within this category, I was sceptical. But thankfully, Kubrick diverts drastically from the source material, playing down the supernatural elements of horror. The fear of the characters' deteriorating mental health, and the potential of what they could do to one another, is far more terrifying than the threat of ghosts. This makes for a human, relatable, and intelligent horror; more frightening than the typical ghost story. Kudos to the screenwriters for taking a chance.Like most Kubrick films, the performances are strangely enigmatic. Shelly Duvall's portrayal of the seemingly 'desperate to please' Wendy, was irritating in the initial stages of the film. There was a self-consciousness to the performance, that felt slightly superficial. HOWEVER, when the hysteria sets in, Duvall delivers the goods. She is chillingly authentic, and utterly electrifying. It actually heightens the experience in the final third of the film. Apparently Kubrick was a prick to her on set in order to 'push her' into that place...so thank you for that! It's magic. I find Jack Nicholson a difficult actor to really warm to, and his performance here is no exception to that. It's over the top, comical, frightening...and unpredictably mad. I think I would have preferred Jack Torrance to be a more likable character in the developing stages, but nonetheless, he is fascinating. And Danny Lloyd would have to go on the list of 'best child performances ever'. The facial expressions, body language, and the eyes, are completely believable and nuanced! They struck gold with him.Typical of Kubrick, the film is a visual spectacle. Even by todays standards, the cinematography is mesmerising - a testament to Kubrick and John Alcott. Visually, the film is so absorbing. The camera rarely stops moving, in inventive (but non-distracting) ways. There is a sense that the characters are being watched by 'another presence' that is constantly tracking their movements. The camera work is subtly unsettling.It is so refreshing for a modern audience to watch a film like this, that relies on a slow and contemplative build up, and resonating images for scares. There is a genuinely creepy tone throughout, and the climax absolutely soars with thrills. And, strangely enough for this genre, 'The Shining' gets better with every single viewing. A well deserved classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric, but overrated thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably one of the most loved/loathed "haunted house" thrillers ever. Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson fans cannot seem to praise it enough, while fans of Stephen King's legendary novel are decidedly more lukewarm towards it. Personally I find the film rather schizophrenic, which leaves me somewhere in the middle. Anyone hoping to see even a marginally faithful adaptation of the King novel will be sorely disappointed as aside from the very bare bones of the story, many of King's memorable set pieces and much of the emotional pull of his story has been abandoned. Aspiring writer Jack Torrance and family are hired on to become caretakers of the oppressive Overlook Hotel during its off season in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains. Despite the threat of isolation and stories of a prior caretaker who went mad and murdered his family, the Torrances persevere and find out that the hotel has some rather nasty spooks determined to set Jack against his wife and son. Director Kubrick provides a chilling and ominous atmosphere thanks to hypnotic cinematography and amazing sets. The corridors of the hotel seem to go on forever. The film has its decidedly chilling moments ? particularly the appearances of murdered twins, Nicholson's ax-wielding attack on wife Shelley Duvall and a memorable chase through a wintry labyrinth. Unfortunately, it has some glaring problems narratively and with its lead performance that cannot be overlooked. The title of the film is the slang term given to a psychic power possessed by both Danny Lloyd as the son and Scatman Crothers, as a hotel chef. In the King novel, the power was a major player in the story. In the film, both Danny and his power seem an afterthought and the hotel ? which was decidedly malevolent in King's story ? comes across as rather a neutral entity that just houses nasty specters. Danny's primal fear that his father will turn into a monster that will murder he and his mother is oddly muted in the film ? largely because Kubrick treats the characters and their emotional plight as of little consequence and is much more concerned with setting the stage for Nicholson to enact his raving madman performance. Sadly, Nicholson's much-ballyhooed central performance nearly derails the film. At no point does anyone buy him as a caring husband/father who makes a shocking transition into a psycho. Instead, Nicholson plays him from the outset as a creepy nut with pedophile mannerisms to such an extent, that it becomes impossible to believe that anyone would follow him into another room much less into a 3-month isolation with a young child. While Lloyd is largely relegated to prop status speaking in a strange voice and drooling, Nicholson stomps and chomps the scenery sputtering, snarling, and hissing in between inappropriate one-liners. There is no doubt that his madman act is impressive, but it is also one-note and robs his character of any sympathy. Seriously, from frame one there is not one moment where he seems relatively normal and there is no moment where he shows any reluctance in his descent into madness. This film also serves the dubious distinction of marking when Nicholson's performances segued from real acting into caricature until About Schmidt came to the rescue. By contrast, it is not until reflection that one realizes Duvall, as his terrified wife, has delivered the film's best performance and shown him up. Additionally, the final shot of the film, which is apparently supposed to be a surprise, is anything but, indicating that Kubrick and his writers are not overly familiar with horror genres conventions. Yet for all its faults, the atmosphere and lavishness provided by Kubrick is a definite must-see in that few subsequent thrillers have been able to compete with it and he does provide moments they stay with you, even if the end product is not as impressive as some of its parts.</fullReview>

Comprised by hyper-lit sets, eccentric soundtrack and visual extravagance, this becomes a tour de force that constantly teeters between psychopathology and paranormality and manages to transmit a genuine feeling of eeriness.It does however feature a star performance that would probably be better off had it been more restrained. As it is, Nicholson's take tends more towards caricature rather than madness.Still, this is horror at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The shining deserves it recognition as the most terrifying film of all time. Stanley the perfectionist delivered the shining with perfection. Proving that he can conquer near about every genre. At the time of it release, the film was criticised of being to slow, too long and too hard to understand. Yes , it an physiological film, requiring an bright mind to understand it. Also at the time, Jack Nicholson's performance was panned for being to over the top. To me and many others, this is one of Jack's best known and beloved role. Jack delivered the goods. He was simply amazing as an recovering alcoholic facing the torment of isolation and the closed spaces that the hotel provided him. Then there's Shelley Duvall which in my opinion, played the best female horror character ever. Her role was believable, she acted like an mother would react. There was no falling over or ridiculous screaming, she gave an professional performance.Credit also goes for Stephen king. He wrote an original horror. Instead of an vampire or an werewolf or yet an mask murdered being the villain, Stephen thought the scariest thing of all is the human mind. Many people complain about the film being slow. Not once did I think this. What your watching is Jack doing what he does best, acting crazy. As the film progress, you see the effects the house and the surrounding has not only on Jack but the whole family ( as eventually they all become either crazy or slightly crazy). In fact the film races by. Another unique factor it has compared to other horrors is that it not by any means predictable, you don't know what going to happen next. It keeps you on your edge of your seat.The directing and camera work was brilliant. Stanley made the hotel breath , with its wide corridors . The tracking shots were beautiful and the music that kept playing through out the film was just an huge effect. It played the biggest part of creating an disturbing atmosphere. From the last hour, every scene is memorable. If you want the full effect, then watch it alone in the dark and after it finished, watch it again. By then you'll understand why this is rated number 1 on the most terrifying movie list</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>European Vs. American Version breakdown!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining (The Versions)The American version is 144 minutes, the European is 115 minutes.I can easily see why Kubrick would prefer the shorter European cut of 'The Shining'. That said it is great to see a longer version.The extra material included in the American cut are mainly bridging scenes and expository scenes. There are a few extra moments within scenes that are cut from the European version.The first is a scene with Wendy talking to a female Doctor about the fact that Jack has indeed hurt Danny by dislocating his arm in a drunken attack. This episode is explained later by Jack to the 'imaginary' barman in the ballroom, so the scene is redundant.An other is an extension of a scene where Jack explains to Wendy that he had a strong sense of Dejavue when he first arrived at the hotel. This moment also crosses the camera line as the first part is shown in the reflection of a mirror. By cutting the end of the scene the transition to the next one is crisper and tighter.The cook's part is larger in the American cut and shows more of the stages of his progress in reaching the hotel. One scene with him talking to a garage owner from the Airport on the telephone feels unnecessary and I can see why it was cut. One expository scene has Wendy talking to herself to inform us of her means of escape. It is much better that this scene is cut as it is theatrical expository device. Wendy then goes to Danny's room and we are shown that he has reverted into the character of his imaginary friend as he tries to deal with the horrors of the hotel. I think again this scene is not necessary as it labours a point.Then there is another bridging scene with Wendy and Danny watching a cartoon together, which is only there to explain that she wants to go and talk with Jack. Again removing this moment is a wise one as it keeps things tight.A couple of extra lines by Jack and the 'imaginary' barman are in the longer cut. "Women can't live with them...." Their removal helps with the focus of the scene.There is an extra scene with Danny saying "Redrum". This takes away from the creepy scene that follows with Danny again saying "Redrum"....so I am sure it was removed to make the impact of the later scene greater.In the European version, when Wendy finally see visions within the hotel, they are brief and shocking. The American version has more shots of Wendy witnessing these horrors. Suddenly, the reception area is dressed in cobwebs and skeletons are siting on sofas. This tacky moment made me laugh and I am sure it was the first thing Kubrick removed from the European cut so as not to get the same reaction. The European version is more polished than the American cut because the flow is far more dynamic. The shorter cut is also more subtle and challenging. I agree with all of the cuts that Kubrick made for the European version and I can understand why he felt it was much better because it is. I feel the American version is not the finished movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still shining thirty years later- and forever and ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my reviewing of horror and Halloween-themed shows throughout October, here's one of the all-time great horror flicks: Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Based on a novel by Stephen King, the movie tells the story of a family who look after a closed hotel during the winter, only for the ghosts of the hotel to drive the father Jack (Jack Nicholson) insane and determined to kill his wife and young son.Oh, right, and one other thing: the kid is capable of telepathy and precognition, something that seems unrelated to the ghostly phenomena, as if the two things were thrown into the mix just to make for interesting results. Or that may not be the case: according to the character Dick Hallorann, all these things are related to shining, something supernatural and slightly incomprehensible that certain people and places are able to do.First, dialogue about a past tragedy at the hotel allows for some foreshadowing of ghosts and murder to come. Nicholson plays a convincing psychopath, originally a man who seems to hate his family. There are early signs of insanity (maybe a little too early) as he smiles while talking about cannibalism on his way to the hotel. On the other hand, he does scream at a nightmare of himself killing his wife and son. The ghosts fan the flames, but what are their motives? The novel explains them, or so I've heard, but the movie keeps them a mystery. Maybe we're expected to understand that ghosts, like people, can be malicious.Certain parts of the film, like seeing the boy on his little bicycle exploring the hotel, are well-shot and nearly hypnotic. The horror itself unfolds in some surreal ways; a sexy naked woman turns into a hag, a metaphor of Jack being seduced by the hotel's evil. An elevator door opens and blood pours out: perhaps this is the blood of native Americans, and Bill Blakemore suggested the whole movie is a metaphor for the violence of whites against natives. It would explain the otherwise inexplicable reference to white man's burden. The ghost girls are eerie, as are the ghosts Wendy sees, and the "novel" Jack writes. In the end, Jack freezes while his family escapes. Kubrick evidently knew what Shakespeare knew- that killing off tragic characters is often the only way to go.Happy Halloween.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't dare Overlook this classic horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the work of Stephen King, what we have here is a classic horror from director Stanley Kubrick that may not please those expecting a slavish adaptation but will certainly please all genre fans.It's all about Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson, in top form and providing some iconic moments), a struggling writer and struggling man who takes his wife and son with him when he gets a job caretaking at the Overlook Hotel during it's off-season. The brooding quiet, the isolation, the fact that his son keeps seeing nasty visions that don't seem to be there - all of these things upset Jack and start to wear away at his soul. This is all encouraged by the hotel itself, a place full of bad vibes, ghosts and inherent evil.In an annoying way, The Shining is one of those movies that has already been dissected to death and while reviewing it you feel you will never have anything worthwhile to add. The cast is okay (while Nicholson is superb and Scatman Crothers does great with his small role Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd are alternately weak and annoying at times), the direction is masterful and the frights are, well, frightening. Often referenced and/or parodied by others there are plenty of plus points to offset the few negatives; THAT dangerous room, the "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" revelation, conversations at the bar, etc.What I will say is what I have said many times before, something that has made some people disagree quite vehemently. A couple of moments aside, it's quite possible to view The Shining as a movie WITHOUT ghosts and simply as a study of descending into madness, an unflinching look at the constant machinations of evil. I am not saying that the movie has to be watched this way, and I certainly do not consciously think of it while watching the film, but I am saying that you can enjoy yet another layer from it if you do view it as such and it makes for an interesting conversation starter.Haunted hotel or not, there's no arguing that it's simply a classic modern horror movie and should remain so for years and years to come.See this if you like: 1408, Session 9, "The Shining".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to check out the DVD edition of this flick and on a 50 inch plasma was indeed almost as frightened as I was seeing it nearly 30 years ago.The flick is produced with great attention to detail and progresses slow enough to be compelling drama and fast enough to haunt ones memory.All acting was superb and with todays shallow directing, this flick remains at the top of the pile.The casting was also excellent from Danny LLoyd to Of course Jack Nick'.I did miss a few subtle things in my first screening of this movie and was fascinated by the apparent philosophical theme of eternal recurrence. Although this theory is said valid over huge amounts of time, this flick compresses it down from 1921 to 1980 !I also thought of another chiller that exploits ghosts and the same theme. Wind Chill. Both films are indeed chilling and enduring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most of the very best movies, Stanley Kubrick's film of The Shining has only become more and more renowned and influential with time. Released in 1980 to a limited box office success, mixed reviews and even (one would say, understandable) hostility from feminist groups, it certainly didn't catch on overnight. What's more, Stephen King was famously angered by how his story had been translated to the silver screen and Kubrick's crazed perfectionism boiled over to the point where it became what he was known most for, personality-wise (he notoriously did over 300 takes of the "What should be done with Danny" scene). But jumpforward 30 years, and The Shining has finally risen to a level of greatesteem with critics and audiences alike, and rightfully so.Struggling author and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny (Danny Lloyd, who, thanks to some clever direction had no idea he was working on a horror movie) have just arrived at the magnificent, sprawling Overlook Hotel in Colorado, where Jack has landed the job of caretaker during the winter off-season. Jack hopes to get some serious writing done during their stay, but unbeknownst to him, Wendy and Danny, the Overlook has a very violent past in which one of the former caretakers murdered himself and his entire family out of isolation. Their spirits remain, haunting and cursing the hotel. On top of that, young Danny possesses a very powerful gift called "shining," which enables him to clairvoyantly detect and communicate with evil spirits, a gift he ironically shares with the hotel's kindly head chef Dick Hallorann (the wonderful Scatman Crothers). Over the winter, emotional problems and isolation send Jack spirally down into the depths of insanity, leading to only two things: bloodshed and death.Now I'll be honest: Kubrick is one director who either amazes me (Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket and of course this) or bores me stupid (Barry Lyndon and the first half of 2001: A Space Odyssey), but with this knockout masterpiece he makes not one decision that's less than a genius one. His direction here is nothing short of breathtaking, as his rhythmic pace in the second and third acts and tedious attention to detail in all three acts of the film enables him to notch the tension up to almost unbearable levels, all building up to one of the most unforgettable climaxes ever seen in cinema. Much credit for this goes to cinematographer John Alcott, whose stunning aerial shots and creepy Steadicam interior photography enhances the film's eerie atmosphere enormously. The music by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind also does what it is meant to do brilliantly.Maybe most thankfully, given this is a horror movie after all, the acting is exceptional. The one and only Jack Nicholson, despite not wanting to be in the same room as his director during filming, enjoys what for me is his best role after One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest's R.P. Murphy, and boy does he give it his all. Nicholson makes it look all too easy as he effortlessly portrays Jack in every stage of his downfall ? from slightly crazy and career-driven but loving husband and father to unstable hotel-bound man to finally a complete and utter animal. Nobody else could have played this part, and it's surely one of the scariest performances in the history of film. Although her character will probably annoy many people (and indeed that's really the point, you could argue), Shelley Duvall does a radiant job as an initially seemingly catatonic housewife who must race against time to save herself and her son from the one man who should love them more than anything else in the world. Finally, Scatman Crothers brings a whole lot of old-world charm to the wise and affable cook who shares Danny's gift/curse.I was first introduced to Kubrick's film of The Shining when I was a 13-year-old lad, eager for something new, and I was mesmerized ? scared out of my brains, but mesmerized. Its technical mastery aside, The Shining becomes a true definitive masterpiece in how it deconstructs the human condition, looking at what makes us sane and what can spark irreversible insanity in us all. With each genre he tackled, Kubrick aimed to make the last word in film-making in whatever genre that might've been. This was his attempt to do that for the horror genre, and if I may say so, he sure as hell succeeded. The Shining is one of the most insanely (no pun intended) brilliant pieces of cinema ever crafted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent psychological horror drama. And one of Jack's most memorable and iconic roles("Heeeere's Johnny!")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read the novel from Stephen King then you know it is quite different from Stanley Kubrick's adaptation. King who's novel is long and drawn out and it goes into more detail as is the case with most books. Kubrick on the other hand made the film long also yet his focus was more of an enchanting and psychological chilling visual masterpiece. Stanley was always so good for the fact that when shooting his films the scenes shot were always done in a manner of detail with a great camera touch. You add this with the performance of Jack Nichoslon(my favorite actor)who's over the top and out right crazy here with his role as was so common in his acting roles(example: "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and as the "Joker" in "Batman") "The Shining" turns out to be a horror masterpiece as most agree it was one of Warner Brothers most acclaimed and successful films of all time.Nicholson is Jack Torrance an ex school teacher and now writer who moves his wife Wendy(Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny(Danny Lloyd) a clairvoyant to the Overlook hotel in Colorado, where he has just been hired as winter caretaker. This is an old and elegant style hotel of many alleys and room floors, yet soon behind it all this place reveals a haunted past of ghostly secrets it's a past time of ghostly madness. Scatman Crothers and Barry Nelson give good supporting performances as hotel employees.And the creme of the crop my man Nicholson gives a stirring and most memorable iconic performance as a man who's guilt ridden the film is a good character study of a man coming to terms with his guilt and family problems only sadly he gets wrapped up in the ghostly and sinister past of the overlook. Nicholson was at his angered and shocking best even during the dreamlike track shots and remember the famous line that still sticks in pop culture "Heeeere's Johnny!". The film is moved just fine by Stanley's direction it blends well with his musical score which is so pulsating and creepy. In the end it proves the past can suck you in and haunt you, and also that each and every place has hidden secrets as in this case it was a ghostly past a time warp. Overall a great horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stephen King did not like this adaptation of his book because it strayed from the original story so much, but I think that's what made this movie as amazing as it is. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but I honestly think that Stanley Kubrick came up with a better story that is much more atmospheric and terrifying.The ever brilliant Jack Nicholson continues to amaze in this film and is truly horrifying as Jack Torrence. The rest of the cast is great but there are some iffy moments from Shelly Duvall. The story is great and Stanley Kubrick's direction is unbelievable. I wish he hadn't died.If you call yourself a horror fan and you haven't seen this movie, then you're not a horror fan. It's as simple as that. Stop sitting around and see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of the macabre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) and his wife Wendy (Shelly Devuall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) stay for the winter at a isolated hotel called "The Overlooked Hotel" in which they participate as caretakers. Danny has a special ability to see the future and past with his mind and communicate without opening his mouth which enables him to know danger known as "Shining". This hotel was once built on a ancient Indian burial ground, long ago there was a man with a family who had a similar job like Jack at the Overlook Hotel murdered his family with an Axe, the hotel is haunted by spirits from the past come to terrify the Torrence family and make Jack go insane to the edge of madness.An epic supernatural horror thriller from Stanley Kubrick is a very loose adaptation of Stephen King's timeless novel which he said he disliked the film version from Kubrick but i think it's a dark, surreal and nightmarish film about the supernatural and madness. The performances are terrific especially Scatman Crothers as the lovable Chef, the music score by Wendy Carlos is chilling in particular and the whole movie is atmospheric. I like how they use camera tricks and the tension this movie has, sure it's not near the novel but it's still a masterpiece of horror in it's own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*WARNING!! SPOILERS!* I freely admit to reading the book before seeing the film, but I tried very hard to see the film as a separate entity, and it still didn't do it for me.I found the entire thing rather disconcerting. Nothing is really explained, and while some may think this "adds to the mood" I just found it to be lazy and irritating. I have to say how frustrating it was to see Halloran throughout the entire movie trying to get there and is immediately killed. I understand that this was meant to be a shock, but I just found it irritating and time wasted. Perhaps if Halloran had done something, ANYTHING, before he was killed I wouldn't feel that way. I was also put off by the pictures on Hallorans walls. I don't know what that was about. He was just a useless character because Kubrick needed SOMEONE to kill.I also didn't CARE. I didn't care about any of the characters. I think that's a very important quality in a film. I could have lived with the changes if I cared at all about the characters. As it was, I didn't get scared or anxious or INTO the movie at all, because I just didn't care. Jack, as others have said, seemed crazy from the beginning, which undermined the film, in my opinion.They didn't need to bother calling the movie The Shining, as Danny's abilities played such a small part they could have been cut entirely and no one would notice.It wasn't all bad. Nicholson's performance towards the end was quite disturbing, and I loved the imagery in the movie. It just didn't deserve the hype. There were some scares. The twin girls were disturbing enough. And it is still, even with these flaws, one of the BETTER horror movies I've seen in my life. I would certainly recommend seeing it. I just don't think it's the masterpiece that some think it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mood of Menace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere down the line films have become about sensation rather than mood and, in the case of horror, atmosphere. It is most obvious with action movies as the genre was always essentially about sensation, but horror has largely migrated to that camp as well. Horror started with films like 'Nosferatu' and James Whale's 'Frankenstein' and it was almost all about mood and atmosphere. Naturally a lot of it was due to lack of elaborate special effects, but it nonetheless resulted in many classic horror films.By time time he made 'The Shining' Stanley Kubrick wasn't a director that had to worry about budget constraints and he used the relatively high-for-its-time budget to include some great shock effects, but mainly focus on the atmosphere and on the anticipation of shock rather than on the shock itself. Then when the shock arrives it still looks the same, but feels more genuine. Kubrick maximizes his opportunities to create the mood of menace and terror by pretty much doing it in every scene. Well almost every scene, as there are obligatory scenes that set up the story, but the opening sequence alone lets the viewer know very well that something is up. And it only gets better from there as Kubrick manages to draw such a thin line between reality and nightmare that H.P. Lovecraft would be proud. It is also interesting to see how Kubrick builds this tension and it is almost solely due to placing his camera in all the right places and a very eerie score. Seemingly simplistic when compared to many of today's horror films, but simplicity can be very effective. And I suppose simplicity isn't wholly the right word, 'The Shining' is a complex film with many things going on, so instead of simplicity, it could be said that it simply gets right to the point of what it is trying to say. Even with the gradual build up, not a scene is wasted.However, the film does vary from the source material considerably. I hardly consider that a strike against the film and it should be seen as simply two artists (King with his book and Kubrick with his film) working on nearly identical painting, but inevitably each has his own story to tell with that painting. --- 9/10Rated R for horror images and violence. Ages 13+</fullReview>

But it's one of those films you can watch over and over again.The Shining is truly a horror masterpiece and it is one of my favourite films ever.With signature roles from Jack Nicholson and other well known actors. Nicholson gave is most known role of all time, portraying a murderer fantastically.With brilliant music adding to the chilling atmosphere, and brilliant shots with added suspense and climax's to die for!If you're a fan of horror films then this film is a must see, but it's must see for anybody.

In my opinion better than the movies he is making now, nearly 30 years after The Shining.Jack takes a job as a caretaker on a big hotel over the winter. Mostly it is because he wants to have peace and quiet when he is writing his new book. With him he have his wife and his son. Perfect start for a perfect horror movie. What can be better than a big, empty, creepy hotel to make horrific scenes? I am usually no fan of horror movies, but this film was something different. That's my opinion. //Lundizco</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is the best horror movie of all time. Yes, Shelley Duvall's acting sucks for the most part, but if you can get past that you'll find a great movie. Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances as a slightly insane man who goes very insane. But the real star of this movie is Kubrick. He brilliantly paces and stylizes the film to create one of the most haunting movies you'll see. He did change some things from the book, but they are done for the betterment of the movie. I beg you book purists (I am one of them) to give this movie a chance and just roll with the changes made, because I strongly believe they were the right changes to have made for the film. The made for TV "The Shining" may follow the book better (which I like the TV version as well), but it's not as good of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack IS the film. Let me start by saying that i am no fan of Steven King, but the fact that Nicholson is ion this one, makes it more than worth seeing. For all you King fans who whine about it being different than the book, DUH! That's what Hollywood does. But it only helps. The problem with this film is that the mother (Shelly Duvall) and the kid (Danny Lloyd) are so damned annoying by their bad acting and that women's bug-eyed histrionic whining of hers that I was rooting for Jack Torrance to get them with the damn ax.I almost wish one could take Rebecca DeMornay and Courtland Mead from the miniseries and put them in THIS one. There is a particularly beautifully done scene that literally had me on the edge of my seat in the maze of hedges at the Overlook Hotel. Just the fact that Kubrick found a way to go from a shot of the miniature of the hedges to the actual hedges was just mind blowing for me. And the changes from the book (pay attention Steven King Fans) were GREAT! This made it a surprise even for those who had read the book. I won't give away the surprised for those who have not yet seen the film.Anyway, there are some genuinely frightening scenes in this horror epic and it still beats the hell out of the crop of slice and dice films calling themselves horror today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie sometime ago, It was very difficult to sleep at night. The horrific terror of this film made getting to sleep at night such a chore, (not to mention it scared the hell out of me). Although the acting was done great by the entire cast, Jack Nicholson was in my opinion the lone star of this film. Although he puts on a good horror face you can clearly see that he can be quite the comedian. Some of his expressions are outrageously funny and makes his performance much better with a few laughs thrown in. He makes his character so believable and it is very scary to watch some of the things that his character does. You can tell as Jack gets crazier although it's scary, the more comical he seems to become. Many of Jack Nicholson's unique talents are shown in this specularly splendid performance. He is an unbelievably good actor because you can tell by this movie that he can both take a movie role seriously, and at the same time have fun with it. This movie is absolutely marvellous thanks to the outstanding plot and breathtaking sequences of terror that any horror fan will love to watch.</fullReview>

This is a good horror movie and a scary one too, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it a masterpiece, cause then you're talking about horror masterpieces like Psycho. I liked this movie, it was frightening, and I was dying to get to know what happens in the end, but I wont give this film more than an eight. It doesn't deserve more. But the acting was awesome. The one and only Jack Nicholson is once again really good and believable but personally I thought Shelley Duvall was even better. The way she handled the "Heeeeeere's Johnny!" scene was fantastic. She was truly believable there.The fact that this film is number 54 on IMDb's top 250 is just wrong. There are lots of other movies that deserve to be from 1-50 on the list, for instance Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, Reservoir Dogs (my favorite movie), La Vita é Bella, The Big Sleep, The Green Mile and Gone With The Wind. There is no way The Shining is better than The Green Mile or Forrest Gump.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Jack Nicholson is at his best when he plays people who are caught up in extraordinary situations or circumstances ; two of his best I still think are : The Joker in the first Batman movie with Micheal Keaton , where he is played the homicidal manic and arch foe of the Batman and Jack Torrance in the Shining , he excels as an actor when he portraying crazy people or slightly not so normal people and he was perfect in The 3 Witches of Eastwick , as many have said , Jack is King . I believe Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest top five actors of our time , next To Marlon Brando , Robert Duvall , Al Pacino and the queen herself Audrey Hepburn . Thankyou Jack Nicholson for one of the greatest horror movies of our time ; next to Jaws , the original Halloween movie and the first Saw movie .

		<fullReview>It took me a long time to see this film. I have never enjoyed horror. Yes, I would watch the occasional vampire or werewolf film, but I walked out of Blacula after 10 minutes when he went down the alley eating an arm.Recently, I have been exploring Italian, French and Spanish horror, as well as some old classics. I have a lot to catch up on as I never watched those Halloween flicks, or Friday the 13th films, or appreciated zombie films. I am exploring torture porn and zombies and can now watch a mutant eat flesh as I did the other day in Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain; although it looked more like a breast implant than flesh.I rambled on just so you know why I have not seen this classic until now. I am sorry I waited, as it was just about the best horror film I have seen to date. No, there is little gore and no WB actors; it is classic horror. Jack Nicholson gave the best horror performance I have seen from him since Wolf. Watching his transformation was captivating. There was pure terror in this film; especially from Shelley Duvall, who's voice got on my nerves. Scatman Crothers was really good, and Lia Beldam was amazing in her only film role. Well, she was amazing for a minute or two.This is real horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie I decided its my favorite horror movie ever. Stanley Kubrick did directing gold with this movie. Every second of it was perfect. But the acting is what makes this movie great. If they would have chosen anyone but Jack Nicholson this movie would not have made it. Just seeing his face as he descends into madness scared me more than any other horror movie I've seen. It also helped greatly that the person that played Wendy actually looked scared to death. The special effects may not be that thrilling for today's standards, but man they scared me more than today's overrated special effects. The plot actually isn't that hard to understand. A man takes his family to a remote hotel to work as a caretaker in the winter while everyone else is gone. But when he gets there the isolation slowly sends him spiraling into the depth of madness. And his wife and pshyic child have to fend for themselves. The scariest thing in this movie is the complete feeling of isolation. How they have nowhere to run and the only means of escape is a big snow cat thing.(not sure what it's called) If you like horror and want to see a movie look no further than the shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's cold, frightening masterpiece of sustained psychological terrorisation. Pure art of terror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining (1980)Top 3 - 1980 Top 15 - 1980s Top 100 - All TimeRated R for sustained psychological terrorisation, strong horror, violence and some languageStanley Kubrick, who undeniably was established as one of the most unorthodox but unquestionably successful filmmakers of his time; his film content and style were always unconventional; his mastery absolute.The Shining is Kubrick's protégé of horror, a classic masterpiece of fright with the stunningly elaborate, yet so simple Jack Nicholson as the man who must look after an isolated hotel over the winter; but the hotel is haunted by memories, feelings... astonishing frights and a child who senses the supernatural.Stephen King's novel could have not been given a better screen adaptation to his chilling novel. Kubrick's film maintains a fierce grip on the viewer for 140 minutes that feel like 140 minutes of relentless terror. The simplest of images still hold the viewer in absolute agony; hiding behind the pillow; the sounds, the sets, Kubrick's faultless direction never let the viewer rest or take a breath comfortably; the film does not show relentless images of horror, but it is the way it is made.Kubrick knew how to frighten an audience and he did effortlessly in 'The Shining', a masterpiece of cinema and a triumph in the art of terror.This film toys with the mind; it is a relentless, unforgiving force of terror. It deserves praise because this may be the best horror film ever made.And... You cannot write a review about The Shining without mentioning the thrilling Jack Nicholson. Which somehow seemed to be the perfect choice for the role of Jack Torrance; and Jack is superb as the slowly deranged man in isolation.You can sense supernatural, unnatural situations occurring throughout the film, but the last 5 minutes are dizzying, perplexing and ambiguous, change the entire course of the film. Who? What? Why?Kubrick creates a psychological utopia and this is what makes 'The Shining' endlessly disturbing. Who should we trust? Who really is Jack? This is a majestic piece of terror, made by a vivid and eccentric director, who never quite seems to give you an answer to your question...10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A momentary loss of muscular coordination?The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can the pairing of Jack Nicholson and Stanley Kubrick, right after a decade of their best work in the movie industry, fail? With The Shining, we get one of the best thrillers to ever grace the silver screen. There is no need for special effects or gross-out gore like the so- called horror films currently being churned out. Instead we get an amazing lead performance from Nicholson, showing a descent into the hell of insanity, and the visual genius that was Kubrick behind the camera.The best literary adaptations are those that take the source material and make something unique out of it. Film is a totally separate medium and most novels can't be transferred word for word; books just aren't meant to be especially cinematic. With The Shining, we are given something that is no longer Stephen King's story. Sure the crux of the tale remains intact, but a singular mind like Kubrick allows himself to take the basics and craft them into a piece of art that lends itself to the medium being used to express it. Thus, rather than bore us with people talking to explain what is described to us in a book?like The Da Vinci Code amongst others?we are able to join this family for their winter taking care of the Overlook Hotel. The visuals speak for themselves and it is the inner turmoil and setting in of cabin fever that really takes over the story to become a force in and of itself.There are so many moments and frames of imagery that will stick in your mind for the rest of your life. Between the twin sisters and the sharp cuts to them butchered on the floor, to the blood spilling out from an elevator, to the old woman in room 237, they bring chills just reminiscing. Not to mention the crazy, what the hell just happened moments, like that of the bear and butler alone in their room, whatever evil residing inside the hotel has a keen ability to unsettle and terrorize those that threaten its motives and enjoyment. There could also be no one better to shoot the film then Kubrick and his knack for cinematography and composition. With his visual style, I still can't believe he shot many of his movies in fullscreen format. Having the ability to shoot widescreen seems a natural fit, but something about the 1:1.33 ratio spoke to him. Along with the gorgeous angles and points of view, he orchestrates an amazing score and sound effects track. Being low to the ground as we follow young Danny Torrance on his big wheel not only puts us into the action, but the loud sounds of the wheels turning on the hardwood floor and being momentarily muffled by the area rugs along the way add a sense of foreboding and anxiousness that remains prevalent throughout.Besides the technical craft that went in to the film, we have some stellar acting performances. What can be said about Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance? He always holds that touch of temper hiding behind his too gracious smile at the beginning, and once we hear his wife's tale about why he stopped drinking, you start to realize what he may be capable of. When the voices and visions projected onto him by the hotel finally seep into his head, the real fun begins. His facial expressions, tone of voice, and overall demeanor bring laughs to the audience, but they are just as much for comic reasons as they are for the viewers' unease, smirking out of fear for what this dangerous man might do. The role could have overshadowed everything else, but the success in this film lies in the fact that all fronts work cohesively. Even the abysmal Shelley Duvall doesn't seem too bad here. Her faces of fear are almost too real and her amateurish acting quality lends itself well to the na?ve wife dutifully staying by the side of her husband. We are also treated by two wonderful turns from veteran Scatman Crothers and newbie Danny Lloyd. These two experience the titular "shining" and are able to see what force lies inside the hotel. Almost used as a defensive mechanism to try and exorcise the evil, these two show the good and the bad of their gift. Lloyd is great as the young son experiencing the horrors and visions of past murder; you almost fear for his mental wellbeing. His parents must be credited for allowing their son to partake in such grueling and psychologically detrimental moments. Whether he changes his voice to become Tony or he convulses from what he sees in his head, I have to believe Kubrick shot his scenes in a way to not let him know the full extent of what was happening in the script. Either way, Lloyd has done only one more bit of acting in his life and seems to have called it quits. He still definitely made a lasting impression on the craft.As a final note to the perfection of this movie, it is fun to see how many moments have been used later on in new films. If you are going to steal, definitely steal from the best. A couple I noticed occur during the credit sequence and shortly thereafter. While the titles are fading in we are treated with the Torrance's car riding the mountainous roads to their eventual destination. Although Michael Haneke has put screaming music over his start in Funny Games, the resemblance is uncanny. The other moment that stuck out like a sore thumb was the psychiatric sequence with little Danny. Even with the tone of the scene and the questioning going on about his imaginary friend, it is not until Danny utters in a babyish voice that he doesn't want to talk about it anymore do I recall the similar moment in Donnie Darko pertaining to the rabbit Frank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shining shines...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could be seen as a clacsical damned ghost-house film at the first moments of it.But the minutes goes you'll see it differs from the mentioned films by the method of "Shining".Jack Torrance's son is Danny,as he has two personalities,senses whatever lived in the past.He thinks that his family's faith will be same as the Grady's family who were employee in Overlook Hotel.Jack Torrance wants to advance writer abilities in times from rest times of maintenance.But the time goes,he'll just interested writing.This sentence found by his wife Wendy summarizes the process of Jack's going mad:"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy".Although he got warning the managers of hotel,he'll go forward in the way that he knows right.As a Stanley Kubrick film,it isn't necessary to say too many words.From the beginning to the end,it makes people curious.The character that is realized by Danny that is Tony, says the things those aren't said by Danny.In the role of Wendy,Shelley Duval completes Jack and Danny.When Jack Nicholson is a future-promising writer,he transforms into a wild murder.As a imaginary character Delbert Grady dominates Jack's feelings is fascinating. The "Redrum" code that was said by Danny's second character Tony along the film,signs the danger.Finally,"The Shining" shines as a Kubrick classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, typical Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a great film that completely grips you from start to finish. There's a slow build up that Nicholson played perfectly. Kubrick's direction was nothing short of fantastic. I've heard so many debates about this version not being true to the book or whatever. I personally never read the book, but I'm sure it's really good, very scary and very interesting. King is a great author and I'm sure on paper the story is very well told. Although, a film and a book are 2 completely different mediums. There are some stories that won't translate well from books to movies if you go line by line. A good filmmaker, like Kubrick, knows what to keep in and what to alter for the screen. A book can be easily more descriptive and more explanatory than a film. A good author can justify almost anything in a book because it can be very well written. Kubrick did exactly what he needed to do in order to make the this story suitable for the screen. He changed what needed to be changed and added his own frightening touch to it. And he completely blew me away for a director who never has done horror. Stanley was the best, he had a way of taking any story and telling it beautifully visually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining has every thing that a good horror film has and not many horrors do that. Jack Nicholson delivers great acting and actually looks like he is going mad, so good! My favourite scene like probably everyone else's is the "Here's Johnny!" bit it is probably one of the most famous lines and scenes in cinema history.Although the film trails off a bit from the Stephen King Book it still is really good and I recommend it to everyone that hasn't seen it and is reading this comment. Sherly Duvall was good but still she got a razzie award for worst actress ?????? Plus Stanley Kurbick was nominated for the best director but then got another nomination for worst director!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a great movie is ranked by how many times you can watch it over the years and still be entertained by it. you can always find something new in it. as a horror movie buff for decades, i can still watch this movie with great enjoyment. it has an air to it that captivates you right from the beginning. the use of light has a great effect in the entire film along with the echoing emptiness of the hotel, as it would be with everyone gone for the winter, emphasizing isolation, and a snow storm compiles it even further. i do not believe this caption i mention here is a spoiler, rather something that caught my eye after seeing this film over fifty times! : Wendy is pacing about what to do, she is smoking a cigarette. she hears Danny in the bedroom and goes to him. she walks to the door with the cigarette in her right hand, goes through the door and sits on the bed with Danny... where did the cigarette go? ?? strange because Wendy takes such care of the place, i found it hard to believe she just dropped it on the floor so casually. good giggle for me -has anyone else noticed this? to make Shelley Duvall do one scene 127 times, i found it amazing that this little ooops slipped through to the final draft. no spoilers for me in this film. four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the 1980 movies and when I saw its poster I immediately remembered and related the Jack Nicholson's photo that matched the poster of this movie. This was the poster that was on a book ? Top 1000 movies to see before you die. I read the reviews of this movie ? good and bad both; especially those who hated the movie were those who had read the book. I was fortunate that I saw the moving without reading the book. This helps in enjoying it more.So this was my opportunity to see the movie. The prior knowledge that this movie is a horror movie is not a good thing to know, because one pre-conditions one mind to prepare for seeing something horror ? and that is the drawback of our minds.The story is based on Stephen King's novel ? The Shining. It is about a hotel in US that remains closed during winter snowing for six months. The author Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson), wants to go to an isolated place to write a new book and remove the writer's block. He is selected as a care-taker for 6 months of this hotel, and plans to go with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd). In the beginning they are very happy and excited to be in this enormous place with nobody around. But as time passes Jack starts becoming insane due to these isolation, and the ghosts of the hotel inspire him to kill his son.The movie mostly revolves around these three characters, but there are two more big characters in the movies ? the sound track and camera work. The knowledge of this being a horror movie ? makes us view every scene with an expectation of something will happen, and that is what creates a feeling of tension. A simple shot of child driving his small tricycle in the empty corridors of the hotel is chilling to say the least. The child stopping and looking at the half open door ? is enormously terrifying than seeing a crude make-up ghost in drab movies like Evil Dead etc.The director ? Stanley Kubrick has not used night scenes, dark images, shocking editing, sudden entry, loud bangs to awake us to realize it is a horror movie. But he uses subtle consistent musical score that builds up on your nerves. The opening long shots of the journey to the mountain are breath-taking.Jack Nicholson is as his usual self. He has his own style and whims. Anyways as always he has acted well. Shelley Duvall brings life to her role as a typical housewife ? who is modest, next door looks, and humane to protect her husband and son; and Danny Lloyd is the best (he actually won the best supporting actor's award) in his role and portrayed the child's character brilliantly.A trivia I read was that Danny Lloyd did not know that he is working in a horror movie ? while shooting was on, and even after 2 years on ? he did not know it. He just acted in one more movie before retiring to routine life.I consider this movie very similar to Omen in creating fear ? without using the commercial gimmick of horror movies. Now I can venture to read the book. People say that the book is better than the movie. So I can enjoy it more! (Stars 7.5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Dissent Into Madness. But Some Flaws Getting There.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining, tells the story of a caretaker who is assigned to look after a hotel with a sinister past. His wife and young son are with him. Early on, we learn that the son is clairvoyant. He can see the past and future, along with the sinister surroundings that they bring.An employee cook at the hotel is also clairvoyant and he tells the son about the power that he has. The Overlook Hotel is a very evil place, where a former caretaker murdered his two daughters years ago. Jack Torrance, played superbly by Jack Nicholson seems almost eager to descend into madness as the new caretaker! With the hotel as his responsibility and everyone else gone except his family, the film gives new meaning to the phrase, "Cabin Fever!." There are some very good suspenseful moments in The Shining. Nicholson is excellent as always. His wife Wendy, played by Shelley Duvall, and son Danny, played by Danny Lloyd, also deliver fine performances. But there are some small issues with the film.One of the problems is that Nicholson seems to be close to crazy before even getting the caretaker job! There is not enough build-up for his character to develop into something crazy brought on by the hotel's forbidding feeling of isolation. His "Madness" is already there and just gets worse as the film progresses.The film is also VERY predictable because you know what's going to happen with Nicholson's character. You can see his "Madness" coming a mile away. However, Jack acts the part so well that you almost can forgive the film's predictability flaws.One of the film's best scenes is with Scatman Crothers talking to Danny Lloyd about his clairvoyant (i.e "Shining") ability. While Duvall is very good at acting or reacting to Nicholson's madness, the unfortunate situation is that there isn't much else for her to do but shriek, run, or protect her son from Nicholson.However, The Shining is still a very good film because of Nicholson. Without Jack, and his brilliant acting skills, this would not be a good movie. Additionally, middle scenes drag because the viewer is waiting to get back to Nicholson on screen and when he is on screen, you can't take your eyes off of him.If the lesser characters had a better script to act on, rather than react to, Nicholson's behavior, the film would have been a classic. The problem is that The Shining's lesser characters often exist in superficial roles. However, The Shining delivers some fine moments of dramatic tension and suspense. It's not a classic, but is still well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining Shines with Terror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a person who usually does not get frightened by movies easily. However, when seeing this, as an adult, I have to say this was the first movie that really frightened me since seeing the original Alien when i was a child! It sent shivers down my spine, and makes my heart rate pound like an athlete in a marathon. This film does not scare in the typical horror fashion of blood and gore and unrealistically CGI effects like most modern-day films.Yes, there is bloody violence, but instead of being about aliens running around in spaceships or a lethal epidemic spreading through the world, the film is psychologically disturbing on the standpoint that the mere thought of a devoting, subtle husband (played by the ultimate Jack Nichlson) who turns into a disillusioned crazed man that seeks to savagely murder his wife (Shelley Duvall) and his telepathic son (Danny Lloyd) is much more intense and realistic. In other words, the film was not designed to only give nightmares for children, but also to adults. Based off of Stephen King's bestselling novel, the film was excellent. It captured and brought to life the terror and horror of insanity and isolation.Stanley Kubrick brilliantly brought this film to life with both captivating up close shots and distant camera angles. The variety and creativity of the use of camera angles makes the film feel real. In other words, the viewer would feel inside the film, rather than a member of the audience. From the aerial shot of the car traveling in the beginning to the suspenseful, climatic chase in the maze, they were all gripping and thrilling. It was also supported by the dreamy setting of the massive, but creepy hotel, and the pumping classical music, along with the "wierd 80's style of music" (that gives me premonitions to Blade Runner), it all added to the suspense and thrills in the film.This movie also holds one of Jack Nicholson's finest performances. He delivers not only one of the most memorable scenes in movie history, but also one of the best lines ever. He shouts, "Heeeere's Johnny!" as he hacks his way through the bathroom door with an ax to maim his wife. this is one of many captivating scenes. He was both coldly humorous and very chilling as Jack Torrence. Every single scene of him was simply fantastic! Shelley Duvall was also very good in role as the pampered, delirious wife; as was Scatsman Crother as the cook who is a bit limited in the film, but is great nonetheless. The other great performance was by Danny Lloyd. He also gave a very compelling performance as the sensitive son who sees haunting images and croaks the word "redrum", and writes it in lipstick near the finale, only to spell the word "murder" backwards. This is another scene that even thinking about it now gives shivers down my spine. I was never a fan of Kubrick, nor of the horror genre, but The Shining, by far is the father of all horror films. Any horror film ever made needs to be measured in comparison to The Shining, which shines wither absolute terror! **** out of ****</fullReview>

Already during the opening scene, beautifully filmed and sporting a very creeping sinister background music, you get the sneaking feeling that something is not right. And it is not !A family of three is going to spend a serious amount of time at an isolated mountain resort hotel, as the husband of the family (Nicholson) works as a caretaker.It soon becomes clear that something is not right at the hotel, and the family soon notice some very chilling changes in their environment.That's all I'll reveal !I highly recommend you see this movie ! If you don't, you will miss out on your basic horror- movie-education ! Don't show it to your kids; they'll never fall asleep again, and probably you will have some trouble too...Honestly, this movie scared the living daylights out of me, so if you haven't seen this one yet, you know what to do tonight !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of horror movies. The Shining was a combination of Horror and Suspense. You always want to try and guess what Jack Torrance's next move will be... And you get surprised. I don't know if it's the music, or the craziness of Jack Torrance, or Wendy getting all panicked and teary eyed, but this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat! You can easily follow Jack Torrance's path to insanity through this movie. Through every line of dialogue, step, or touch. It is the creepiness of this movie that drives viewers crazy. Every line in The Shining was memorable. There are a lot of creative twists in this movie.The music in The Shining added yet another creepy effect. It is the music here that really helps the creepiness factor of The Shining.The acting was great! Jack Nicholson was PERFECT for his insane role of Jack Torrance. When I really think about it, he is the only one that could pull it off. Shelly Duvall pulled of her role as a hysterical wife too well, but she could really get annoying in some parts.Overall, I'd give The Shining a 9/10 for great plot, acting, music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally forget this movie is supposedly based on Stephen King's novel: Stanley Kubrick makes The Shining his own, and all the better for it. This is certainly Kubrick at his best, mixing plenty of frightening moments with a chilling, subdued and isolated atmosphere, all rolled into one.Jack Nicholson is superb as Jack Torrance, a seemingly ordinary family man at first, but gradually turning into an increasingly unhinged character bringing sheer terror and shock to the viewer.... Shelley Duvall plays the terrorised wife very convincingly too - Wendy is so full of fear, we can actually feel her emotions.The Shining combines alert acting with a sense of loneliness and fear. Stranded in an isolated place with no-one to turn to sounds very frightening to me! Kubrick mixes this and other aspects well, enough to make The Shining one of the best horror movies of the 20th century. The horrible (but simple) reality of Jack's madness graphically displayed with that now infamous "Here's Johnny!" scene certainly proves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is my favorite horror movie. I can relate to the theme of family dysfunction--the alcoholic, abusive father; the frightened, overwhelmed mother; and the withdrawn, almost autistic child--because it mirrors my own childhood experience, just as the family's isolation as caretakers for an abandoned hotel recall certain events when I was growing up. I don't want to go into too much autobiographical detail here so I'll focus on the film. "The Shining" has all the motifs common to Kubrick's films starting with "2001: A Space Odyssey": a cold, impersonal narrative tone; harsh, bright lighting; and brilliant musical choices, especially Bela Bartok's "Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta." The photography is brilliant, especially the use of the then-new Steadicam, which Kubrick was to use to good advantage seven years later in "Full Metal Jacket." As in all of Kubrick's films, the theme is survival in a barren, absurd cosmos. Danny Lloyd is simply the best child actor I've ever seen, and Shelly Duval's very plainness makes her all the more believable as an average housewife and mother. It's ironic that Stephen King disliked the film because he thought Jack Nicholson hammed it up too much as Jack Torrance: how do you underplay a homicidal maniac? This movie is so good it's frightening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually a masterpiece, as a horror not so scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I have heard of The Shining was when I was five or six years old. I remember seeing the famous scene when Jack was chasing his wife with the axe. At the time I was very impressed by it and remember being haunted by it a little. But it took me almost 25 years to actually watch the full movie as an adult. Before I watched it I was expecting a lot. Now after having seen it (multiple times) I have to say I am a bit disappointed.Visually it is stunning and impressive, the setting and the music was haunting. But the most important thing for a psychological thriller, is the fact that the story was lacking. I understand that Kubrick is trying to be abstract and maybe he wanted to give the viewers some freedom to use their own imagination to fill in some blanks and so making it creepier. But for me the story wasn't that abstract. They start a plot line about Danny and for some reason they don't use his talent to their advantage. Also I didn't experience a real change in Jack's Character. He is acting crazy right from the get go. I understand that in the book the character is an ex-alcoholic who is struggling which adds a whole other dimension. In the movie you don't see the struggle and therefore is it more difficult to understand why Jack is acting the way he does. Personally the movie would be much creepier if Jack was the only character who could see the visions and ghosts. Because the boy with his psychic abilities doesn't work well for the story at all. As a plot line it intrigued me but judging the whole story it didn't really add and feels like a wasted opportunity. Maybe I am spoiled having watched a lot horror films, but I must say that The Shining isn't shocking. Compared to The Exorcist which still is a very unsettling film, it doesn't even come close. I like most of Kubrick's work. 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket. But The Shining did not have the same impact as those movies did to me.As a film fan I think you have to see this movie for the visuals, music and style. As a horror fan I can tell you this is not the scariest movie ever made. Sure there are some surprises, but not enough to give you chills all the way. I have to agree with some reviewers that this movie is very overrated!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just start off by saying I have NEVER seen another horror film that even comes close to the intensity and sheer psychological terror that Stanley Kubrick gave us back in 1980. Everything about this film is frightening... The pacing is dead on perfect. The cinematography within the hotel is tight, weaving, claustrophobic, and sets the mood perfectly (especially the scenes involving Danny on his bike). And the performance of Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance will go down in the annuls of history as one of the most terrifying screen performances ever witnessed. It is hard to believe that the man that you are seeing on the screen is not insane. I firmly believe this is the best horror film you can watch today, and it has never, and might never, be bettered. Stanley Kubrick at his terrifying best. Watch it... but be prepared to sleep with the lights on for a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by: Stanley Kubrick. Stars: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall and Scatman Crothers. In order for a movie to be a classic, I feel that at first viewing it has to reach you and you have to understand it. Many classics often have second viewings, but don't need them. This needs a second viewing. It is a confusing and overly long psychological thriller about a man's descent into insanity when stuck in a cabin with his wife and kid. This is a horror film, though I find it more disturbing than scary. It's a pretty good movie, but it just didn't reach out to me as it did for others.My rating: ***/****. 141 mins. rated R for full frontal nudity, violence and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I vividly remember that back in 1980, THE SHINING was severely panned by both critics and fans of the book alike. My mother read the book way before the film was released and when she saw the movie she was quite pleased. I never read the book but I think THE SHINING was a very good movie. Released at a time when the norm for "hip" horror was the "slasher" genre established by HALLOWEEN and more notoriously Friday THE 13th. THE SHINING, with its moody, creepy atmosphere, eerie soundtrack and seldom body count set itself greatly apart from other "slasher" flicks of the time. While I do like Friday THE 13th, I'll be the first to admit that it looks extremely dated and that it is the basis for SCARY MOVIE and its sequels. Even many Fangoria readers trashed THE SHINING for not being gory enough, but the charm of this movie is the sheer creepiness and the atmosphere it creates. In this respect, THE SHINING is closer to THE CHANGELING (another haunted house movie that has aged extremely well) than to the slasher flicks that were its peers. Jack Nicholson's performance is outstanding and although he did look like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown long before strange things started happening at the hotel I think his casting was correct. Same goes to Shelly Duvall who does great as Jack's wife Wendy. I have seen THE SHINING many times and all I can say is that the movie has stood the test of time and looks as vibrant and as offbeat today as it did 26 years ago. Unfortunately, a lot of horror movies of that era look ridiculously outdated. This means Mr.Kubrik was right all along!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not disregard this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching The Shining I was one of the many who discarded it amongst the other famous yet utterly terrible titles of the horror genre (see Hellraiser, Wolf Creek, The Exorcist etc.). How wrong I was to do this. Anyone who claims The Shining is over-rated must be delusional. A visual masterpiece that is certainly one of Kubrick's best.People have faulted the film on its loyalty to the book, but as with many book to film adaptations, The Shining contains all the crucial narrative elements, neglecting only minor details that would be impractical to film. People who do fault the film because of this are the same kind that felt The Lord OF The Rings was destroyed because of the leaving out of Tom Bombadill.Jack Nicholson's performance is Oscar worthy (although in this day and age that doesn't mean too much) is as good as or better than his performance in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Danny Lloyd is one of the best child actors I have ever seen. The one major downfall of the film (which detracts from the deserved 10 stars) is Shelley Duvall who has a tendency to overact.To anyone who hasn't seen The Shining and like me disregarded it, please reconsider; it is probably the best horror film ever made.</fullReview>

There are plot elements that could have been included that would have made this a much better movie. One of the things is "the shining" itself, the supernatural abilities of the young boy. The character of Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) is used up with virtually no effect on the plot. I don't know why King allowed that to happen, because it weakens so badly the chance of the victims to escape. The topiary could have been used to a better advantage as well. The way things are, it is too one sided. That being said, I think the Nicholson role is awesome. This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It has enough shadows and manipulation of the supernatural to really be frightening. I loved when Jack was telling the man who hires him what a great opportunity this was for him to work. He's about as wolfy and sly as he can be. Of course, when he finally gets there, the hotel takes over and he begins to become that wolf. One of the most terrifying moments in all of film is when Shelly Duvall , the wife, picks up all the pages he has typed and they are just gibberish. Kubrick plays with us in grand style. I saw the movie a few years after my first viewing, and because the book was behind me, I enjoyed it a great deal more, even though I knew the events unfolding. Kubrick seldom disappoints and this is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling, but not as much as the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is really good and full of suspense. The Room 237-scene and the elevator scene and show that Stanley Kubrick can be a very good director. But especially the end of the movie differs completely from that end in the novel which does not make the film better. In the book Jack does not get mad completely and tells his son to run away of him. In the book Jack dies and Wendy and Danny go with Mr.Hallorann which is more convincing than Jack's freezing in the labyrinth. There are also some very thrilling parts in the book which are missing in the film, probably because of a too low budget. In the book there are hedges in the garden which can move and persecute Danny,Wendy and Jack. If you only see the film you do not know exactly why the film's title is "The Shining". The appearance of Tony and the fact that Hallorann comes back to the hotel although of the snow seem to be superfluous. All in all you can say that the film is really good and exciting, but the book is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching the shining and no work makes Jack a dull boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought i'd write this without reading the other posts because I didn't want to be influenced by them. The Shining is quite simply the best horror film ever made and will not, repeat will not, ever be bettered because mostly the makers of horror films work to a cheap trick agenda.Now, the fact that this is a Stephen King story is all the more remarkable because, let's be honest he ain't going to win any literary prizes and how on earth could the grand master, Mr K, spot the potential of this story from Stephen King's vast repertoire? Ultimately it doesn't matter because we, the viewers, are treated to the scariest movie ever, the most delightfully subversive in terms of misogyny, that almost gets away with it because of the movie's setting. It's a bit of a crazy place to be! And we'd all go crazy and misogynistic there. Wouldn't we? If there was an Oscar for locations then unquestionably the hotel would have won it, in fact it would have won a lifetime achievement award.The whole cast excels of course and I cannot find higher praise than "perfection".Only one other film meets its level of perfection for me and that is PT Anderson's Magnolia and it goes without saying that that is a very different movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best horror film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cant think of any other movie more intense then the shining. Except for maybe the exorcist. It starts with Jack Torrance and his wife and son. Wendy and Danny. They've agreed to look after the overlook hotel for the winter. First it seems like a beautiful hotel. With a hedge maze and everything. But the isolation soon becomes to much for Jack. All along Danny possesses this strange gift called "The Shining" which lets people see things that have happened a long time ago...or things that haven't happened yet. So all along Danny (or Tony) knew what was going to happen in that hotel. Now back to Jack. A lot of times through the movie we see him writing his "novel" which isn't a novel at all. Just a bunch of papers that say "all work and no play makes jack a dull boy" over and over and over. This is the scene that proves he has lost his mind...literally. Now Jack as probably gone completely berserk. Chasing his wife and son around with an axe. Until.....will I'm not gonna spoil THAT much.The shining is what i would call an excellent movie. Its scary but relies more on the intensity of the film then blood and guts and gore. The whole film just feels creepy and scary. The scariest part, for me. Was when Jack goes in to room 237. Which is forbidden. This lady comes out of the tub. First she's young and pretty decent looking. Then she morphs into this disgusting old hag. Thats probably the most disturbing thing i've ever seen in a horror movie.Although i still don't understand a lot of the movie. What the *beep* was up with the guy in the bear costume, it only for a second but its like "ok...and the point of that was??". Also the whole ending scene, I'm not going to tell you but trust me. I have no clue what it has to do with the movie.There is so many things to say about this movie. Its probably my favorite horror movie of all time. Jack was agreeably the most excellent actor for his part. No doubt about it. Danny Lloyd probably did the best acting for a kid that young. And for the fact that he never knew he was making a horror movie. Just Brilliant. This shining is must have for all horror fans. If you like movies with intensity and meaning. Then you'll the shining. So buy it...you wont regret it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SHINING. Love it or hate it, it's still a classic. And the reason it's a classic is because it's good. Everything just clicks. It's in the use of space and silence as malevolent forces. It's in the peerless photography and the statical shots. It's in the performances, with Jack Nicholson typecasting himself forever as a broadly comic villain who's still terrifying even when he's hamming it up like Robert Newton possessed. It's in the unresolvable questions, which means this film is different - quite literally - to everyone who sees it. Are there time warps? Are the ghosts 'real'? Is it all in Jack's head? What the hell is going on with the flood of gore that the elevator disgorges? The explanations are there, certainly, but it's up to you to find them. Kubrick never pandered to the beer and popcorn crowd, but assumed a level of intelligence and a capacity for abstract thought in the viewer that sadly some people are incapable of, which explains the non-plussed reactions and negative reviews THE SHINING will continue to get for as long as it's in print. To love this film, you have to work at it. The rewards, rest assured, are there."Wendy, I'm home."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a REAL movie. I really enjoyed watching the plot thicken and being scared to death. I was reading about the movie right here on IMDb and was getting scared just by looking at the goofs!!! The Shining was probably the only horror film to actually scare me. The acting is brilliant (I think Jack Nicholson is much better in thrillers than in comedy/romance) with everybody putting on lifelike performances which explains why I was so afraid. Scatman Crothers is always brilliant and little Danny Lloyd plays the "possesed" son of madman pretty well...From the moment Mr. Torrance says "I've been here before" (Or something like that) it got interesting...The movie is always making you think, all the unexplained ghosts are very mind bending and Kubrick illustrates how he wants you to ponder over the existence of the apparitions...Well I throughly enjoyed The Shining and was also throughly spooked.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mother of all horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick was probably the most most consistently brilliant director in film history. Despite having made films in a variety of genres, there has rarely been one made that is short of classic status, and his foray into horror is quite possibly the best of it's kind.In 'The Shining', we are basically told a small story about writer's block, in which a writer and his family look after a hotel during the winter. With no one staying there, they are completely isolated, and writer Jack, (Jack Nicholson), finds himself slowly going mad, eventually resulting in his attempted murder of his wife and child.Kubrick was always about phychology, and he expertly creates a deeply disturbing atmosphere which slowly builds. the camera-work helps to show the vast space the family are stuck in, and the haunting soundtrack compliments this extremely well, creating plenty of tension. The acting is also about as good as it gets from everyone, though it has to be said that Jack Nicholson steals the show as the lunatic star. Overall, this is my favourite horror flick, a film that manages to grip you to the very end, and it has to be said that even the most hardened movie goers will get some chills from this masterpiece.</fullReview>

From the outset you get the feeling that something is wrong, and as the movie progresses you get drawn deeper and deeper into a swirling whirlwind of madness and psychotic events.Even though the movie is from 1980, I still recommend it to anyone looking for a good thrill. Modern day horror movies rely a lot on massive bloody and gory scenes. While this movie contains this kind of scenes as well, the most scary parts are not the gory ones. The mental evolution that the Torrance family goes through is no less than psychotic.Go watch this movie, and you will get hooked forever... And ever... And ever...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson's Best Role; Triumph for Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson, as I'm sure probably everyone knows, is fabulous in everything. And this is his best role in my opinion: he epitomizes his character, he becomes his character and his performance can never be beat. Stanley Kubrick: how do you describe the mind of a genius? His sense of intuition; how he becomes one with his work: how he can adapt say, a novel into a single movie- delivering to us, the audience, exactly what we want to see and then some.I love exposition. All of my favorite movies have lots of exposition and The Shining has it in abundance. The opening scene with the credits is intensely gripping: it grabs you and you wont want to let go, even after the movie ends. The way all of the scenes are put together: many quite in harmony with each other and the soundtrack, the chemistry between the actors and the gradual, persistent buildup of the plot is just about as perfect as it gets.The best way to sum up this film is that it is a horror film with depth portraying some of the greatest, unexpected fears anyone could ever have. A must-have for great film connoisseurs.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurbick's Flawed but Still a Noteworthy Horror Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Torrance (Three Time Oscar-Winner:Jack Nicholson) has been hired to look after as a Caretaker in the isolated Overlook Hotel with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and his son (Danny Lloyd). But each of the family are experiencing something different. Jack is slowly spinning out of control and having a feeling that he was there before in a different time in the Overlook Hotel. Jack's son is seeing spirits trying to warm or scare him what did happen in the Overlook Hotel in the past and future. Jack's wife is worried about his husband's behavior and her son's fear of the Overlook Hotel.Directed by Stanley Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut, Full Metal Jacket) made a flawed but extremely well made horror film that is superbly shot by John Alcott (Barry Lyndon, The Beastmaster, Terror Train). Based on a Novel by Stephen King (Dreamcatcher, The Shawshank Redemption, The Stand). Although not as faithful as King's novel. King actually wrote a screenplay for the T.V. version directed by Mick Garris (Psycho 4:The Beginning, Riding the Bullet, Sleepwalkers).This DVD is actually an improvement over the original DVD with Picture Quality and Sound. DVD has an sharp Pan &amp; Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD does contain a new feature, an 35 minute commentary track by Stanley Kubrick's daughter-Vivian on the making of The Shining. Nicholson's performance is so good but there's no time to get involved in his plight. The film is highlighted by some eerie scenes but the film is quite long and slow at times. Kubrick cut several key scenes after the film's premiere. Remade for T.V. in 1997. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is definitely a Steven King story, definitely a Stanley Kubrick movie. Their marks are all over this 1980 thriller about claustrophobia inside a possessed hotel. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, an author who gets the job of winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies where he'd be alone with his family and could write his latest book. The hotel hires caretakers for the winter to avoid ware-and-tear since the mountain blizzards often cuts the hotel off from the rest of civilization. Early in the movie we are told that a previous caretaker had gone insane and killed his family, and ominous sign to be sure. The mood of the film is established even before that scene however, as in true Kubrickian form, the opening of the movie has a certain feel to it that tells the viewer that something will not be right about the coming movie. The strange sound track, the long helicopter shot of a winding Colorado road sets the mood, an uneasy one. As the movie goes along, slow, quiet scenes predominate. Kubrick trusts his story enough to go minutes without any dialog, and the only words spoken have very little to do with the story, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey. Jack's wife, Wendy, is played by Shelly Duvall who has the difficult job of acting surprised when her husband is taken over by the hotel. The more remarkable acting job was turned in by Danny Lloyd who plays Jack's son, Danny. Danny is the distant cousin of Cole in The Sixth Sense as Danny can see into paranormal worlds and has a creepy invisible friend "Tony." What make's Lloyd's acting even better is that he didn't know he was in a horror film, perhaps lending a certain understated value to his character. The sprawling hotel becomes a character in the movie, in more ways than one, and we become claustrophobic with the characters as the movie reaches its climax. The final third of the movie is where the action happens, where the thrills reside. Most fans of the King book find the movie slow and plodding as Kubrick builds up to the final parts of the film. From the point where Scatman Crothers returns to the hotel in one of the funniest rescue missions you'll see in films to the end, there are genuine thrills and chills. The film will be remembered most for Nicholson's slide into madness (a role custom made for the actor), but it should be remembered as a well crafted, big buildup/big reward thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World of Stanley Kubrick: The Shining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining (1980) was Stanley Kubrick's attempt to make a bona fide horror film. Despite the fact that he has never really directed one, he was infatuated with the project. He read the novel by Stephen King and set out to recreate the novel, his own way. What we get is a cold ans sterile film that resembles the original source material some what. We get a maniacal and crazed Jack Nicholson, a doormat Shelly Duvall and a minor actor/performer Scatman Crothers a shot a some big time acting. The actors were "motivated" by the director's work but it just didn't work out as one might felt it should have.Technically, the film was good (despite the many takes the film is filled with a multitude of errors and goofs). A film maker who doesn't understand the genre shouldn't try to implement their ideas when making such a film. The movie itself was a disappointment to die hard Stephen King fans but it gave Jack Nicholson an even greater level of success as an cult actor and made the line "Here's Johnny" even more popular than it has ever been. A lot of the dialog involving Jack Nicholson was improvised (the documentary shot by Vivian Kubrick shows him working himself up into character!) A nerve racking shoot filled with a lot of tension and nervousness.Overall I would have to say that the film was a brilliant failure. A flop as a horror film but brilliant on every other level. In order for a film like this to work properly you need either a top notch horror film maker or heavy involvement and input from the writer. If you want to see why Jack Nicholson fans rave over this movie then you need to see him in action. This is the film! I would have to recommend this film with caution for non-Kubrick fans and horror fanatics in general.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best directed film ever made. The style used by Stanley Kubrick is always fantastic but for this film I think he overwhelmed all expectations, he uses the camera with such eerie bluntness that the effects are astounding. The props are unbelievable and I just cannot comprehend how dedicated he must have been to take over 60 shoots for some of his scenes, and also how he could have been bothered to use the huge prop of reams and reams of paper that read "All work and no play make Jack a dull boy" in many different styles, this must have taken a lot of persistence to have carried on writing it.Jack Nicholson plays his part to perfection, as the winter caretaker of an isolated hotel in the Rocky Mountains, in which the mysterious ghosts and other supernatural inhabitants begin to take over his soul and turn him against his family, in which to the latter part of the film he tries to murder. His family is played brilliantly too by Shelley Duvall and 5 year old Danny Lloyd as his son who possesses a special ability of telepathy in which he can communicate over long distances through his mind, this is The Shining. The direction is well highlighted by these two actors as it seems that they abandon completely what would normally be an impulse to laugh, in exchange for believable, realistic seeming terror. It is fantastic.Scatman Crothers makes a dignified approach as a man facing the horrors of the overlook hotel, and a man who feels deeply for his Shining friend who is trapped amongst the horrible images of the overlook that only he can see, for whom he must save from the forces at work.Philip Stone is also brilliant as a previous caretaker in which the hotel has claimed, and he goes around persuading Jack to revolt against his family. Joe Turkel is Lloyd the barman and he pulls of one of the most eerie performances in the film as he uses calm and collected wordage to encourage Jack to sell his soul for the drink he craves, that will send him back to his old violent ways, and ensure that the hotel claims the most powerful and important soul of all, his son Danny, The Shiner.With a brilliant script loosely adapted from a Stephen king bestseller, this film uses the material to perfection, yet does not copy it outright. It uses the eerie surroundings of the ornate hotel to create the best atmosphere of any horror film ever and it is this atmosphere, that is backed up by the best horror film soundtrack of all time.Honestly if you have not seen it and you want to scream, and at the same time be overwhelmed by the originality of the blunt direction, then get this film watch it and I guarantee you WILL enjoy it, with its most memorable quotes and most fantastic acting quality I can definitely say this is the best directed film and best horror film ever made. Hail Stanley Kubrick, for this he shall always be remembered.</fullReview>

He's awesome in this and there are some good scares in this movie as well as some gross out gory scenes (like the blood pouring out of the elevator) that should please any horror movie fan. I also recommend the 1997 remake that starred Steven Weber and Rebecca Demornay as Jack and Wendy but I would recommend that to fans of the book.

A very quick plot summary is that a family is watching a hotel over the winter season and th dad gets cabin fever and does some stuff. That is all i am going to say about it because i do not want to ruin it for you. this is a modern day classic. Jack Nicholson is amazing as the father (Jack Torrance) As are the rest of the actors.

		<fullReview>There are so many films that I have reviewed for the last year and a half that are such classics that there isn't a lot more to add to the mix. Another of these is a film I caught as a midnight showing at a local movie theater, 'The Shining', directed by Stanley Kubrick and adapted from Stephen King's classic novel of the same name. 'The Shining' has become such a pop culture phenomenon, parodied by everyone from Saturday Night Live to The Simpsons, that it is easy to forget to look at what a fantastic film it really is.Set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, 'The Shining' tells the story of a small family who are hired to take care of a large hotel/resort during the off-season. This is an ideal situation for the father, Jack (Jack Nicholson) who plans to spend the time working on his novel, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) if not for a couple of key factors. Firstly, the hotel gets snowbound in the winter, so leaving isn't an easy option. Secondly, the family has its own problems; Jack is a recovering alcoholic who has been abusive in the past, Wendy is fragile and nervous to the point of near-collapse, and Danny is a borderline schizophrenic whose alter-ego Tony manifests himself as a barking voice coming from Danny's right index finger. Oh yes, and the hotel is haunted by the spirits of guests, servants and their families who have died there in the past. All of these factors make up a spooky story that, when coupled with Kubrick's exquisite direction and cinematography, makes for a pretty creepy little film. His use of light and color (always with the red), unconventional score (always with the jarring piano) and serious creepy imagery are as amazing as always. The flashes of the twins, even after seeing the film many times, still make me shiver, and the tracking shots following Danny as he rides around in his Big Wheel still make me cringe every time he takes a corner. What Kubrick does best with 'The Shining' however is the slow pace he makes us follow until the action story crescendos near the end. Rather than construing this as a pacing issue, this is more of a simmer, then a slow boil, and finally a boil over. As I said earlier, this isn't a very compelling review because there has been so much said about the film that I can't possibly add anything in the way of significant interpretation and exploration in a forum this short. What I can say in testimony to this film's relevance, appeal and ultimately, longevity is that the theater I screened 'The Shining' at was packed with people, from adolescent to middle age, which I personally found pretty neat, being such a fan of Kubrick's work. 8/10Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but effectively creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick begins his love affair with the Steadicam in this film, five years after 'Barry Lyndon.' Tracking shot after tracking shot after tracking shot fills this film as Kubrick, liberated from laying track for his camera, follows his characters as they run, walk, limp, stagger, hobble and cycle from room to room all over the Overlook Hotel and through the Maze outside on the hotel grounds. Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a writer (surprise) with, apparently, a history of mental problems and alcohol abuse. In recovery, he and his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd) are hired as caretakers of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado during the off-season. But during the winter, Jack falls off the wagon and descends into madness---or does he? Are we witnessing the hallucinations of a deranged mind, or is the hotel really haunted---or both? Is son Danny really telepathic and clairvoyant, or is he also a little nutty? It would appear that the hotel really is haunted and that Jack's mental frailty is fertile soil for the spirits' pernicious influence.I have not read the book, but I've heard that Stephen King was sufficiently dissatisfied with Kubrick's adaptation that he approved a 1997 TV miniseries starring Steven Weber and Rebecca de Mornay. Maybe so, and this is film is not without its flaws, but the power of Kubrick's unique vision is undeniable. The sets of the interior of the hotel are huge; they are somewhat reminiscent of the Discovery-2 in '2001.' We see ceilings and hallways that really appear to be connected. Different rooms are lit in different hues, so that there are sudden color changes as characters run from room to room, which must have given the cinematographer some truly baroque headaches. The emptiness and stillness of the hotel's rooms and corridors are effectively creepy. The film would not succeed, however, without Jack Nicholson's ferocious portrayal of a man losing his mind. His fortissimo performance simply overwhelms all the other actors' work, with the exception of Scatman Crothers. His riveting performance as Halloran astonished viewers who were familiar with Crotheres only as a rather clownish older black actor who made frequent appearances on TV dramas, comedies and talk shows that were rarely or any consequence. Since Crothers and Nicholson are almost never together on screen, Crothers has the opportunity to steal every scene he appears in with effortless aplomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really not sure why Stephen King doesn't like this film. I mean, if I were King, I'd be making a bigger fuss over "Maximum Overdrive" if I was going to complain at all.The Shining is the story of the Overlook Hotel, a huge and beautiful place where the rich and famous have been spending their summers for nearly a century. However, when winter comes, the Overlook closes down for the season and a caretaker is left behind to look after the grandiose estate. The previous caretaker didn't work out so well; seems a touch of cabin fever drove him to slaughter his entire family with an ax...or at least, that's what everyone says happened. So enter Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), his terribly insecure wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and their 5 year old psychic son Danny. The Torrances move in and settle down for a long winter within the deserted Overlook, but they slowly learn that the Overlook is not deserted at all and that many of the previous tenants never left.Like the festering house in the Japanese ghost story "Ju-On," The Overlook is less a hotel than it is a malignancy which infects everyone who comes into contact with it. It works as slowly and insidiously as a cancer, fatally poisoning you before you are even aware of it. Poor little Danny, who is either gifted or cursed with a powerful psychic gift (which Overlook chef Dick Halloran calls "The Shining") is very much aware of the sickness that is the hotel and the many restless guests within. But it is Jack whom the hotel ensnares, quickly and easily, using his bad temper and his alcoholism to turn him against his wife and son. As the winter snows pile up and literally trap the family within the guts of the hotel, Jack quickly descends into madness and the profane ghosts become stronger and more insistent, all but shoving the ax into Jack's hands.This is one of the best ghost stories ever put on film. Much like the unseen entities in "The Haunting" the restless dead drive the fragile living into doing the dirty work for them, forcing them to feed new souls into the already crowded halls. The ghosts are very visible here: ghastly and robotic, they take the forms of butchered twin girls, a rotting woman in a bath tub and an ocean of blood crashing down an elegant foyer. The violence is surprisingly minimal, usually presented in aftermath shots, but they are powerful and disturbing shots that literally froze me in place. The acting of the entire cast is exemplary and the hideously creepy opening music sets the tone for the rest of the film, implanting a heavy sense of dread that never lifts until the end credits roll. This is my absolute favorite Kubrick film, and should not be missed by anyone, horror fan or no. 10 huge stars for this morbid masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hints and Tips.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now...I'm usually afraid of Horror films, but since studying film studies in college, I have learnt a few tricks..to calm us weak hearted people down! I watched The Shining for the first time last night and truly found it terrifying! But watching it a second time, I began to pick up hints on how it works. Whenever you see Jack look into a mirror, you can tell something is going to happen, because a mirror is a split between the body and the soul. You'll be able to see it happen in the bedroom and in the dining room. Also I know that this is obvious, but it's great how the music builds up on the enigma and creates a strong tension between audience and character. When Danny is scooting round on his little tri-cycle and the music becomes more extreme, prepare yourselves because around one of these turnings something is going to happen! Anyway, I'm about to get back to the film, just thought I'd leave a little something for you film addicts! Milly x.x.x</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining and Salem's Lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes the shining is definitely a classic and I agree with whoever said that many of King's novels get butchered when made into movies...Sleepwalkers is a prime example. Wish I could see "It" but my fear of clowns keeps this movie far from my view. I love stephen king and his books are just riveting but his movies fall largely under his standards. Another good king movie though is Salem's lot...not to be mistaken with salem's lot 2 which is crap! Salem's lot follows vampire rules and gives you an eerie feeling as the movie progresses, Salems 2 depicts vampires leaping from cornfields and attacking passing children which is not true of what we know of vampires. Very disappointed with the second one but definitely see the first one. Watch for the master. He's the best part The shining is extremely well done and my favorite part is danny riding the bike on the rug and then on the floor. Good directing on Kubrick's part! Loved this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *There are a lot of really bad Stephen King adaptations around. I can safely say, this is NOT one of them. Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) takes a position as the caretaker of the overlook hotel, which seems like a dream to him. He plans to spend the winter, mainly to himself, to work on his novel. The only thing is that he was warned that the last caretaker went crazy and went on a killing spree, but Jack thinks nothing of it.Jack's little boy, Danny, gets quite an interest taken to him by a negro worker in the hotel, who knows that all will be not right. He teaches Danny about his special gift (The Shining), which allows him to see the past, present and future, including one rather famous scene of blood running down the hallways.I won't reveal too much more, although the story is pretty well known now. This is a brilliant film and it would have been nice to see Kubrick attempt horror more often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Come out, come out, where ever you are." -Jack TorranceThe Shining is definitely one of the scariest films I have ever seen. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel, and was directed by Stanley Kubrick. Jack Nicholson shines as Jack Torrance, a writer who takes his family up to the Colorado Mountains for the winter to take care of a hotel, but the hotel seems to have secrets of it's past. Stanley Kubrick's direction and Jack Nicholson's acting are definitely the high points of the film. I was thrilled from beginning to end and definitely didn't find this movie predictable. I have read the book, and I would call this a poor adaptation. But, this isn't King's movie so I can't really compare the two. Truly, a masterpiece of modern horror.10/10.</fullReview>

Well the fact that a horror film should be scary and this wasn't. No good suspense created. No well timed startle shocks and no freaky things. Kubrick's direction was bad. Nicholson, Duvall and Lloyd's performances are all terrible. Well Lloyd has an excuse- Kubrick didn't let him know that he was acting in a horror film! The Red Rum scene could have worked well if Kubrick had told Lloyd he was in a horror and if the letters weren't messed up. And how come "The Shining" was only touched upon?

		<shortDescription>My introduction to Stanley Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll never forget this. Probably one of the most - if not THE most - terrifying classic horror films I've ever seen. (Plus, it was the very first movie I saw that was made by my soon-to-be favourite filmmaker of all time!). Like many people, I saw this film at a rather surprisingly young age. I was at a friend's sleepover (birthday?) party, and he - or someone in his family - had rented this movie called "The Shining", starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, and directed by some guy I had never heard of, but whom apparently was a great director, with a great style. After hearing the creepy premise, I looked forward to this interesting journey with quiet anticipation...Words couldn't express my silent whirlwind reaction to the style and scope of this man's work. From the very first frame of opening credits, I was hooked (and scared to death, naturally; and it was just a freakin' shot of a car driving!)So many images, lines, and scenes from this film still resonate with me that I won't even bother going on forever about each one...but I will say that throughout this disturbing, beautifully-conceived nightmare, I was constantly trying to figure out how I was going to sleep that night! That's some powerful material! I must admit, however unfortunately, that I've never read Stephen King's novel upon which I found out this was based. I found out much later that he apparently HATED this version, but I nevertheless respected his opinion. After all, this movie wouldn't have been made if it weren't for him!A rich, timeless, and unforgettable masterpiece of cinematic horror that is surely among the best work of Kubrick's illustrious career. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's contribution to the horror genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the pen of one of the most prolific writers to the direction of one of the most obsessive perfectionist directors. Stephen King's imagination has inspired many movies and Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of ?The Shining' is the best that I have seen. Given the fact that many top directors have bought King's work to the big screen, we can thus see how good Kubrick really is. Kubrick has made many top class movies, but this one probably captured audience's imagination the most. It also became a signature role for Jack Nicholson, which is further indicative of the status of this movie.The soundtrack was not to inspire gross sales or to add greater revenue by way of soundtrack sales. It was utilised with one purpose in mind, and that was to significance to the story. The DVD edition includes the compositions in the chapter headings thus indicating how each particular composition was used to manipulate audience emotion and add value to the storyline. How do you portray the terror of the mind using the big screen? The ingenious use of camera shots and angles certainly helps and this was used. But overuse of this will underscore the effect the director is trying to create. It will translate to the audience as someone who is trying too hard and it becomes pretentious and this will be foremost in the audience's mind rather than the effect itself. Music has the benefit of creating the impression that some overbearing, ominous evil is present, but we cannot see it. This effect is used very well in the opening scene where Nicholson is travelling to the Overlook Hotel. An overhead shot is used with the car seemingly overpowered by the landscape and this is accompanied by a chilling opening number. Here the two are combined to enhance the overall effect. Nicholson is heading towards an enemy far stronger than him and a sense of impending doom is initiated for the audience.This is also used in the scene where Danny sees images of foreboding terror at the hotel. Excessive use of blood can be cheesy, but it's usage here has a definite part to play in moving the story forward. Danny picks up the image of terror that the hotel?s inhuman occupants have to show. This image is shown whenever Danny senses something terrible is about to occur, most notably in the scene where Nicholson confronts his wife after his experience in Room 237. The blood indicates the presence of the terrible beings at the Overlook Hotel and shows the true horror that they wish to impose. There is very little sound of gushing or none at all ? just the use of dark sound which rises as the terror is shown thus excentuating the image of horror for the audience. Although a shocking image, it is not out of place and clearly delivers the message of the foreboding terror that is about to unfold. Kubrick has a firm understanding of how to visually translate the terror of the mind. His work can be compared to that of the well-known writer of the 18th century, Edgar Allan Poe. Poe had a great eye for detail and also used very little dialogue in his horror stories. He usually portrayed the story from the viewpoint of the himself thus creating reality for his stories. He described the inner workings of the mind when subjected to terror, sometimes terror self ? imposed by the frailties of the main character's own mind. Kubrick has the same style, only he uses the big screen, which is sometimes more difficult when attempting to create this illusion. Kubrick made the necessary use of dialogue, but his mark was made by using other elements to project this effect. This is a complicated task to perform and one can well understand why he used Nicholson in the key role. Nicholson used his eyes to great effect with a little assistance from his devilish looking eyebrows. This is evident in the scene where he stares seemingly into nothing, but we can see the evil intent taking hold of him. There are no weaknesses as far as the performances are concerned. Nicholson is brilliant as the writer who already has problems with his wife from the start. We can see that this is a man who is impatient with her lack of intelligence and becomes less tolerant as the ghostly inhabitants increase their influence and guide him towards their diabolical objective. We can see that Nicholson relished the role of the demented axeman. He was able to fulfil his fantasy of wreaking havoc on society, which he does with boisterous aplomb. Duval is good as the wife who is gradually subjected to terror by Nicholson and it is the ghosts that finally decide to take control of the situation, revealing the full perverted horror that the hotel holds. Kubrick gave her a psychological drubbing in order to ensure that she looked unlikely to handle the situation. This may have been unpleasant for her, but it was essential to create a character that would seemingly falter against her husband and the ungodly spirits. Danny was superb. He showed maturity beyond his age as he was able to portray someone who had to deal with these images of terror. When Tony, his name for the power that his mind has, attempts to tell his mother through Danny that his father has escaped, he was able to keep his concentration throughout a long scene. This scene hung the suspense on a shoestring, which snapped when Nicholson starts to chop the door down. Working with children has it's own unique demands which were well met. Scatman added a lot considering his small role. He helped Danny deal with his images and the connection between the two offscreen oozes onto the screen.Without doubt this is one of the most prominent horror movies to date. Most satisfy a fast ? food mentality whereby cheap thrills and abuse of special effects is evident. If these are the fast ? food, then ?The Shining' is the escargot. It is in a class of it's own. To watch it once is to not experience the full effect of the movie. The sound of Danny's tricycle as it crosses the carpet onto the wooden floor and back again, the sense of isolation, the approach of the tennis ball and the terror within the eyes all take on a greater significance when viewed for a second time. These all helped to make evidence of the terror of the mind. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything shines on this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As some on this site have said, Kubrick´s The Shining is a horror classic. Everything on this movie, from the extraordinary direction of Kubrick, to the superb acting given by Nicholson, Duvall and Lloyd, is a highlight.The first thing that comes to my mind when i think of The Shining, are those long, long lanes of that empty hotel (remember the scene with the tricycle). It plays directly with the psychology of the viewer, who sees in those lanes a path leading straight to the unknown. That´s real terror.Also, the mixture between the hallucinations and reality may be nothing new, but the scenes are so involving and suspense full (here we can see the hand of a master like Kubrick)that you can do nothing but wait what will happen next.I personally think that some of the greatest movies, specially in the horror/fantasy/sci-fi genre, are so good because they intentionally leave a part of the plot unsolved. They leave big or maybe little mysteries to the viewer, so that he can start using his brain and imagination to get the answers. This element makes you want to watch a movie over and over again, in order to find something new, something you missed when you firstly watched it. The Shining has this element of not-completely-clear plot, and that makes it more interesting and terrifying. If you don´t believe me, then watch David Lynch´s movies, unsolved mysteries are the essence of his movies.Those who believe in that "it´s all about native americans theory", not be so sure. That is only an element barely mentioned, just another viewer theory. But you´re playing the game that Kubrick wanted you to play, so in that sense, you´re in the right to think what you want, but don´t try to impose your thoughts to everyone.Anyway, this is a classic movie that everyone should watch, not only the horror fans, but any cinema lover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorites as a kid, and still great to see today. It's not entirely satisfying though. The problems with the film mainly come from the second half. The use of Scatman Crother's character when he makes his way back to the Overlook is clever and must have seemed great on paper, but it takes a lot of time and may cause a lot of impatience to some viewers. Also when the spooks of the hotel finally make themselves visible to Shelley Duvall, it's a bit of a letdown, since they're just a few random shots of things that have been seen in a lot of ghost films before. The moods of hauntings, possessions, and isolation have never been handled better though. This is one of scariest films ever made, it gives me the creeps, and Jack Nicholson's rant to Duvall about bothering him while he's working is a classic. The final chase through the maze is ingeniously handled, it has a real sense of danger. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wasted potential bothers me - whether in a person or in a movie. It bothers me here. I want to love this movie. I want to think it's a masterpiece. But it misses that height by just a little bit because while it's very good, it could have been great.There's a great story here that could have worked so well. Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance, a writer who finds the perfect opportunity. He's going to take his wife and young son (Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd respectively) off to a secluded resort in the Colorado Rockies for the winter. They'll be the only ones there; Jack will work as the custodian and have all sorts of time for writing too. But the unexpected happens. Jack has writers' block. Anyone who writes for a living knows how frustrating that can be. Combined with the seclusion of the resort, Jack begins to slowly drift into insanity, with repercussions for the whole family. If that had been the story, this would have been a great movie; a masterpiece - simply because it's so plausible. Unfortunately ...Well, Stephen King (who wrote the book that this is based on) felt the need to take a story that would have been absolutely chilling because of its plausibility and turn it into some sort of rather silly supernatural/psychic adventure. It seems that Danny has visions and hears voices, etc., etc. The focus keeps coming off Nicholson's descent into insanity and back to this psychic bit, which makes the whole thing nothing more than a flight of fancy, when it could have been bitingly real. Combined with an ending that was - to me at least - the epitome of anti-climax, this movie really lost a lot in my estimation.Don't get me wrong. It's a very good movie. The performances are excellent. Jack Nicholson was born to play parts like this, and he is superb here. Shelley Duvall is convincing as his increasingly terrified wife, and Danny Lloyd does well - even though I wasn't sold on his character's psychic abilities. It was a pleasure to see Scatman Crothers in a supporting role as Dick Hallorann, the resort's chef who shares Danny's psychic ability. I've always liked Scatman Crothers. Stanley Kubrick does a magnificent job of building suspense. You will be on the edge of your seat throughout, and time and time again you will think something is about to happen, except that more often than not nothing happens, so you just start to get comfortable when you suddenly get shocked. This is one of Kubrick's best in my opinion.Watch this. It's a very good movie. It simply could have been better and more believable.7/10 (would have been a 9 if it had been told straight without the psychic nonsense.)</fullReview>

The only reason you would think this is because you didn't pay attention to the movie, didn't read the book, or didn't like only because it didn't have some psycho ripping some girls insides out every five seconds. And I think those slasher movies are so boring and funny they should be considered gorey soap operas.

		<shortDescription>Horror classic number one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Stanley Kubrick's nicest film: attracting, warm and cozy "Barry Lyndon" the masterful director wanted to return to something he's so extremely good at: horror. Of all the wonderful motion pictures Kubrick directed over the years "The Shining" is the one I've seen most often. Nevertheless it's simply impossible to grow tired of this enjoyable and unforgettable classic because at least I can't find a single fault in it. Floods of blood from the elevator, sights of two dead little girls, boy who has an imaginative friend talking through his finger: Kubrick's terrific masterpiece is filled with dark visions and frightening ideas that makes it the biggest and the most amazing horror film of the movie history. If I would have to name one thing that's common in almost all of Kubrick's films it's the interesting fact that they look more like a filmed dreams than a traditional movies.And usually those dreams turn out to be nightmares. Dreadful story, wild acting and especially the maniacal camera-work creates the same impression with "The Shining" too. Blood-curdling "The Shining" may not be Stanley Kubrick's finest film because there's always gonna be the brilliant "A Clockwork Orange" but that doesn't make it any less perfect. As I said, it's definitely the very best horror movie in the history of its genre - I haven't seen anything that comes even close to its effectiveness. If there wouldn't be a film classic called "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" the furious role of Jack Torrance would also be Jack Nicholson's greatest performance ever. Movie contains some of the most memorable horror movie moments. "Here's Johnny!" and "Redrum, redrum!" are just few of the legendary one-liners we remember from horrifying "The Shining". I've seen this film so many times I could say that if there's a film that's extremely familiar to me it's this one. But I still haven't figure out what the hell the last picture, the very last shot of this movie means? My rating is absolute 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Many critics claim that there were two failures in Stanley Kubrik's career. One was the over-hyped "Eyes Wide Shut," which seemed underdeveloped and overacted. The other was "The Shining." Most critics mentioned the differences between the book by Stephen King and the movie's screenplay. (Jack Torrance was too crazy in the movie, his wife was too wimpy in the movie, the boy was too strange in the movie, the moving hedge animals were missing in the movie, etc, etc). I think these critics have actually gotten in wrong. Stephen King should be thanking Kubrik for what he did--he took an average book about the effects of child abuse and turned it into a masterpiece of modern horror.First, let's examine the events in the book. We learn that Jack Torrance has a bad temper, and that he has been fired for hurting a student. We also learn that he broke his son's arm once in a fit of rage. Most of this was done in an alcoholic rage. Needing money, he moves his family to the Overlook hotel and takes the job of the winter caretaker. His son, Danny, has visions of horrible things in the hotel: a blood-stained wall, a hand coming from a bathtub, and the words REDRUM. Slowly, Jack becomes obsessed with the hotel's past, while strange things begin happening to his son. A fire hose begins to menace the small boy and the hotel's hedge animals begin to move and "hunt" him. He has recurring nightmares about a figure stalking him in the hallways with a bat, telling him repeatedly to "take your medicine!" Meanwhile, acting as though he's back off the wagon, Jack becomes convinced that he should kill his family and, quite predictably, turns into the figure in the hallway with the baseball bat. Only at the end of the novel does Jack snap out of it, rescuing his family from the hotel before it blows up (he forgot to fix the heater in the basement). (Bear in mind, this is an extremely brief summary of a 300+ page book).Okay, here are some problems right away with the novel. One, it's almost downright silly. Moving hedge animals? That's not scary, it's almost laughable. A threatening fire hose? Not scary. A blood-stained wall? Seen that on television too many times. The only true terror from the book comes from room 217 and the woman in the bathtub. The other problem from the novel is that most of it is told through the child's point of view. His "shinings" and visions are scary, yes, but they are still childlike. We don't question if the ghosts exist to Jack or Wendy, we question if they are real for Danny. Are these the real ghosts of a haunted hotel? Or are they the ghosts of a traumatized, abused child's mind?Now let's address the movie. The film begins similarly to the novel. Jack Torrance interviews for a position at the Overlook Hotel. Meanwhile, his wife discloses to a nurse that her son was once "injured" by Jack by accident when he was "still drinking." The student from the novel is dropped. Danny begins to have his visions--an elevator opens to release torrents of blood down a hallway. As the family moves into the hotel, Danny continues to have "shinings," such as seeing the two twin girls mutilated in the hallway. These visions are graphic and haunting. Meanwhile, Jack begins to have visions--a bartender serves him alcohol, a caretaker tells him to rid of his family. Danny eventually wanders into room 237--room 217 in the film--, and when Jack goes in, he finds the woman in the bathtub. She appears beautiful, but when he sees her reflection, he realizes she is actually a decomposed body. (To get into the use of mirrors in the film would require a whole new essay). Eventually, Jack goes insane, stalking his family with an axe, chasing Danny through a maze of hedges. Wendy runs through the hotel, seeing several ghosts and bizarre visions. Jack eventually gets lost in the maze andfreezes to death.How is this an improvement on the book? For one, Kubrick changes the point of view. The movie is told strictly through Jack Torrance's point of view. We see Danny's visions, but they are much more "adult." The blood streaming down the hallway is much more menacing than a dog-shaped hedge animal. Secondly, Jack himself is much scarier in the movie. Some people say the character is over the top, but I disagree. In the book, the repeated "Take your medicine!" references got old REALLY fast. Watching Jack Nicholson smile crookedly and say "Heeeeere's Johnny!" in the movie still gives me the chills. The bizarre visions that Wendy sees near the film's conclusion are also an added bonus. While searching for Danny, she sees three different visions. First, she sees what appears to be a man in a bear costume performing oral sex on a man in tuxedo. A viewer might be tempted to say "HUH?", but that is what makes it so frightening to me. Wendy wouldn't know what the heck was going on, so why should the viewer? Not knowing makes us as scared as Wendy was at that point. Then, she sees a man with blood trickling down his forehead. "Great party, isn't it?" he says. What party? Who cares! Like I said before, she would have no idea what was going on...why should we? Finally, Wendy sees the blood pouring from the elevators, a terrifying image that gave me nightmares the first time I saw it.Overall--and since I've been writing far too long already--the movie is much better than the book. The novel seemed silly and juvenile, while the film seemed subtle, morbid, terrifying, and very, very adult. Some say Kubrick didn't tie up all of the loose ends. I say he left out enough information to bring the audience back for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is supposed to be scary!!???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with this movie. I had read the original novel about 8 years ago and never got around to seeing Kubrick's much ballyhooed film--until just the other night. It's been well-documented that Stephen King wasn't all too pleased with Kubrick's portrayal of his book. I don't blame him. I tried to see the movie as a separate piece from the book and tried to judge it on its own merits. I came away scratching my head and thinking "Is this supposed to be chilling and frightening?" I think it's funny to read all the Kubrick sheep proclaiming this movie to be a masterpiece of not only horror but of cinema in general. Their attempts at trying to find symbolism and an artistic edge throughout Kubrick's "brilliant" direction amuses me. There are some good directorial techniques but they weren't effective in portraying the overall feel of doom for the main characters that King did through his prose. Kubrick's direction aside, the acting is atrocious. Maybe I've been ruined by all the mimicked/cliched Nicholson lines over the years but he never instilled any type of fear in me. All I got was dark humor. I can also see why Shelly Duvall went from doing this to Popeye and then to obscurity. My biggest gripe is that I never felt scared and that's essential in a movie based on a King horror novel. The only slightly scary scenes involved the two little girls hassling Danny on his Big-Wheel pedaling around the Overlook. Very underwhelming...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the book instead! *SPOILERS WITHIN*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read many Stephen King books- this was easily the scariest. The movie was a huge disappointment if you read the book first, for many reasons. First, Wendy in the book was a strong character; in fact, her near-threat of a divorce was the whole reason they went to the hotel. In the movie, she's a total wimp. Second, the kid's imaginary friend never spoke through his wiggled finger and messed up voice- I realize it's difficult to portray imaginary friends in a movie, but they could have made a better effort than that. Third, and this was the real disappointment, some of the scariest parts of the book were totally eliminated from the movie. In the book, the hedge maze was actually a topiary (a collection of hedges shaped to look like oversized animals). The topiary comes to life and chases the child around. This was the part that truly frightened me, and was completely ignored by the movie! Kubrick eliminated some of the best parts of the book and added his own, eroding the strength of the novel. To me, this film was saved only by Jack Nicholson's (as usual) riveting performance. Unless you're a diehard Nicholson fan, just read the book- you'll be much better entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is, without a doubt, one of the best horror films ever made. Without resorting to horror formulas and cheesy shocks, this film manages to be highly frightening, and, at the same time, a thinking-man's horror movie. Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance, the writer gone mad, is absolutely terrifying. Shelley Duvall plays his nagging wife, Wendy Torrance. She portrays a weak, frightened, frail woman to perfection. Danny Lloyd is surprisingly eerie in the role of Jack and Wendy's son, Danny Torrance. A great cast is made even better under the masterful direction of legendary director, Stanley Kubrick. Throughout, we get the beautiful tracking shots (a Kubrick trademark) through the giant, cavernous main halls, and the narrow Steadicam shots through the narrow corridors of The Overlook Hotel. Unlike such horror atrocities as "Valentine" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer" this film is not in-your-face; it's a very subtly portrayed masterpiece. One last note: The Overlook Hotel is one of the greatest movie sets in the history of film. All in all, a great movie, very highly recommended. ****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of my comment says it all, why? Why take a perfectly good book from undoubtedly the best horror writer around and turn it into this long, boring film that is supposed to have viewers quaking in their boots but instead had me almost asleep? I suppose I shall go through my feelings about this 'film'.Firstly, the cast that the director has decided to involve in this film is all wrong. Wendy Torrence, all she ever seems to do is cry, and almost break down, she is such a weak character anyway so why get an even weaker actress to play this part? Danny, well, he just seems totally lost all the time, the character is supposed to be a scary character, what this boy is experiencing is not normal so why does it seem that everything he does is just boring? His facial expressions are all obviously fake and he seems to react to the whole scenario as if it were a walk in the park, this makes no sense. Finally, the infamous Jack Torrence (Nicholson), well, I would like to say how sorry I am in advance to any avid Nicholson fans out there but the only reason that he seems to act well in this is because he has such a weak supporting cast. He is wooden and, well, he does not play the part that was meant by the author. At the beginning we should see Jack as a loving husband and father who, although he has his faults, is not a bad person, but even in the early stages of this film we see the manic sides to Jack that we are not supposed to see until at least half way through, he goes to pieces before he reaches the hotel. Nicholson, although a good actor in some of his films, gives this part an edge from the out start which shouldn't even be there. This brings the quality of the film right down.This film was so hyped up that I automatically thought, naive as I am, that it would live up to all the publicity that it received, I was wrong. As a fan of the horror film genre, I was so disappointed that the supposed 'best horror film of the 80's' would turn out to be this long, pointless, laughable portrayal of what could have been a seriously terrifying film. My advice to you is to skip the film, it's a waste of 2 and 1/2 hours and read the book instead, that'll have you more scared than the film ever could.Again, I ask my original question why..............?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest movies of all time by one of the best directors of all time. ***1/2 out of ****.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SHINING / (1980) ***1/2Stanley Kubrick is one of the best American directors who ever lived. No recent filmmaker has more effectively depicted ideas and created movies that literally defined generations; such films by Kubrick include "2001: A Space Odyssey," "A Clockwork Orange," "Dr. Strangelove," and most recently Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the psychosexual thriller "Eyes Wide Shut." Twenty years ago, this infinite artist completed "The Shining," one of the scariest movies ever made. The film, based on the similarly horrifying novel by Stephen King, is vivid in its characters and overpoweringly haunting with its terrifying undertones. Stanley Kubrick co-wrote, produced and directed this thriller that is well worth the view.The film stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, father of young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) and spouse to his wife, Wendy (Shelley DuVall). This family is not strongly knitted; never do we see the couple kiss, show tenderness, or make love. Jack used to be an alcoholic and once physically abused Danny. This factor is a major piece in the story's puzzle.As the movie opens, Jack receives a job maintaining a massive hotel in the mountains over the winter. This resort is called the Overlook Hotel. Jack's temporary service will provide his family with extra cash, a wonderfully positioned vacation, and him some quiet time to continue work on his long awaited manuscript. The innkeepers explain to the Torrance's they will be on their own for the upcoming harsh winter season.The Overlook Hotel is a magnificent architectural design. The film's atmosphere alone makes it worthy of recognition. This chosen location is a perfect place for a horror picture to transpire. Along with a haunting atmosphere, the plot also builds momentum through dialogue. These smart variables also vividly promote the vary essence of Nicholson's performance that induces psychological terror. Being stranded in a captivating hotel with a person who has a violent history is a circumstance commendable of true fright.Each scene advances the movie's story into a further depth of tension and develops the characters to a greater level. The gradual increase of Jack's frightening behavior creates a sense of heart-stopping suspense. After an extraordinary setup, when the hotel's radios are destroyed, transportation is taken away, and a colossal snowstorm strands the Torrances in captivity, the sky is the limit for what is in store for them. Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not take advantage of the payoff to a movie with a sufficient premise.Jack Nicholson extensively defines Stanley Kubrick's horrific masterpiece. His performance is outstanding, easily the best of his career. He intelligently depicts a character of intensity and raw barbaric depth. Also perfectly cast is Shelley DuVall, performing with fright-inducing intricacy. Danny Lloyd, best compared with today's Haley Joel Osment, is top notch as well.Although "The Shining" is a precarious, well-portrayed adaptation, its conclusion is disappointing in the highest regards. With such an effective first and second act and superior character development, we come to expect more than a lazy, disagreeable closing like this; "The Shining" does not execute the climax in which it builds.Another problem is with the second half of act two, featuring a assumed hero, Dick (Scatman Crothers), as the film interacts between him and Jack's terrorizing. He is eliminated so quickly, however, we question his existence in the movie period. Furthermore, the 1997 retelling starring Steven Weber better explains Danny's psychological power."The Shining" is an interesting motion picture to study; I own it. Discovering certain plot twists, analyzing performances, learning from direction techniques, and witnessing haunting atmospheres and tricky camera angles is fun. Most audiences will treasure "The Shining" for what it offers, but also condemn the film for the method in which it sums itself up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually interesting, but little more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to wonder why this film has so many fierce defenders. All we have in this film is a great premise, a series of often outstanding visuals tacked on to an anorexic story, and some fine actors struggling mightily against the retarded dialogue they were given. If Stanley Kubrick had spent even half the time on his screenplay as he did planning his camera movements, this film might be worthy of the praise it receives.There is plenty to like about the film: the music is effective throughout, and the sets of the Overlook Hotel are simply incredible -- of course, Kubrick uses them to his full advantage, moving the camera slowly through them to heighten the impact and size of the place. There are many visual images which stand out: the blood gushing from the elevator door and flooding the hallway, Danny riding his big wheel through the enormous, empty hotel, the typed pages Wendy comes across, Jack Torrance attacking the door with an ax and then looking through the hole with his famous grin, and of course the film's final image of Jack is one that is tough to forget. Kubrick never failed to deliver a visually interesting film.About the acting: I love Jack Nicholson, and he was very good in "The Shining," but he was miscast as Jack Torrance. Why? Because he always plays the crazy/weirdo guy, and the audience knew this going in. One cannot buy Nicholson as a normal guy in this or any film, so when he becomes crazy it has little effect. This takes a lot of wind out of the movie's sails. Shelley Duvall spent too much time whimpering, but considering that this is what she was asked to do I thought she was very good. Danny Lloyd was OK as Danny Torrance, although I thought Courtland Mead in the TV version did a better job (for those who insist that a six-year-old kid can't be that articulate or intelligent, try spending some time with one...). Scatman Crothers was great and underused as Hallorann.The thing that really gets me about this movie is when I read or hear people say that it is a metaphor for religion or child abuse or racism or jaywalking or whatever core value you prefer. It seems that Kubrick's fans believe that since he made the thing, it has to have some sort of deep, spiritual meaning and structure. Wrong! He read (skimmed through?) King's book, liked the idea of a family imprisoned in a haunted hotel, and decided to make a movie about it... it's that simple. Whether Kubrick understood what King's book was about is irrelevant -- if you've read the book, you can easily see why King doesn't like Kubrick's movie, but the plain fact is that Kubrick never set out to make "Stephen King's The Shining." King fans (and King himself) have the TV miniseries for that, and Kubrick fans should lay off it; it's pretty good, not nearly as visually fun (or as "scary") but the characters are infinitely more interesting and human than they are in Kubrick's film. If Kubrick ever made a popcorn flick, "The Shining" is it.The bottom line is that Kubrick wanted to make a horror movie, but had no idea how to do it. "Do I make a ghost story or a slasher flick? Is it about going insane or having ESP? Is it about the supernatural or getting lost in some hedges? Can I put in something about Indian burial grounds? And where do I squeeze in the obligatory scene with the cobwebby skeletons in old dressy clothes?" He had no idea, so he threw in a bit of everything, and the result is predictably uneven. It is only Stanley Kubrick's undeniable talent as a director, a big name in a starring role, and the Overlook Hotel itself that separate "The Shining" from any number of average horror movies. "The Shining" is little more than a "B" horror flick with an "A+" director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but this movie is a waste of time. Kubrick was a brilliant filmmaker, but even he can make a stinker. Well, here it is. There is no sense of pacing, no character development, and the acting is just AWFUL! Shall I explain? Well, for a movie that is as long as it is, is sure goes nowhere fast. Talk about a snail's pace. Jack Torrance was supposed to slowly descend into madness due to the effects of alcohol and the spirits that surrounded him. In this movie, he is normal one second, and out of his mind the next. The acting. First the kid. Whenever he did speak it was like he was reading right off the page. Oh, and talking to his finger? That has to be one of the most unintentionally hilarious things in any movie of the last 20 years. Give me a break. Shelly Duvall just sleepwalked through this movie. Could her voice be just a little more annoying? Nicholson. He was being Jack Nicholson when he was supposed to be Jack Torrance. I don't know which performance was hammier, this or the Joker. It's as if he knew how stiff everyone else in the movie was, and he had to make up for it by going WAY over the top. Laughable and not scary. Now to its credit, the movie does have some scary visuals. The stedicam work created a very creepy feel, and some the exterior shots of the snowbound hotel were very eerie. The whole maze scene was creepy for about 30 seconds and then got dull. The tv remake was not only more faithful to the book, but the acting was better. Yes it was! The actors remained faithful to the characters and the material. In just about every way, the remake was superior. This movie was NOT scary! I was 10 years old when I first saw it. I remember it vividly, because that night I also saw the scariest movie ever made, John Carpenter's Halloween. That movie scared the crap out of me. That is what a great horror film should be. The Shining, however, almost put me to sleep. Sorry Mr. Kubrick. Oh, and Mr. Nicholson? Switch to decaf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta say, the TV miniseries (done years later, I'll admit) was better than this film. Kubrick's adaptation is somewhat scary, but more "foreboding" than scary. More proof that Steven King stories don't make movies that are nearly as great as the printed product.Too many important details of the story are left out, and we don't get a good enough sense of the true history of the Overlook. It's these details that create the *real* horror. The miniseries explored them more, and so it was, to me, much scarier, even though I pretty much knew what was going to happen.The worst offense of this film is an over-the-top, over-acting Jack Nicholson and his undeservedly classic "Here's Johnny" line.</fullReview>

It wasn't even particularly scary.Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of "What horrors could be lurking around the corner?" as the camera follows the kid through the halls.But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that? There's no explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie! Here's where I'll probably get derided by the movie's fans for not "getting it," but I'm convinced this is really a case where the movie-makers themselves had no clue what it all meant. They just threw all this random imagery at us just to confuse us and convince us that it's actually brilliant (because if we can't comprehend any of it, it must be brilliant, right?) but really it just makes zero sense.I don't get why this is so highly rated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the novel, by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most popular and easily accessible Kubrick film in existence, THE SHINING is a film I've seen plenty of times over the years and yet it's a movie that never gets old. Part of the reason for that is the professionalism of the director; his cinematography is exceptional, really bringing the Overlook Hotel to life so that it becomes a character in itself.As well as being superb-looking, THE SHINING is both a creepy and exceptionally entertaining movie. It's far more effective than the Stephen King novel on which it was based, purely because it takes a more realistic approach to the material: you can argue perfectly correctly that this is a psychological tale of terror in which all of the events take place in the minds of the protagonists. Gone are the living hedges of the King novels, elements which Kubrick rightly realised wouldn't translate to the screen very well (check out the '90s THE SHINING TV miniseries to see how they did).Kubrick's main beef with the film is that the Jack Nicholson character seems psychotic from the outset, a contrast to his rational character in the book. But Nicholson is what makes this film a real delight to watch; he's a fantastic psycho and probably the most entertaining cinematic psychopath, better even than Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates. Duvall and Lloyd are fine, of course, but it's Nicholson who makes this such a compelling production. Finally, Kubrick throws in plenty of creepy stylistic techniques, like the subliminal images and some truly grotesque imagery, which makes this a chilly, frightening classic and one of the best 'haunted house' flicks in existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining indeed shines. One of the most iconic horror film, ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the thinking man's horror movie. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the movie is loosely based off the novel by Stephen King with the same name. Kubrick takes the concept of King's novel, and makes it, his own. The movie is about Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) a writer with writer's block who takes up a job as caretaker for an isolated, snow-bound hotel over the winter. He brings his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young child, Danny (Danny Lloyd) with him, where he intends to get some good work done. The Hotel has an ominous murderous past, where previous caretakers and patrons had killed themselves or others. The madness of being isolate in the hotel takes its toll on the family, as the past start to haunt them, forcing one of them to snap. This is one of those confusing films with so many interpretations of what the movie meant. It's no surprised, that fans would love to explore more on its themes and subliminal messages. Some people even watch the film, backwards and forwards at the same time. There are hundreds of interpretations ranging from CIA, The Illuminati, the Gold Standard and others. The most popular ones are that the movie was about the massacre of the American Indians because the film is loaded with Native American symbolism from the hotel's theme, location, and it's never ending supply of Calumet. According to this theory, the infamous visions of gushing red liquid streaming from the elevators actually make sense, as it represents the souls buried deep beneath the hotel, with the elevator cabin dropping down into the basement like in a well, delivering a bucket blood upon its return to the surface. Others believe it's about the holocaust, due to the number 42 being throughout the film. Half-hidden numerology is meant to evoke the year 1942, the same year the Nazis launched the Final Solution. I found it to be a little bit stretch. It could be that the director was fan of Jackie Robinson or really love the romantic movie 'Summer of 1942'. Still, Kubrick loves dipping his hand into Nazism symbolism. Then there are those, who think Kubrick made this movie to come clean about helping the government fake the moon landing because a character wore an Apollo 11 sweater and how the room 237, represent the number of distance from the earth to the moon. Most of this theory come from a 2002's French mockumentary film, call Dark Side of the Moon that was made as a spoof. There is no prove that Kubrick had anything to do with Apollo 11. I do believe that Kubrick's does tackle the themes of coincidences of life, dreams, racism, repressed sexual themes, and the past does not exist in this film. I do believe he use Theseus and the Minotaur as plot references. The huge giant maze was indeed added for the film, only. I dig the part of the Red VW Beetle being smashed up as a jab at Stephen King's source material as an inside joke as if saying, it's my movie, now. The other theories of the film are less lunatic, but drawn from small details like chair disappearing, TV had no cord, the window being in an odd place, typewriter changing colors, the carpet changing patterns, Etc. Etc. The people in the film, think Stanley Kubrick can't make mistakes. I for one, don't think Kubrick is a perfect with full control of every tiny little thing on his sets. Most of these examples seem more errors, then metaphors. The way, its shot is great for the most part. I love the opening helicopter shot of the lake. Wonderfully shot, lots of long, smooth tracking shots and perfectly placed imagery and slow dissolves. One of the famous sequences in which the camera tracks Danny. That was pretty cool to watch. Really great striking imagery, like the blood-red and white bathroom. The use of color is one of the highlights. The title screens &amp; accompanying screeching orchestra is amazing use of a countdown. The score is fittingly atmospheric and unique. The drum winding up and down is particularly great. The movie does have some different in International cinema releases and new releases. Stanley Kubrick shot Jack's typewriter pages in different languages for release in different countries. Also, some versions add the delete scenes to it. It makes for a lot of re-watch value. Although it made for a better, tighter film, if it wasn't there. It's interesting to see the film spell things out, but these scenes ultimately hurt the pacing, so it was right to cut. Still, there were some awful WTF frankly hilarious shot with skeletons with Shelley and the man in the bear suit that could had been chop. The acting was alright for the most part. Jack Nicholson is captivating and terrifying. He gives a believable performance. Still, his acting isn't much of a stretch, as Jack, the actor been known as a crazy guy, before this movie. Shelley Duvall is mediocre at best. Wendy, the clueless housewife, is barely tolerable before things go down. When they do, she's just there to be the final girl. I'm sure it was emotionally &amp; physically draining for the actress, but nobody liked her on set! It's seem like Stanley and her, bump heads a lot in this film, and you really do see, how much Stanley didn't like, working with her. The writing is pretty good. I love how dialogue changes tone, topic, seriousness and deadly intent line by line. Still, I wish there were more things from the book, add to this film. I like the power of the Shining, be used more in the film. The book makes the father, more of a tragic figure, than the straight out jerk in this film. Overall: Here's Johnny and he's absolutely incredible to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of a horror movie but a sophisticated one as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining remains to be a horror masterpiece to this day from Jack Nicholson's performance, the camera work, and how much of it is worthy of being analyzed. Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) is a writer and is taking up the job of being the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, he takes his family with him, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), his wife, and Danny (Danny Lloyd), his son. Before he takes his family up with him, he is talking with the manager of the hotel and is told of a story of a man who was a caretaker once before for the hotel and ended up having a mental breakdown leading to the him killing his entire family as well as himself. Jack says he'll be fine and simply brushes it off.Many different things unfold in this movie, from the intense tension in a vast majority of the scenes, especially the last 40 minutes, and all of the strange things that happen which you question the reality of and what the deeper meanings are. But, even if you don't bother to get analytical with the film or try to interpret the complexities, it doesn't take away from the film because it truly is one of the best horror movies ever made especially in terms of actually being scary and the performances. The soundtrack alone make things terrifying whether they are meant to be or not. The movie manages to have some incredibly memorable moments that are littered in pop culture today for good reason because so much is worth remembering.Every single shot in The Shining is taken with care, every thing is perfectly done and it makes for one beautifully terrifying film. It doesn't surprise me that Kubrick was such a perfectionist because not a shot is wasted. Everything is perfectly framed. Amongst everything though, the performance by Nicholson is mind blowing. He plays a fully blown-out insane man and it is incredible. It isn't very surprising considering I think he is easily one of the best actors ever and seems to be a stand-out in nearly all the films he is in. As the film ends, you will have plenty of questions but that's the beauty of the film, just how much of it is open to interpretation. The ending stands out as you question what is meant by it all and what Jack Torrence is exactly. The film has supernatural elements that aren't wholly explained but more left to what you think its supposed to be. Personally, I like it when a film leaves me with questions, if its done tastefully of course, I don't want everything to be spoon-fed to me by the artist. Ultimately, this is a film that still stands the test of time and probably will forever as a horror classic as well as being a smart, albeit terrifying, movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Horror Classic, A Definitive Staple of the Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror is a very strange and interesting genre. Most horror films never work. About 90% of horror films are terrible in an artistic sense, even in an entertainment sense, but still, there is that 10% that really make a difference. "The Shining" is one of those. It's one of those household film names everyone has at least heard of. This Stanley Kubrick classic is a great example of Kubrick's directorial power. Like all of his films, there are subtle hints that are clues to the point and direction of the film. There is an interesting documentary about these things called "Room 237" I strongly recommend checking out after watching the film for references to what I'm talking about (though may of this may just be coincidence)The screenplay, of course, was great. Stephen King is a hard author to translate into film, most films based off of King's books are terrible, but Kubrick had a vision enough to make it one. King has an excellent story writer.There is a lot to say about this film, the acting, the music, the atmosphere especially. I will not go on on a long review, so I will stop here.I strongly recommend anyone to check out this film. It is a horror must- see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant &amp; Terrifying Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick directed this (loose) adaptation of Stephen King's superb novel, about married couple Jack &amp; Wendy Torrance(Jack Nicholson &amp; Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny who go to an isolated Colorado hotel as caretakers for the winter, when the hotel is forced to close. They are met by the head chef Dick Halloran(Scatman Crothers) who recognizes in Danny what he knows about himself: that they have powerful psychic abilities called "Shining" that alerts them to ghostly presences. Unfortunately for them, the hotel, called the Overlook, is indeed haunted with evil and violent ghosts that are determined to destroy them, and then add their spirits to those already there...Genuinely terrifying film is supremely well crafted and directed by Stanley Kubrick, made more frightening by the sinister banshee wailing music score that really gets under the viewer's hide. Fine performances by all, claustrophobic atmosphere and horrifying imagery in this top-class adaptation; though writer Stephen King disliked the changes made to his novel(author's privilege) this film is nonetheless among the top horror pictures ever made. Once seen, not easily forgotten...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece like only Kubrick could make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A writer accepts the job of caretaker in a hotel during the winter, when it's closed to the public. Alone in there with only his wife and his (apparently psychic) child, he slowly falls for the influence of the hotel's ghosts, specially the former caretaker who murdered his entire family in a surge of madness...The Shining was a Stephen King novel published in 1977, and often regarded as one of the best horror novels. I'm not a fan of King, though, and I highly disagree with that opinion: I've read it, and thought it was a mediocre story, with absurd twists and so full of King's favorite clichés that one could easily predict what happened next. King criticized the movie a lot, saying Kubrick didn't understand horror. How ironic that the movie improves so much the story's idea.Kubrick did major changes in the story. Whereas the novel was a straight-up ghost story, the movie is a psychological tale of madness. We are treated with Jack's slow decent in that realm in such a way that we too feel like we are experiencing this: the numerous long shots, the feeling of emptiness from the big but empty hotel, the passage of time and the realization of how little one can do in there alone... It's easy to feel that Jack is slowly snapping from it all.If anything, the ghost aspect of the story is highly ambiguous: is Jack really being influenced by the paranormal, or is he just going mad? The fact no one else see the ghosts, only when they too snap from the pressure, also puts in question this. That's where lies the movie's true strength: it plays with us, play with what we believe we are seeing. Can we truly trust what we are shown?The choice of location was nice; such a big place creates such a sense of emptiness, it's scary. Kubrick, as shown with '2001' or 'A Clockwork Orange', is unsurpassed when it comes to creating an eerie atmosphere, which he further accentuates with his choice of music (which doubles as being very nice to the ears). There's always that impending sense of dread, the feeling that something bad is going to happen whenever a character turns a corner in the hotel corridors.The acting is perfect, something one can only achieve when working with Kubrick. Jack Nicholson is on familiar terrain, playing a crazy man; however, he truly does the part of the slow decent into madness with a high degree of realism. His performance is one of the best I've ever seen, from him and from anyone else. Shelley Duvall, too; she is a good actress and she truly brings to life her character's fragility and distress throughout the movie. Scatman Crothers and Danny Lloyd, the two other major players in this story, as well as the ghosts, are also very good.Saying this is a good movie is a severe understatement. This is my favorite Stanley Kubrick film, one of my favorite films ever, and possibly the greatest horror ever. Stephen King should feel honored that Kubrick did such a great job based on his idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) arrives at the Overlook Hotel to interview for the position of winter caretaker, with the aim of using the hotel's solitude to work on his writing. Manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) warns him that a previous caretaker got cabin fever and killed his family and himself. Jack's son, Danny (Danny Lloyd)and Jack's wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), feel terrified about the hotel. Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her that a "crazy woman in one of the rooms". Jack investigates Room 237 where he encounters the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy he saw nothing. Wendy and Jack argue about whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts having a costume party. While searching for Jack, Wendy discovers his typewriter; he has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" formatted in various styles. She is confronted by Jack, who threatens her before she knocks him unconscious. Jack awakes and chops through the door where Wendy and Danny are hiding. He then chases Danny through the maze. After Danny throws him off his path he escapes with his mother and Jack freezes to death.The scene where Jack first meets Lloyd, he's lit from beneath, which illuminates his already ominous features. When Wendy finds "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy", she is positioned right in the center of the scene and it's red right behind her (Kubrick always makes interesting use of red). Then, what appears to be a POV shot moves towards the chamber, but it turns out not to be; Jack moves into the scene. The camera views Crother's TV through his bare feet as he lies in bed, under the portrait of a naked women. His camera placement is original. Often the scenes are brightly lighted and the characters seem to be without makeup and the conversational pauses and hesitations stretched out. Camera-work had this quality of making the viewer expect that there is something around the corner.Nicholson is an artist who uses his face and various features in a brilliant manner. His expressive eyes, broad smile, ever moving eyebrows, deep crackling voice. He displayed cold frustration as effectively as outrageous anger. Portrayal of a frustrated madmen who slowly looses his mind was very detailed and must have resulted from a lot of homework. I found it to be very entertaining, very suspenseful and a visual treat. Those visuals were so good that I didn't mind the slow pace. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her "Olive Oyl" face especially with the camera pan.Something obviously falls out when you're watching the movie on a 67" high def. This scene was heavily planned and Kubrick was obsessed with aesthetic symbology. My theory is that the elevators represent Danny's mouth and him screaming was the elevator doors opening and Tony spilling out. All the bloodshed from melanin-eating white people killing native Indians and black people was all symbolic for the hotel being America and the history loops back in the destiny of evil white men. White men's novel is the destiny he writes for himself and that destiny is rage. "all work and no play (murder) makes jack a dull boy".... even when they first showed him throwing a ball at a wall that had a native painting of Indian deities that look a lot like the dead twins in blue outfits; the scene first started off with the blank typewriter. Him throwing the ball was symbolic for throwing or chopping an ax. (the ax in the hallway scene of the dead twins)I feel it was a slow long movie. I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who likes a horror or mystery. I haven't read the novel but i guess the movie wasn't what Stephen King wanted it to be. There was some disturbing images (not being scary) but who wants to see a fully naked rotting women, it was a raw movie, you saw their bare faces and true expressions. You felt the crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked both the movie and the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I don't see why I would have to choose between the book or this extraordinary adaptation done by Stanley Kubrick.It is true, the movie took many liberties with the story, and did several changes to it (Funny how the most iconic scenes from this movie weren't in the book, such as the part with the creepy twins and the "All work and no play..." thing) it keeps the essence and fear from the original story, adding some new levels of horror and nightmarish beauty.In many ways, despite the differences, both the movie and the book are great in their own, having the same level of quality and entertainment value.In my opinion, this is one of the best horror movies ever made, with an incredible atmosphere of tension and mystery.The result it's pretty effective and well done, resulting in something that is actually scary without having to use any kind of gratuitous violence or excessive gore. I mean, there is violence and gore, but that resource is not used in same way that other horror films(Such as "The Evil Dead" or "Braindead) tend to do.And that's the main reason of why this is such an unique horror movie, having a very well deserved title of "classic" among this genre. Considering how tamed and amateurish are most of the horror films from the recent year, t's good to have movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the UCLA Westwood Campus the most devoted movie fans were to be found excited for the screening of THE SHINING in 1980 as excited as the group I was with.......some film students. It was at the Village theater and an EVENT. Cut to the film. After about 35 minutes of beautiful photography and establishing the hotel, and a hint of oddness emerging in Jack and his tennis ball throwing while Shelley Duvall managed to remain mostly in the b.g. while the kid started browsing the corridors and introducing us to some remarkable shots on a Tyler mount or similar at the back of his little plastic tricycle.......and then more beautiful shots of white skinned dead of bleeding or horror shot to be seen for a while during which time Jack is in the best lit bar of the hotel with the ghostly bartender and Jack flipping out on poor bewildered Shelley while great effects flood corridors and elevator entrances....That UCLA bunch of real critics started to get uncomfortable and waited for something just as my group and I wondered what the frig was wrong and why is Jack doing so much ad libbing? NO HORROR was really happening. When REDRUM was discovered as all that Jack was pounding out, I sarcastically yelled out OH NO! MURDER SPELLED backwards!!Well,it started a riot of moans and groans at the dull pace and popcorn and things were being thrown at the screen of the classiest cinema in West LA. EVERYBODY hated it except the reviewers from the LA TIMES. The DAILY BRUIN had the worst reviews and people were yelling REDRUM all day to any question and laughing mockingly. SHINING was a dud.Seeing it twice since, it was a dud. Last night on TURNER TCM Stephen King did a Holloween Special discussing horror, thrillers,suspense and was incredibly smart and funny and open..Well, to hear him talk about his difficulties with phone calls from Stanley Kubrick and concepts about points of horror on which they completely disagreed and did not have ONE meeting of minds as to how the film should work, they ended their talks with Kubrick asking King if he believed in God? King answered "he believed in Hell" and did not go to see the film till way after it was released and found it to be beautiful aesthetically, but a bore and totally non horrific and Kubrick's ending of the film in the snow as opposed to a fire, completely dull and not scary...I was double thrilled when I agreed with the author and especially at the end of the interview after seeing dozens of clips of horror, vampire,and suspense, monster,films, that at the very last question of his favorite horror film being the original THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, my OWN favorite, I realized my opinion of SHINING was right on.It sucked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 2 cents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I've seen the film and read the book (in that order). I've even sat through some of the TV-series (or as much as I could stomach). I've read several threads in this ongoing debate.In the first place, I'd like to thank and praise King for writing the novel. It is to his brain that we all owe a great debt of gratitude for this interesting story in the first place.Secondly, I would add that I think we're dealing with 2 different caliber of artists approaching similar subject matter (which, again, King originally came up with). On the one hand, and setting aside basic plot ideas/differences for the moment, I find King's writing to be good (though very long-winded). On the other, I find Kubrick's film-making and screenplay to be brilliant (and concise).In the end, I feel Kubrick's capacity far outshines King's. I appreciate King's own appreciation for Gothic (esp. Poe), but feel he hardly measures up (to Poe or other writers he admires (such as Lovecraft); I suspect he would agree). King is a good pop-fiction writer. Most people will read him. He explicitly (and annoyingly) explains his metaphors (such as the wasp's nest), rather than leave them for the reader to decipher for themselves (if they do). Most people need that. We live in an age where more people read Harry Potter than Crime and Punishment; but, I digress.Before closing, I had one final note which may be a piece of fiction of my own, but, I think, is worth considering nevertheless: King's novel, which we know is in many ways autobiographical, may have been a therapeutic exercise for him in which he fabricates a new (and fictional) reality and recognizes (and, therefore, addresses, genuinely I think) his own personal issues/exorcises his own personal demons. As readers, we can only admire him (if that is in fact the case). However, that Kubrick's interpretation puts a wrench in this may be part of the reason why King disliked the film in the first place (and continues to do so). Any personal issues which originally fueled the novel do not need to be adopted or even recognized by Kubrick, who clearly went in a different direction with the character, Jack Torrance (than did King). Here I say, let King be King, let Kubrick be Kubrick.I never met King or Kubrick, except through their work, and even there both reveal and hide parts of themselves. I am grateful to both, but, if pressed (and regardless of who originated the story), I would consider Kubrick the superior artist. Also, I could barely sit through even some of the 1997 TV-series version (written by King), but can appreciate why he continues to keep the story emotionally sprinkled and sympathetic to Jack Torrance as he does. Here, King's presence remains; whereas, in Kubrick's version, it is checkmated and eliminated from the game.In closing, I would add that we should also thank Diane Johnson, herself an author and (I believe) PhD in Gothic Literature, who no doubt greatly influenced Kubrick's final product. Cheers, CA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining is a true horror classic that allows you to feel the fear and suspense of the characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a classic horror film that has every element of psychological terror. Directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the novel by famous horror author Stephen King, this film brought together the elements of terror, action, and suspense.Jack Nicolson plays the main character, Jack Torrence, an unemployed writer who accepts a job care taking a hotel in the remote Colorado mountain's. With him he brings his wife Wendy, played by Shelley Duvall, and their young son Danny, played by Danny Lloyd. This film projects a father who is controlling, moody and abusive. He takes his family away to this hotel, knowing its past events, and forces them to endure a brutal winter of seclusion and fear.This film alters between Jack's reality and his delusional state. Jack Torrence, in his quest for solitude begins to lose his mind and transgresses into the life of a psychopathic killer. This film does an excellent job with the use lighting and various camera angles to allow the viewer to feel the tension and suspense.Danny possesses a paranormal ability to see the past and the future. This ability is referred to as "shining". With this ability he is able to see the horror that the hotel history holds and the horror that is to come from the hands of his father. Danny connects with the cook at the hotel, Dick Hallorann, played by Scatman Crothers as he also "shines". Hallorann warns Danny of the evil of the hotel and to stay away from room 237.As the weeks progress for the Torrence family in the seclusion of the hotel, Jack begins to act differently. He becomes irritable and mean. Jack has delusional conversations with a dead bartender, who reminds Torrence that his family needs to be punished. Wendy becomes aware of Jacks change in attitude and personality and fears for her safety and that of her sons. She tries to call for help, but Jack has destroyed the radio system. Danny, with his ability to "shine", is able to communicate with Hallorran and lets him know they are in trouble.The best scene is when Wendy is in the lobby, which is where Jack is writing his novel. She approaches the desk with trepidation as she doesn't know where Jack is and she was warned not to go in there and bother him. She has a bat in her hands and as she approaches the desk the camera angle changes so you can see Jack is behind her in the shadow of the overhang. He is watching her read the pages of his novel, which consists of numerous pages of "All work and no play make Jack a dull boy". This scene was filmed perfectly, it had so many elements that worked together to produce the feeling of terror and suspense. The lighting and zooming in on Wendy trying to get away from Jack while walking up the stairs backwards reinforced the fear she feels in trying to protect herself and her son.The theme of this film laid the foundation for the fear and terror that Wendy and Danny felt and the perpetuation of those feelings as Jack slowly lost his mind. This film is a great American classic. Kubrick did an excellent job casting outstanding actors, incorporating perfect lighting, scenery, camera angles to project the suspenseful and terror filled scenes in this movie.</fullReview>

Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. Plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a difficult review to write. You see, I've just posted comments on Ella Enchanted where I comment that, as someone who has never read the book, the film is absolutely fine. But it's difficult for me to approach Stanley Kubrick's The Shining on that basis because, you see, I've read Stephen King's The Shining.If I do my absolute best to put the book out of my mind, I suppose that the film must be acknowledged as a tolerable horror, with two major flaws - one, it's overlong, and what should be a slow burn loaded with increasing dread becomes simply boring, and two, Jack Nicholson's established screen persona means that there is absolutely no suspense in his development from decent though flawed father/husband to scenery-chewing maniac - the final madness is there from the first frame he appears in.If you've never read the book and you're a horror fan, then you'll probably enjoy it - no huge surprises, but it ticks most of the boxes. And it looks very good.But what a missed opportunity! Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film about a man who goes mad in a haunted hotel. Stephen King's The Shining is a novel about an evil entity which inhabits a hotel, and which wants to consume a boy's psychic power: the boy is strong enough to resist it, so it works on the weakest link, the father, and gradually erodes everything which made him a good, decent man. Jack's transition from the decent though weak man he starts out as, to the point where the Overlook is in control of his every action, is absolutely central to Stephen King's The Shining, and it could only have worked on screen if Jack was portrayed by an actor who was initially credible as a decent, gentle man. Not Nicholson - I love him, but he was (in my view) a spectacular piece of miscasting for this movie. Picture Dustin Hoffman, Harrison Ford, or someone similar, and how dramatic and shocking their descent to axe-wielding maniachood would have been.The contrast is essential to Stephen King's story: with Nicholson, there was no contrast.It is also worth commenting that King's The Shining is about a man who loves his family: Kubrick's The Shining is stated, by the screenwriter in one of the DVD documentaries, to be about a man who hates his family. A fairly fundamental difference, yes?Ah well. "What if"s never got us anywhere. Go and see Stanley Kubrick's The Shining anyway, and enjoy Jack Nicholson chewing scenery. The scenery's pretty good eye candy and, besides, he does it so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OMG. This movie is awesome. The best movie ever made. The directing, the acting, the story, the paranoia, the hotel, the axe, and The Shining. I've watched a few thrillers or horrors in the past, but were never the full treatment I was expecting. Rear Window got close, Flightplan was off-course, and Cellular disappointed. But this, was far from that. The music was synced perfectly to the movie, and the suspense was on top through the whole thing. And it just kept raising the bar. So far, the plot is extremely confusing, and I still don't get it. But regardless, this movie will NEVER disappoint. Most of the content was not language, but only some violence. The worst was the nudity. Graphic. But no, it's not a real person. It's the apparition of one of the past victims. Sometime around the first quarter, you think it's boring. He takes care of a hotel. So what? He has his family there, and he's writing a book. But when his wife notices that he's getting extremely short-tempered, things just seem not right. The child with mental problems and abilities is being haunted. By room 237. The victims. The two little girls. The woman in the bathtub. The axe murderer. Meanwhile, the father seems even more crazy. The wife is getting scared of him. He's has hallucinations. But one day, he has a total mental meltdown. He gets the axe, he escapes the pantry, and heads for his accomplishment. To kill everyone. What happens next? Watch The Shining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nothin'. There ain't nothing' in Room 237. But you ain't got no business going' in there anyway. So stay out. You understand? Stay out." Never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves. This is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so.

Then the father (Jack) becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel.Kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect. The tense tracking shots, agonising music, mystical messages and perplexing plot makes this the best horror film ever made.Throughout the film there is constant references to danger, death and horror. Red is used in EVERY scene. Is the red purposely put in by Kubrick? Of course!.This is a definitive Kubrick classic and this is the third of his films I have given 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films. He loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his films.I will be talking about this film for months to come. It has infinite depth.In conclusion, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't mind watching this once in a while for a few reasons.First. This movie is in format 1.33:1 fullscreen which means that the screen of my old TV set is completely filled whereas almost all movies of the last 40 years are more or less panoramic or "widescreen".Second. The light in this movie is excellent along with the quality of the images. Kubrick, unlike some directors, handled with care the original negatives of his movies. That is why today Kubrick's films are the most outstanding from an "image quality" point of view despite the fact that they all aged. (Space Odyssey is from 1968). This means respect for the viewer.Third. The fact that Jack Nicholson looks half crazy from the very first scene rather adds something to the movie instead of penalizing it. From the very first scene we are already tuned on the upcoming outburst of Jack Torrance. We just can't wait till it happens.The atmosphere is very particular. Some scenes are really the ones of a "horror movie" and by this I mean that the term "horror movie" is very abused.But I did notice a few things that I didn't like. It happened during the sequence of Jack Torrance with the bartender. I noticed that when Jack is talking, the bartender is out of the picture and we only see a very small portion of his shoulder. When the bartender is talking, Jack is also out of the picture and we only see a small portion of his shoulder also. What kind of a technique is that? Was Kubrick too lazy to work with the 2 actors together? I bet you that when the bartender was filming his scene, that small shoulder we see was the one of a technician and Jack Nicholson was relaxing in his dressing room.The same thing happens in a more dramatic scene, when Jack Torrance has gone definitely nuts and is about to attack his wife. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall are never pictured together. If we see Jack, Shelley isn't there and vice versa (except for that famous small portion of shoulder). I think this scene looses much of its dramatic intensity. In the scenes where Shelley was blubbering I couldn't stop thinking of Nicholson probably having a day off.The scene of Nicholson definitely going nuts is where the movie ends. Every mechanism of the movie drops. The tension of the movie is now uniquely in a physical match which appears right away almost ridiculous. We have a too slow moving Nicholson opposed to a very awkward and clumsy woman. The final part is really without any surprise as we all know what will happen.From very good to excellent. But not a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite the Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read The Shining by Stephen King, I found it to be one of the best novels I had ever laid eyes on, It is his only novel so far that has frightened me (and I have read many of his) and I was almost hyper at the thought of watching the movie. The hedge animals, the bathtub scene in room 217, the playground cave-in, and the explosive ending of the book made me excited about how scary the movie would be. Well. About one hour into the film, I was shocked, simply SHOCKED to find that it had almost nothing to do with the book. I watched on, and to my horror, I found that the hedges, playground, and boiler were gone, replaced with typewriters, mazes, elevators brimming with blood, and slaughtered girls in a hallway. However, I watched on, and the movie gave me grim satisfaction at the end. Kubrick had simply taken the main idea and ran with it. Why did I still like the movie? Simple: It's good. The macabre scenes were enough to cure my blood lust and strong actors graced the story (despite what most people say, I found that Shelley Duvall was a better actor than Jack Nicholson in many of the scenes; he seemed rusty and forced, and his eyebrows didn't help any, either). The movie did not scare me the same way the book had, but its weirdness takes its place, making it a great experience. I gave it a nine only because of its occasional slow scenes.Watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i absolutely loved this film, i thought that Jack Nicholson was brilliant but sadly this was not a HORROR movie just a good film. there was no points in this film that made me jump or frightened me. i read the book before i actually watched the film and all i can say is that in a way it was a bit of a let down. i had imagined the whole thing while reading it and then when i sat down to watch it on screen what i was confronted with is a pretty funny film with all the suspense of a soap opera. i would just like to ask, what was the point of Stanley Kubrick doing an adaptation of a book if he isn't really going to use the events from the book? is it because he couldn't think of a story of his own so he simply stole the outline of someone else's? or could he just not be bothered to do the book justice and create a quality film. like i said i thought this film was fab in itself but maybe Mr Kubrick should have omitted the fact that it was 'based' on The Shining and just called it something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writing is hard business, and there's a great scene in "The Shining" which shows it all. If you've seen it, you know it. Jack Torrance is typing away in this terribly non-conducive writing space, huge and imposing. Just then his wife Wendy walks in, asking him if he'd like some sandwiches, maybe let her read what he's written.Jack Nicholson is a marvel in this moment, letting her have it with both barrels for "breaking my concentration." Whether she hears him typing, or doesn't hear him typing, she's not to walk in and disturb him, he tells her, not putting it nearly so pleasantly.As a writer, I laugh with recognition. But it's kind of a problem moment because it kills dead any concern I have for Jack Torrance 30 minutes into the movie. He's a bully as well as a deadbeat, who has cooped up his wife and kid in a snowbound old hotel with bad mojo leaking out the vents and then springs some heavy 'tude on the old woman for simply trying to offer him friendly company."The Shining" is the horror film by Stanley Kubrick, a mega-talented but overrated auteur of several very well regarded films, five of which are in the IMDb Top 100 list (and a sixth, "Full Metal Jacket," hovers just outside.) "The Shining" is the fifth most popular, but next to "A Clockwork Orange" my favorite, and probably the most enjoyable.It's a very disturbing and violent film in parts, more a mood piece than a gore fest but with some scary moments. Kubrick never had much of a sense of humor, and the film sleds quickly over a lot of territory author Stephen King explored more compellingly in his great novel. Certainly Jack Nicholson, who seems to be doing some kind of Bruce Dern imitation here, doesn't really give us a character so much as a caricature, and of the three principal actors, his manages to be both the weakest and most memorable.But "The Shining" is a great film once you realize Kubrick's vision here is to create an absorbing entertainment. For all his faults, he was a master of control, and demonstrates that here with shots that have become indelibly etched in cinematic history, like little Danny riding his Big Wheel across carpeted corners, Jack taking an axe to a door, and Wendy cowering in a corner screaming. It's a bitter story, and while I miss at times the humane angle King brought to the book, it's probably good that a movie version was helmed by someone as legendarily hard-hearted and unsentimental as Kubrick.I think "The Simpsons" have raised this film much higher in general estimation with their many nods and parodies in "The Shining's" direction. But "The Shining" speaks well of its creator Kubrick on its own terms, kind of as his goofball effort amid heavier-themed pictures and kind of as his demonstration of supreme technical craft. There's a great documentary attached to the DVD of this film which shows Kubrick setting up scenes, coaching little Danny Lloyd as Danny, and arguing with Shelley Duvall, who for my money gives the best performance as the only relatively normal denizen of the Overlook Hotel. It's really something to watch Kubrick so in his element."The Shining" is all about Kubrick in his element, isolated, cold, squeezing the viewer's field of perception from every angle. It's a memorable ride from its opening fish-eyed tracking shot of a river road to the final black-and-white image, and a masterpiece that is impossible not to love on its own, unembraceable terms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is such a classic how can one even comment on it? Obviously this film is a legend, a classic etc. And some of the most legendary lines around were coined in this movie. Great acting, great special affects, creepy! Eerie(very eerie!). A classic! But one thing I have to add: as good and scary as the movie was, as erie as it was, I found some of the scenes to be either intentionally or unintentionally rather funny too. "All work and no play"(being typed over and over again),here's johnny",even the famous "RED RUM!!" to an extent. I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be that way but many of us felt that way and would go into gales of laughter when certain particular scenes came on.That's NOT to diminish the movie's eriness or fear factor AT ALL!. I'm just thinking that there were some unexpected moments of wit in this classic as well and that made it all the more fun to watch. RED RUM!</fullReview>

In fact, for the most part it is just watching people putter around a hotel by themselves and one of them goes insane. The boys powers are for the most part ignored, and it is a major part of the book. Though I myself would have loved to have driven around on a big wheel through a hotel at that age it doesn't really belong in this movie either, what the kid can't be walking and discover stuff? Jack though does a great job as the father, though he seems a bit to insane at the beginning so him going crazy is definately not a surprise. All in all a few scary scenes here and there, but this one to me is just an ok movie, not the scariest movie by any stretch of the imagination.</fullReview>

As opposed to some 16hour epic that just goes on and on and on like alot of the 'made for tv' adaptions. The Shining is a terrifying and well acted movie. Ok, granted Jack Nicholson looks insane before he goes insane. But thats cause he is insane. Anyway, stop slating a film that dares to deviate from its original source.</fullReview>

Before I had gotten a quarter of the way through the book I had the answer, Stanley Kubrick. After reading the entire book I see that the movie was even more lacking in plot, acting and scare factor than I had thought.

		<shortDescription>The first epic horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is "the fist epic horror film" as had written Jack Kroll on Newsweek. Martin Scorsese argued that was "one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time". Billy Wilder said to Cameron Crowe that "The Shining" is a "fluid film" that does a good meaning to this film. This is the best performance of Jack Nicholson, also better of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" when he won the Oscar on 1975. The other actors have also a good performance as Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers that probably they had a big trauma during acting that movie. This is an important movie. The several meaning continue to be written by the fans. There is a movie: "Room 237" that groups some of these hypotheses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep. Symbolic. A multi-layered Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm thankful for the liberties Kubrik took with the adaptation of King's novel. It made it less corny and deeper than the original story. In fact, it stands proudly on its own while it delivers a multi-layered tour de force into America's darker beginnings.Make no mistake: it IS about the Native Americans' genocide. Kings' story being just one of the layers to this movie.The whole movie is a maze. From the roads that take the Torrence family (and the viewer) to the "Overlook Hotel", to the Hotel's architecture it self, to the outside maze, to the family's relationship of abuse, to the endless symbolic imagery that populates almost every single frame.The acting is superb and memorable, the Sound Track's eery and haunting (great use of Bartók, Ligeti and Panderecki) and the overall scenery is mesmerizing, to say the least.There is a foreboding sense right from the beginning and a sense of "unescapable" fate through out the entire movie.Indeed, one of the few movies that still resist to the passage of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a teen I used to love this film (Kubrick+King+Nicholson is an irresistible combination for a young man born in the early '70s) but now I believe this is one of the most overrated 'classics' of all time. The film is overlong (for the little it has to say), very slow (for no reason, that's the problem) and poorly narrated; the characters are shallow, underdeveloped (Nicholson looks like a maniac since the very beginning) and uninteresting ? all actors clearly do their best but they are way too over the top to be convincing. Only a couple of great scenes, the usual good photography and some beautiful settings save Kubrick's worst effort from disaster. I believe most people who adore this mediocre piece of cinematography just can't admit also a legend like Kubrick could make mistakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The photography is exquisite, the score insinuating, the direction unblemished, and the acting sumptuous. It's so good that even Steven King's usual pulp horror script can't undo it.From the opening scenes of an insignificant Volkswagon beetle snaking up the deserted road towards an old fortress-like hotel, with an ominous, electronic Dies Irae providing the accompaniment, we know we're in some strange territory. At the wheel of that tiny car is Jack Nicholson who is about to be hired as the winter caretaker of the Hotel Overlook. He brings his family, goggle-eyed but beautiful Shelley Duval, and his cute little son along to keep him company while he does his minimal manual chores and tries to write the great American novel. Things begin to go wrong. The echo of things past begins to make itself heard. Nicholson goes berserk, kills a good Samaritan (Scatman Crothers) with an ax and hunts down his wife and child. Duval manages to reach the snow cat, the only vehicle that can travel through the monstrous snowfall that has isolated them. Nicholson chases little Danny through an intricate maze of thirteen-foot-high hedges, howling and lugging his bloody ax. Danny outwits him, escapes with Duval, and Nicholson is finally left to freeze to death in the middle of the insoluble maze, a more cinematic ending than the novel's boiler room.The hotel is a stage set in England and so is the exterior. But what a set it is. It comes across not at all faked but rather like stylized reality. Kubrik does a fine job. The natural tendency in a spooky horror movie would be to hurry the pace so as not to bore the audience of impatient teens. But Kubrik takes his time. The first hour does little more than introduce us to the characters, just enough information to pique us. The shock scenes are not sprinkled throughout the film but are built up to as logically as possible. Threats don't lurk in the shadows. Everything is visible. And the scenes are sometimes funny. The camera views Crother's TV through his bare feet as he lies in bed, under the portrait of a naked babe with an Afro the size of a medicine ball. His camera placement is original. Often the scenes are brightly lighted and the characters seem to be without makeup and the conversational pauses and hesitations stretched out to the horizon, a self-imposed directorial challenge.And an acting challenge too. Jack Nicholson has been in better films but his performance here has never been topped. There are some long takes during which he speaks to Loyd, the ghostly bartender, while looking directly into the camera. He delivers a superlative slice of ham here and elsewhere, winking, wriggling his tongue at his wife, snorting, making gargoyle faces, acting stupefied. What a performance. Everybody else is good, too, if not quite at Nicholson's level, but of course he has by far the juiciest part.The story is so full of holes that it's hardly worth bothering with them. Something strange happens to Nicholson, let's say. A beautiful naked woman approaches him in one of the hotel's rooms and smooches him while turning into a rotting corpse. Nicholson screams in horror and runs away. When Duval asks him what happened, he says, "Nothing." And if Loyd the bartender is a real ghost, and if the booze is real, and if Nicholson's character is really a recovering alcoholic who has decided to get off the wagon, then why does Jack order just one drink and then wander away to join a supernatural party? Why doesn't he say, "Loyd, give me something simple -- a bottle of bourbon and a straw." But suppose Nicholson is hallucinating the ghosts? Well, that can't be, either. One of them unlocks the door to the food storage room and lets Nicholson out. And Shelley Duval and little Danny see them too.This doesn't really torpedo the movie. It has too many superlative features to be destroyed. The holes are irritants but not lethal. A good deal of talent was lavished on this lowbrow script. See it if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually stunning, with a degree of eeriness only Kubrick and very few others could have achieved; some of the scenes are unsurpassable in this respect. The cinematography is immaculate; Kubrick even makes the toilet look good. Nicholson is incredible; what he does isn't overacting - it's just what the film and story needed. (He has been often criticized for his performance here.) After all, he is going insane, right? Shelley Duvall is excellent, too, and well-cast.I can't believe they re-did this; what's the point? That moron Stephen King should be forever flattered that the best director of all time decided to pick up one of his crummy books and make a movie out of it. In fact, this dumb-looking bird-brain has even criticized Kubrick's adaptation of his irrelevant little novelette! Stephen King criticizing Kubrick is like a guy in a wheelchair criticizing his boxing coach for not making him the WBA heavy-weight champion of the world (with the difference that Kubrick made something out of "Shining"). King criticizing Kubrick is like an eight year-old telling Einstein that his theories are stupid. King criticizing Kubrick is like Michael Moore criticizing Mark Twain's writing. King criticizing Kubrick is one of the biggest jokes in the history of mankind. If you still want to watch the remake, your problem.Excellent soundtrack, similar to that of "2001".

It starts off with a fairly interesting premise but soon turns south, thanks to a story that is silly and characters that are one-dimensional and under-developed. Nicholson's acting is way over the top with the only redeeming quality being that it's pretty funny at times. Duvall is at her bug-eyed, buck-toothed worst as Nicholson's simpering ninny of a wife. The blame for this must fall on Kubrick, as both actors have shown that they are capable of better performances. While visually opulent, the film is totally lacking in subtlety, a huge disappointment from a master filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining begins with the camera gliding, twisting, and turning over winding roadways. The opening credits crawl up the screen not unlike closing credits during these aerial shots. And a dies irae, played on a synthesizer, oozes from the soundtrack.. At frame-one Kubrick inspires a feeling of dread, a feeling of uneasiness, and a sense that something is not quite right.No, The Shining is not one of my favorite horror films; however, I have to give credit where it is due, and I have to acknowledge that the Shining accomplishes what it sets out to do: inspire dread.I originally watched the Shining 15 years ago, and didn't care for it at the time. Upon revisiting the film I was surprised by how vividly I remembered the film (more vividly than the novel, I might add.) So kudos to Kubrick.Then interestingly, Kubrick explores another meaning of the word "dreadful" with the dialogue in the following scenes ? the interview. Painfully forced, obligatory, dare I say Hollywood-ish? I cringed watching Jack Nicholson put up a stilted performance complete with a phony grin as he assures his employers, "Five months of peace is just what I'm looking for." And the performance of all the other characters matches this same stilted tone.Like a puppet show with Stanley pulling the strings.Shelley Duvall stares into her past, making an uncomfortable recitation (that curiously lacks conviction) of the memory where Jack hurt little Danny once upon a time. In the end, I felt this neglect ultimately robs the film of some of the emotional attachment required to get the sense of tragedy ? although Roger Ebert's perspective paints these stilted performances in a fascinating light in his Great Movie review series.Then, strangely enough, as Jack descended the steps to insanity, his performance felt more natural, more believable, and I bought every second of his unprovoked hostility. Eventually leading back to that same adjective, "dreadful" in the sense that at any moment this man could snap as he sits with Danny for a painfully long period of time until the mounting suspense becomes unbearable.The Kubrickian pacing syndrome where things happen (or don't happen) by Stanley's watch: as I described in the above paragraph (which is not a criticism, btw), the film is not afraid of pausing. Not afraid to linger. And not afraid to take its time, while the camera absorbs the hotel in such a way that it (rightly) becomes an ominous character in itself.Having said that: the Overlook Hotel was Kubrick's playground, and he masterfully wove its vast depth, its space, and its symmetry into the very fabric of the film. The cinematography is simply marvelous, literally bombarding the audience with symmetrical shot after symmetrical shot compliments of the Overlook's architecture. The sensation is like watching a story told through a series of animated religious paintings. Symmetrical. Unnatural. Something isn't right.Then the film moves outside for a sudden contrast in shot composition ? the climax. Frequently reduced to a mere silhouette, Jack races through the creepy foggy atmosphere on the cold snowy landscape in an asymmetrical frame. Here we observe a contradiction of expectations - these exteriors in the bleak snowscape feel less empty and less isolated than the interior shots of the Overlook as if the hotel were a vacuum.Unnatural.Dreadful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant direction from Kubrick and superb acting from all involved can't save a lame script. Nicholson is indeed amazing in this role. But really, that is the best thing going in the film. Kubrick gives us an eery palate and innovative camera angles and pans to create a strong feeling of disconnected isolation. He squeezes everything he can from the material but the screenplay is ponderous, at times sleep inducing. Everything in this film is predictable as every plot element is telegraphed from beginning to end. Little tension, no suspense. The characters have no depth and no spark as they leadenly plod through their preordained roles. By the end, you just go "that was it?" Why anyone thinks this is a great film is beyond me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails a little for a horror flick, but still a pretty good job by Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard many claim this to be a failure, either due to it straying too far from the book(something that apparently ticked King off, though he wasn't the first writer to be less than satisfied with Kubrick's adaptation of their work) or due to Kubrick's love for setting a mood and building atmosphere ruining the scares, at least if you're into sudden shocks, gore and stuff like that. Personally, I don't care too much about the source material... of course, that's probably due to my distinct dislike of Stephen King. But a good story is a good story, no matter who or where it came from. And the better part of the good story here may have come from Kubrick, and it may have come from King. I don't really care. I will admit that the film does fail in some areas, though, as a horror film. The scares are not as constant as they feel they should be, and the film only really works on the atmospheric level. The atmosphere and mood is great. No doubt about that. The film has a nice mysterious feel to it, nothing is explained in too much detail. The story is pretty good, as well as thoroughly interesting and involving. I saw this film once before, years ago... and even though I didn't understand too much of it, I liked it a lot. Particularly because of the story and the atmosphere. The plot is very good, interesting and involving. The pacing is quite good, there are only a few scenes where you're somewhat bored. I believe this is mainly because Kubrick wasn't too used to horror movies... or maybe his approach to the genre just wasn't the best. Through his career, Kubrick went through just about every single movie genre, often only making a single movie in each genre. That might be the reason some of his movies(this one and Full Metal Jacket, mainly) aren't as good as his better movies(A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove). The acting is good, though it can be argued that the two leads, Nicholson and Duvall, overplay and underplay, respectively, at times. The characters are well-written and credible, though it can be argued that some of them are a little thin. The special effects are great, and still hold up today. All in all, a pretty good horror film, and a very good Kubrick film, but definitely not for all tastes. I recommend it to fans of Kubrick, atmospheric horror films, atmospheric films in general, and possibly fans of the actors involved. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, well I am 14 and me and my 11 year old brother decided to rent the Shining and watch it last Saturday night. My 8 year old sister Rachel and my 2 half sisters Emma, 5 and Ashley, 17 watched it with us. None of us had seen it and we thought we were in for a big fright! Throughout the whole movie, Emma and Rachel kept asking us when it was going to get scary!!!! There was not one scary thing in the movie! We laughed more than anything!!! When we started watching it we wern't sure if Emma should watch it with us, b/c she might get to scared, but she and Rachel just laughed the whole time!!!! The movie was not a bit scary! We watched Urban Legends after the Shinig and it was 100% more scarier!!! I thought we were going to be in for a HUGH scare with The Shining, and I was SOOOOO dissapointed! Usually, ever more scares me, but not this one! I even got scared at Alicia Silverstone's True Crime but I was not the least bit frightened at The Shining and neaither was Landon, Rachel, Emma or Ashley! It was more funny than anything!!!Much Love ** Alexandra</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Adaptation of a Stephen King Novel Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be Stanley Kubrick's worst film since "Barry Lyndon" (sorry I haven't seen "Eyes Wide Shut"), &amp; certainly the worst adaptation of a Stephen King novel EVER. Kubrick has changed the entire focus of the story from a "haunted house" story, to the story of one man's trip into insanity (especially since Nicholson had just won an Oscar for "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Kubrick's egotistical attempt to make it his story and NOT King's is epitomized by the changing of the room # of the "lady in the tub." The topper was the killing of the cook Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), Danny &amp; Wendy's savior, moments after his arrival. At this point in the movie, my wife had to restrain me from leaving the theater (opening day).My recommendation: Read the Stephen King novel (one of his best) or see the Steven Webber/Rebecca DeMornay TV mini-series, but AVOID "Stanley Kubrick's The Shining" (it certainly is NOT "Stephen King's The Shining") AT ALL COSTS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, even boring. At best an overly dramatized faux documentary on domestic violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love That 70's Show, probably the best comedy series ever in TV. Each one of its episodes, specially that on Halloween, when Eric tries to scare the guys telling them one ghost story; but then a deadpan Fez says: "When I was six, the mayor of my town was hanged from a tree. Your story is not scary". That's how I felt after seeing TS. Years ago, a similar massacre occurred in this city: the police was called to an apt. were a man was stabbing his whole family. When they arrived they found a small boy shaking, terrified, half naked, in a balcony, where he had taken refuge; the only survivor. The truly terrifying news came later when it was revealed that, up to then, the murderer was the most loving, caring, father and husband. He had just flipped off from one moment to the next. That's why--as a horror story?this film was ruined from the beginning. As some have already said, Nicholson's casting did it--and that demented grin during the car trip didn't help. From that moment on the mystery was gone; and what's left of a horror movie when it becomes predictable?? Later, when we are walked around the hotel we already know that that would be the maze in which rooms, halls, corridors the beast would stalk and haunt his prey, his wife and son. And all what's left when they are finally left alone: to see how the drama unfolds; and also a chance for Kubrick to make instead a faux docu on domestic violence. Which he did at the end. Because don't tell me that all those lame ghosts served any purpose at all (did they?) or that Niagara of blood coming out of the elevator for that matter. No, we all know--Kubrick, the actors, us--that we focus will be from then on the incoming explosion of violence from the part of a deranged man against his family. The rest is red herring, filling material. But wait: this isn't even a family! Remember the beginning in TTCM, when the 5 kids in the van pick up a nut? Now, imagine there's just one woman in that vehicle, with her son, and she picks up the bum and makes him drive. That's how that car trip feels like, with Jack as the bum. Technically the film is impeccable. As always, Kubrick shows here his passion for the visuals, the magnificent sets, the vast spaces, the sumptuous halls, which serves--so he seemed to think?-to mask his inability to give human features to his characters--the only exception being when victimized, as it's the case with Wendy. Anything else is intolerable to him. See how the only character showing generosity, courage, is murdered just as he's about to become active in the plot. That's no coincidence: such an individual is intolerable for the misanthropic Kubrick. He must disappear; he can't be allowed to be part of his world. (And no wonder he gives so much camera time to men like Jack Torrence, Sgt. Hartman; he allows the actors to chew every bit of scenery as they correspond well to the image he has of mankind). And he couldn't help either concerning his hatred for blacks and women. Like he did in FMJ. According to a reviewer quoting Nicholson, he used to verbally abuse Duvall, to the point of bringing her to tears. Not to mention that gratuitous, disgusting--rather than horrific--bathroom bit, which constitutes his Poe moment (and a delight for a psychoanalyst). Concerning blacks, he prematurely killed Hallorann, as said, even a the price of such an absurdity as having a psychic capable of sensing danger from a thousand miles being unable to detect it at three feet away; and the use 3 times in a dialogue of the N word, for no reason whatsoever. At the end, Kubrick is all about visuals, facades, scenery, as that's all he got for the showing, nothing else: just empty shells. Now, there are two mighty annoying things about this "Kubrick Is a God" cult. The first is that, while its members claim to be so open minded and smart as to thoroughly understand each one of its films--and get every nuance, symbolism, subtlety--on the other hand they are so closed minded and intolerant as to feel free to gratuitously insult all those who disagree with them with comments like '"I can't believe there's anyone who didn't love this film" or "If you didn't like it it's because you are not smart, or for your personal hang ups". That's pure self-aggrandizing, pretentious, garbage. The second thing is that, while there's much talk here about the symbols and hidden meanings in his films, no cult member seems to be able to decipher those symbols and codes. For ex.: what's the meaning of a ghost in bunny suit doing a sweet job to a businessman ghost in a film about a man who goes berserk and murders his family? If someone is able to explain me that maybe then I could start taking seriously all the pompous babble (BTW: the back to back Kubrick reviews is just a coincidence, not a project I'm into; and I'm not even a King's reader).Conclusion, for a pathological misanthropist as Kubrick was the horror genre should have been a second nature; yet that wasn't the case after all, no matter what KIAG say. At the end, a simple plot with so many useless distractions in its way. 4 on 10, only for its (dubious) value as documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If The Shining were about camera work and atmosphere only, it would rank with Kubrick's best, which is to say about as good as the movies get. To Kubrick's hand-held camera and cinematic imagination, the hotel's vast empty corridors and adjacent rooms become a labyrinth of horror in which evil of any kind might emerge. Only The Sixth Sense, of recent vintage, comes close to capturing the same spooky anything-can-happen atmosphere of the Shining's Overlook Hotel. If the film were about script only, it would still rate an arguable 5 stars, as Kubrick &amp; Co. substitute mood and spectral apparitions in place of the book's hokier parts, such as flying topiary. Nor do I think the film is overlong, since a leisurely buildup is essential to the crashing, mind-altering climax.But this is not the early Kubrick, the sure-hand behind Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, or 2001. This is Kubrick in decline. A director who either cannot or will not control the wild excesses of his celebrity-star Jack Nicholson in the film's pivotal role. In a part that fairly cries out for sublety and nuance, especially in limning the descent into madness, we get instead a leering, smirking self parody of an actor obviously wallowing in a chance to pull out all stops. And who can believe that that dreadful mood-killing line, "Here'sss Johnny!" is actually in the script. Rarely has such a grossly self-indulgent performance been allowed to reach the screen in unaltered form. And for that, there is only Kubrick to ultimately blame.I realize I risk offending Nicholson's legion of fans for whom this "cool dude" can do no wrong. But the fact is he traded in his acting credentials soon after Cuckoo's Nest for the easier road of self-parody, in which the silk purse of Five Easy Pieces becomes the sow's ear of the typical Nicholson Role. I care because in more disciplined hands - say an Anthony Hopkins - this could have been a great movie, instead of the artistic irritant it finally is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, Stanley Kubrick is a better director than most, but........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never understood why everybody thinks Stanley Kubrick's movies are the best thing since sliced bread. Though I loved Clockwork Orange, and I thought a couple of his other films were okay, I don't think he's worthy of the slobbering worship he tends to get.While I'll grant to Stephen King's detractors that he isn't the most sophisticated writer in the world (there are only so many books about writers that take place in Maine that one can stand, correct?), however, he knows his genre well, and knows how to touch your deepest sense of foreboding. The Shining wasn't anywhere near close to his best work, but the novel was LIGHT YEARS better than this movie.I wasn't going to bother with the mini-series remake of this flick, because I've felt that when Stephen King puts his sticky fingers on film adaptations of his books, he ruins them (there are perhaps 4 exceptions)...but I wanted to see Steven Weber go from his goofy Brian Hackett persona on the sitcom "Wings" to Jack Torrance. I was thrilled. The mini-series was far superior to the crap version that Kubrick produced for the big screen.Maybe it isn't so much Kubrick's directing skills (I like the way shots are set up, I like the contrasts...his style really is maverick), perhaps it's his screen writing skills that should be called into question. He had a hand in development of the screenplay for the majority of his movies...maybe that's where it all breaks down.Kubrick's the Shining was marginally average. By no means brilliant, and certainly not scary in any way, shape or form (not to mention a far cry from King's book of the same name), the acting didn't impress me a whole lot (don't even get me started on Jack Nicholson - who plays the exact same character in every bloody thing he does...though I must admit that I liked Chinatown). Its saving grace was Kubrick's directing style (if not his directing talent, per se), and a pretty original bent by King on the typical yawn of a ghost story upon which Kubrick loosely based the movie.4 stars, 5 yawns...Take my advice: if you haven't read the book yet, read that first, then rent the TV mini-series, THEN rent this one. But don't expect to be scared, not even mildly. At most you'll probably just be annoyed that you wasted one of your Netflix choices on this clunker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A successful comedy, unfortunately by accident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, if only because of its absurdity. Stanley Kubrick showed, as in 2001, that he can take a great story, and basically ruin it. Critics applaud everything he does, only, in my opinion, out of respect for such magnificent efforts as Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Dr. Strangelove, and Full Metal Jacket. He added so much pointless stuff to this story, that I had to stop taking it seriously. I'd heard such great things about this movie, and I have applied my Taxi Driver theorem, named after Scorcese's Taxi Driver. If a great director does a movie, and it's extremely odd, and has a lot of stupid, quirky, just plain weird things in it, the critics will applaud it's genius, out of a fear of being called stupid. The critics were probably afraid to admit that they just plain don't understand the movie, so they praised it in a way calling anyone who doesn't understand it stupid. Unfortunately, no one will admit when a great director makes a mistake, so this has gone down as one of the greatest horrors of all time. I, personally, couldn't stop laughing the entire time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* 1/2 out of ******SPOILERS** Just by reading my headline summary of The Shining, I'm guessing there are going to be a lot of fans thinking "Oh, it's just another average Joe out there who just doesn't 'understand' Kubrick and his films." Okay, I suppose I could take a pretentious insult like that. But what I do understand is that from the opening scenes, this movie reeks of filmmaking incompetence. You can clearly see, during the aerial view of the car heading towards the Overlook Hotel, the helicopter's shadow on the bottom right-hand side of your screen. Even worse than that has to be the clear view of the helicopter blades on the top of the screen during the first shot of the hotel itself. I seriously doubt Kubrick and company filmed this intentionally.But, seriously, The Shining is easily one of the most overrated movies of its genre. I'm a huge fan of horror, moreso than the average viewer, but I can't see how so many people could back a movie that's obviously second-rate on so many levels. As anybody who's seen the movie knows, it's based off of Stephen King's popular novel (To be honest, it was never really one of my favorites of his, though still a decent book). Jack Torrance (Played by a hilariously overwrought Jack Nicholson) is a struggling writer who takes up the job as caretaker of the luxurious Overlook Hotel for the winter, along with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and young son, Danny. Unfortunate for them, a blizzard holes them in and Nicholson starts to grow insane.Not much of a plot, is there? Truthfully, I'm not one of those people out there who believes in strict adherence to the source material. If a movie can diverge from the book it's based on and still come through as grade-A quality, it's got my respect. But Kubrick doesn't just diverge, he leaves out major parts of the plot completely. No back story is offered about the hotel and why it's haunted, there's not even a slight hint given as to who Tony is, the imaginary boy that Danny speaks to. There's a big difference between trying to scare the audience with the unknown and just totally alienating the viewer by not explaining a thing, and this movie accomplishes the latter. And I do believe that this movie is called The Shining, which is the name Scatman Crother's character gives for a certain telepathic power that Danny has. So how come this power is of very little consequence to the plot? The only time it's really intentionally used is just to get someone over to the hotel, and if you've seen the movie, you'll know how pointless that was.I can just hear the fans clamoring that the success of this movie has little to do with King's original plot, but Kubrick's direction. To that, I can only laugh. Oh, it's not like he doesn't try to give the movie a foreboding atmosphere or a stylish look, it's just that he kind of fails in these regards. The ominous aerial shots, a little cool at first, grow a bit hilarious after the fifth time it's done, especially with the banging music playing over the background, as if to remind us "Brace yourself for the horror to come!"Kubrick also relies heavily on long tracking shots, a la Brian De Palma. Initially, it works in creating the sense that this hotel is indeed humongous, but I pretty much got the point after the first hour. Kubrick continues these shots incessantly throughout the ENTIRE film (148 minutes!), with almost no end in sight. Even De Palma would have known when enough is enough.When it comes to this movie's running time, two-and-a-half hours doesn't seem all that long compared to some other King films (The Stand, Storm of the Century, and The Shining remake). But Kubrick paces this film at the speed of molasses, making sure that everybody says their dialogue as slowly as possible, making sure that his camera catches as much of the hotel as slowly as possible, making sure...you probably know what I'm trying to get at. There's a difference between deliberate pacing (2001, Kubrick's real masterpiece) and simply being boring and talky, and The Shining is most definitely the latter.And it's not as if though I can't appreciate a slow build-up, but as I said before, this build-up isn't particularly well-done and every time a certain segment gets interesting, Kubrick cuts away and kills off the momentum by introducing each new part with silly subheadings like "The Interview," "A Month Later," and "Tuesday." It's funny that I hear complaints about the subheadings for Sphere ALL the time, but never once for this film. I don't know about you, but a subheading like "The Interview" hardly sounds foreboding or preparation for the horror ahead, and I very much doubt Kubrick intention was to throw us off guard from the "horror" with such a workmanlike heading.Kubrick's ideas of pay-off for a slow build-up aren't very inspiring. We get a naked woman in a bathtub who then becomes a naked, old woman standing out of that bathtub. She cackles like a witch at Nicholson, and then Nicholson proceeds to...back off slowly. This isn't a particularly ambitious ghost, since it seems entirely content with just cackling. Still, this is the only real scene I can think of in which Kubrick actually utilizes the whole "haunted house" motif which, by the way, is considerably more interesting than seeing Nicholson go insane.When that does eventually occur, Kubrick decides to film virtually all the chases OUTSIDE the hotel. I mean, this hotel is like a huge mansion, a perfect opportunity for cat-and-mouse chases, and like much of the film, the potential is once again wasted. The chase outiside in the hedges isn't bad, but the outcome was never in doubt.Now that I've bashed Kubrick's filmmaking, it's on to the performances. WIth three principal actors for the majority of the running time, it's important the acting is very good. Too bad it's not. Jack Nicholson's overacting is so ridiculous, it would put Charlton Heston to shame. Hell, there's not even an attempt to make us sympathize with Torrance's plight. Shelley Duvall registers pretty badly as his wife, not quite as awful as I've heard, but she's pretty damn annoying. The kid who plays Danny never seems like anything more than a child actor trying to act disturbed (For better peformances with similar themes in mind, watch the far superior The Sixth Sense and Stir of Echoes). Scatman Crothers is easily the best of the cast, but (spoiler) he's only here to give the film a body count. It's almost as if though Kubrick thought he would lose the audience's attention if he didn't try putting in a visceral kill scene, and it's hard not to lose respect for him for doing that.The Shining, bad as it often is, still has its moments (Since it's directed by Kubrick, how could it not?). The scene where Shelley Duvall flips through hundreds of papers stating the same phrase is a real spine-tingler, the only scene that's remotely frightening. When it's hinted that something evil lurks inside room 237, it makes for a fairly creepy scene when the kid stands right outside that room's door (Of course, when you find out what's inside, it's hard not to be a little disappointed). But considering that a big deal is made out of this room, it's more than a little annoying that no explanation is given for what happened inside. The score, overdone as it may sometimes be, is still pretty decent and probably scarier than almost anything else this film has to offerSo, I suppose that's all I've got to say about Kubrick's rendition of The Shining, a movie which could have been so much more but ended up going nowhere. There was, of course, a remake, most of which I've seen, and yes, I liked it considerably more (Though it has been five years since I've seen that version). For a film that combines the talents of Stanley Kubrick, Stephen King, and Jack Nicholson it's hard not to be disappointed with the outcome (I will make explicitly clear that none of this is really King's fault, considering he wasn't all that pleased with Kubrick's film itself and that he had nothing to do with the making of the movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK film but a poor horror movie with awful acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "A Clockwork Orange" things did not go so well for the great Stanley Kubrick. He was blamed for violence allegedly incited by "A Clockwork Orange" so he had the film pulled in England. His pet "Napoleon" project got canned after much effort in pre-production, which prompted him to make "Barry Lyndon" as a consolation substitute. After many arduous and expensive months of location filming, "Barry Lyndon" flopped both critically (not unusual) and commercially (which was unusual for Kubrick). Kubrick badly needed a low-risk hit movie, particularly in America, to raise his stocks again with Hollywood. "The Shining" was that movie, and was indeed a hit in America.The trivia section mentions that Stephen King was surprised that Kubrick was sold on the first chapter of the novel, since the first chapter was atypical of the rest of the novel. It certainly contained no real scares. However when you consider the above background, you can sort of understand the novel's appeal to Kubrick as a film adaptation. The first chapter describes in great detail the layout of the hotel, in which almost the entire snowbound story takes place, as well as the seething writer's anger at being questioned about his struggle with alcohol and his personal failures (poignant for Kubrick?). Here was a film which could be shot entirely in the studio (low risk, low cost) using a small, relatively inexpensive cast featuring a well-known star (Nicholson) with whom Kubrick had wanted to work for some time. This allowed Kubrick unprecedented and relatively inexpensive scope for his notoriously excessive re-shoots. It was also based on a best-selling book, thus drawing in the numerous Stephen King fans. The hotel's long empty passageways also gave plenty of scope for Kubrick's trademark tracking/zoom shots down the length of long symmetrical corridors, while Jack Torrance's mental disintegration allows Kubrick to use his other trademark, The Glare.As a gadget freak, Kubrick generally had a technical innovation in almost every movie. In this case it was the Steadicam, to which he had been introduced several years earlier. The stairwells and carpeted corridors provided a perfect opportunity to use the Steadicam on previously "impossible" shots, and some shots (e.g. the Big Wheel ride over the carpets, or the staircase ascent preceding the Dog Man) seem to have been included purely to show off the capabilities of his new gadget.Yet in focusing on the technical appeal of this project, Kubrick lost sight of one important thing - he has no understanding of the horror genre, and thus doesn't have a clue as to how to make a scary film. Though the film is reasonably interesting and absorbing, there are only a couple of even moderately scary scenes in the whole film. Nicholson's acting throughout is outrageously hammy, Shelley Duvall is monochromatically hysterical and tearful for too much of the movie, while the child actor does as well as you can expect a 5 year old to do, which isn't very well at all. Kubrick apologists try to claim he wasn't trying to make a scary film, that he was actually commenting on the role of television, or the plight of the Indians (or some other barrow the apologist is pushing) in the guise of a horror movie. However when Diane Johnson was given the job of co-writing the screenplay, Kubrick told her to make it "completely scary". So they failed to achieve their goals.The film is justly famous for the ambiguity of its plot. At first Kubrick repeatedly implies that the ghosts are merely imagined for most of the movie, then only towards the end suggests they are capable of action in the physical realm. While this gets the audience discussing the movie, it is also blatantly inconsistent. Likewise with the film's punchline suggesting Charles Grady, Delbert Grady and Jack Torrance may or may not have previously been there and may or may not have been the same person. There is a point beyond which the shifting of perspective turns from tantalising ambiguity and fascinating puzzle into annoying and unsatisfying confusion. Kubrick's extra edits for the 2 hour version seem to remove a great deal of clarifying information, and accentuate this confusion further. I don't know if this was dome out of incompetence or a love of confusion. Either way it's not impressive.In short, this is an unsuccessful Kubrick film, but nevertheless a moderately entertaining one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great horror story from Stephen King is given the Kubrick treatment here, which results in sheer brilliance, only weighed down by a confused storyline. The story has not only been adapted but also it has been manipulated by Kubrick, giving the film an uneasy ambivalence, especially at the end. Other than the screenplay, the film rarely faults, and it is always intense and intriguing to watch, even when one does not understand. Technically, it is an ultimate horror experience, with a rather sterling production design and excellent cinematography. Great sound effects and an underplayed haunting music score are able to create an astonishing atmosphere that is perfect for the film. Also generally well acted and rather well directed, it is a shame that the screenplay lets a bravura horror film down, even if it is still excellent nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've recently gone back to look at films that terrified me in my youth, to see if they still have the effect on me. The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, The Shining, The Exorcist are all films that aren't any good once you get out of childhood.Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrence in Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's masterpiece The Shining. I can only think of one positive thing in this film, and that's the fact that it's still psychologically scary and disturbing to this day, even when I'm in my twenties.However, Kubrick changes way too much from the novel for this film and you can tell that he was re-writing the script during production. I re-watched a lot of Nicholson movies over the years and realized something... Nicholson is playing Nicholson. He's never playing The Joker, or Jack Torrence, or anyone else but himself.I am not convinced that Jack Torrence is a sane man at any point in this movie. In the car on the drive up to the Overlook Hotel, Danny (Danny Lloyd) says, "it's okay mom, I know all about cannibalism, I saw it on TV." Jack retorts this with a creepy, "see, it's OK, he saw it on the television." This just speaks out to me that the hotel didn't turn him insane, he was already insane.Stephen King's version in 1997 fixed everything that was incorrect in this film, which is basically 98%, I'd say.First, Jack's alcoholism is all wrong in this film. He didn't break Danny's arm in the past, he breaks it while at the Overlook. He was fired and not allowed to teach due to the assault incident at school.Secondly, Jack and Stuart Ullman in this film seem like old friends, but in the novel and Stephen King's miniseries, they loathe each other.Thirdly, in Kubrick's version, it takes about 20 minutes for Torrence family to be alone in the hotel. But, the pace in Stephen King's allows for it to come more gradually and this succeed in convincing you that Jack Torrence slowly turns evil.Fourth, in Kubrick's story-telling Jack kills Dick Holleran. But in the novel and King's version, Jack sacrifices himself to get Dick, Wendy and Danny safe.Fifth, Danny's imaginary friend Tony is not a, "little boy who lives in his mouth." Tony is actually Danny all grown up and just talks to Danny giving him advice.Sixth, in Kubrick's version, Jack Torrence's boiler responsibilities are basically omitted. Wendy (Shelly Duvall) is shown doing something with the boiler once just before Jack wakes up from a nightmare. In King's version, it's the boiler that ends up killing Jack.Seventh, there was no hedge maze, it was hedge animals. They attempt to attack Danny, but Wendy saves him by coming out to check on him.Eighth, Wendy in Kubrick's version has a rocky relationship (to say the least) with Jack. Jack seems to not be able to stand her presence. In one scene, he tells her to don't come into the room ever again, using profanity. Plus, in the book, it's mentioned Wendy is a blond bombshell (supermodel looks). In King's version, Rebecca DeMornay is a better Wendy, not just because she fits the profile in appearance...but her character seems stronger. In Kubrick's version, Wendy is described as a ghost and horror fanatic, yet, Shelly Duvall spends most of the film being terrified of everything and Jack, as well.Ninth and finally, Kubrick screws up the storyline of Delbert Grady. He is acknowledged at the beginning as a previous caretaker with his name being Charles who killed his family and committed suicide. Yet, when Jack meets him later on, he says his name is Delbert Grady and not Charles. In King's version, Grady storyline is correctly done and Watson is the one to explain it.It is all these problems with the changes or omitting of things, that allow me to dislike the film along with Jack Nicholson's horrible and unconvincing portrayal of Jack Torrence. It's horrible acting for Shelly Duvall and the overuse of her being scared and screaming about everything is also another reason. I will give it one point increase due to the fact that it's what caused me to be afraid of my bathtub or anyone's bathtub whenever I went over to someone's house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can people love this bastardization of such a wonderful book?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read people praise this movie over and over and I just don't get it. Where do I even begin??? Let's start with the hotel itself. Stephen King based the Overlook on the Stanley hotel. This hotel doesn't begin to compare with the majesty of the Stanely. It's just UGLY!!!Then there is that ridiculous hedge maze. It was supposed to be topiaries!!!! Wendy, Wendy, Wendy........ What can I say? I would have killed this mealy mouthed, butt ugly, whiny woman long before he did. She is supposed to be portrayed as a strong, vibrant, beautiful woman.And then there is Jack. I agree with another reviewer in that this man was insane long before the hotel got ahold of him. Jack was a man who struggled with his inner demons and looked at this job as an opportunity not only to write his play but to mend his family after his alcoholism had nearly destroyed it. There is no visible internal struggle shown in this movie whatsoever!!!! He rolls over and embraces the madness of the hotel with open arms. NOT SO MR. KUBRICK!!!!! There is deep inner turmoil going on inside this man who is fighting for his sanity and his family. All that is lost in this movie completely,Finally, all the little details that finished this movie off for me. The murdered little girls.....???? What the h-ll???? Where did that even come from? This boy talking with his finger? Jack freezing to death in that stupid maze??? Dick Hollorann dying?? I have only one question, why would any director take on a novel to movie project and the proceed to tear down EVERYTHING the very audience that its directed at loved about the book to begin with?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be the most overrated movie in the history of film. I just watched it for the first time, expecting the best of the best, and it was quite a letdown. The sets and music are great, of course, but Kubrick seems to have forgotten one very important thing: to make a horror movie horrifying, you have to have likable characters. That way, when bad things start happening, the audience feels for them.What we have here, however, is a documentary on the most dysfunctional family in the world. Isn't this supposed to be about a loving husband and father who goes insane? Jack Nicholson is brilliant at portraying total insanity, but there's no gradual shift into at all. He looks like he's about to snap from scene one. His wife is a whimpering, nervous wreck who does not seem to trust him at any point throughout the movie. And the kid, Danny, is just a weird little nut. Who can identify with these people?Another major problem is that there is no clear storyline here. The whole first half of the movie is about the kid's psychic abilities, and then it does a total switch and focuses on Jack Nicholson being crazy. What was the point of spending all that time on Danny? It seems like it is foreshadowing something, but it never amounts to anything. I guess Danny is the first one to see ghosts in the house, but that is not a big enough plot point to spend the entire first half of the movie on.Other than some incredibly creepy music and sets, there is nothing really scary in this movie. It is fun to see Jack Nicholson ham it up, of course, but there is no scariness involved when you spend the entire movie waiting listlessly for him to pick up an ax, rather than being shocked when he goes from lovable to psychotic. Instead, he goes from obviously-wanting-to-release-a-ton-of-built-up-aggression to psychotic, which is extremely inferior.6/10 stars, and that is being generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was Stanley Kubrick doing directing horror?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The suspense was ruined scene after scene by bad editing. Jack Nicholson was never credible as a sane Jack Torrence. This should have been billed as "loosely inspired by Stephen King's The Shining". Left out the topiary (a very important aspect of horror in the book) and what's with the repeated shots of the elevator of blood? I think the ONLY reason this has gotten decent ratings is because it has Stanley Kubrick's name attached to it. If it had the director as Alan Smithee, I doubt it would have gotten above a 3 rating. If you want to see a very faithful adaptation of the novel, rent the mini-series Stephen King's The Shining. Shelley Duvall (an accomplished actress) was reduced to a whimpering, sniveling extra. And, what's with the finger "redrum"?!? In the book... Tony lived in the back of his throat, not in his finger. About the only thing worth watching in this movie is Scatman, even though they changed his role quite dramatically from the book. This movie appears to have been made to show how insane Jack Nicholson can act, as he is really about the only thing featured in the movie. Those that rated it well, obviously never have touched the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful adaptation of a terrific--and terrifying, let alone actually scary--book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King felt pretty happy about the adaptations of his first two books, Carrie being mirrored perfectly by Sissy Spacek in De Palma's 1976 classic and 'salem's Lot being fairly okay on TV in Tobe Hooper's 1979 adaptation. However, when Stanley Kubrick, one of the biggest and most famous directors ever, chose to adapt King's masterpiece of horror and great storytelling, Stephen King became cautious about who he chose to adapt and direct (not to mention how they are adapted and directed)--and with good reason. Virtually the only things in common between the book and the movie are as such: character names and roles, the title itself, and locations. All similarities end right there. Though fans of Kubrick welcomed this so-called "masterpiece" into their already-huge cult of Kubrick movies, fans of the far larger Stephen King world--even after only 3 books at the time--were severely disappointed. How could this movie be created? The characters' attitudes are far different than in the book (Jack Nicholson is an average schmo to start and immediately becomes grouchy, then kookie; Shelly Duvall is an eccentric wife that acts as if she has suffered many years of abuse; not to mention Danny Lloyd's ridiculously ignorant and indifferent and jaded attitude that quickly turns to psychotic episodes). Very bad acting goes into it all (virtually the only case of good acting that shows real characterization, however shallow, is Scatman Crothers as Dick Halloran), and the directing is terrible. Over 12 obvious mistakes occur in this movie, including a clear shadow from the helicopter view of the Rocky Mountains at the beginning as well as a bending baseball bat used by Shelly Duvall on Jack Nicholson in one of many ridiculous conflicts and multiple parts of the door from the famous "Here's Johnny!" scene disappearing in several following scenes. And to top it all off, Stanley Kubrick was so convinced that this...rubbish...was such a good movie that he had a contract made so that any re-makes of the movie could not be released on video in the US. Luckily in 1997 a far more faithful adaptation was made, but unfortunately Mr. Kubrick's legacy of no-US-video had the movie appear only once on commercial television, never to be seen again unless it is on the video available overseas from Amazon.co.uk. This was a terrible scratch in the long film reel of cinema history, and hopefully will be mended &amp; forgotten soon enough. All in all and simply put: this movie sucked. --MetalHorror</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good horror film with a brilliant lead actor and masterful direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, directed by Stanley Kubrick, stars Jack Nicholson as an author who agrees to take care of the Overlook hotel during the winter with his family, but the feeling of cabin fever and isolation, as well as the hotel's demons, start getting to him and he eventually tries to kill his family.I personally think this is the best work Kubrick has ever done. I'm sorry, but I don't find Dr. Strangelove funny at all and all of his other films can be weird and make no sense sometimes. That's not to say it doesn't ever happen in this movie, too (I mean, that's why it's an 8/10 not a 10/10), but it just doesn't happen as much and is put to a better effect.Nicholson was perfectly cast, Duvall's performance was actually quite good and I loved how all of the horror simply came from atmosphere and shots. No cheap jump scares, no clichés and no goofs, just a twisted, creepy, atmospheric story centred on the mind of a future psycho.One thing I didn't like, though (not about the film itself), was that I went and bought the AU DVD of this film, expecting it to be the same as the US version, because I had only heard that the EU version was shorter. Didn't say anything about AU, but expectations were wrong and I noticed about half and hour of some pretty important and good scenes were cut. Lucky I had the US version on iTunes, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I ask the question because the very first thing we hear about the hotel is this shared dramatic roots : the place was a sacred burial ground that has become desecrated for modern life ! There's no doubt that Kubrick was a talented director : The way he shoots this empty, majestic haunted hotel is indeed fabulous ! Usually, when a movie takes place in a single location (ex : « million dollar hotel »), the director pays no attention to it while it's the first character ! Here, we understand the topography, we know the different places so we are really immersed in what happens between the characters. In addition, the sights are totally incredible as well in natural outdoors as sophisticated indoors and i'm really fond of social, collective places becoming desert (ex : a mall like in « career opportunities »)?Now, it's hard to tell if the movie is frightening as i'm an adult, i have read the novel and i have watched it a long time ago ! Actually, the way dark forces twist the family is really original because except for very graphic moments, the horror is mostly verbal and psychological : to illustrate those fears and anguish, I found the cast really talented : Danny plays great when we think how young he was ; His mother was really caring for the whole family and shows resources when needed and Jack was indeed a fabulous puppet man driven crazy ! So maybe the flaw was just him as King told : if Jack is perfect when crazy, he is unfit to play the normal guy : at the start of the movie, he doesn't act like the perfect husband, loving father or motivated employee so we lost his unexpected fall and thus a lot of the dark intensity of the movie?But, after 36 years, the movie doesn't look old and senile and with that late 70s fashion and design, it's still pertinent and a must see movie today !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's terrifying until you realize how ridiculous it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is horror? When you're watching a movie you are not at physical risk. Surprise. The two ways you create horror is by putting in danger characters you care about or planting a story that you feel could happen to you. For me this did neither. The first half was absolutely terrifying. The camera work, creepy music and use of desolate rooms was very effective. Seeing Jack turn crazy is horrifying, especially since Jack Nicholson does creepy faces better than anyone. The problem is, they introduce the shining which is essentially paranormal and very poorly explained, two things that don't bode well. At first, the visions are creepy but as the movie progresses they just seem more and more ridiculous, particularly since they can actually move things. Again, the reason why isn't explained at all making this frustrating to watch if you haven't read the book. A lot of these are introduced but have no closure so I can't help but wonder why were they in there? Towards the end, Jack is hunting his son, which was terrifying, but then it cuts to Wendy seeing visions that were so cartoonish I laughed. Way to kill the suspense. there are three characters in this movie and the only one I cared about is the villain. Wendy and Danny were loathsome so at times I was rooting for Jack which should not be the goal of a horror movie. Also, Jack is constantly complaining about how much he works but we never see him work once. Not only does this devalue the character's arc but it also doesn't make sense. He was given several tasks that he never does but there is no apparent effect on the building which raises the question: Why is he needed there in the first place? Ultimately, this movie succeeded at being creepy for the majority of the movie, but it makes hardly any sense and several scenes kill the tension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining (1980): Dir: Stanley Kubrick / Cast: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers, Philip Stone: Intense shocker about a hotel with a grisly past. The title represents a psychic ability that renders communication through the mind. The Overlook Hotel is closing for the winter months and a new caretaker arrives. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrence, former professor now writer who slowly descends into madness stemming from a child abuse incident involving his son. Shelley Duvall plays his wife, Wendy who remains optimistic until bruises appear on their son's neck. Danny Lloyd plays their son Danny who has the shining and sees visions of murdered twin girls. Scatman Crothers plays the head chef who communicates with Danny through shining and becomes determined to oversee the safety of the boy through a blistering blizzard. Philip Stone plays Delbert Grady, a former hotel caretaker with a grisly past that haunts the hotel. Another achievement by Stanley Kubrick whose brilliance is as fetching as the massive rooms of the hotel. Maddening performance by Nicholson whose caretaker absorbs the hotel in a frozen frenzy. Duvall is excellent as a mother bent on protecting her child. Lloyd uses brains in outwitting his father in the massive hedge maze. Themes of domestic abuse referencing fairy tales and places where the mind and body cease to leave. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, to say at least.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is deemed by many to be the greatest psychological horror movie of all time. The movie really tries to create suspense by long, strange sounds, rather than jump scares. Some of the scenes are creepy only because of the ongoing sounds, the sounds go on for so long you can not possibly know when to wait for the scary part, sometimes there is nothing, and the sound completely fools the viewer.I don't know why, but i didn't really see Jack going insane during the movie, i saw him as an insane person right from the get go, the way he answered questions at the interview was rather strange. Jack never really showed any feelings for his family, obviously right from the start something was very wrong with him.Really didn't like the performance of Wendy, Jack's wife, she was the dumbest person ever, she had no self esteem whatsoever, did whatever Jack told her, he told her to screw off several times and she didn't even care. She was about to get murdered and she is not even smart enough to knock out the wooden frame of the window to escape her insane husband...There were scenes in the movie which were incredibly long, that was not that bad, because some of the conversations were just awesome, for example, Jack talking to Delbert Grady in the bathroom, one of the best conversations i have ever seen in any movie.The ending scene, or rather the picture that was shown, was very interesting, that lead viewers to craft several theories over the years, which, of course, is crucial for the longevity of a movie, if the ending is something you need to think about and you can never really find the right answer, it has been a good ending. Personally, i believe that Jack was the ''care taker'' of the hotel and that was a reincarnation of Jack in the 1920's, since he was in the picture shot in 1920's looking exactly the same as he did 60 years later.Danny was very interesting too, i feel that his ''shine'' attracted the dead spirits, but Danny's interaction with the dead was not as strong as Jack's, really i haven't been able to see the correlation between Danny's ''shine'' and Jack's ability to connect with the dead.If you want to fully understand the story, i suppose, reading the book would be very beneficial, since in the book all the characters are explained in details, however the movie is a good horror classic, quite different that other movies, but i just can't agree with ''the best psychological horror movie of all time'' title people have been giving the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the creepiest horror movies I've seen, a story about the Torrence Family who become caretakers for an isolated hotel. The son, Danny Torrence (Danny Lloyd) sees paranormal images of the hotel's past using a telepathic gift known as "The Shining." The father, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), is slowly being driven insane by the spirits that lurk the hotel, threatening his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and Danny.The creepiness and eerie atmosphere of the hotel gave the perfect setting for the movie, making the audience jump when demonic creatures appear and when horrific events occur. The characters, for the most part, did a nice job portraying their roles, especially Danny Lloyd. His constant shrieking of "Redrum" was enough to send chills down your spine and raise the hair on the back of your neck. Nicholson's portrayal was a perfect blend of insanity and evilness. However, Duvall looked like she was just in a manic state of depression, wimping and whining throughout her role.Confusing in some parts including the grand ballroom and bar scene and spirits' overall purpose in the movie, but it's a good horror film for a scare.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a cut above the rest as Stanley Kubrick re-tells the classic tail of Stephen King's novel. A chilling film which will have you on the end of your seat from start to end. What the film does is that it shows a psychological break down in the mind of Jack Nicholson's character from start to finish. The main plot is simple yet compelling as it brilliantly shows how isolation from the rest of the world can send a man crazy. The reason why you can watch it over and over again because the audience does not know whether some characters like Mr. Grady are real or just a hallucination in the midst of panic and confusion. This is definitely one of my most favourite films by a long shot by showing a real inside into characters minds. One thing I would like to point out is that Kubrick uses the 'follow cam' so well that the scenes with Danny just pedalling around are so airy.I definitely recommend the film for anyone who wants a horror/thriller which can blow your mind whilst it sends shivers down your spine.</fullReview>

It's manly for two reasons.Firstly, I don't like Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyed which are both overacting and underacting unconvincingly and I can't get into their situation. Jack Nicholson is overacting to but he's marvelous at that, this movie is truly entertaining only because of his performance.Secondly, the family don't have any chemistry at all and don't seem to like each other before they get to the house, I would much rather have the family be incredibly loving and supporting why the ending would be much more tragic and horrifying. I can't remember if Jack and Shelley shared a kiss during the whole movie.Beside these two points and the lack of being scared, I liked the movie, with the cinematography and the recognizably Stanley Kubrick direction and especially Jack's performance. I would recommended highly recommend it for those reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shining Analysis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shining is an American film released in 1980, screen played by Stanley Kubrick, Diane Johnson and directed by Stanley Kubrick himself.This film is based on a novel written by Stephen King, bestselling writer and master of suspense books. He has written Dead Zone, Stand By me, and Misery all three adapted to the cinema. Wendy Carlos, Rachel Elkind, Gyorgy Ligeti, Bela Bartok and Krzysztof Lloyd have composed the music. In it, we can hear magnificent melody mixed with rasping noise that we rediscovered throughout the film every time that a character having "The Shining" gets a vision. We find, in this film, Jack Nicholson awe-inspiring in his madness, as well as a young Danny Lloyd demonstrating a rare maturity for a young boy. Shining is completely based on acting. The young Danny Lloyd plays a little boy with "The Shining", this gift is embody in a certain way by an imaginary friend named Tony, who lives in his mouth. Little by little Jack Nicholson let his talent came out, here to play a man with murderous madness. Role that he already played in Milo's Forman film, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest, in 1975. In Shining, as he write his new book, his madness progressed, and the fact that he wants to stay alone tenfold his isolation. This link between his madness and the writing is explained afterward in the film, when Wendy, his wife, discovered that he wrote one and only sentence since the beginning: "All work and no play makes jack a dull boy". New scenes are in this version of Shining, as the one when the doctor comes in the family house to see Danny after his first vision. Which let us see briefly this family's past, mainly Jack's alcohol problem that come back, later, when he moved to the Golden Room's bar of the hotel.Is this evidence in order to put us on the trail of the evolution of Jack's madness?Shining includes a very strong symbolic around the mirror and what is reflected inside, located in Jack and Wendy's bedroom, this mirror reflect an idea of parallel world where this family's story could be totally different.Danny uses this reflection to write on the bathroom door with a lipstick the word: "REDRUM", what gives "MURDER" in the mirror's reflection.This mirror is here as an eye. Several theories are possible.The first one, of a parallel world join the second one, which is the evolution of Jack's madness, saw by his son, Danny in one of his vision. "REDRUM" can let us think of "RED ROOM" which could be a reference to the bathroom of the Golden Room that is red. Where Jack met Grady (the former custodian of the hotel), who helped him awareness that he must kill his wife and his son. This parallel world joins ours when Danny is attacked in the room 237 and Grady opened the door of the room where Wendy succeeded to lock Jack.At the beginning of the film, the labyrinth located in front of the hotel is introduced as an attraction. This idea seems very charming at first, but much less at the end with the famous pursuit. Evidences sown by Kubrick throughout the film leads the viewers to this final outcome. For instance, we could linked the moment when Wendy and Danny played in the labyrinth at the beginning with the picture of Jack who is walking alone in the hotel's corridor and arriving in front of a labyrinth model which shows us the superiority of Jack's madness.Let us return to this legendary outcome in the cinema history. Kubrick had chosen to never show us the position of Jack (relative to Danny) that increased prodigiously the suspense for the viewers. Finally, hundreds of scary films have been made but there probably just five of them that are genuinely creepy. Shining fits alongside of the Exorcist released in 1978 by William Friedkin as the best horror film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favourite Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely brilliant. The great thing about this film is that the film's 'villain' is not a supernatural being, it is the main character himself. Out of all of Stephen King's novels, this is my favourite, and also one of my favourite films in general. The only thing that irritates me is the actress who plays Jack's wife: she seems too passive, even for that character...but that small flaw in an otherwise brilliant film is insignificant. I love the voice the boy puts on for 'Tony' as well, it's super creepy (and I'm not usually a fan of the now-cliché 'psychic kids in horrors).Everything is perfect, and it also is parodied in the greatest Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror episode of all time, 'The Shinning'. Also, the ending is awesome, but I won't say too much about that.</fullReview>

This movie would seriously give me nightmares, and even still, I still force myself to watch it because it is so good. Jack Nicholson is an amazing actor.

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick Confession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Kubrick, I give you a 10+ for this movie because you've cleverly coded The Shining with the Apollo fiasco. I get it. 33% of Americans get it. Evidence which comes into question is overwhelming and to question them is scientific, not conspiracy ! Today's technology ought to be able to verify moon remnants but there is no real rush. Perhaps there is no flag or moon buggy to find. Also, our film cameras of yesteryear and the human body alike must have been Van Allen retardant. Oh how the list goes on. Anyhow, my favorite scene has got to be when Jonny gets up from the launch pad printed carpet and walks down the hall in his Apollo 11 sweater pass the Gemini twins to room 237. How brilliant was that !!! This is what made Kubrick the best at his craft. Attention to detail yet subtle.Chalk this one right up there with JFK my friends."Do something today which terrifies you"Wes Saldua, Seattle</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best horror movie ever. Best use of music to enhance horror, too. Best if watched alone late at night in creepy dark old house with lots of windows and no locks. If you have to watch it with other people, it's still scary. You won't be the same after watching it. So you need to see it again. Eat popcorn while watching. You can throw it at the bad guy like Steve Martin does in The Jerk. And repeat. You've always seen The Shining. Visually stunning. Mesmerizing. Perplexing. Psychological. A social commentary. Scary. Jungian. Freudian. Supernatural. Supranatural. Unnerving. Tense. Horrifying. Worst nightmare come true. Appearance vs. Reality. Interesting, in the best way. And in a way only Kubrick could do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reviewing, After Just Having Seeing It For, Possibly, The 36th Time, Maybe More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King originally got the idea for this story from the story, "Burnt Offerings," written by Robert Marasco and later adapted by Dan Curtis(Dark Shadows)into a movie released the year before King had his novel for The Shining(1977)published. I remember the movie Burnt Offerings well as my parents took me to see it when I was 5 in 1976. The movie scared the living daylights out of me and would haunt me for the rest of my childhood. I think it was 7 years later when I first saw The Shining. As with Burnt Offerings, The Shining made a real impact on me on so many different levels. Throughout the years I would watch this movie over and over again and from the first viewing I had a favorite actor Jack Nicholson. Jack is great, as he always has been, so much so that it his portrayal is iconic. It also gave me a favorite director in Stanley Kubrick. I wanted to see everything both men produced, and eventually would. With all of that said, after multiple viewings I would notice things that I was too captivated to notice before. It is my belief that Stanley Kubrick was the greatest director ever, even if all of his films weren't perfect, as is the case with this. I'm surprised, with the perfectionism to detail that he was known for, that he allowed certain things to show the light of day. The documentary, Room 237(which I do recommend, even if I don't agree with most of it's conclusions)says that these things were intentional. One of these mistakes is the shadow of the helicopter seen in the lower right corner during the opening sequence, which I noticed wasn't in the Blu-ray version. If that was intentional than why was it removed and why would Kubrick want the source of the photography to be shown? As much as I loved Jack in the lead I have to admit that King was right in that the main character is already crazy from the start. The role requires the lead to eventually go crazy but with Jack's devilish smile and eyebrows his portrayal is not totally convincing. I heard that Harrison Ford was rumored to play the part and I have to admit that he would have been more convincing in the role and it would have turned out to be a different movie because we would then never have the quote, "Heeeeeere's Johnny," because it was improvised by Jack. There are other examples such as the obvious editing mistake of the door that Jack just axed through, directing mistake's such as Wendy's(Shelley Duvall great in the role who unfairly didn't get any credit for what she had to go through to portray a character who had to cry for almost half the movie)reaction to Dick Halloran's(the always great Scatman Crothers)bloody corpse, the stairs scene where Jack says, "You didn't let me finish my sentence," when Wendy didn't say anything(which shocks me because I heard that Kubrick had them do that one scene like 60 times?), his use of the skeletons briefly just seemed tacky and other minor things. Going back to the original story; I did eventually read the book some time after having seen the movie a few times, I have to admit. I loved the book and how it showed it's differences between the movie, but some things were better in each. Jack Torrance's obsession with the hotel and his job as the caretaker and it's history is better, but the portrayal of Danny's imaginary friend, Tony, is much better in the movie.If anyone needs any proof of this just watch the remade for TV version of The Shining and tell me i'm wrong. Overall, what makes The Shining such a great and memorable horror film, faults and all, is it's look and feel. The look in the colors, the 80's great film look and the photography, introducing us all to the innovative steadicam that would be copied and become a staple in movies to this day. The way that the camera follows Danny on the big wheel throughout the hotel and through the maze scene at the end are great examples. The feel in the way Kubrick was able to portray a claustrophobic sense that you can feel. Another example is just the overall creepiness and weirdness(the old woman? the man in the bear suit? both great and hauntingly memorable. I would love to have seen in the documentary on the making of the film, Stanley directing the poor old woman in the tub scene. HAHA!!! By the way, what the hell was he on when he came up with the idea and taking it seriously enough to actually go through all the trouble of casting and filming it?!) Also, who can forget the amazing soundtrack?! Like with other movies, especially horror movies(Jaws, Psycho)where would the movie be without it? In this case, as with the two others mentioned, the music is essential and very effective. Say what ever you want, whether you take Stephen King's side or not, this IS one of THE BEST horror films ever made...period On a side note: if you need help in understanding the end I suggest watching Burnt Offerings. Unfortunately most people dislike the film but give it a chance, especially if you like horror films about houses. The movie has a great cast: Oliver Reed, Burgess Merredith, Karen Black and Bette Davis. The novel is good as well but I think the movie would help more to understand the ending of the Shining and of course interesting to see where King was inspired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among some of cinema's most frightening and creepy moments, The Shining includes some of the best and most effective experiences. It is perhaps eternally iconic for watching Jack Nicholson breaking down a door with an axe, shouting maniacally "Here's Johnny!!!" at his family. Everything leading up to that climax, however, is a freaky experience, littered with all kinds of unnatural phenomenon, wicked imagery, and always laden with an unsettling atmosphere. The film becomes a mesmerizing nightmare, which dives into the depths of the human psyche to expose pure madness.This adaptation of Stephen King's novel downplays the supernatural a lot, thus deviating from the source material a lot and just sticking to the basics. There are ghosts haunting the Overlook Hotel, but at times, it's hard to tell if they're really "real" in the movie, or just reflections of Jack's mind.And that ambiguity is part of what makes this movie so great and intriguing; it remains very mysterious and open-ended, offering just enough exposition to build a basic plot, but leaving enough up in the air for all manner of interpretations. You could watch the film and accept it as just another ghost story. You could see it as a psychological thriller. Some people have even read into it and somehow dug up hidden messages of the director's involvement in faking the Apollo moon landings. No matter what you read into it, the experience lends itself to wide interpretation, universally covering terror and fear on all levels.On a micro-level, the story is generally sound, with or without the involvement of the supernatural. The film features a decent cast of characters, and a lot of their issues from the novel (primarily, alcoholism and domestic violence) carry over into the movie. Even though it's not a totally faithful adaptation, the plot is well-constructed. It explores some deep and interesting scenes concerning the horror of violence (whether domestic or in the overall human spirit), madness, and overcoming the ghosts of the past.This film is presented with very strong photography; it makes very liberal use of the Steadycam to beautifully compose the film and conjure very unique imagery. The editing is very good too. Acting in this film can be very extreme and over-the-top; Jack Nicholson's expressions and lines are often so wild that they become laughable, but the menace is still very palpable, and I think it's an awesome performance overall. Shelly Duvall tends to be very weepy, but is still decent. Everybody else does the best they can. Writing is finely-balanced and nuanced. This production uses very interesting and decent sets, props, costumes, and locales. Music is very ominous, adding to the film's atmosphere.The Shining may not be the perfect Stephen King adaptation, but as an exploration of humanity's dark side, it is very effective and extremely creepy. It remains one of my top-favorite horror movies of all time, and as a classic in the genre, everybody should endeavor to see it at least once in a lifetime.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Content: Perfect | Film: Perfect)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I finally got to see Johnny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Some places are like people: some shine and some don't."I'm ashamed to admit that despite being a film buff I never got around watching The Shining. As a matter of fact the only Kubrick film I've seen is 2001 A Space Odyssey, which I thought was brilliant. I tried to watch A Clockwork Orange, but never managed to finish it. I'm not a huge Kubrick fan but I do need to watch his films. The Shining is one of those movies that I wish I would have seen years ago because it really hasn't aged too well and after seeing so many horror films I've realized how much they took from this film. That is why perhaps I felt the film to be very predictable, but there is no denying that this film influenced the horror genre during the last three decades and continues to do so. The film was adapted from Stephen King's novel, a writer which I'm not a huge fan of either (although I loved Misery). I guess that having watched The Amityville Horror before this, kind of ruined the suspense for me, but there is no denying that Jack Nicholson's performance was magnificent here during his psychotic transformation. That "Here's Johnny" scene is such a classic and it is proof that Kubrick knows his craft. He is a perfectionist and it comes through in his direction. The problem I had with this film is that the ghost story really didn't work for me and some of the scenes felt really cheesy. The imagery in this film however is technically brilliant and there is no denying why this film has become a classic.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a failed writer who is trying to find inspiration for his next novel. He is offered a job as the winter caretaker at an isolated hotel in Colorado and he realizes it would be the perfect place for his writing project. He decides to settle in the hotel along with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd) who has some sort of a psychic ability known as the shining. Before the employees of the hotel leave for the winter season they warn Jack to stay away from Room 237 where a terrible murder took place several decades ago. The first person to have terrible visions of the place is Danny, but soon the rest of the family realizes that they aren't the only ones in the hotel. The place begins to take its toll on Jack who slowly begins to go through some sort of transformation that puts the life of his wife and child at risk.The Shining sets a perfect background for a horror story and Kubrick takes advantage of the screenplay and gives us some spectacular visuals. The symmetry of the images, the inclusion of the color red in most of the scenes, the impressive and claustrophobic maze and hotel corridors set the tone and mood of the film. My main issue had to do with the ghost story and the entire "shining" thing with Danny. Narratively speaking the film has many flaws, but technically it is very well crafted. The only performance I enjoyed here was Jack Nicholson's, but the rest of the cast wasn't really up to par with the movie. I do have to admit that the soundtrack was thrilling. If you leave out the entire ghost thing and realize this really has to do with how isolation can often turn into madness you will appreciate Kubrick's work even more. However, as a horror film this really never managed to scare me or make me feel uneasy so it doesn't really succeed in that level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is in my opinion a very good one. Not only does the movie entertain you for the whole period in which you watch it, but it also makes you think quite a few days about it after the end. I have to say that what some regard as continuity errors I regard as Kubrick's genius. This means that all the disappearing furniture and impossible architectural layouts are meant to disillusion the viewer and to give the hotel a truly alive character. I must admit that I am a big Jack Nicholson fan and this movie does not disappoint. Thus, it is just normal to say that all cast members played beautifully, creating a true psychological thriller. Summing up, I think that the movie overall is OK, but it would be unfair to give it ten stars(reserved IMO for the Godfather etc) because it simply can't live up to those standards. P.S. There is however a minor glitch at the beginning of the movie, where you can see the camera helicopter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw The Shining I was about 13 years old. I remember that I didn't quite understand it at that time, and therefore it didn't get under my skin. At that time I was expecting non-stop gore and fun. I gave the film a try some years later still remembering how disappointed I got the first time. So I turned down the lights, gave it a second chance, and then something new happened: The film crept up under my skin, freezed my bones and scared me halfway to Hell.What works for me is the intensity. The idea of the terror happening inside the family's safe borders is truly horrifying. The atmosphere is highly unpleasant all the way through, and the fact that you never know what is right behind the next corner, is pure psychological terror. The scenes where Danny rides his tricycle through the huge empty hallways still gives me the chills.Furthermore I always get amazed by the acting. First of all I must mention Shelley Duvall. Usually frightened performances on film is extremely hard to do in a convincing way, but Shelley puts so much fear and desperation into Wendy that you truly believe in her all the way. Little Danny Lloyd is perfectly casted. His performance as the little, lonely boy is amazingly played with a perfect touch of melancholy. Jack Nicholson is, well, Jack Nicholson when he plays a psychotic maniac, but his presence in this film combined with some insane dialogue makes it even more intense.So as you can read, I am a huge fan of The Shining. What you can expect from Kubrick's version is a tour de force of psychological terror. Sure there is some gore, but the focus is on the psychological.</fullReview>

A movie that changed the landscape of horror and fear, something beyond modern day horror, Kubrick knew what he was doing with this masterpiece as it presented horrifying, riveting, and over the top symbolism and diction of moral themes such as racism, ghost, death, psychology, and characters losing whats in a humans pure sense of mind. Wendy and Jack are put through hell in this movie and the acting given by Shelley and jack to display pure madness is done with perfection. The acting is amazing;this movie is extremely psychotic; its horrific and terrifying; this movie had no jump scenes yet it succeeded to present a creep hellish atmosphere. In my opinion this is the best horror movie of all time alongside Halloween (1978) its true state of the art horror at its best. For those youngsters or new generation horror fans take time away from paranormal activity, hatchet, those shitty remakes (not the good remakes) and watch this it could never be remade its horror at its best, its "the tide of terror that swept the nation"...</fullReview>

I am still waiting for a horror movie that has plenty of scares while following a great storyline but this movie did alright. Had a great storyline but a bit too few scary moments.Credit to Danny Lloyd who played the son, Danny Torrance. This kid man, this kid can act!! His voice changed, his concentration was superb, his acting and lines were delivered fantastically well! Stanley Kubrick knew that he had talent. I can't imagine anyone at this age acting any better for this character.I would recommend it to movie buffs who have a love for movies like I do. People who enjoy browsing the history of movies and how they were made back then, especially as it is a classic! The Shining is just an iconic movie in the horror departmentIt was a fantastic movie as there was so much suspense involved! I mean you have a vacant motel, so much you can do. The acting was great, the terror and fear shown by the wife felt real! The twins, the room 237 and the kid really added to the chills in this movie. Great overall movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything is perfect about this film. the shots, setting, story line are all fantastic. But what makes this film truly great is the character Jack Nicholson portrays. The film effectively is the story of this man slowly losing his mind to the spirit of the hotel. As well as being a great idea for a film, this idea is executed perfectly through fantastic directing and acting. The film is successful in bringing its terrifying but somber feel to the audience, which in turn connects the audience right into the story line. It's story line is so immense, that every time I watch, it gets harder and harder to understand, as it's all about a psychotic man smothered in isolation.It's worth saying again; even if you do not like this genre, you must admire the pure class of the acting in this film.

		<fullReview>What does the Shining mean? You have to watch the movie yourself to really know, but once you do it will blow you away. This is quite simply the best horror films of all time. If not, it is the best movie i have ever seen in my life. From the beginning, the plot is pretty simple. Jack Torrance (Nicholson) becomes the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel for the winter. The owner of the hotel says that the previous owner went crazy and killed his entire family. Torrance disregards these facts and says that he will be perfectly capable of being the caretaker.The great thing about the movie is the events that play out when Torrance and his wife and son become completely alone in the hotel. It is pretty obvious, since it is classified as a horror, that some serious disturbing events are going to take place. The way that it happens is really what makes the movie work. Kubrick uses his spectacular ways to make this movie into a classic. I don't care if it is totally different than the book. A book is not a movie, that is just a plain and simple fact. This movie will still scare the crap out of you whether you read the book or not. Even scenes with just one word will make you jump. If you watch, do watch it with someone else, because you will be talking about it forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is my favorite horror movie ever. Every second of it was perfect. But the acting is what makes this movie great. If they would have chosen anyone but Jack Nicholson this movie would not have made it. Just seeing his face as he descends into madness scared me more than any other horror movie I've seen. It also helped greatly that the person that played Wendy actually looked scared to death. The special effects may not be that thrilling for today's standards, but man they scared me more than today's overrated special effects. The plot actually isn't that hard to understand. A man takes his family to a remote hotel to work as a caretaker in the winter while everyone else is gone. But when he gets there the isolation slowly sends him spiraling into the depth of madness. And his wife and psychic child have to fend for themselves. The scariest thing in this movie is the complete feeling of isolation. How they have nowhere to run and the only means of escape is a big snow cat thing.(not sure what it's called) If you like horror and want to see a movie look no further than the shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King meets Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King wrote the Shining intending for the main character, Jack, to be a completely normal man with a wife and son who is hired to be the caretaker for the closed Overlook hotel for the winter. The hotel causes him to slowly lose his marbles. Therein, lies the problem. Jack Nicholson is McMurphy from One flew over the cuckoo's nest the instant he appears on screen. The same wicked smile and look of someone not quite all there in the head. Kubrick chose the wrong actor this time. Jack hears the legend of the previous guy who watched over the hotel and went postal and killed his entire family. He does not believe it. His wife, Wendy(Shelley Duvall) and son Danny(Danny Lloyd) arrive and a black cook, Dick(Scatman Crothers) is able to communicate with the little boy telepathically. He explains to Danny that he has always had this ability and calls it the shining. He warns the kid to stay out of room 237. Of course, curiosity will cause him to check out room and he sees a dead woman there but keeps it to himself. The visual highlight is a large and intricate hedge, beautifully landscaped into a maze where Danny and his mother explore.Meanwhile, Jack suffers from writers block, typing over and over, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy; the author is clearly losing it. King used his own periodical droughts as inspiration for this element. Danny continues to have visions of doom and frantically writes redrum on a mirror while daddy dearest transforms into Paul Bunyan/Ed Mcmahon, and swings an axe at a door barricading his wife while screaming, "here's Johnny," a typical family dispute.Danny uses his esp to send an sos to Dick the cook and you will have to watch the movie to find out how it ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Stephen King's adaptations (Kubrick at his peak!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This masterpiece adaptation of Stephen King's "The Shining" novel is a work of genius that takes us into a journey to the realm of horror with a twist of insanity. Jack Nicholson was the best choice to play the role of Jack in the movie; Jack's character evolves and the story unfolds beautifully from a calm cozy winter in the isolated hotel into a crazy nightmare full of terror. The camera work and the wide angles used during the filming makes the audience feel the depth of the surroundings and the characters all together. "The Shining" is a real turning point in the history of Horror/Drama genre that lead the way for many Stephen King's adaptations to the big screen using somehow some similar methods (Pet Sematary is one of them). Stanley Kubrick's work was not really praised by Stephen King at the time, and this is why Stephen King re-shot his own version (mini series) which was also a very good adaptation; but nothing supersedes Stanley's version in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not the large things that send a man to the madhouse. Death he's ready for, or murder, incest, robbery, fire, flood? no, it's the continuing series of small tragedies that send a man to the madhouse?not the death of his love but a shoelace that snaps with no time left? Charles BukowskiThere is a lot of analysis out there of this film. Every Kubrick film is scrutinized endlessly. If you look for essays about his work, its meanings and implications, you'll have a fruitful outcome. This one in particular has been more dissected than an alien in Area 51 (before all the "respect the alien rights" activists started fussing around). Jonathan Romney believes it to be "an Oedipal struggle not just between generations but between Jack's culture of the written word and Danny's culture of images"; Bill Blakemore thinks it is all about the Indians: "The Shining ends with an extremely long camera shot moving down a hallway in the Overlook, reaching eventually the central photo among 21 photos on the wall. The caption reads: 'Overlook Hotel-July 4th Ball- 1921.' The answer to this puzzle, is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re- embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries".What I really think it is about? A man whose wife drives him crazy.When Wendy enters the room where Jack is typing, I start to empathize with him. She asks if everything is okay. She is sweet, affectionate, loving and caring. Don't you just hate that? Don't you just feel like bludgeoning her to death with a rusty lump hammer or maybe cut her in little pieces with a fireman's ax?Her pale sickly skin, horse teeth, oily hair, her puke-provoking sweetness, aren't those reasons enough to not only wanting to hurt her; but just bash her brains in, right the f*** in? I'm not saying those motives would suffice in a court of law, but they might give the judge some pause.After I established that the movie premise has nothing to do with Indian massacres or oedipal struggles I'll start the movie analysis in itself:t.co/AUv6aBuJ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Horror's in Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's adaptation for Stephen King's "The Shining" is at least a top 3 Horror movie for the genre. It features some truly chilling and scary moments for movie history. (Major Spoiler) Two of my favorite were: the revelation when Wendy Torrence comes upon the writing, "All work and no play makes Jack a Dull Boy" confirming Jack's insanity, and the deal Jack has with the Grady ghost which frees Jack Torrence upon his word that he will be murdering ("correcting") them. The real element that molds this movie is a terrifically creepy soundtrack replete with creepy and lurking thematic music throughout. Combine that with strange Hotel decor, and the murders and histories of the past - and Kubrick achieves spookiness. The ending is marvelous, and the photography stunning. The performances by especially Nicholson and Shelly are first rate. I generally am not a big Horror fan as it is certainly difficult to take most horror movies seriously, but this gem of a production is different. It is one of Kubricks better movies, and a fabulous production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of both Kubrick and king. so i had to read this book before i saw the movie and they have absolutely nothing in common. the basic storyline is the same, (Danny has the shining, he sees dead people and jack goes crazy)but there were a whole bunch of things i saw in the movie I didn't read in the book, and i read a lot of things in the novel that i didn't saw in the movie. does this means The Shining is a bad movie? of course not. does anyone complains because "les fils del homme(look it up at wikipedia)" is different from "The Godfather. NO. and thats because they are different kinds of art. and they are both a masterpiece. Stephen king is a terrific horror narrator, he makes you kept me reading on for hours. Kubrick if probably the best director EVER, he made up a whole different story but HE DID IT RIGHT. he gave his touch to the story and made a masterpiece, the most influential horror movie since psycho. so both the book and the novel are masterpieces in their respective fields. cant we just leave it this way?</fullReview>

All in all a classic movie, and unlike many of its era it doesn't seem dated, and has one of the most famous lines in the history of cinema.Its not really a horror story, but see it first time, and it will make you jump.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining involves two big names : one author, Stephen King, the other: Director Stanley Kubrick. Stephen King, the master of horror genre and Kubrick, a crafty director have created this horror The Shining.An aspiring writer, Jack Torrance (played by Nicholson) signs a contract to supervise a hotel in the winter. He wanted solitude for a few months to complete a novel and some income as well. He comes with the family (Wife and son). The son, possesses psychic abilities to see the past as well as the future. The hotel acts as a person who is possessed and after just over a month Jack loses his mind and decides to kill his family. What happens after that forms the climax of the movie.There are many things to look out for in the movie. Kubrick films are known for their technical brilliance. This movie is no different. Camera angles to sound recording, everything is rich. And a brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson. For any movie in the horror genre, music plays a very important role. The music director scores a perfect 10 in his scores !Should be in your must-watch list if you are a horror genre fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finished seeing this movie at 2am. So I need not say it gave me quite a fright. Stanley Kubrick once again proved his inimitable mastery at film making with this film. Even though the movie deals primarily with paranoia and clairvoyance, it also makes subtle references to child abuse.Jack Nicholson never ceases to amaze us. His portrayal of the insane father is one of the backbones of the movie. The slow build-up of the plot showing ghastly forebodings ensures that the audience stays glued to the screen till the end.Many of the scenes in the movie like the outburst of blood from the lift, and Jack's insane smile through the split open door lingers in your mind long after the movie is finished.The Shining is clearly horror films at there frightening best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heeeeeres a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is one of the best horror films ever made. It's a classic and will remain timeless. The thing with Stanley Kubrick films is that after viewing them you seem to view the world sort of differently when you come out of the film. You start to see things from a different point of view when you watch another film. He truly is a one off director and this will remain as one of his best films!One of the best aspects (there are many) about this film is the directing by Stanley. He manages to build up a chilling atmosphere to a masterful affect. He makes us as the viewer seem as isolated as the characters through the ominous tracking shots of the long isolated hallways, the large echoes in the halls and the sublime mountain landscape which almost seems to be devouring them up. It is a truly chilling masterclass in how to direct a horror film! Some scenes create a choking atmosphere and an uncomfortable feeling towards the suspenseful dialogue, it's just genius! Some of the cinematography is beautiful.Also arguably the best aspect is the performance by Jack Nicholson. How did he not win an Oscar? He wasn't even bloody nominated! This will remain as one of the unanswered wonders of the world. The sheer anger of his character shoots through every last inch of him! He puts his heart and soul into the film and makes up for the hilariously bad acting from Shelley Duvall. Poor Shelley, she makes the film seem quite funny when it's obviously not suppose to. Her acting is atrocious and just pretty darn funny! (Something she'd say) but like I said, Jack does more than make up for her weak performance.Stanley's script is great! Instead of just copying the book, he takes the story and makes it his own vision. He leaves more questions to the viewers to answer, making them think and care about the characters. The screenplay is effective, inventive and very tense at times. Most importantly it's suspenseful and makes everything count! He also makes good use of symbolism and could be analysed in a way such greats like "Black Swan" could be analysed."The Shining" is also quite creepy thanks to Stanley's masterful directing. The ominous tracking shots of Danny on his trike, the weird unexplainable images and an atmosphere that really cranks up the terror. If you are a lover of films, then you should be able to appreciate everything that is good in "The Shining". Aside from it being exciting and creepy, it's also really well-written and directed to perfection. Go watch!</fullReview>

The clever cinematography and directing by Stanley Kubrick is hard to pass by, he really made me sit on the edge of the couch asking thousands of questions as soon as the credits went by, and if you're good at putting things together you might notice that this movie's imagery symbols something completely different than it appears.. The scariest thing however is the amazing soundtrack, largely dominated by the master of atonality; Krzysztof Penderecki, and really confirms the psychological tension and disturbing imagery throughout the film.

		<fullReview>I wouldn't call it a "horror" movie. It is one of those tourists run into slashers movies. Pretty well made, not a high budget venture, but not a "B" movie either. Horror and thriller movies can be very very effective, without such over the top, extreme, excessive sadism, torture and gore. Tarantino is a one-trick pony -- only going for shock value in his movies that have no other redeeming qualities whatsoever. Please tell me what's actually good about his films. I really wonder what goes through the guy's mind when is in the "creative" process... "Let's see, the goal of this movie will be to get people to barf while they're sitting in the theater." Brilliant.What's the point? Quentin Tarantino is a useless "film-maker". While writer/director Stan the Man Kubrick takes bits and pieces from other films like the American tourists ("An American Werewolf in London", "Eurotrip"), the Hotel ("Psycho"), the wax museum ("Tourist Trap","House of Wax"), the body parts ("Body Shop"/"Dr. Gore"), and sends this "entertainment" to you, you have some real problems. This movie strikes me as the kind of thing that would be enjoyed by someone who gets a real kick out of those disgusting videos that have been coming out of Iraq. Rent Saw instead.Moreover like in "An American Werewolf in London", there is some dark humor. However, If you are a real horror fan, then wait for the directors cut. Also if you are a new horror buff, check out any Alfred Hitchcoke film and see where it all began.If you decide to see it in the theater be warned that what ever you do, don't eat popcorn or anything during or before this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to "The Shining"'s Overlook Hotel ... such a scary place ... such a scary face ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" is a movie that impresses by its extraordinary ability to scare the hell out of you. You may say that this is the basic premise of a horror film, but believe me, it's not that obvious. When you expect to be scared, you kind of mentally prepare yourself to be shocked at any moment to minimize the impact. In the case of "The Shining", a movie I've seen multiples times, no matter how long I keep my guard up, the movie gets me every time. And this is all to the credit of Kubrick's perfectionist direction, a gift that includes a very accurate casting instinct : four important characters in the film, all of them perfect."The Shining" is adapted from Stephen King's novel of the same title, and you can tell that the author has a strange fascination for claustrophobic places, as it seems to provide resourceful elements to thrill you and keep your heart literally hooked, always expecting the worse to invite itself. And that's understandable in a very basic level, if you find yourself in a closed place, you can't escape, this is the basis of "Alien", "Das Boot" and many other thrilling masterpieces. But in "The Shining", although the hostility of the environment is very well suggested by the shots of the long and tortuous road leading to the Hotel, and the cold winter that blocks the way, the horrifying element of the location is still kind of diluted in its vastness. The Overlook Hotel is so big that the places where to hide are countless. So, the plot needs an extra push to increase the Hotel's level of scariness, and though I concede the script is not the movie's strongest asset, it gets us prepared in a relatively good way, giving away the "terrible secret". The former family who kept the Hotel during the summer was brutally killed by the father before he shot himself to death. This doesn't seem to distract Jack Torrance, the new inhabitant, played by Jack Nicholson, on the contrary, he finds the anecdote quite amusing.The film doesn't embarrass itself with subtleties. From the start, we kind of expect that Torrance will be victim of the same Syndrome that lead to this bloody murder, his eyes are already telling something, as if Jack Torrance's personality had a parallel predisposition to be victim of the disturbing atmosphere governing the Hotel, and Nicholson's unique talent to embody evilness with one grin and one hell of a hypnotic stare. Torrance's eeriness contrasts with the sweet motherly naivety of Wendy, Shelley Duvall in a performance I consider among the best female leads in a horror film, and the innocence of their little boy, Danny played by the namesake actor, Danny Lloyd. The last thing we precisely learn in the first act, is about Danny's strange ability to telepathically communicate. He's got the shining, a supernatural power he shares with Holloway, played by the late Scatman Crothers. We understand that this shining will play a significant role to the plot, while surprisingly pleased by the return of the unforgettable orderly Turtle from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" who doesn't open the window this time, but close the last door letting the Torrance family on its own. Now, we have all the parameters, the movie can start.And the least we can say is that we're quickly plunged in one of the creepiest and most uncomfortable atmospheres from a movie, beautifully embodied by Kubrick's direction. The cinematography is efficient, powerful, and not restrained. "The Shining" looks, sounds and plays like a horror film, Kubrick doesn't transcend but he doesn't cheat either. Take the subliminal appearances of the twin girls, reminiscent of the same hallucinatory images from "The Exorcist", the iconic torrential waves of blood splashing, the long bicycle ride along a never ending floor, not to mention the famous scene where Wendy finally discovers what Jack was writing all this time, and I can go on, and on, Kubrick's touch is omnipresent in the film, and his nomination to a Razzie is a joke. There's a perfectionist feeling that makes the aesthetic of the hotel, scary in every single surface of it. The bar, the bathroom, the room, everything exudes a kind of hostility, that you wonder how you can spend months and months without getting alienated by such a place, as it happened for Jack.But I don't think "The Shining" is nuanced enough to invite for an analysis about Jack Torrance's evolution. One could go on about dehumanization, being trapped in a place and letting your evil side influence you, I think the movie just delivers the premise of a great horror film and it works thanks to the characterization of the good guys. Danny is sweet and Wendy so genuine, so loving and caring for Jack, we can't not to root for them, and wish for them to leave this nightmare. Because this is a nightmare, when someone you love is eager to kill you and it's almost impossible to kill, even to hurt him because of self-preservation, while survival instinct commands you to escape but you can't. "The Shining" is as nightmarishly captivating as Jack is perfect, his face when he opens the door with the ax, is not the scariest moment but surely the most iconic, although for me, fear and panic have never been more perfectly incarnated than by Shelley Duvall's disfigured face while screaming and begging. This was realistic in its touching ugliness and the best pay-off of Kubrick's infamous perfectionism.And the climax is probably the best you can expect from the genre, so full of thrills, and some "what-the-hell" moments forever graved in my memory ? "The Shining"'s flaws are simply irrelevant because you know you just watched a great horror film, when your sensation at the end is relief ... like when waking up from a nightmare ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mismatch of style and content</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is characteristic of Kubrik's slow, almost glacial, cinematic rhythm, with events unfolding over a long time scale. This worked magnificently well in 2001, but even by A Clockwork Orange was beginning to become a mannerism. The drawn out nature of Barry Lyndon is one of the points against it, but it could be argued that such an approach works better in a horror film like The Shining where anticipation really is half the fun.Kubrik has a painter's eye for details such as colour, texture and lighting and all his films are visually stunning, The Shining (and the equally flawed Barry Lyndon) being no exception. Some scenes are breath taking and the overall look and atmosphere of the film is exceptional.However these atmospheric sequences are used to cover deficiencies in the plot. Nicholson goes from normal (as normal as he ever is) to hallucinating nut in one quick step. It all seems too easy. Some schlock horror clichés (creepy twins, dead bodies, rivers of blood) are no substitute for what should have been a subtle and gradual descent into madness.Without that psychological subtlety, the film becomes a series of familiar horror scenes: An 'old dark house'; a man who turns up to help only to be brutally killed; a final conventional chase. We've seen it all before and it is not surprising that the original audiences and the author himself were unimpressed.Another issue is the music. We are used to Kubrik using classical pieces in a new and unusual fashion, the blue Danube during a space flight, for instance, or the Thieving Magpie during a fight. Here, he merely selects a series of creepy and atmospheric pieces in the hope they will impart creepiness and atmosphere to what would be very ordinary scenes. In effect, Kubrik piggybacks on the work of the composers.Kubrik even recycles the scrunched-up face close-ups from A Clockwork Orange too, with less purpose here. It does not help that the kid is not much of an actor, but he is not to blame really, since no child deserves to have the full weight of a film placed upon him. But Shelley Duvall's performance is truly awful, so wooden that I can hardly believe it. Scatman Crothers puts in the best turn, but is sadly not in it enough to make a difference.But then perhaps we should not be too critical of Duvall, being as she was, required to act scenes over and over while Kubrik tries to realise the vision of clinical perfection he was apparently aiming at.This is certainly the work of a great artist in decline.</fullReview>

Frankly put, never have I seen a better acting in a horror movie before and I miss the loss of this classic era of horror movies. This movie is so amazing that it feels to be completely dreamlike, ghostly and totally physical, psychological at the same time. There is no explanation of what is behind all the trauma and emotional scarring.You are just swayed to the facades of human psyche that make you question the sanity of a normal person. this movie gives you a hangover you will not forget.This movie is the Godfather of Acting based Horror. Shelley Duvall has so perfectly acted her part of a doomed wife that for the first time I noticed a Jack Nicholson 'reign' (acting wise) in his movies got overpowered by a costar. Watch this movie not as a challenge because you may easily sit through it, but as a fan of Classic Horror..the horror the way it should be. i am damn sure you will love the the way the movie transports us to such notoriousness,for the camera movements so impeccable for that age that it almost feels to be a smooth ride to..death. This is the first time that apart from screeching and screaming, the full fledged background music has played a crucial role, almost like in a 'Horror musical'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant cinematography and production design</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American exile in England Stanley Kubrick shot all of his films in England from LOLITA in 1962 to EYES WIDE SHUT in 1998. Here was a man who created New York on a Pinewood back-lot (EYES WIDE SHUT), 1970 Vietnam on the Isle of Dogs (FULL METAL JACKET), the Pentagon War Room at Shepperton Studios (DR STRANGELOVE) and prehistoric Earth and the solar system at MGM Borehamwood (2001).The Overlook Hotel exists nowhere other than on the sound stages of Elstree between 1978 and 1979, where Kubrick filmed the whole movie. It's to this remote and very large American hotel that husband and wife Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall (and son) arrive to caretake for the winter shutdown. Jack goes mad, sees ghosts and eventually tries to murder his wife and child - only to end up frozen in the snow covered outdoor maze.Whilst everyone eulogises Kubrick's fine direction, the real strengths of the film are Roy Walker's production design and John Alcott's remarkable cinematography. All of the sets are huge and empty - the corridors, the lounge, the ballroom suggesting a hotel in winter hibernation. They're all brightly lit by Alcott, forgoing the cliché that horror best works in darkness.Nicholson's overacting in the later scenes and the lack of much humanity in Kubrick's screenplay are perhaps the two flaws in a film which still stands up well 31 years after its release. Two scenes stand out: the haunting image of Nicholson striding across the ballroom floor and it's full of the ghosts of 1921; and the final chase through the eerie and beautiful snow-covered floodlit maze.David Thomson, in his Biographical Dictionary of Film, calls THE SHINING "Kubrick's one great film". Nowadays regarded as a classic of its kind, back in 1980 it failed to receive a single Oscar or BAFTA nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's best horror.....Kubrick's only horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick turns his ever-precise eye to Stephen King's novel, and although far more a supernatural horror than the familial psychodrama King intended, the film stands alone as an absolute masterpiece (and ironically far more exciting and memorable than King's own mini-series adaption). Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrence, a writer who takes a care-taking post at The Overlook Hotel for the winter period; he is intent on using the time to get a new writing project underway. After moving in, it quickly becomes apparent there is something wrong with the hotel, and its effect on Jack is apparently to drive him insane and desperate to destroy his family. Shelley Duvall and young Danny Lloyd play wife and child with nowhere to go.Kubrick is a filmmaker's filmmaker, and as is nearly always the case with his work, one of the biggest stars of "The Shining" is the man's technical brilliance and desire to push the envelope. From the famous, grand shots at the beginning (it has been difficult ever since to see epic aerial landscape photography without being reminded of the opening of this film), to some of the best steadicam work you will see, even when compared to the movies of today, it is a cinematic tour-de-force. Kubrick's attention to details whose job it is, if only on a subconscious level, to put you constantly on edge is rather impressive; before the production, he read Freud's essay "The Uncanny", about the feeling of something being uncomfortably strange whilst remaining familiar, and was intent on working that theme in at many a turn. What better film to work it into than one about the man who is supposed to love you wanting to murder you? Not a frame is wasted, and rarely is a moment not visually arresting, tense of unnerving, due to unique framing, lighting, or noticeably exciting camera language. The result is a movie with numerous iconic scenes and startling imagery. The soundtrack also might just be one of the most jarring and haunting in horror cinema; dense, loud, dissonant strings and found sounds shred regularly at your nerves. One of the film's best moments combines all the above, and may leave you with nightmares of little boys muttering "Redrum" at your bedside...as if kids doing strange things wasn't creepy enough! This is a film you may find you do not love immediately; as always with Kubrick, there is a lot to take in, and the sense that he is making the film to be interesting rather than necessarily realistic is never far away. Detractors of the film cite the over-the-top nature of Nicholson's performance to be one of the issues they have with it, but I think Kubrick knew the absurdity of the character, the dark humour played against the isolated horror setting, would really accentuate the pressure, discomfort and sense of entrapment, with nobody else to turn to, Wendy and Danny are suffering. After a few viewings, "The Shining" should start to reveal itself to you as the masterpiece it is.Far more Kubrick's than King's, and his only horror film, this still retains its status as one of the best-made of all time. He never did things by halves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My personal favorite film of all time, the Shining will shoot fear into your heart like a bullet. By far the most intelligent horror film ever made. The story of a man's descent into madness when he brings his family to caretake a hotel sounds somewhat simplistic, right? Wrong. Stanley Kubrick creates a strong tension in the film, especially when young Danny Torrance runs into some unexpected visitors in the hallways of the massive "Overlook Hotel." Jack Nicholson's psychotic emotion will make you want to run away from your television's screen. Though the film does not completely follow the original Stephen King novel, I assure you, it is just as good if not better. If you haven't seen the Shining, you haven't seen a true horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slowly becoming a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the mid-90s I was fascinated by the Danish TV series The Kingdom. The story happened in a hospital which was a labyrinth building that played an active and determining role in the action - a structure built on unsafe ground claimed by ghosts and haunted by crimes of the past. I had discovered a great and original director named Lars Von Trier. Now 15 years later a discussion on the Internet list doubled by the coincidence of the screening of The Shining on ARTE-TV reveals me what may have been one of the sources of inspiration of Von Trier.The film is an adaptation of a book by Stephen King, although the writer had many reservations and critics about Kubrick's version, who took the characters and the basic story but moved the emphasis on what seemed to him to be more relevant and expressive. As in a few of King's other novels the principal character is a writer who hides in the mountains in order to find the tranquility for his creation, and finds horror instead and the tranquility and power of nature becoming soon a threat. Kubrick was no strange from the recluse position, as a few years before the making of the film he had retreated into an isolated house he had bought, actually starting a personal evolution towards the image of the great director with sparse output he took in the last decades of his life. The frustrated writer story is however only the surface, as we soon get into a much more complicated epic with multiple layers of horrors and incertitude, where family relationship drama, ghosts, haunted manors, supernatural powers interleave and place the viewer in the situation of never being sure from what perspective the story should be considered. The answer is that it is probably about all of these and more that would be revealed when thinking about the film after the projection or seeing it again.Jack Nicholson plays the lead role and this is one of his powerful creations in a type of roles in which insanity takes control not only of the character but also places under question the sanity of the whole world around him. The question critics asked was whether his stronger than life acting did not shadow completely the other actors and characters. His partner in the film is Shelley Duvall, an anti-Hitchcock female character (opposite to Hitchcock's blond and beautiful heroines). She was so overwhelmed by the work with Kubrick and Nicholson that her career crashed after this film. The musical score is dominated by Gyorgy Ligetti's Lontano but also includes other significant excerpts from Berlioz (directed by von Karajan) and Bartok. It is however the exceptional cinematography that makes this film unforgettable. As the hotel isolated in the mountains and cut from the outer world by the winter storms plays a central role in the action the filming of the deserted rooms in the huge and empty hotel (when it does not become populated by ghosts) provide the opportunity of an aesthetic exercise which is valuable in itself, but together with the acting and the music provides one of the most consistent visions in any horror movie I have seen. Always on the edge with technical inventions Kubrick used here the Steadicam which allows for a stable holding of the camera with unusual angles to film the kid running though the endless corridors from the lower angle of his toy. The effect is amazing.The initial reception of the film by critics was rather negative, adding to the cool reception by King. Themes like alcoholism or the disintegration of the family were considered as downplayed. My opinion is that they are there for anybody who wants to interpret the story through one of these angles but they are not the only ones possible. The very last sequence changes the perspective and provides a very different reading through which the film can be seen, one that has hints planted in some of the previous dialogs and situations. The presence of the native American as 'true owners' of the ground where the hotel is built is also mentioned in several sequences and provide an alternate reading. As time passed this film (which was also a commercial success from start) started to gain critical acclaim and gathered interest from aficionados of Kubrick and of the horror film genre. I had seen it for the first time only now but my impression if that as with many other good films it gets better at each viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining Shines!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As entertaining as horror movies are nowadays, several of them are much more violent than those in the early years. A perfect horror film doesn't need gore, sex, or a guy with a knife, although many directors have been able to do something original in their films("Scream," and Saw" being prime examples). All you need is a great cast, the right director, and the ability to create unbelievable suspense and tension. "The Shining" defines what a perfect horror film should be.Jack Torrance has been assigned the job of the caretaker during the snowy winter at Colorado's prestigious Overlook Hotel, and he's lucky enough that he gets to take his wife Wendy and clairvoyant son Danny with him. While they're snowed in for months on end, Jack gets to work on the book he's been writing while Wendy keeps Danny occupied. But Danny has other things on his mind. His power of "the shining" distracts him from his family and leads him to discover the many secretive horrors of the hotel, including the death of the previous caretaker and the murders of his family. And how come Jack's been behaving so weird lately around his wife and son? Everybody knows that "The Shining" was based on the bestselling novel by Stephen King. The 1980 film version only sticks very loosely to the book, but the obvious changes director Stanley Kubrick makes in the story enhance the film in its own way.You know right away that the Torrance family has domestic issues, since Jack takes the job while he's still in minor recovery from his emotional alcoholism. So when he begins to lose his mind, you don't know whether to think that the horror of the film is Jack's psychosis or the haunting of the hotel. But knowing that this family is far from safe right from the opening shot makes you all the more scared for them.Kubrick's direction gives the film a tremendous atmosphere. Even the tiniest details can give you the shivers, whether it's Danny riding his bicycle over the wooden floors of the hotel or the immense size of the hedge maze outside of the hotel. The bicycle scenes, especially, find some way to freak you out. The sound effects of a wheel meeting a wooden floor and then tracking over a carpet over and over again sends you a message that something isn't quite right. Kubrick's camera angles also tell so much. Watching someone walk through the hotel from behind gives off a message that we're being followed, and nothing is what it seems.A tremendous sense of claustrophobia is felt throughout the film as well. The Torrance family's cabin fever scares us more than it scares them since we are snowed in with them for the entire film, and there's no way to get out.Filmmaker John Carpenter, director of "Halloween," once said that the horror films he makes are usually about the area in which you are set. The Overlook Hotel is, of course, key to "The Shining's" effect. As you continue to watch the movie, you realize that it almost feels as if the hotel is watching and waiting for you, and the hotel's appearance becomes just as creepy when you feel that it becomes a major character in the film.The performances of the cast are a huge highlight of "The Shining." Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance has become a bigger role for him than that of his Oscar-winning role of McMurphy in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," mostly because he's just so damn terrifying. People don't know whether to believe if his performance is over-the-top or if he's not acting. Whatever it shall be, Nicholson scares you plenty. Shelly Duvall does a wonderful job as Wendy. What an actress! She doesn't even have to mutter a line of dialog. Her facial expressions tell you everything. The look on her face during the "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" scene is probably just as frightening as the moment itself.In the end, what hasn't been said about "The Shining" that hasn't been said already? It is one of the most disturbing and nightmarish horror films ever made, and one of the most quotable ones. Rob Zombie says "You meet so many people who say 'Nah. I don't really like horror movies. But they always love 'The Shining.'" That could be a fact. It's not only a flawless exercise in terror, but just a flawless movie. Period.P.S. I don't know what's scarier. Those two creepy-as-hell twins in the hallway or Jack Nicholson bursting through a bathroom door with an ax, howling with maniacal glee "HEEEEEERE'S JOHNNY!!!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most frightening movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been like 6 years when I watched it just one time, but still thinking of it makes me shiver. Maybe I was too young back then, maybe not but it gave me nightmares for two weeks at least. It is not a typical horror movie, sure there are little ghost girls in the corridors but that wasn't the scariest part, just a start for what it is going to be. I can't praise enough Nicholson's performance on this movie. Usually in this kind of movies I don't even care that much if the "good-ones" survive if it's poorly made, but the Shining really made me squeeze my pillow on the couch and hoping them not to get murdered by the insane father. The true meaning of horror. I haven't read the book, I don't dare, this was scary enough. Maybe some day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Kubrick Masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick, co-written with novelist Diane Johnson, and starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd. The film is based on the novel of the same name, by Stephen King, about a writer with a wife and young son who accepts the job of off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel. The son, who possesses psychic abilities, is able to see things in the future or past, such as the ghosts in the hotel. Soon after moving in, and after a paralyzing winter storm that leaves the family snowbound, the father becomes influenced by the supernatural presence in the haunted hotel; he descends into madness and attempts to kill his wife and son.Atmospheric horror, superb background sound-effects, top notch performances by veteran actors Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall and Scatman Crothers and the best child actor I have seen to date: Danny Lloyd.Danny is simply gorgeous all though the film. At such a young age his acting is phenomenal. He is shoulder to shoulder with the big names in the film. The best and most memorable scene in the film is Danny sitting in Jack Nicholson's lap, having a father-to-son conversation.Jack Nicholson who portrays the writer and ex-schoolteacher, gives a professional performance and thoroughly gets into the act. The character he portrays literally undergoes a transformation before your eyes. He is complemented well by Shelley Duvall who plays the wife of Jack's character. She portrays a simple housewife who passes her time with household chores and taking care of their only son. Danny Lloyd who plays Jack's son is simply a joy to behold throughout the film. The role fits him like a glove and his acting is simply phenomenal. Not to forget to mention Scatman Crothers who always gives his best to us. He is a born actor and his presence on screen is very powerful. The film really clicks into gear when he and Danny have a personal conversation about the Overlook Hotel over some ice-cream. And it is here that he mentions about that very special gift: The Shining....Overall 10/10. Add this one to your DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Horror from One of the Greatest Filmmakers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as he'd made his mark on the science fiction genre twelve years prior with 2001, Stanley Kubrick tries his hand at horror and suspense, creating a haunting film and an instant classic. Based on the Stephen King novel, THE SHINING follows writer Jack Torrance as he agrees to act as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. He is warned of the isolation and told the roads become impossible to traverse in the overwhelming snow. Seeing an opportunity to work on his latest piece, he accepts and moves his wife and son to the Overlook with him for the duration of his stay. Jack's son, Danny, has a special ability referred to as the "shining". He possesses psychic abilities that allow for telepathic communication with others who "shine", and he is able to view images from both past and future. As the winter snow arrives and the family is effectively trapped in the hotel, Danny begins suffering horrific images of the previous caretaker's family (whom had been murdered when the caretaker had succumbed to "cabin fever") and Jack shows signs that he's lost his grip on reality. Soon, Jack is overcome with the inherent evil of the hotel and sets out to murder his family.If there's one thing Stanley Kubrick knew better than anyone, it was how to establish a film's atmosphere. From the first helicopter shot establishing Jack's initial drive to the hotel, we feel a sense of quiet isolation that will build for the next hour and a half as the Torrance family lives in this massive, grand hotel. Vast ballrooms and lounges, seemingly endless hallways, and an expansive hedge maze help make the Torrances seem truly alone as the snow drifts in and soon cuts them off from the rest of society. It's a long build-up, and might be too long for some viewers. The entire movie is almost 2.5 hours long and more than half of it is establishing life in the hotel and slowly developing Jack's madness, Danny's visions, and the hotel's latent evil as more and more strange occurrences plague the child. Once the movie kicks into gear and Jack goes over the edge, we're treated to some of the tensest and chilling moments in cinema. Jack hacking his way through the bathroom door while his terrified wife cowers in the corner, strange visions of hotel "guests" (especially the one in the dog costume...gives me chills), and the famed elevator unleashing a tidal wave of blood. You can't go long without seeing an homage to some iconic moment from this film in some other media.Jack Nicholson is at his best here. I can honestly say his role as Jack Torrance is probably my favorite that he's ever held. No one does psychotic better than Nicholson and he goes all out here. Twitching, explosive mood swings, unrelenting violence...he mesmerizes. I could watch the last hour of this film over and over and it'd never grow old. Shelley Duvall is fine as Jack's wife, Wendy. She doesn't do much aside from scream and sob, but I suppose she does it well. Danny Lloyd does an excellent job, which blows my mind because there are so few decent child actors. Kubrick proves his mastery in directing with his ability to get the only the best from a child actor. A solid cast combines with fantastic production design and Kubrick's usual skill to create a great horror film without resorting to the "boo!" scares and gore you'll find most modern horror hinging on. It's slow pacing and haunting atmosphere build up and lure you in for a final act where Nicholson completely owns the screen. I'm sure this movie won't be was well-received by those who demand fast-paced scares and graphic violence, but it's one of my favorites in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good it's scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heeeeeeeere's Johnny?Hollywood that is, and this week I'll be reviewing what is, in my opinion, the greatest horror film of all time: The Shining. Based on the novel by Stephen King and directed by the extremely creative Stanley Kubrick (whose most popular films have featured regularly in 'All-Time Greatest' lists), it is a film that has burrowed its way into popular culture like few others have. Its depth in storytelling not only revolutionised the horror genre, but also gave one of the greatest actors of his generation, Jack Nicholson, the role that would launch him to superstardom and forever define his career.The film revolves around Jack Torrence, an aspiring writer who has accepted the winter caretaker job at the Overlook Hotel because he feels it would be the ideal place to work on his stories in peace. He brings along wife Wendy and son Danny (who possesses a unique supernatural ability to contact the dead) and begins a gradual yet overt descent into madness, assumedly brought about as a result of total isolation and boredom within the hotel. He decides, with the influence of a few deceased hotel guests, to kill his wife and son (you know, to pass the time) and so Wendy and Danny are left to fend for themselves.In a near-perfect film, Jack Nicolson gives an outstanding performance that, if it weren't for Heath Ledger's psychotic portrayal of The Joker (coincidentally, another of Nicholson's most popular roles) would stand alone as the most sinister character in cinematic history. Criticised for overacting upon the film's release, greater research into the character through reading the novel leaves no doubt that Crazy Jack hit the mark completely. In stark contrast, I feel his co-star Shelley Duvall to be the only weak point of the film, utterly wooden in her delivery and just plain unlikeable as an individual that we, as the audience, are meant to feel automatic sympathy for.The unmistakable imagery of the film has contributed to its status as one of the most referenced films in popular culture. The bleeding elevators, creepy O'Grady twins and Jack's face peering through the axed door are easily identifiable even by those who haven't seen the film, but those who have seen it know that these images are merely the surface of Kubrick's multi-layered masterpiece. Perhaps even more frightful are the woman in Room 237, the dogman &amp; his master and the final shot of the film, which induces goosebumps every time I think of it. Considering how crucial the climax is to a film of this nature, Kubrick does not only create suspense and anxiety of the highest degree as Wendy and Danny fend for their lives against their deranged husband, but then he goes and focuses in on a final photograph, which takes everything you've learnt in the last two hours and turns it on its head, inciting an abundance of home- made theories to justify its meaning, none of which have been satisfactorily proved in thirty years. With so much emphasis on the visual imagery of The Shining, something I picked up on during a second viewing was the underestimated use of diegetic sound in the film. I draw your attention to two particular scenes: as Danny rides his trikie around the hotel, the wheels thudding as he moves from carpet to timber floor, and the echo of Jack's typing throughout the grand hall. In both of these instances, there is nothing sinister going on in a physical sense, but the ominous sounds give the viewer cause for concern, almost waiting for something to strike off-screen. This dosen't happen, but foreshadows the evil brooding in the hotel's walls, and fits the tone of the film in a most appropriate fashion.Where the majority of modern-day horror films appeal to a specific target market and apply similar plot and character models with each film, The Shining differs in the way that it has delivered something truly original. A foreboding sense of imminent doom omnipresent in every scene of the film, coupled with Nicholson's immensely enjoyable performance makes this not just the pinnacle of horror, but an excellent all-round endeavour.</fullReview>

It gradually evolves and captures the attention with consummate ease. Stanley Kubrick's masterclass is there to be seen in each and every frame.It's not a typical ghost story that relies on cheap thrills and tricks. It is a classy attempt and a new way of infusing terror into viewers' mind. It tells how human weaknesses can be exploited by supernatural forces. Jack Nicholson has given a legendary performance.

		<shortDescription>Classic horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining (1980) is based on the novel by Stephen King. Director Stanley Kubrick gave us a masterpiece. I like nearly everything about this movie. I remember seeing it on cable TV around 1980 and 1981. This is a different kind of horror movie in that it is not over the top with LOTS of blood and gore and LOTS of killing. Instead, it's a movie that has a moderate amount of blood and killings (with the exception of the scene with the tidal wave of blood), but it's greatest strength is its reliance on atmosphere and the gradual buildup of tension and horror. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) gradually becomes a madman over time. Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) becomes increasingly terrified. Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) is effective as the son that possesses psychic abilities. The story and setting are very simple. The hotel itself seems to be a character itself. The atmosphere in the hotel is eerie with a sense of emptiness, but frightening. There's a feeling that strange and horrifying things are bound to happen in this huge vacant hotel. Again, the buildup to all-out madness is the movie's strongest point.The camera angles that are used at times are very innovative.The best acting performance in this movie was by Shelley Duvall, in my opinion. She was totally believable. Jack Nicholson also gave a great performance.The electronic musical score is great and very memorable. It's the kind of music that crawls under your skin and adds to a tense atmosphere.This movie is a classic that has stood the test of time. It's definitely one of the all-time great horror movies. Stephen King himself actually hated it, but horror movie fans generally like it. I highly recommend The Shining to all horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SHINING = Beast, Boss, Excellent, scary, sexy, and annoying... (Jack's wife.)I love Kubrick's movies except 2001 odyssey.. And this one was the best... i had awesome scenes that makes you jump like crazy. I liked how the kid is not normal.. that made the movie even more scarier. jack Nicholson was so scary. His expression was awesome and freaky. I loved the story too.. It is about a family who moves in a hotel and Jack is always typing at the hotel because he needs peace and concentration. Then slowly and slowly he becomes more possessed with evil and tries to kill his family. Before, there was an old caretaker that was at this hotel and he got mad and he killed his 2 daughters... My rating: story: 10/10 effects: 9.5/10 Character: 9/10. (I should've gave the character a 10 but the wife was so annoying.. i wanted to go in the movie and just stab her in the head.. HER SCREAM IS SO ANNOYING!!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>letting Stanley Kubrick into your head is not a good idea but he's going to get in anyway so much so that you might even be scared of the word Tuesday flashing onto your screen which leads on to many moments where the music hits you at the exact right point. I surprised myself with how scared i got when nothing happens at all this was mostly due to the use of open spaces and long corridors making me as paranoid as Jack himself. the downfall of this movie with all other horror is that i take no joy in being scared. This as one of the best horrors every should not only be remembered for it scares but for the acting from Jack Nicholson, perfect. the crazy eyed stare has never and most likely will never be done as good again. It also should be remembered for the brilliant suspense with was added to by the sprained ankle of Jack.influencing years of "it's not what it seems " horrors</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The House That Stanley Built</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(contains spoilers)The Shining's reputation has only grown over these almost 30 years since its initial release, something true of all Kubrick films I believe. And though I would venture to say that nothing Kubrick ever made could be safely classified as a genre picture, The Shining is almost always, and rightfully so, listed among the top horror films of all time. But Kubrick always found a way to transcend these genres he chose to immerse himself in, whether they were noir, gladiator, (anti-)war, sci-fi, period drama, contemporary satire, etc. And out of his entire oeuvre, The Shining is perhaps the most perfect example of said transcendence, shattering most clichés of the horror genre: the main character is the monster; there's only one murder in the entire film; and lastly, it's never a question of "who" or "when" in The Shining, but "why" (did Jack do it?) and "how" (was he also in the past?), which themselves are questions left arguably ambiguous at the end. Its this very ambiguity, one of the most non- genre devices there is, that elevates The Shining to not just the top of the best horror movie lists, but perhaps on to the best films ever lists. For me, ambiguous conclusions make for great psycho-logical film, and The Shining is just that.Released in 1980, The Shining was Kubrick's next film after 1975's Barry Lyndon (his best?). Based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, Kubrick rejected King's own adaptation and instead enlisted the aid of novelist Diane Johnson to help write the screenplay. Many King-lovers decry the script's strong differences with the actual source material, but who cares? Considering King's own at-best-mediocre screenplays, and his disastrous attempt at film directing ? the mind-numbing Maximum Overdrive ? I have no problem trusting that Kubrick knew how to make a film better than Mr. King.The Shining is, on its surface, a ghost story. A failed, alcoholic, and abusive husband and father, one Jack Torrance, decides to take a winter-season caretaker position at the Overlook Hotel, in hopes that the seclusion will help him to rebuild his life, and also assist in revitalizing his creative juices as a writer. Despite the warnings of cabin fever, and the story of a past murder/suicide by a previous caretaker of his entire family, Jack takes the position and travels to the Overlook, with his mousy, chain-smoking, battered-wife syndrome poster- girl spouse, Wendy. They also have a son, the often bruised yet powerfully clairvoyant, Danny, who foresees the evil, but is powerless to understand or prevent it. Of course we, and the entire Torrance family, soon learn that the hotel is named Overlook because, one: it's what you should do if you ever come across it, and two: because it affords glorious views of Hell. Whether it's a simple case of one man going mad, a genuine haunting/possession, multiple hauntings, or if the hotel itself is an evil and sentient being, we never really know. The majestic and horrifying images Kubrick creates, his nail-biting pacing, the revolutionary steadicam work of John Alcott, and the performances of all three major characters, make The Shining one of the most atmospheric nightmares on celluloid.And something else about The Shining not often said, is that it's the only film starring Jack Nicholson that isn't overpowered by Nicholson himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest film of all time, and Kubrick's most accessible work, if far from his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick, whose legendary, chilly style is so distinct that you can tell a Kubrick film no matter what genre he tackled. The Shining, inspired by (I won't say "based on") Stephen King's classic novel, is Stanley Kubrick's stab at straight horror. A master of making the audience uncomfortable even in his non-horror films, Kubrick fully disregards all the normal conventions of horror and films a genuinely frightening story in his own unique, deeply dark and often downright uncomfortable style. With a classic performance by Jack Nicholson that is simultaneously hilarious and bone-chilling, and a pervading sense of dread brought on by the gorgeous use of location, no movie has the power to truly, deeply disturb me every time I watch it like The Shining. It's a perfect horror film.The story involves the dysfunctional Torrance family, Jack, Wendy, and their little son Danny. The intense Jack is a recovering alcoholic and aspiring writer who takes a job as winter caretaker at the isolated, prestigious Overlook Hotel, the disturbing past of which doesn't bother Jack in the slightest. Upon arrival, the troubled Danny discovers that he has psychic powers; he can see things from the past and future. This power is called "shining," and it seems to be in full effect in the hotel. Danny is terrified by what he sees, and rightly so. Unfortunately, he is too young to understand what he's seeing, so he can't warn his parents.He doesn't really have to, as the hotel's demons, or perhaps simply the claustrophobia and isolation, seem to be taking a more sinister toll on Jack. Stuck with his family whom he can barely tolerate for nearly a year in a place with no alcohol, his temper gets gradually worse. When Wendy becomes scared of the hotel and suggests leaving, Jack is furious to say the least. He then meets (or does he?) the former caretaker from the hotel's sordid past who kindly suggests a harsher, more permanent way of dealing with his family issues.The Shining is an enigmatic film. We can never tell whose point of view we are witnessing the events from, or if we even are at all. There is as much to suggest that the Overlook is simply haunted as there is to say the characters are claustrophobic and hallucinating. This consistent ambiguity results in a deeply unsettling tone where for much of the time, we aren't sure what we're afraid of. The simple idea of three people alone in a giant isolated hotel is creepy, and as the camera follows the characters around the Overlook, we sense danger around every corner.As far as scares go, the film isn't all atmosphere. Say what you will about hidden messages and menacing camera-work, The Shining's relentlessly visceral nature alone is where its powerful immediate impact lies. There are some legendary shocks here. The elevator scene. The baseball bat/typewriter scene. The room 237 scene. Special mention should go to the two little girls for being among the only horror characters to literally keep me sleeping with the lights on. Kubrick pulls these scenes off with the most masterful sense of timing, pacing, and atmosphere. There is gore in the film, but it is used sparingly and to maximum shock effect.The performances are odd, but looking back, I couldn't picture anyone else in any of the roles. Nicholson is basically playing himself in a lot of ways, and as over-the-top and hilarious as his performance is, it is also truly scary. Nicholson the actor seems to be really enjoying acting insane; his fun rubs off on us, and we laugh with him, and at his over-the-top nature; but his insanity is never doubted, and his sense of fun rubs off on us making us feel almost complicit in Jack's rampage. Shelly Duvall is rather annoying as his wife, although I think that was what Kubrick was going for. It's more believable that he'd want to chop her up than if she was a stronger person. For the record though, she is very good at conveying deep, helpless terror when the scene calls for it (with the help of Kubrick's intimidation). Danny Lloyd does good as Danny, which is remarkable as at such a young age, he didn't know he was making a horror movie; he's as believable as such a young actor can be, and his performance works because his innocence is the real thing. Scatman Crothers steals every scene he's in as the hotel cook who befriends Danny; he's just such a charming, likable guy who brings a little relief from the grimness of the storytelling, without taking away from it; his role proves darker than mere comic relief. I should also mention that Philip Stone's performance as "Grady" makes a more terrifying impression in two scenes than most actors do in whole movies. For such a polite gentleman, there is something so off about the mere presence of his character, that you never feel comfortable; the mere expression on his face during the bathroom scene still keeps me uneasy late at night. The score, the cinematography, the editing, the lighting, the sound... I could never stop praising this film. It is my idea of a perfect horror film, perfectly blending claustrophobia, gore, psychological terror, ghostly imagery, and mind-bending weirdness to create a film that's as nightmare-inducing as it is brilliant. 10/10 The Shining is rated R for disturbing images and terror throughout, some violence, nudity, and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one thing we want to gain from a horror movie, it's the feeling of sheer terror and this movie does just that. I watched this movie not too long ago around ten in the evening and after the movie ended, I constantly looked over my shoulder at every little noise that was made. I'm not one who scares easily but this movie got my heart pumping a good bit throughout it's entirety. Hands down, one of Stephen King's best stories.The cast, minus Shelley Duvall, was perfect.Jack Nicholson, as always, was phenomenal. It's amazing to watch him slowly mold from hard working father to a mad man. One of the many great things about Nicholson is his eyes. He has the most amazing, story telling eyes. You could put him in a silent movie, with no subtitles, and understand the story just by watching his eyes.Shelley Duvall was awful. In fact, she was down right horrible and it was painful to watch her act. When watching a film, we want to get lost in it and feel like it's actually happening. Her acting took so much away from the movie that every time she was in a scene, I remembered I was watching a film.Danny Lloyd was excellent. This kid blew me away. It's very hard to find a child actor who can reach certain aspects of a character, especially in a horror film. Somehow, the crew were able to find this boy who has the ability to make you paranoid.The only thing, besides Duvall's awful performance, that slowed the movie down was the dialog. Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson could have done a better job at transferring the story from paper to screen. The dialog sounded as if a child wrote it and didn't flow as well as it could have.But overall, great movie! Classic Horror Film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, allow me to say, I did not read the book. I find that people who say they have read the book seem to be disappointed in this movie..wow..for me, this movie was the opposite of being disappointing..I found this movie riveting, and outstanding. From the acting to the cinematography to the directing, this movie is a ten in my estimation. Each actor/actress makes you believe each scene...of course,one of the best scenes is when Jack Nicholson breaks down the bathroom door with an ax, and put is face in the hole in the broken door saying "heeeeeere's Johnny".....it's a great scene because of the build up. You can cut through the tense as it rises within the Overlook. Great acting, great directing, great scenery, great story. I highly recommend this movie. I would put it in my top 50, for sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a bunch of horror movies in my lifetime so far and they all go under certain categories. A lot of them are called horror movies because of the killing or the gore. Also, a lot of them have their horror moments but then the mood is changed to lighthearted for character development or for some sort of dynamic purposes. The Shining on the other hand keeps that same feeling of horror throughout the whole film beginning to end. The music and the way it is shot makes it a horror film. This is what I've noticed these are the 2 great things needed to really make it a classic horror film. Nevermind effects. There is hardly any blood shed or shockers but like I mentioned before the music and visuals make it what it is. The weird quick shots of blood coming out of the elevator to the boy being scared to weird imagery plus that music is just owning the genre all together. Its odd because Stanley Kubrick didn't really direct any horror films but this one and this one comes out on top over all the directors that have directed multiple horror movies. The lighting in it gives it a dreamy like feel and the hotel becomes a character just as much as the ones you see in the film. I can't remember the first time I saw this film in its entirety but my God its a masterpiece. I wish Stanley Kubrick did more films of this nature because he would have been called the best horror director of all time I'm sure of it. Anyone who thinks this film is lacking or boring or drawn out doesn't understand the magnitude and intensity this film holds. It hits you on another level a more sophisticated level of human fear than any horror movie has ever done before. It makes most of the other horror movie "classics" seem like child's play! With an exception of a few of them. Directors should take a lesson or two from this movie and execute it in their own manner because if there were more horror movies like this horror would be the most popular genre there is.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson is Oscar worthy as the insane father/husband that goes insane from isolation. You feel the isolation with him also. The film makes you feel the isolation that Jack is going through. The film is really scary. If you do not get creeped out by the two little girls than you are not human. This film doesn't fit many horror sub-genres. Slasher? No. Gorefest? No. Cheesy B movie? No. It really is in a world of its own, and creates something fantastic. This film is one of my favorite horror film ever, and will continue to be amazing.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed but very interesting and suspenseful horror from the Master!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I finally saw The Shining, Stanley Kubrick's horror film. Is it a good film? Yes, definitely. Very good actually. While it is a slow film, it certainly has some creepy suspense and mystery, and Kubrick gets beneath our skin most of the times. Jack Nicholson is brilliant here, and his performance here is worthy of it's popularity. I also thought Shelley Duvall was pretty good, but I am sure her performance is one to get a lot of hate, and seeing her Razzie nomination wasn't surprising. Now back to the film, like I said, it is a very good film, and it even achieves greatness because of certain scenes. I appreciate what Kubrick was trying to achieve, but his direction while sometimes brilliant feels a bit misguided as well. This is a psychological horror for sure, but the screenplay is pretty strong, even though there are some flaws within the writing. The last 40 minutes are brilliant, and the visuals will haunt you, and as far as horrors go, this ranks in the top class. I am not sure if this is the masterpiece Kubrick hoped for or just a film that is near-brilliant, but one thing is for sure... it remains always unsettling and interesting</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Under the influence of a desolate hotel where murders had occurred, a caretaker (Jack Nicholson) goes berserk and threatens his family. Unlike most films by director Stanley Kubrick, which saw a slow graduated release building on word-of-mouth reputation, The Shining was released in a manner more like a mass-market film.The film is a genuinely scary ghost story that polarises opinions: devotees find it the greatest horror film ever, while naysayers deride its over-the-top histrionics. Admittedly, it gets the heart pounding, and there's a truly disturbing edge to Nicholson's performance, but between the highlights, there's not enough to maintain one's enthusiasm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made and ambiguous psychological horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stanley Kubrick and star Jack Nicholson collaborated in a very interesting, very well made but ultimate slightly flawed horror film.It is a measure though of Stanley Kubrick that a flawed film still gets 9 out of 10! The film is more populist than most of Kubrick's films, however he still keeps many aspects of the film non mainstream and original, despite this coming from an existing story, in the form of a Stephen King novel.The plot is typically ambiguous, challenging the audience by not having a neat structure, and this applied particularly to the intriguing ending. However, I wonder if a little too much development of the story got lost in the editing as for me this was the area where the films main, and only fault was. While I understand that the time line in the film moves in jumps I found that Jack Nicholson's character psychosis happens too quickly, and I felt it would have been more interesting to see this disintegration of character, which is well played by Nicholson, happen more subtly. Shelley Duvall's performance is very good as the wife who becomes more terrified when she realises what is happening to her husband, but again it would have been interesting to see her change more gradually. Kubrick alumni Philip Stone (as Delbert Grady)and Joe Turkel (as the bartender) are both excellent in small parts, as is Scatman Crothers at the head chef, but for me the real acting kudos in the film has to go to child actor Danny Lloyd as the Daniel Torrance character. He is amazing, especially when performing both the slightly sinister alter ego as well as his Danny character. He carries off his performance with subtlety and charisma. This character is the emotional anchor for the story, and Danny Lloyd pulls it off magnificently. Kudos has to go to Kubrick for getting this level of performance from a young child actor. Technical credits, as usual for a Kubrick film, are first rate. Kubrick alumni John Alcott's photography is complemented brilliantly by Kubrick's signature use of wide angle lenses. This is particularly impressive as Kubrick makes wide and large spaces look really scary, and eschews the more stereotypical approaches of darkness and tight framing of shots to induce claustrophobia with the audience. Mention must also be of Garrett Brown's use of the Steadicam in this picture. As the steadicam operator, he worked this camera system into the production very effectively as for it to be almost not noticeable. Credit however, must go to Kubrick for realising the potential for it to be a storytelling tool, rather than for it to be a practical solution to certain shooting problems, as it had been in previous films. His work here certainly inspired many modern filmmakers to use steadicam in their films, sadly rarely with Kubrick's level of sophistication. Editing and production design are excellent, particularly the work in realising both the Overlook Hotel and Maze, for which huge credit has to go to Roy Walker, another Kubrick alumni. In fact the snow bound atmosphere is brilliantly realised, as are the winter scenes, particularly with most of this film being made in the UK at Elstree studios. Kubrick again chooses most of the music from a variety of sources, both scored and existing music. It works very well with the filmIn summary, a very good psychological horror film which left me thinking long after the film was over, despite some aspects of the characters journey in the film not really working for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Psychological Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often times the scariest things are the subtle irregularities in life; the little things that seem...off. In "The Blair Witch Project" it was the little things going wrong that built up the tension (losing the map, no cigarettes, etc.). Time and again movies have proved that they're often scarier when there's little to no violence and gore. "Paranormal Activity," "Blair Witch Project," "Psycho," and even "Halloween." "The Shining" belongs in the same category, although it is different from any of those films because the terror comes from the characters descent into madness, not a psychopathic killer.Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a wannabe writer who has taken a job looking after a hotel during the snowy season (the 20 mile cliffside road leading to the hotel rules out the possibility of a ski resort). For five months, Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and son Dann(Danny Lloyd) are going to live at the Overlook Hotel in complete isolation. But before long, the lack of human contact begins to really get to them.Human beings are social creatures. We need to interact with each other in order to survive. Take away that interaction, and the mind begins to try and cope, and the results are frequently not pretty. This premise, which was raised in Stephen King's novel upon which the film is based, but was discarded in favor of a traditional ghost story with fantasy elements. Kubrick, for the most part, has completely rejected the ghost story and instead focuses on the psychological trauma that complete isolation does to the human mind.The acting is solid, but this is Kubrick's show. As someone who was well read in psychology, it comes as no surprise that that the famous filmmaker knows just how to generate fear. His unique camera shots and use of dissonant music are masterful. We can feel the madness of the characters, and that's what makes this film so scary.It's not flawless, however. There are a few plot holes, and some parts of the plot and characters are a little too elusive (then again, that may have been Kubrick's goal). But the biggest problem is that Kubrick kept some of the fantasy from King's book. It is unnecessary in Kubrick's vision of the film, and it should have been written out completely (a more plausible explanation would be obvious to anyone).Nevertheless, this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Once the tension starts to build, it never stops and never lets up (the finale is genuinely terrifying).My rating: Rated R for some violence/gore, pervasive terror, and brief language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Horror Movie which plays on your mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it that makes a good horror movie? To some, it consists of lots of blood, to others it might be about spending lonely nights in haunted houses full of cheap thrills.However, I belong to the category who finds horror most scary, when it is believable, when the incidents there could happen to me and you, when the supernatural occurrences seem ambiguous,for only then are they truly believable.Are there really ghosts, or is someone just imagining it?.For such people,horror is in the mind,and psychological horror movies are the most scary type of horror.The Shining is a shining example(pardon the pun) of such a movie.The plot is fairly straightforward:We have a palatial hotel situated amidst the high,lonely slopes of the Rocky Mountains.This place is inaccessible throughout the winter months,and thus needs a caretaker.Enter Jack Nicholson,his mousy wife Shelley Duvall ,and their son who supposedly has an ability to shine, or communicate with people mentally.Where it differs from more conventional horror movies is the fact that the gore/ghosts do not start as soon as they enter the hotel.Instead,this movie is more of a psychological horror movie, in the beginning , everything seems hunky-dory with the family,and the stay together slowly causes underlying problems to come to the fore: Jack's indifference to his family is something else,Shelley's mistrust of her husband has never really gone.A chilling scene worth recalling is the one where Jack comforts his son that he could never hurt him, while actually the complete lack of emotion in that scene if frightening And Jack's slow descent into madness, prompted by hallucinations/ghosts and his wife's mistrust is predictable but horrifying.The director gains marks here for his brilliant cinematography, the sense of isolation of the Rocky mountains is shown brilliantly in the aerial shots of the long ,winding roads there.The huge,empty hotel with its past grandeur adds to this.Particularly brilliant are the shots of the son racing down the corridors on his tricycle, the feeling of actually being there and not knowing what is around the corner is awesome!Add to this the excellent soundtrack, which adds to the underlying sense of foreboding throughout the movie, and the documentary feel of it, the chilling, straightforward way in which the shots are taken,and you have one of the best horror movies of all time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a review of The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining (1980) Based on the novel by Stephen King, Written and Directed by Stanley Kubrick. Starring Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall, Danny Lloyd, &amp; Scatman Crothers. Horror/Thriller The Shining tells the story of a writer Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) who takes a job as the winter caretaker of the Overlook hotel, high in the mountains of Colorado. In spite of the warning from the hotel manager about the unfortunate end to previous caretaker and his family, Jack brings his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) along with him. As the story progresses, we learn that Danny has some emotional and spiritual issues of his own, apart from the strange happenings we see at the hotel. Danny meets the hotel cook, played by Scatman Crothers, who shares a mysterious ability to see into the past and future, which is apparently where we get the title of the movie. The story takes a turn for the worst when Danny begins to see images from the past, ghosts and murders, and cabin fever drives Jack to the brink of insanity.There are few movies that fully embody the words "classic horror," but The Shining is absolutely one of them. From creepy twin-kid ghosts scenes, sexy turned disgusting old lady bathroom scenes, to full on slasher blood and gore scenes, this movie has it all. The musical score in this movie is the best part in my opinion. It creates a blanket of suspense from the opening credits all the way to the end. The music sets a tone for the movie at the very beginning, I've never been so creeped out by what is a seemingly normal scene of mountain driving in my life! Even the credits moving from bottom to top leaves you with an eerie feeling, like something bad is about to happen.Stanley Kubrick does an amazing job with the cinematography in this film. The camera angles, the perspective shots, the long tracking shots. This movie is full of wonderfully symmetric, artifully crafted scenes that tell a story all their own. Stanley Kubrick also uses off-screen space so well in this movie to increase the suspense.I was especially impressed with the acting of little Danny Lloyd, who has two roles in this movie, a relatively content little boy and "Tony," the little boy that lives in his mouth. Danny Lloyd plays both roles, even in the same scene, very convincingly and in my opinion steals the spotlight. Even the way Danny uses his finger as a puppet when "Tony" is talking is outrageously frightening. What a terrific little actor! The Shining is a much see for any horror movie enthusiast and it really sets the bar for the genre. If you've never seen this movie, rent it and watch it, just make sure and leave a nightlight on after, because this movie will scare you stupid!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel bad for giving this classic only 80%, but like I said in other reviews, since no one can create atmosphere like Kubrick did, I was expecting this movie to be scary, but as a movie, it is brilliantly shot and extremely well made.A man, his son and wife become the winter caretakers of an isolated hotel where Danny (Lloyd), the son, sees disturbing visions of the hotel's past using a telepathic gift known as "The Shining". The father, Jack Torrance (Nicholson), is underway in a writing project when he slowly slips into insanity as a result of cabin fever and former guests of the hotels ghost's. After being convinced by a waiter's ghost to "correct" the family, Jack goes completely insane. The only thing that can save Danny and his mother (Duvall) is "The Shining".Kubrick's camera angles are extraordinary (Note the scenes where Danny is riding his little bike), and yes, the atmosphere is also great, I just didn't find it scary, I watched this movie at night, alone in a dark room, and than tried to sleep, the problem is that I did sleep.Nicholsons performance is perfect, his crazy faces are awesome, and he looks insane without being crazy, what is a hard thing to do. Shelley Duvall's performance is annoying, just like Danny Lloyd's one, that woman's voice, is probably what is really going to give me nightmares, and Lloyd look like he's never going to finish his line, it looks forced, and boring to see. In the end, Torrance's wife and son are so annoying, that I don't blame him for trying to kill them, I wanted to just punch that kid so he could talk like a man.Verdict: You'll probably be scared with this movie. It's a classic, it is great, it is Kubrick, it is Nicholson. Watch this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, I don't think anyone will ever top this film. I am no longer the slightest surprised over the title of scariest film ever. This is true psychological horror masterpiece. It doesn't go in for cheap scares, overuse of gore and violence, it is just plain scary. Kubrick is a master of symbolics, and in a horror film it is very effective. This films surreal imagery has been copied hundreds of times since this film was released. And you know what they say; imitation is the greatest flatter. I for one love Kubrick's films, and from the looks of it several other directors in the world do too. Also I think it's nice to see that Kubrick can handle the horror genre too, very well I must say.Now before I finish I must say there are some potential disappointments for you. Kubrick and author Stephen King, didn't exactly get very well along. And Kubrick has a tendency to make films his way, even though the story itself isn't his. So for you out there who has read the book, or simply admire Kings work, you might have the same mixed feelings about this film as he did. Sure I think King is proud of being the author of the scariest film of all time, and he certainly earned some on this film, but it wasn't exactly what he had in mind. many of the same elements are in it, but Kubrick has taken many liberties. I for one think it is a great film, and I admire both men's work, and I would recommend this film to Kubrick and King fans alike. I'm just saying, it might not be quite sure what you expected. And if you're a hard ass King fan, you might wan't to check out the 1997 mini TV series. King produces it, and made sure everything went his way.I'm don't think the acting is necessary to mention, it's simply great. Jack Nicholsen is as scary as he'll ever get, and Shelly Duvall really impressed me, despite the fact that Kubrick has some scuffles with her. I think, that in the end, she did great. And of course, let's not forget Danny Lloyd, his only film performance, is nonetheless great.So what is my verdict? 10/10 Of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining - classic horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining strikes me as one of only three Stephen King adaptations that are completely successful, the others being Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption. Unlike that other film, The Shining was from the start in for a substantial makeover, in this case by Stanley Kubrick and his co-screenwriter Diane Johnson. For this reason, the film has never really pleased many fans of the original book who believe that films must be faithfully and accurately transcribed to screen in order to be considered a successful adaptation.Watching The Shining today, what strikes one are the uncommonly elegant sets, the lack of special effects (one trick shot of the hedge maze notwithstanding), the gliding Steadicam cinematography and the tricky tone the film manages to maintain between horror film, domestic drama and very black comedy. There are scenes in the film that never fail to make me laugh and others that give one the appropriate creepy frisson expected of a horror film.The film takes a distinctly more psychological approach than the novel. While the hotel does appear to be truly haunted in the film (Danny sees ghosts, Jack appears in the portrait in the final shot, etc.), it's also possible to read all of the scenes between Jack and Lloyd (the bartender) or the Grady (the former caretaker) as the delusions of an alcoholic having a breakdown. Certainly, the subtext is at the very least made quite clear. Oddly, the one scene in the film that I recall making clear beyond question that the supernatural is at work (when the ghost of Grady opens the storage locker door to release Jack) is actually ambivalent. Jack speaks to Grady through the door and we simply hear the door being unlocked while the camera remains on Jack's face...the next time we see him he is hacking away at the bedroom door with an Axe. Perhaps he used the ax to bust open the locker door himself? In any event, Nicholson is great in the film, perhaps his finest performance.The Blu-ray is (as expected) notably crisper looking than earlier DVD's. There is some grain evident and the colors don't quite "pop" in the same way that they do for some more recent films but this is undoubtedly the best The Shining has ever looked on video. Considering this is one of the best photographed films of it's period, I think most people will be pleased with the picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Torrance, a novelist, takes a job as a caretaker of the Overlook Hotel.The manager tells him how the previous caretaker, Mr. Gradt, chopped his family and then killed himself with a shotgun.Jack's son Danny has a gift, that's called the shining.It shows him things from the past and the future.He knows some bad things are going to happen there.Mr. Hallorann also has this gift and he warns Danny, especially of the room 237.Soon Jack starts losing his mind.He goes to the Gold Room where he sees a room full of dead people, including Grady.Jack's son and wife Wendy are both in danger, and they have to escape.The Shining (1980) is a Stanley Kubrick masterpiece.The Shining hasn't lost its shining in 30 years.This movie still gives you chills.Stephen King didn't approve this version, which I can't quite understand.I haven't read the novel, I must admit, but I do know that Stanley Kubrick made some minor changes to the movie.Like in the end there's the labyrinth instead of the hedge animals.But the result is a great horror movie, and it's all that matters.Jack Nicholson plays his part of the luneatic very well.He plays his role in a somewhat funny way, which has been criticized over the years.I've always liked his performance.Like when he's the big bad wold and he huffs and puffs.It doesn't make him any less scary.Shelley Duvall is amazing as Wendy Torrance.Stanley really gave her hard time, but it was all worth it and she agrees with that.She had to do 127 takes for the baseball bat scene, which is a record.They found a real talent for the role of Danny.Danny Lloyd didn't even know at the time that he was in a horror movie, but yet he gives a credible performance as this kid.He only made one movie after this.Scatman Crothers is perfect as Dick Hallorann.Some great performances in other parts as well.Philip Stone plays Delbert Grady, who murdered his family.Joe Turkel is Lloyd the bartender.Lisa and Louise Burns are the Grady twins.Vivian "Stanley's daughter" Kubrick is seen as Smoking Guest on Ballroom Couch.One scary scene is when Jack goes into the room 237.There's the seemingly young woman taking a bath and all of the sudden she turns into an old decaying woman.The twins have always given me the creeps."Come play with us, Danny".And the hotel is filled with blood.The Shining is a movie that will never lose its shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect on most grounds but poor on a couple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine novel and an equally enjoyable feature film. Though not Kubrick's best, I think it is the best example of his style. It features all his director trademarks clearly, including great art and bad acting, although the former outweighs the latter.Writer Jack Torrance has taken a job as the winter caretaker for the overlook hotel which is about to close up for the season (because the annual snow makes it impossible to get in or out)JAck moves in with his wife Wendy and his son Danny, At first they are enjoying the godly hotel which they have to their selves, but it is soon to become a nightmare. Something about the place is starting to have an affect on Jack mindset. The isolation and frustration with his work, makes him delusional and he starts having hallucinations of friends and hotel staff who are telling him to kill his family. It is all in his mind or is it real. With nobody around for miles, and bad weather approaching, how will Wendy keep herself and Danny safe from impending doom?Kubricks mise-en-scene is quite distinctive. He strikes me as a detailed set designer, and a director intent on making his environment weird elaborate or complex. Just look at the neon clubs in Clockwork Orange or the masked ball in Eyes Wide Shut. The Overlook hotel is also a great piece of production design. In fact it may be the biggest hotel I have seen in a movie. (shot from the inside that is). The photography is highly evocative, and features a handful of memorable shots and camera tricks. Kubrick likes long duration.For the most part the film is a pretty honourable adaptation of the novel, except for the climax, which Kubrick completely rewrites. I guess he found King's approach too conventional and 'happy ending' like. King's approach was better. Climax of the movie involves a chase scene that feels highly uninventive, rather over the top, and dragging on for a little too long. I've never liked Jack Nicholson much, but for the sloppy performance he gives here, I give equal blame to Kubrick. The way I see it, he probably gave Nicholson only two words of direction...'go nuts'. This is exactly what happens. Never before has Nicholson been so far over the top. Shelley Duvall is equally poor, and for about three quarters of the movie, she delivers her lines with the same ridiculous expression on her face.Aside from these problems, I would call the Shining an impressive piece of horror movie making. Is it a great movie? not quite but it is one worth wathcing, although I would recommend the book first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not one of the greatest horror films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed The SHining to a point. The imagery was well done, especially the beginning when you see and aerial view of the car climbing ominous mountains that seem to want to swallow it whole, and also the scenes in the Overlook Hotel itself. All these things lend great atmosphere to the movie, as well as the musical score, but other than that, this movie didn't terrify me like the best horror films do. THere are just long points in the movie where nothing really happens. THere is dread, I'll agree, but there are also other scenes that just don't go anywhere. THe interview itself in the beginning seems too drawn out, taking up entirely too much of the movie if you ask me.Some people want to talk about the acting, but it seemed entirely too wooden. Shelly Duvall as Wendy is weak and dull, and Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance doesn't become interesting until he starts going crazy and acting like he does in most of his movies. Danny Lloyd, who plays the son Danny, has a telepathic ability called the Shining and has daily conversations with an imaginary friend named Tony. THis could've been a little more interesting, but never goes far enough to really catch your interest.THe plot is simple enough. Jack Torrance is offered a job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, and brings his wife and son with him because it will be many months of seclusion with just the three of them in a large ominous hotel. THe set-up is great, and Stanley Kubrick uses the steady cam to perfection in this movie to show us how spooky this large hotel is. As Jack slowly goes insane he starts seeing the ghosts that haunt this large hotel which comes first in the form of one ghostly bartender and then transforms into a whole ballroom of spooks. It is only Danny though, with THe Shining, who sees the twin girls. Many of you already know what happened to them, but I will not spoil it for those who haven't. THere is also the telepathic link that Danny has with the hotel's cook named Dick Halloran and played by Scathman Crothers. Once again not much is given about this special ability shared between the two. It is glanced over while Dick and Danny talk alone for the first time at the beginning of the movie, but otherwise goes nowhere else, except to bring Dick back from Florida when things go very bad closer to the end.As I've said, the setting is great, the visuals are wondrous at building dread and atmosphere, but the acting and script are rather weak because nothing is ever explained and the actors, other than Nicholson's character, really never change. Then again, upon first seeing Jack Torrance, I thought he was a little loopy then and just becomes way more loopy as the long drawn out story pushes to the end. In my opinion The SHining has enough good points to be recommended, but can not quite match the perfection of a movie like Alien which also starts out slowly, but becomes much more fast paced and terrifying as it leads to its conclusion, and it also has better acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silver Screeningz Review: 81</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Silver Screeningz http://silverscreeningz.blogspot.com"The Shining"Director: Stanley Kubrick Run Time: 146 min Rating: RViewer Bias: 10I have taken an entire class on the films of Stanley Kubrick, therefore I understand some of the inner dynamics of the "Kubrickian" style of film making. Having some knowledge and basis of Kubrick's body of work is essential to uncovering the themes, motifs, symbols, and overall mastery of Kubrick's work.Although the original novel of "The Shining" was written by Stephen King, the film version of "The Shining" is entirely Kubrick's. Stanley Kubrick was forced to allow King to write the first draft of the screenplay, which Kubrick promptly tossed. This created quite a dispute between King and Kubrick which was never resolved. This is a Stanley Kubrick film.Direction: 8Editing: 8The editing is fantastic and is where the root of the film's suspense is drawn from. However, Kubrick's pacing issues often come from editing which intentionally makes the audience uncomfortable. It's a matter of personal taste although I would assume that the majority of movie going audiences would not appreciate this style and may at times be bored.Acting: 7No one would run around a giant hotel flailing their arms like a duck while holding a knife running away from a crazed husband but apparently Shelley Duvall thought so. Duvall's acting can annoy at lot of audiences and my class had a lot to say after we viewed the film. I personally had more problems with Danny Lloyd. I know he was only about six years old when they shot the film, but he needs to learn to open is mouth when he speaks. Maybe I'm being too hard since I can imagine a film like this would be hard to grasp for a child, but he bothers me.On the other hand Jack Nicholson gives his best performance in this film. The dramatic range and convincing insanity he portrays from Jack Torrance is staggering. From minor facial twitches when confronting Duvall in the film's final act to the universal disingenuous demeanor of America's middle class in the film's first "interview" act, Nicholson plays a dramatic character that morphs from the American "every man" to the American "axe murderer." If you need any more convincing, check out Vivian Kubrick's documentary on the DVD to see just how Nicholson prepares for his axe wielding scenes.Writing: 6Story: 6I have never read King's novel of "The Shining," but from what I have been told, it's pretty stupid. Ghosts? Killer Shrubbery? No thank you. Although Kubrick's film may include ghouls - at least the paranormal - it is a psychological thriller and not a science fiction thriller. With the way the story progresses and the film is shot, the audience is challenged to decipher if the events of the film are imaginary or supernatural. Where King places the danger in the paranormal, Kubrick ignites a more terrifying reality - horror within the American family. The closeness and isolation of film reflects the American family and isolation that family members can feel when horror strikes within the home. That transcends stupid ghosts and malicious flora, it becomes commentary, and to some - art.Cinematography: 10This is perhaps one of the best shot films ever made. The larger the screen, the greater the experience. The camera often tracks directly behind characters providing a nearly first-person viewpoint. This subjectivity allows the audience to engage the film from the narrowed view of each of the characters. Ironically, the camera work of the film allows the huge hotel to feel very small and that suffocating feeling is increased along with the film's suspense. The first shots of the film are wide, expansive shots of Colorado which eventually dwindles down to the confinement of a confusing hedge maze.Special Effects: 7Music: 10The editing, cinematography, and music are the three key elements that comprise the suspense of the film. Composers Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind exquisitely created a soundtrack that adds to the tension of the film ten fold. Long held notes and the prickling of strings are common horror film musical techniques but were implemented perfectly in "The Shining." The soundtrack absolutely services the film to its fullest potential.Wow Factor: 9This is a frightening film yet different from the typical horror films we see today. Kubrick was a director known for his psychological take on stories and that is the true beauty of "The Shining." The complete package from the film's score to its visual look can create just as visceral of a reaction as many of today's goriest films with about a tenth of the gore. A horror masterpiece and one of my favorite scary movies. Happy Halloween!Read the rest at: Silver Screeningz http://silverscreeningz.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I much prefer the television version that was made later. Sorry, but Jack Nicolson looks crazy normally. Hard to see him slowly going crazy when he looks to begin with. And Shelley Duval is too much of a wimp. Keep seeing Olive Oyl. Read the book after having worked at a Hotel in the Canadian Rockies so I could really imagine the story. Had to turn the light back on when I finished reading at 3:00 am. Had a hard time going into bathrooms where the shower curtain was covering the bathtub. But the movie just didn't do it for me.Sorry but Jack is Jack Nicolson not Jack Torance in this movie. He seems to play himself in most movies....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, but not for the Oscars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read the book and so I've seen the film - some similarities and I won't reveal any details to ruin the viewer's enjoyment. I don't think it's the best adaptation from a Stephen King novel, Carrie is a great work as is Misery but as a film in itself, it's hauntingly effective - silence and space are the key elements Kubrick used here to developing the enshrining tension and inevitable horror the hotel beholds! You can see how 2001 A Space Odyssey not only initialised these elements of audio and visual technique but how they were used to great effect here. I'll never understand why the panel of the Academy Awards avoid it though? Jack Nicholson has been nominated so often for perfect performances on film, yet this is another performance that went unrewarded. Correct me if I'm wrong!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has it's rewards and is not at all a bad film, but is vastly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What defines a classic film? This is of course up to the individual because we don't all agree on this. Though we can agree on some things, including what movies we like and don't like, our opinions are our own and our ideas on what makes a film a classic aren't exactly the same. Some films considered to be classics by some may be considered overrated by others. Many horror films are thought of as classics, such as 'The Exorcist' and 'Halloween.' Though each of those films have their supporters, there are some who feel the opposite and give praise to other great horror films. For me one of these films is Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's 'The Shining.' A lot of people really like this film and would say it's one of or even the scariest movie they've ever seen. Some even call it their favorite and there's nothing wrong with that. But I just don't feel the same way, never have.Pros: Fine job done by the cast. Stunning photography and scenery. Plus the hotel itself is gorgeous, outside and especially inside. Fantastic score that ranges from grand and dramatic to chilling. Some very haunting sequences and images. The film moves at a slow burn pace, which is perfect for this particular story. Some great tension-filled moments.Cons: Many great horror films are deliberately paced, but here it's just too much. After a while it gets excruciating and almost mind-numbing. I have yet to the read the book, but it does feel like something crucial is missing. Both Jack's descent into madness and the family's falling part should have been more fleshed out. The film is over two hours long and these things aren't too rushed, but again could have used more development. This hurts the impact some. And maybe it's just me, but unlike some other great horror movies this is one that just doesn't hold up as well as they do and doesn't hold up as well with repeat viewings. You could say this about most older horror films, but some really stand the test of time.Final thoughts: This is nowhere near being a bad or badly made film. In fact in both the acting and directing departments it's pretty solid. The problem really lies in the script, not that it's poorly written, but it could have used some more work. The film is absolutely worth seeing for the performances and directing alone. Maybe you'll love it more than I do, but I just simply don't like it enough to call it a classic. Find out for yourself.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Underrated Movie In History.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's Horror is the best of its kind. Horror is not that scary until seen through the eyes of Stanley Kubrick. The movie had a great cast. Jack Nicholson is his usual best, the movies pace picks up as the movies goes and and reveals itself in all the silence and coldness one could hardly expect, it keeps you on the edge of your seat as Jack Nicholson goes on a rampage.It is sad to notice that the movie barely won any awards(not that awards matter much, but still....). This is an achievement in cinema, and it may as well be said that it started a whole new fashion of horror movies, besides this the music, screenplay, the direction is very unique, you will very rarely come across a movie that is so slow and yet soo gripping!!!This movie is unarguably one of the most scary movies ever made. This movie is re watchable and those who watch this once will surely watch it again. Stanley Kubrick proves that he is capable of making movies of any Genre, Be it war, comedy, thriller or even horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining (1980)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winter is my favorite season of the year. It slows and hushes everything down quite a bit. Sends some of the crowds indoors. It's calming and peaceful. Apparently, some movie writers find it to be tense and panic-inducing because there are a quite a few horror films set in the winter. Stanley Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of The Shining focuses on the idea of a "cabin fever" effect that drives a person crazy and makes them want to kill others. Why? Because killers are supposed to be scary (though they rarely in fact are, unless they're actually coming after you at this moment) and Stephen King wrote it. That's pretty much all there is to it, though the hotel the characters stay in seems to be haunted. I usually hate this kind of movie. But Kubrick's version of The Shining seems to know one thing and I agree with it- ghosts are boring. At least the ones that make women go misty-eyed and shake a few objects, creating strange noises, and that a character makes a discovery that there's a presence in the house and spirits are not at rest, so the house needs to be exorcised. Films like The Haunting and The Uninvited. Snoozefests, for lack of a better word. Films so focused on drama, they lack a credible threat and overly pad the long-winded dialogue with weepy revelations. And if you're lucky, they throw a little atmosphere your way. When they're not too busy making the main characters cry into a teacup. That sort of thing.This version of The Shining attempts to be pulse-pounding, inexplicable, headily atmospheric, and filled to the brim with creepy images. It's refreshingly straight-forward and highly eventful. But in it's more visceral horror sequences, I can't help feeling they got a bit too gratuitous. The film's world-famous bathroom scene, set in cursed Room 237, for example. That almost feels tacked on for the purpose of a gross, cheap scare. I felt those ghost horror films which came before lacked directness. This film lacks simplicity and definitely overdoes it. Now, that's not saying that most of the horror in the film is unsuccessful. The reverse is true. Just a few select moments. Along the lines of sexual perversity. To burst the bubble of the film's college-student fan club (even the ones who've long since passed on from those days still have much the same attitude, but with potentially less hair), The Shining isn't perfect or a masterpiece. Not by far. Not just for the reason I previously mentioned, although that's certainly a biggie. And of course, on that subject- the film is nearly two and a half hours long. When you watch a horror movie that long, especially one whose intention was solely to creep you out... you have to wonder how films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to do the same thing better in half the time. The budget is high and the crew is strictly professional. So, yeah they can afford to buy you a lot of nice things to look at. On a technical level, the film's stunning. But that's just the outer shell.What about the inside? In the middle, The Shining is a terribly hollow film. So, don't knock on it, it'll crumble to pieces. The "cabin fever" the father-Jack character goes through would seem to chip away at the nerve of his dislike for his wife and son. Slowly driving him to fits of rage and acts of violence, the movie begins to spend less time making the hotel creepy and more time on making Jack creepy. The effectiveness of this rests entirely on the actor Jack Nicholson's ability to play down the crude transition from sane to insane, to maximize the coldness a person needs to kill others. Instead, Jack plays up the mannerisms Kubrick assumes to associate with crazy people. So, the Overlook Hotel sort of becomes a madhouse-of-one. Every time I watch the film now, I can't help but shake my head in pity at how ridiculous and silly (the bad kind of silly, not the amusing kind) Nicholson comes off. I feel absolutely no threat emanating from his character. He almost exists in this mode for actors to study how to act...forgive me for being so blunt, but: retarded. Jack may show the strain of a weak person letting themselves go crazy, but there really are different kinds of crazy. There's a scary kind. And then there's just an annoying kind. Jack's the latter, not the former. Sitting and watching the film, I can help but feel the audience is being expected to babysit Jack, rather than him being the evil, frightening authority figure a murderous father is supposed to be.But the film is more successful than not, in spite of these blaring flaws. The music score for the film is incredibly potent and strong, and if not creepy, than at least brooding and cool. There's a lot of very good imagery and camera-work. The character of Danny, as well as the actor playing him, are not very interesting. But Shelley Duvall playing the mother, Wendy, gives an amazing performance. I'm told many audiences dislike a woman in distress, but she is the key to anything from this film being mistaken for tension. Because she takes everything very hard. She's an emotional wreck, and a very sensitive person. And Duvall as an actress hangs everything she's thinking and feeling right out on her wonderful face. That's a character-actor's face. And a believable character, too. As much as she is a victim and even men seem to respond to a strong female protagonist, she's an effective element in the film at making you believe things aren't right. More than what you see floating on the surface. She's especially worn toward the end of the film, when Jack begins stalking her. Her eyes just light up with a fever-pitch of fear and terror. Without her, there is no true "horror" to this film.</fullReview>

The visuals, cinematography, Kubrick's's direction and the performances are brilliant and are what make this film a masterpiece. The use of camera angles, imagery and Jack Nicholson's presence are what make this film unmissable and keep you glued to the whole film. The film is a complete work of art, the way each scene is set out and the atmosphere that the film has is so realistic. In words, a film that can't be missed, I have to argue that this film is a much better horror film than "The Exorcist" thanks to Kubrick &amp; Nicholson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Feminist Horror Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a guy with a past history of alcohol and child abuse. He is a writer who takes a job as winter caretaker of a rocky mountain hotel, even though he intends for his wife to do all the work while he writes a novel. We are told that he "used" to be a teacher and we are left to wonder if more abusive behavior towards kids is why he left the profession.Unknown to Jack, his son Danny is a gifted psychic and knew even before he was formally offered the job that there was something very bad about the Overlook Hotel. But Torrance is blind to the true character/needs of his wife and child and takes the job anyway.We get the usual forewarning about dire events ahead. The son doesn't want to go, the manager mentions it is built on an old Indian burial ground and that a previous caretaker went nuts there (he doesn't mention the violence he perpetrated against his wife and children).Scatman Crothers is the head chef at the hotel and recognizes Danny Torrance as psychic at once, as he is psychic himself. Danny never met another psychic and they form a bond. Crothers does a great job in this role.As the isolation of the remote snowed in location seeps in, Danny starts to recognize the psychic horrors in the place as does Jack and Wendy Torrance. Danny tries to get help by psychically contacting Crothers character and Wendy turns out to be far stronger than she appears in defense of her child against the now insane Jack and the evil that has infected him. The evil characters even complain to Jack that Wendy is stronger than he knew.Reality and the evil alternate universe that lives at the hotel begin to fuse even for the very grounded Mom, Wendy. She vividly portrays her horror and her determination to save her child and herself.People focus on Jack Nicholson's character but Shelley Duval and the child actor to me are the real focus of this movie. They show they have strengths and resilience to evil that in the end save their lives from the abusive and easily susceptible to evil Jack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor correction to synopsis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I visited The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, CO this past Sunday. The Stanley was the inspiration for the hotel in The Shining, but filming was not actually done in this hotel. Rather than look back through 900+ comments made about this movie and maybe the synopsis, I just wish to make a correction: The room that housed the ghosts and horror that went with it was not room 237 as the synopsis mentioned - it was room 217. They sell souvenir brass keys to that room at the hotel gift shop, and from what I understand, there's over a 3-year waiting list to stay in that particular room! And be willing to pay the price, as it's a very beautiful, exclusive resort hotel with all the class imaginable and amazing Rocky Mountain views too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small shout out to Ms. Duvall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a plug - as I've not found one in any other review - for Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy.She's a pathetic figure, utterly overwhelmed by the mounting problems she faces from all sides - including the man supposed to be her protector. She squeals, snivels and screams - and yet somehow comes through, driven by her maternal instinct to protect her son even at her own risk.She and Danny are ultimately saved by the bravery of Halloran and the Sno-Cat he brings to the hotel; and by Danny's cunning in the kitchen and the maze. But also by her own efforts: reviled, outsmarted, unloved and unlovely, she nevertheless battles her terror, Jacks homicidal rage and the hotel's resident evil to rescue them both.Other reviewers have described her character as an Olive Oyl lookalike. Wendy is not a glamorous character: her lank hair, unmade face and utilitarian clothing don't attract. Her whining dependency and weak, useless passivity in the face of Jack's anger do nothing to endear her. It's hard not to have some sympathy with Jack.And yet, when forced to the brink, Wendy handles the business: the lucky blow she lands on Jack with the bat puts him out of action long enough to lock him in the only truly secure room available. Only the direct intervention of the hotel ghosts brings Jack back into play. In the bathroom she cuts him badly enough to delay his axe attack until he's distracted by Halloran. She has the sense to go for the Sno-Cat, and the fortitude to wait for Danny to emerge from the maze before she flees. Weaker than Jack, and much less smart than Danny, she's nevertheless the instrument of her own deliverance. Well done, that ratbag! One other small note: if you're a writer who cares about his creations, *don't* sell your film rights to Kubrick (something that's become easier recently). He will take your core idea and make his own film out of it - and you won't like the result, not least because it will be a better creation than yours. I only wish he'd lived long enough to make his version of AI before it was turned to pap by that wretch Spielberg.CD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly terrifying. Scariest horror film in existence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to Stanley Kubrick, you might say that I am an avid viewer of his work, but not a fanatic. Don't get me wrong, I love Lolita, Dr.Strangelove, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, but they are just not some of my favorite films. The Shining, on the other hand, is in my Top 15 films ever made. I've read the Stephen King novel over ten times, seen the film over thirty times, and they both scare the living daylights out of me.Let me set the record straight. I haven't been a big horror genre fan since the late 1990's. Horror films have become nothing but a simple way to make easy money, rather than creating a quality scary movie. Like I said before, I've seen The Shining countless times and it still remains completely terrifying. Every time I finish watching it, I am always peering over my shoulder on the lookout for a wild-eyed Mr. Torrence or a freakish pair of dead twins.The roles of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall), and Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) could not have been better cast. The signature trademarks of these three are Nicholson's utter insanity, Duvall's look of terror, and Danny's reaction to the mysteriousness of the Overlook. The supporting roles were brilliant as well: Scatman Crothers as the cautious Dick Hallorann, Barry Nelson as the strict and fast-paced Stuart Ullman, and Joe Turkel as the creepy, yet welcoming, bartender Joe.The cinematography is truly fabulous. Before the chaos ensues, the viewer already feels the cold chill running down their spine due to the appearance of The Overlook. Kubrick gives it an incredibly spine-chilling feel, especially when Jack starts losing his mind. The scene with Jack at the party in The Gold Room is off the wall creepy! Everything from his discussion with the bartender, to his encounter with Delbert Grady in the restroom is pure horrific genius.Last but not least, I need to mention the fact that The Shining has one of the most brilliant endings in cinematic history. Granted, I already knew what the ending was before I watched the film for the first time, but nonetheless Kubrick pulled it off with style. I've introduced this film to so many friends and family members, and they all have one thing in common by the end of the film: a look of complete shock and awe. Kubrick's visionary tale of the classic Stephen King novel will dominate the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more assets than liabilities, a fun film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'll try a synopsis of this movie. That isn't easy, because there are basically three points of view throughout. A writer takes a job overseeing a desolate hotel, which for some reason is completely isolated during the winter, with no one around. He, his beautiful wife, and his troubled young son are all alone in a haunted hotel. The people who leave him there seem to know it is haunted, too. The writer, we learn later, is trouble, too. The film is purposely ambiguous as to whether he arrived deranged, or whether the ghosts he meets drive him to insanity. Some will like the chilling scenes. It is a fun movie, and it is scary. Others will not like some of the ambiguity, nor the fact that the writer seems to go crazy all at once. However, a second look shows that he may not have come unhinged in one second. The tell tale scene is when his wife finds part of his manuscript to see what he has written. It denotes that he has been crazy for some time. The young son is trouble, but "gifted", with some ability to sense hauntings. For some reason, this makes him a sort of target. Why? Probably more for effect than actual cause. To accept the premise of the movie, you need to accept the premise that the ghosts are the result of some actual intelligence, and that this intelligence is some evil of the usual Hollywood undying evil sort. A lot of interesting scenes make this movie enjoyable enough. It has mixed reviews, but overall, it has many more assets than liabilities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A novelist - Jack Torrance take a job interview as winter caretaker of the isolated, old, huge and beautiful Overlook Hotel. In the interview, Jack is told by the manager himself, that the previous caretaker - Grady, chopped his family and later killed himself with a shotgun. Ignoring the story, Jack brings his wife - Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd). It happens that Danny, has a mysterious power known as "The Shining" that shows him things from the past and future. Some of the visions come from Tony - "the little boy who lives in Danny's mouth". Danny meets Hallorann - the hotel cook in their first day arriving at the Overlook, who also has this "Shining" and he warns him about the hotel and the sinister Room 237. As the days go by, Danny has visions of previous guests and employees who died at the hotel years before, meanwhile Jack starts driving into insanity, turning more and more aggressive, at the point that Danny and Wendy gets convinced that Jack might try to do the same thing, Grady did.Great movie and a perfect script. The ending is also like WOW!!!!!Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity, Sexual Situations and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible adaptation by Stanley Kubrick of a legendary piece of fiction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece has got to counted as one of my top ten horror movies of all time. There's nothing graphic or fast-paced to it to leave you hiding under your seat; the movie itself is actually quite slow, relying on a build up of tension and vastly unpredictable and psychological experience to frighten and thrill the viewer.My favourite element of The Shining has to be the mix of the psychological and supernatural experiences Jack Torrence goes through. The unknown and the unexplained is really what makes a horror movie for me, and I deeply enjoyed trying to figure this out.The Shining was amongst other classic Horrors such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Carrie that my mother refused to let me watch as a child, when I was most intrigued by the horror genre. Having only watched it recently, 8 years later, I've concluded it is a classic simply everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you know where to look there are hundreds of obvious references to special numbers from beginning to end, well-hidden changes in the colors of possessions and surroundings, important shots filmed entirely in mirrors, and many props that visually disappear than re-appear and move around throughout the movie. Stanley Kubrick's Shining brings 'hidden in plain sight' to a brand new level and the movie is a cinematic maze of clues and purposeful visual anomalies and numbers just waiting to be discovered by viewers and leading eventually to the date at the end and something outside of the movie.

		<shortDescription>Kubrick vs King - A Comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say this right off the bat, the Kubrick version is the superior movie while the King/ Garris version is the superior adaptation.What's wrong with the Kubrick version?His misses out on certain very important plot elements. Jack seems to be crazy from the beginning. Jack's alcoholism is not as known as it should be. The Overlook only seems to be haunted in one or two scenes, the rest could be cabin fever. The breakdown of the family is not so clear, Jack and Danny don't seem to really love each other as much as they should. Differs greatly from the book.What's right with Kubrick's version?Superior directing. A very definitive style. Classic scenes ("Here's Johnny!"). Excellent acting. Danny seems to really be his age. Wendy really seems to be scared. Jack really does seem crazy when he's supposed to be. A very good horror movie in general. The hotel is much more imposing. Foreboding music helps to set mood. Differs greatly from the book (I'll explain why it's in both later).What's wrong with the King/Garris version?It suffers from many TV-Movie problems. The actors aren't quite as good. They use CGI when puppets, wires, or trick camera shooting could be equally effective. CGI looks out of place. Danny talks like a twenty-year old, although the same problem was in the book. Jack is fine when it comes to being Mr. Every Dad but he doesn't seem to be crazy when he's supposed to be. Jack's transformation doesn't seem so gradual as it should, Wendy says "You're old drinking habits have all come back" when the book shows each one pop up. It's the book, very little is changed so if you've read the book you pretty much know exactly what happens.What's right with King/Garris' version?It's not a remake of Kubrick's movie, it's a movie version's of King's book. It's the book, if you loved the book and are a die hard fan you'll love this. Very little is changed. Minor subplots are changed but movie works well without them. You get pretty much everything the Kubrick version left out.Which one?It depends. If you loved the book and are a die hard Stephan King fan then watch the Garris TV miniseries. If you are a regular movie fan or a Kubrick fan then watch the Kubrick version. Garris' is for the book fans. Kubrick's is for the non book fans.Final Thoughts.It's not really fair to compare the two movies. Each one has their own pros and cons. Kubrick's is more of a movie using the basic premise of the haunted hotel and the father who goes crazy. It's meant to be a movie that's not just a page by page adaptation of the book. Which you got to admire Kubrick for doing that. He did something that even those who memorized the book would be surprised and scared. But Garris did something that the die hard Stephan King fans can love. It depends on who you are. It is definitely not fair to compare the two since they are both very different from each other. Both are good in their own separate ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read "The Shining" by Stephen King, so I can't compare with the book. When I was going to see this movie, I had high expectations about it, because it gets mostly very good comments. And indeed, it was a pretty good movie, but not a masterpiece like many people say. Director Stanley Kubrick did a very good job directing this (the atmosphere was very creepy), and Jack Nicholson is excellent in his role. Shelley Duvall I find less good. She acts well, but screams too much, certainly near the end of the film. The music is very good and this movie contains some excellent cinematic shots. You should try to see this movie as soon as you can. Your time won't be wasted!P.S.: The scene in the snow is brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but disappointing compared to the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes I have to admit this is one of the most haunting films you are ever likely to see, but if you have an active imagination and have read the book you'll find out this film is sometimes jolty and at annoying. Having seen the film last night and read the book the week before I can tell ypu quite truthfully that King had a right of not liking the film version. For a start it completely blocks out why Jack goes mad apart from his little family problem and his drinking problem, cutting out the ghostly Lloyd. In fact it cuts from right at the beginning to right to the very end and the gradual descent into madness is so much more terrifying. I have to admit that when it did deviate from the book at the end, fellow readers of the novel will agree, Kubrick unleashes his directorial skills and creates one of the most frightening dream-like sequence. I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it but the maze sequence with the footprints is just brilliant. Now this is the question that really bugs me. Does anyone know why the party is centred for the spooks? Write a review and PLEASE TELL ME!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Time Ever When I Was Laughing and Screaming At the Same Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" is, to me, the lone great horror film. Horror films have been on the decline lately, as the only ones to have actually impressed me in the past five years are "The Ring" and "The Descent". But look back and watch "The Shining". It doesn't need "BOO!" moments to scare you, it just needs your patience. It's truly terrifying.There are certain moments that stick out considerably. My favorite scene happens to involve Jack Torrance (Nicholson, in his best performance ever) and the old caretaker named Mr. Grady. I was so creeped out. It almost scarred me for life when it came to the "237" scene.The performances are exceptional. As I mentioned, Jack Nicholson is amazing. The best "Over-the-top" performance ever. His dialouge coming up the stairs with Shelly Duvall is wonderful. Duvall, in herself, is also great. By being a normal housewife. Some scenes combine laughter and horror together beautifully. The famous bathroom scene is a perfect example.Stanley Kubrick isn't one of my favorite film makers (I didn't like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and I hated "Eyes Wide Shut") but this is probably his second best film ("A Clockwork Orange" barely topping it).This is a great movie. See it. Now. "Little pigs, little pigs..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though an amazing masterpiece Stanley Kubrrick CANT call it 'The Shining'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a great movie the fact of the matter is, it's not "Stanley Kubricks"'The Shining'. Stephen King thought of an amazing and wonderful tale of the pain of your loved on trying to kill you, in a way Stanley Kubrick stole Stephen King's beloved masterpiece and remade it. People that saw the movie read the book thinking it is the same but they are disappointed because either the book was better but different, or the book was worse and different. Then die hard Stephen King fans are disappointed at this because it is either better then the book or worse.Personally, I like the book better but I still love the movie. So both S.K. fans can argue of which is better when I'm sorta in between(sorta by the 8). Now just because Stanley did make up an entirely different story doesn't mean you have to hate it. I like it. It's just that Stephen King puts more suspense and chills and complexity then a man going crazy over his family in a secluded hotel in the winter. Another thing that makes Stephen Kings better too is that HE DID NOT GO CRAZY! The hotel ghost possessed him and made him think about how bad his family is and that they should be 'punished'. Also the roque mallet was something I wanted to see Jack use. An ax does fit a psychopath but no one WOULD EVER THINK OF A ROQUE MALLET! That is pure wood and rubber and is much more effective and terrifying then an ax. Also there were no living hedge animal... I WANTED TO SEE HOLORANN FIGHT OFF THE HEDGE ANIMALS! And why in a snow chance in hell would Wendy be Shelly? WENDY WAS TO HAVE BLONDE HAIR! The last thing I would have appreciated seeing would be the man in the dog suit chasing Danny in his dreams. that gave me nightmares and fears of my hall, imagine what seeing it in the movie? I wouldn't be able to go to the bathroom without a flashlight(only 13 here). Finally I liked both endings but the books was better. I mean the hotel blowing up, hedge animals burning, Jack telling off the ghosts when he lets Danny and others go and guards the boiler so it can blow up. Also Jack killing himself by a hard smack with a wooden mallet! Awesome!Now comes why I liked Stanley's. Though I didn't want it to happen I liked how Holloran died. Also I loved Jack Nicholson. Though Jack Torrance was not to be that evil Jack Nicholson is a terrifying man. He's got the happy/irritated grin yet it contains such evil. Also there is the 'All work and no play' thing. I like the suspense and how he has the talk with Wendy in the lobby. Finally(like i said in previous paragraph)I like this ending just a little less then the books but it's still very Gothic and great.So in conclusion the two S.K. fighters can have their war over a silly movie and book mis-copyright but I could care less. The movie does act like the book in the beginning to about just before the middle so there isn't much to complain, and there are parts that were in the book it's just Stanley modified them(ex. Book:elevator continuously moving, Movie:elevator full of blood). So enjoy or... don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS At the Overlook Hotel* Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a writer who cannot seem to be able to write anymore accepts the job of caretaker at the Overlook Hotel; but he doesn't know that the hotel is haunted, and for Jack's wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall at her ugliest) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd), it's going to be a nightmare brought to life...Stephen King doesn't like this movie because it strays a lot from the source material, his book (which I have bought but not yet read), but as a horror film, it works on every single level, ESPECIALLY the acting; who can forget Jack Nicholson's faces, or his 'Heere's Johnny!' (or in my case, having seen the Italian version first, 'Sono il Lupo Cattivo!' ('I am the Big Bad Wolf!') with great voice acting by the amazing Giancarlo Giannini).The DVD edition only amplifies the feeling of terror you get from this movie; the only problem I have with that is that the movie's the North American Version, and since Kubrick had personally insisted that the sentence Jack repeated over and over on paper was translated using a proverb in each language (in Italian, it's 'Il Mattino Ha L'Oro In Bocca' ('Early Morning Has Gold In Its Mouth')), this kind of feels like a rape of this masterpiece.The Shining: 10/10.The Shining Italian VHS: 10/10 The Shining Italian DVD: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is one of the scariest films ever made. And possibly my personal favorite movie of all time. But it uses hardly any of the gore-based cheap frights making up the typical late 70s-80s slasher flicks such as the Friday 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street series. And that is its strength.The art of Kubrik's film-making makes the fear come almost purely from the tenseness of the atmosphere that he manages to create. You feel something bad is going to happen from the first scene and this just builds up throughout the film. In many ways the horror comes from what we EXPECT to happen more than what we actually see. The feeling of foreboding, partly put across by the musical score and harrowing symbolic imagery, is what the film hinges on. It is riveting from the opening credits to the end and powerful acting, great scenery/cinematography and a tense suspenseful plot also add to its power.Kubrik's The Shining is a real masterpiece that also has enough plot twists and possible interpretations to let itself be watched again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson saves the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with the film has three good scenes. Not much for a two hours movie that some people rate very high. The first good scene is the opening panorama shot which is more than good and one might think this is the right movie to sit through, unfortunately it falls down minute by minute. Based on a novel by Stephen King director Stanley Kubrik tries to tell the story of the writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) who takes a job in an empty hotel in winter Colorado together with his wife and son. His job is to heat the rooms because of frost damages. In the beginning (2nd scene) it is told him that a man who had the job years ago killed his wife and daughters because he couldn't stand the loneliness of the empty hotel ...Then problems occur, not only for Jack who is going mad like the man years ago, but also for Kubrick and his co-screenplay writer. They do not find a concept to translate King's novel into a good film. They take elements out of it (Jack's son has supernatural powers) that do not work in a movie even if it is two hours long. A more coherent scenario would have been to focus on Jack and his visions. This leads to the second good scene. In one of his visions Jack meets the man who has killed his family and who was a former waiter in the hotel. This is a subtle and well written horror scene and we see that Jack is now taking this man as a model of his own behavior towards his family.The third good scene is Nicholson's acting before Duval hits him with a baseball bat. This is brilliant acting in a furious monologue. We can also add the scene where he speaks to Duval in a closed room (interesting camera angle too).Generally the movie is way too long and way too boring. It lacks of a good and tight concept and Kubrick's direction disappoints again.</fullReview>

The acting is good, well, except for Shelly Duvall. The music consists of Pizzicato violins. The only scene with a lot of blood is the blood in the elevator. Another frightening scene is the pages in Jack's book. Everything in the book is "All work and no play make Jack a dull boy." written over and over and over.

		<shortDescription>"The Shining" will ice your guts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every film genre has its own characteristics. So does horror. There are some golden rules and hints that some directors totally forget to check out before or while they shoot their movie.First of all, horror is not visual. It's mental. Your eyes can't judge whether something is scary or not. It's your brain that does. Eyes are only a tool.Many contemporary directors shoot their horror films by putting visually-dazzling images and think that it will do the job. But it's what's inside that counts...Stanley Kubrick understood that. But he did more than that. What Kubrick did with "The Shining" is that he created that is as scary by its visuals than its mental representations.The reason why Stanley Kubrick succeeds in every genre he works with is because he searches for the most essential essence of each one of them and exploits it the effective way.While the majority of filmmakers effectively work with zombies (George A. Romero) or vicious serial killers (John Carpenter) which could become menaces themselves, Kubrick works with a haunted hotel, filled with ghosts, which aim a particular target: mind. And there's nothing that can be done about it.The three main actors are the main reason why "The Shining" is such a masterpiece. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is the main target of the Overlook's ghosts and his peaceful existence is quickly turned upside down by what happens. Kubrick's choice of casting him was controversial because he already looked slightly insane, even in normal mode. That might be true, but we must admit that, once put in berserk mode, nobody is as maniacal as Jack Nicholson. And the actor proves it in a chilling way here.Shelley Duvall, often mentally-challenged by director Kubrick during the production, is very effective as Wendy Torrance. And especially at the end, when Jack crashes the bathroom's door and when she meets ghosts herself.But my predilection goes to Danny Lloyd, who plays Danny Torrance. He's probably the most effective of all the actors present in the movie. His cold face and his dramatic voice are appalling.As it's a Kubrick film, it's inevitable that special camera tricks and movements should be present. In "The Shining", we quickly think about the legendary use of the Steadicam during Danny's ride in the hotel's corridors and the maze excursions. Kubrick's trademark zoom moves were heavily used in his previous movies, but they've never been as effective as here. Zooms perfectly catch the scary moods expressed by the characters and create a sense of suspense and fear, which is what's needed in such a movie. There are also these almost-one-frame shots, which are effectively scary and thrilling.There are numerous unforgettable moments and lines during the movie and some of them have become a part of modern pop culture. Some lines, such as "Redrum", "All work and no Play make Jack a dull boy" and the chilling "Here's Johnny!" are now considered as icons of the horror genre.Some of the scariest scenes include the two hypnotic girls in blue dresses that Danny meets and Jack's smashing down the door with an axe. But the scariest scene of the movie is Dick's murder. Jack kills Dick and, at the same moment, Danny screams in his hiding place, due to his "shining" gift."The Shining" is a horror masterpiece, because it goes deep in the delicate parts of our minds and the way that these scares are depicted is as delicious as a Halloween candy. So don't waste your time in watching ridiculous 'trailer' movies, made to be Kraft dinner for your eyes. Just remember that movies like "The Shining" contain the pure fluids of the horror genre and must be watched before today's horror messes. It gives you more adrenaline wherever you watch it and by renting it and watching it at home, you save money.And just a friendly advice: don't watch it before going to bed. I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Year at the Overlook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is Stanley Kubrick's only horror film and one of his very best. The movie is based upon the Stephen King novel by the same name and tells the story of a struggling writer ? Jack Torrance who moves with his wife ? Wendy and son - Danny to an eerie hotel in the middle of nowhere as winter caretakers. While Jack gradually descends into madness, Danny starts having visions of the hotel's horrifying past and of even more terrifying events that will happen in a near future. From the opening scene of Jack's car travelling alone in the mountains, with the haunting Dies Irae remix by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind, you know you are in for a scary yet beautiful experience. You may ask how can a horror film be beautiful? It is a fact that only a few movies were able to do "beautiful horrors", most notably, Georges Franju's "Les Yeux sans Visage", Dario Argento's "Suspiria" and Mario Bava's "Black Sunday". Not only masterfully directed by a movie genius, the film also counts with marvelous acting from the four leads actors: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duval, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers. But also, you must take note that the hotel itself is a very important, if not, the most important character in the movie. While watching The Shining we ? the audience become the very eyes of the Overlook Hotel, who watch every step of those inside it's walls. We must also congratulate Lisa and Louise Burns who plays the ghostly twins, and which if they were not in the film, it wouldn't be that scary. But then again, how great is an actor without a great director behind him? According to several interviews with the cast and crew, Stanley made the actors near the edge, most likely Mrs. Duval, who plays the wife Wendy, so that the hysteria and desperate scenes would seem realistic, and well, it really was worth the hard work. The Shining is a film that must stand up there with classics such as Citizen Kane, Rear Window, 2001 and Casablanca. It's not a mere horror film, it's not for everyone, it's a true classic that even many years from now, while some will be forgotten in time, will remain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not For Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two distinct things about this movie: the novel that stood as reference and Kubrick as an entity. They are like those geometric forms that you have to combine. One is a perfect cube and one is a perfect triangle hole in the wall, but they do not match ( go see Fight Club and read the novel to understand what I mean. The director and the writer match and seems like one ). Now if you have not read the book, you may consider this movie a masterpiece coming from Kubrick. On the other side if you read the book and have no knowledges about movies, and Kubrick, then this movie will suck ass just like Carrie. If you are not familiar with none above then this movie should be OK, maybe just a little bit old.For those who read the novel and know Kubrick's work this movie will be so confusing that you will spend your entire life not knowing if you hated it or if you loved it.Why to hate it? Well I'm not saying that Stephen King is a very complex writer, but he surely tries to spread some messages through his books. The Shining was a good read, and with lots of messages and many weird things. And this is the main problem. A lot of those messages did not came with the movie ( the wasps' nest, Tony, the most tensed part of the book where Danny reach into his father head, the big explosion, etc., and finally one of the most important thing: Wendy's smile from the end) Beside that, Wendy's past is totally give it away in the movie and the book is very much about her. The book is a road of initiation for her and Danny ( Jack Torrance is just a victim !!!). There where moments in the film when I went: "Oh my God!!! What the f**k is going on. They missed that part and that part and that part." " Oh my God!!! No No No. Why ? Why ?"Why to love it? Not because it's a good horror ( which in my humble opinion it is not ) but because it's a work of art. The image is outstanding. Every moment of the film could be put as an wallpaper. Simply amazing. The lights, the shadows, the angles, the majesty ( which by the way all-in-all does not match the feeling from the book ). All mixed with a very good sound. Beside that, the cast is quite good. Nicholson is in one of his best role, and Danny Lloyd does a great job. The problem could be once again Shelly Duvall. She acts horrible. The only thing that keeps her in is her unusual face ( just like Sigourney Weaver ).While I enjoyed watching another Kubrick's masterpiece I got the feeling that something was wrong with this one and to be honest I have not expected to be otherwise. This film was not for Kubrick, and I believe many of you think so. ( maybe it had been better if they changed its name, cause for many this movie is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining ).</fullReview>

A man of Pride, within a few short days the SANE man becomes as INSANE as they come. Something in this man's complex and confused mind triggers and he soon becomes delusional and an unsound minded human being who is confused with his family and tries to kill them his work not working. 'REDRUM' reverse it 'MURDER' Danny yells out...'REDRUM, REDRUM, REDRUM'!The film has to be viewed from start to finish because of this film being very complex. Jack Nicholson gives a extraordinary performance as always it has been Jack Nicholson's most disguised and critically acclaimed movie. And why because of one of the most unforgettable lines 'HERE'S JOHNNY'This line become so famous, along-side this brilliant chilling motion picture. Very soon the famous scene of Jack breaking down the door with an axe and Wendy screaming in terror, it takes so long for Jack to break down the door, and you're with on every swing.

		<shortDescription>Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeere's the Shining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly one of the greatest horror films. Ironic in a way because horror movies are notorious for over-the-top gore and stomach-churning scenes which this film almost has none of such antics.In fact this film is almost like a satire of such gory films, (eg. the scene where Jack wielding a axe looks like he's just about kill his wife until he's interrupted, losing interest and then walks away). This film must have been considered terrifying in 1980 although now, while it still maintains its' eeriness, Jack Nicholson's flamboyant performance may have some laughing.What is unique about this film is that it makes you THINK, rather than presenting the answers to everything in front of you. The beauty of not knowing is what makes this films one of the truly eerie films of all time.The plot sounds basic enough - a recovering alcoholic is hired to be the caretaker of a grand hotel, and takes his traumatized wife and child. Things go smoothly for a while... until Jack sees - or thinks he sees - ghosts of child murderers, naked femme fatales, sinister looking barmen and self-contained waiters. His son is in no better place, who keeps having weird, unsettling hallucinations about the hotel.As the film progresses, Jack quickly becomes obnoxious, lazy, grouchy, intimidating, anti-social and withdrawn. He especially is obnoxious to his wife, Wendy, with whom he can not have a normal, loving relationship with, and acts intimidating towards his son, Danny, while saying he would never harm him or his mother.For those looking for intelligent, well-crafted, solid, neat little horror films, check Stanely Kubrick's classic THE SHINING.</fullReview>

He scared me whenever Wendy found his All Work and No Play Makes Jack A Dull Boy papers and he completely went nuts on her and she ended up knocking him out.

		<shortDescription>OK-ish movie - brilliant directing and with a great actor, but the rest is rather disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Things I liked about this film: I give this movie 4/10 stars because the directing was brilliant, since it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, and also because Jack Nicholson is a very good actor and excellent with his role of Jack Torrance.Things I didn't like: But apart from that, this movie fails to impress me. I think that overall it was quite a ridiculous excuse for a horror film. Lots of parts made me laugh, for example the bathroom scene with the young woman turning into the old woman was quite stupid.This film was, I admit it, one of the scariest I have seen in a long time, but it just doesn't scare me quite as much as it might some other people who thought this was a better film.The movie overdid it with all the ghosts and blood and that sort of thing. And the little boy getting all these visions was another ridiculous aspect of this film. The only interesting part was the end, it's nice to see how they're trying to escape, and the ending was kind of satisfactory. They escaped and he died, so what had happened those years ago was reversed, let's say, but still I think it would have worked better if (I can't believe I'm saying this!) the movie had followed the Amityville Horror's example and made Jack go sane again once he left the hotel.The ending could have been improved by making Jack return to sanity again once he escaped from the hotel, and the spirits from the hotel were coming after the family or something like that. That would have worked much better and would have helped me to enjoy it more, but like I said, this film is not a good horror film and I do not enjoy thrillers with supernatural happenings involved in them. I much better prefer thrillers with actual murderers.So, all in all, I only recommend this film for people who would like to get pretty freaked out, but if you're not in that kind of mood, or if you're not in the mood to watch a supernatural thriller, then don't watch this film. If you don't get scared easily by movies, and are like me, who think that supernatural thrillers are all rather pointless and stupid, then The Shining is not for you. It's not a "good" horror film, but if you do watch it, make sure you don't watch it alone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological Terror At Its Finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is based on Stephen King's equally-terrifying book, and is about a family - Jack (Jack Nicholson), Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd), who go to be temporary caretakers at the Overlook Hotel during the winter season while it's closed. Everything begins to change soon when they arrive at the hotel, and Jack finds out that one of the previous caretakers took an axe, slaughtered his wife, and his two twin girls, slicing them into tiny pieces. Wendy begins to notice strange behavior in Jack, and meanwhile Danny realizes he has the ability the "shine", or to read minds without speaking, and experiencing visions of past events.I saw "The Shining" at a very young age (I was about nine or ten years old), and afterwards I couldn't sleep for days. Truly a marvel of psychological horror, this is likely one of the scariest horror movies of all time. Stephen King's novel was excellent as well, and this film adaptation is probably the best of all of them (I'd say "'Salem's Lot" comes in second place). The plot is thick and complex, and the crafting of it is truly masterful. And this film brings all of King's visions to life in a horrifying manner. Director Kubrick uses some excellent camera-work that should be noted for - lots of long pans, zooms, and lengthy shots that add a certain style to the film (his style, perhaps). The film's bizarre ending may be a little hard to understand, but as a note, it is much different from the novel, as is a lot of the film.But there is a handful of truly bizarre (but truly petrifying) scenes in this movie that are guaranteed to stick with you for years, I know they did me. Everything from the blood-filled elevator, the woman in room 237, and the iconic murdered twin girls who roam the halls of the Overlook, make for some extremely terrifying scenes. Great acting from Jack Nicholson as well as the paranoid, crazed Jack, probably one of his best performances ever (besides "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"). Shelley Duvall is also wonderful as Jack's hysterical and terrified wife, and Danny Lloyd plays their son well too. Although some don't agree, this is one scary movie. The intense, claustrophobic atmosphere and the overall scary plot are what make it such a terrifying film. Another neat piece of info is that I live about a half an hour away from Mt. Hood in Oregon, and they shot the exteriors at the Timberline Lodge, which makes the lodge an interesting attraction to visit. Anyways, this is a truly terrifying movie, probably one of the creepiest I think I've seen. Definitely a must-see for horror fans. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this movie late on a stormy night... but not if you've got a heart condition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's take a look at some other movies that have been based on the books of the brilliant (and, obviously, slightly insane) Stephen King. One of my firm favorites is, and always will be, Ride the Bullet (based on a short story of the same name). Whilst remaining pretty much true to the original story, it managed to turn a book that takes just under forty minutes to read into a movie masterpiece that goes for over two hours, adding some scenes, deleting none.The Shining is an altogether different story. It uses the book sort of like an outline for the movie, not quite staying true to the story but not deviating from it in a massive way. It also manages, without even really trying, to be one of the most terrifying movies that I have watched in quite a while.The basic plot is this: a man (Jack Tarrance by name) takes the job of winter caretaker at the isolated Overview Hotel, so as to work on writing his book. Throw into this the fact that he takes his family along with him and the fact that the place is haunted by evil spirits, and you've got a recipe for horror waiting to happen, in the form of demonic possessions and attempted murder with a fire-axe.One of the best parts of the movie is the feeling of complete and utter isolation the viewer experiences merely from watching the movie. The snow, the mountainous setting, the vastness of the rooms of the hotel and the complete and utter lack of people all come together to paint a picture of complete and utter bleakness.The brief glimpses of the vengeful spirits inhabiting the hotel don't really terrify; rather, they unsettle the viewer, and plant the seeds of creepy dreams once you've finished watching the film.This is by far one of Jack Nicholson's better films. His portrayal of a man slowly sinking deeper into the depths of insanity is utterly convincing, and his alternately snarling and dementedly gleeful face serve to unnerve the viewer to the point of almost turning away from the screen.Shelly Duval's terrified screams are high pitched and ear grating, and seem almost to verge on the point of irritating. Somehow this just lends more weight to the viewing experience. Danny Lloyd's performance as Jack Torrance's son is also brilliant, and his psychic flashes are brilliantly and creepily executed.If you plan on watching this movie, do so in a pitch black room, late on a stormy night... but not if you've got a heart condition. Just make sure to read the book first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb slice of eighties horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: This is a review of the 115 minute UK version released on R2 DVD.Quite possibly one of the best horror films ever made, this is quite possibly one of Stanley Kubrick's most accessible films in the latter part of the directorial career, a dark slice of isolationist horror that uses every trick it can muster to scare the living hell out of the audience, from Jack Nicholson running around with an axe, gory death scenes, ghosts, a perverse scene of semi-sexual activity, you name it and unsurprisingly the film is good, brilliant in fact. It is so easy to single handedly praise Nicholson's performance on it's own, but is merely one aspect of what makes this film so great to watch. First of all there is the direction from Kubrick himself. I'll be honest, I have a love hate relationship with Kubrick's films. I love Full Metal Jacket, Spartacus, Dr Strangelove and of course this film here, but others like A Clockwork Orange and Lolita have tended to leave this viewer cold, I tend to like my films on a more visceral level and I suppose that is the main reason I love The Shining as this is possibly one of his most aesthetically more enjoyable films. It has more of a roller-coaster thrill ride aspect to it rather than the cold aesthetics of 2001 and Barry Lyndon.Of course the film does takes its time to get going, but this adds to the fun as you can feel the tension growing as the film goes on, you can almost feel the possibly supernatural psychosis growing in Jack Torrence with each passing of every minute, Nicholson becoming more and more frightening as the film goes on. The same goes for the performances from Shelly Duvall and Danny Lloyd. You can almost feel the tension building in everyone before the terrifying last half hour begins and it's a testament to Kubrick's handling of the material that you almost feel their emotions as the film goes on. When Duvall as Wendy starts shouting with terror as Jack goes all Johnny Carson on the audience with an axe, you almost feel like shouting with her, likewise when Danny is running through the maze with an axe wielding Jack after him you almost feel like running with him.The Shining is a superb piece of horror film-making, a tiring and emotionally burning movie and wears its horror genre credentials on its sleeve. Recently Channel 4 in the UK voted it the scariest film ever made. I don't know if I would go that far, I believe that The Exorcist deserves that title, but The Shining is not far behind. As thrilling and entertaining the film is, it is deeply unsettling, this, like The Exorcist, is a pure horror film and does what the horror genre can do so well when treated right, which is to take a mundane and realistic situation and to turn it into a story that makes the palms wet and the nails shorter. Like the best horror movies, The Shining is no mere popcorn entertainment, it is a trip into the darkness of the human condition. The fact that it is entertaining and thrilling to watch, doesn't detract from the fact that it is also a disturbing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining being the best movie of all time gets this review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Review-The Description:If you think The Shining is going to be a pleasant sun shining filled movie, think again. Stanley Kubrick made an ultimate horror movie that for some, will make you cringe... some, will make you laugh... and even some, will make you want to come back and observe anything you missed the first time you watched it! Recently seeing in a magazine a review with Jack Nicholson, oddly enough they didn't even bring up THE SHINING! I felt it was his best movie other than his performance as the Joker in the Batman, for he's a great villain! Onwards with THE STORY! The Story: Jack Nicholson plays as Jack Torrance, a writer/recovering alcoholic *nice combo*... the movie starts off with us looking over a large sierra from a helicopter's view... as Jack drives to The Overlook Hotel. There, he gets the job as the Winter Caretaker... not even phased by the fact that the "Tragedy of 1970" where the original Winter Caretaker Delbert Grady *Philip Stone* went crazy and chopped his family up then killed himself.Jack brings up his family, Wendy Torrance *Shelley Duvall* and Danny Torrance *Danny Lloyd*, and they begin their lovely five month stay at the beautiful and renowned Overlook Hotel. Everything seems pretty nice eh? Being boxed up in a large mansion for five months... nah ah. From even the beginning of the movie you realize something is not usual with the hotel, and ghosts, yes GHOSTS haunt the hotel! Not usual ghosts, they look like humans... they are more like beings that once existed there, but they have full control of the hotel... later Jack will be tempted by the evil side, and slowly begin to go insane... some of us perhaps remember the scene with Jack and Lloyd the Ghost at the bar... very funny. All I can say is it's one of the best movies ever, possibly the best horror movie as well due to the plot, great acting, and scenes... and of course, my favorite movie.My Opinion: While watching it when it was on the channel A&amp;E, I noticed they only gave it 3 stars... which is not bad I guess, but it was a movie among movies, especially years ago. Even NOW I still feel it's one of the best among all, I cannot stand those new horror movies that they think suspense is someone behind a mask with a knife coming to get you out of nowhere *cough* Scream *cough*. No... horror is following a specific character, then watching them go evil for about an hour... and evil, to PURE EVIL, and about to murder everyone in sight! So, it's my favorite movie and one of the best, I sure hope you feel that way too.Finally, I have an ultimate shrine for The Shining and I must boast it is the best Shining source on the net, I would like you all to see it. Thank you.http://www.gamelegacies.com/theshining.html/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining, based on Stephen King's novel, is the story of a writer, Jack Torrance(expertly played by Jack Nicholson) who, along with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son, Danny become the winter caretakers of a hotel that is closed for the summer hoping that the peace and quiet will help him write his next novel.Gradually, the quiet is no longer peaceful. Jack, discovering that the hotel is haunted by the ghosts of a former caretaker and the family he murdered, slowly begins losing his mind. What follows is a frightening look into the mind of a mad man, and the family that has to cope with it.Technically, this is a great movie. The acting is amazing, the script is great, and the cinematography is out of this world. There are also some scenes that will keep you up at night! The only problem I have is that it isn't as scary as the book. Stephen King's books don't translate well to movies because he understands that anything you imagine is many, many times scarier than anything a movie shows you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best movie with Jack Nicholson and his best role, although I admire him in every film. Each scene is complete and each character is even more impressive than the one from the book. Watching it many times helps to notice more details and it makes it even more gripping, more thrilling. Jack Nicholson is so convincing and his madness is so naturally sensed that you feel even more thrilled than when watching a normal horror movie with monsters eating people, the most thrilling scenes are the ones with the 2 girls that the boy sees sometimes and the scene when Wendy comes to see her completely mad husband typing the same phrase in all possible forms. I read the book only after watching the movie and was a bit disappointed, the book doesn't impress that much, although it is very rare when the screen version is better than the book. Other Stephen King screen versions are not that good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1980 Kubrik masterpiece is without any doubt the scariest film of all time. Even scarier than The Exorcist. The paranoia-driven, psycho thriller unfolds as something so real you can feel it, something so human -- succumbing before a mental devolve triggered by haunting images of an animalistic massacre. The scenes of Nicholsons crash to his unvisited, deep recesses of mind, and of course the immortal graphic tidal wave of blood rushing from the elevator were instant classic cerebral macabre. A complete diversion off the usual horror sequences my generation grew up with, The Shining instead carved in film history the whole meaning of horror, ever present in each person snapping out of sanity.</fullReview>

Though it is a scary film, i think it is a bit slow, but i guess thats what adds the suspense and horror, and i also found it a bit cheesy when the dude goes all that way to save the boy and his mam, and soon as he sets foot in the door he gets an axe in his chest, but other from that it is a great film.

		<shortDescription>An Analytic Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is Kubrick's attempt to develop in an intimate way the dynamics of a young family. The horror is the maintenance of the mother-son bond that is under threat by the overzealous father. No matter how hard he strives, this bond cannot be broken. He sees women as whores, as the objects that relieve his desire. His son is a mere token of his abnormal sexuality.In isolation, without the counter reliance of men, he is held hostage to the redundant role of men in the family situation. He is unnecessary and feels he should be punished. His psyche shifts and lives in self-destruction, the mode that attracts the attention of his wife and child. But he is overcome. The male is signaled as deceased. The killing by each man, is the determination of the male role in the family unit. Redundant, obsolete, violence offers only a vacant reprieve.Kubrick follows Nicholson's destruction with an eye for the decline of the creative enterprise. Either way, the role of storyteller is overtaken by the wife and the clairvoyant son, who seek refuge from this male self-destruction. We hope for Jack's vacation, but his impotence pollutes any attempt to bond with his family. History repeats itself. If only Jack could lesson his grip on dominance the trio would be saved by unitary fear of the unknown. Jack doesn't recognize this fear, doesn't confront his impotence as the "male" and relents to the massacre.One of the best films of the twentieth century.</fullReview>

I thought Jack Niholson did a great job as the caretaker and was brilliant at conveying a man possessed. I only wish this film had a little more gore. But that's not to say it was mild either.

		<shortDescription>Kubrick delivers one way or another.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rare is the film that is better then its inspiration in literature, but THE SHINING (Stanley Kubrick, 1980) must be among the handful that meet that criteria. Director Stanley Kubrick takes a lot of liberties with Stephen King's storyline, but the end result resonates more powerfully then the author's novel.Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall are Jack and Wendy Torrance, who have agreed to care take a spectacular hotel in the mountains of Colorado over the course of the winter. They are accompanied by their son Danny, here portrayed by talented child actor Danny Lloyd. Danny was born with a caul on his face, which, according to folklore makes him a recipient of psychic gifts that a family acquaintance, the hotel cook Dick Holloran (Scatman Crothers) calls "shining".The problem is that the Hotel Overlook is a vast barn of a hotel, overflowing with the chimerical shadows of a long, violent history. And young Danny and his powers become the object of the malevolent institution's want. Jack is slowly turned against his family, as was his predecessor, hotel caretaker Delbert Grady, who butchered his children with an axe and stacked their bodies like cord wood in the hotel's west wing. Grady is among the many spectral energies that still inhabit the Overlook, and the entire phantasmic location is one that can draw sustenance from Jack Torrance's past, one soaked in alcohol abuse and the fear of further destroying his life and career. Jack left behind him in Vermont a career as a ritzy private boy's school teacher, which he forfeited through the beating of a student during a drunken rage. He tinkers with an unfinished novel between dry drunk episodes.It's a potboiler storyline, in short. Robert Wise made something roughly similar work fifteen years before when he took Shirley Jackson's vastly superior book THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE and turned it into the classic THE HAUNTING. Stanley Kubrick's task was far more daunting, and he grasps King's excessive style and transforms it into a clever "wrinkle in time" narrative. For those who are looking for loyalty to a novel's plot line, THE SHINING can only be a disappointment. But if you like Kubrick, and admire his versatility in expressing the brittleness and desolation of the modern day, this movie should work. The worst flaw of the work is the destruction of the one black character in the storyline, proving that even directors as advanced as Kubrick can fall into cliché'.Recent releases of the film on both VHS and DVD have included a documentary on the making of the piece, which offers a warts and all take on what it was like for this particular cast to work together with some special focus on Jack Nicholson and his interestingly quirky contributions to style in performance. THE SHINING is good on a number of levels, and holds up well in the quarter century since its release. Watch for a certain elevator terror during the chase scene. It's a strikingly beautiful and powerful image that condenses the theme of the original work in a few hundred frames.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't imagine why Kubrick picked Diane Johnson to write this. She butchered one of King's nastiest tales. I understand that Kubrick always collaborates on scripts, so I can only guess who gets blamed for what. Spoilers: The scariest scene in the book is when Jack goes to the "forbidden" room where Danny may have been attacked. He sees a few drops of water in the tub, smells something like body powder, feels uncomfortable, but concludes there's nothing amiss in the room. On the way out, passing the bathroom door he sees the shower curtain closed; he thought he left it open. Is there a shadow behind the curtain? No Jack, don't let your imagination carry you away. He turns to leave-- and hears the sound of shower curtain rings sliding on the rod. Eeeeeyi! In the movie, a distorted version that substitutes explicit gruesomeness for the excruciating auditory shock.Another classic scene in the book is the menacing of Danny by the topiary animals near a playground. Totally left out of the movie. (A made for TV version of The Shining was pretty poor but this scene was included and was very scary).Another great scene from the book that was left out involved Jack trying to get a Snow Cat running to go for help when Wendy and he realize that real danger exists in the hotel (this is when he's still somewhat sane). It was all interior monologue, so hard to script and film, but an actor of Nicholson's caliber could have done it. In the book, it poignantly expressed the conflicts in Jack that destroyed him and almost destroyed his wife and child. There quite a few other things about the script that I thought were wrong, while allowing for the necessary compression of a long book into a movie Kubrick never made a bad movie; his craftsmanship partly compensated for the lousy script, but this could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes it is a classic, but so is also the book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I'll join the group of people who've read the book before seeing the film and who's a great of Stephen King's novels, so I suppose you may get a hint of where I'm heading. "The Shining" as a book is a masterpiece, probably the best King novel out there one can get if you would ask me. The film however suffers from, as more or less all films based on novels do, a lot of "keys" that I think is really important for the whole plot. I won't give any spoilers here, but Mr. Kubrick, whose works I adore, gives his own interpretation of the novel and he has a few tricks in his pocket for you here in case you believe that you've read the book and that'll leave you out of surprises - well you're wrong. Jack Nicholson (Jack Torrance in the film) makes a crazy performance here and if anyone should be closed within rubber walls, he's the person for it. He makes his role perfect and he succeeds in spreading psychotic vibes. I'd really like to make this a bit of critical spoiler, but I won't, so I sum things up with that I recommend reading the book before seeing the film. Yes, the film is a classic and I like it for sure, but so is also the book who I love. Kubrick's done as well as he possibly could I believe, it is hard to squeeze these 500 pages into 140 minutes without having to cut much of the plot or reorganize things, so this is a masterpiece itself (but once again, so is also the book). 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last of the Classic Horror Pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's version of Stephen King's horror novel heralded the end of the classic horror run of films, such as the original "The Haunting"(63), "Rosemary's Baby"(68) and "The Omen"(76). After this, it was all slasher stuff copying "Halloween"('78,itself a classic now) and garish cheap crap, followed by the digital age of superficial horror begun in the nineties (capped by last year's "Van Helsing" - humph). Yes, this is way before digital, so the twin ghost girls, for example, are not computer FX creations; they're real. Their 'reality' results in a more chilling depiction of ghosts than would have been possible with ethereal software versions. When they show up a couple of times during the film, it's very creepy.You may wonder at the lengthy shots of expansive wilderness that dominate the beginning of the film - they're both majestic and eerie. And they explain that this really will take place in the middle of nowhere. The haunted hotel, the Overlook, is about as far away from the rest of the population as can be. Most of the film is about just 4 characters: Jack, his wife Wendy, son Danny, and the head chef who comes back to try to help. They're isolated from the rest of the world and the film points out that, maybe, large buildings such as this are not meant to be so empty. Remove enough of the living beings meant to reside there and other forces will move in to fill in the empty gaps. Oh, of course, malevolent forces - this is horror, after all. The film builds slowly, but doesn't really speed up as it nears the finish; it's a classic mood of steadily oppressive horror and continues to take its time even as Jack finally reveals his true crazy nature. Most, if not all, of the scenes are played out as very lengthy for a typical film, with one continuous shot carrying the weight in some cases. It's a far cry from the fast cutting prevalent in today's movies.Nicholson was accused of hamming it up back when this opened and he does, for the most part. But there was probably no better way of playing the role. He's over-the-top bonkers madman and any other method would've been boring or, at best, pretentious. Duvall was an odd choice for leading lady; in some shots she looks very haggard and unpleasant, as if Kubrick purposely chose unflattering angles and lighting. But you wonder if these shots are the way Jack sees things; his world could be all ugly from his perspective. She also reads many of her lines in a flat dull tone, a sharp contrast to Nicholson's antics; her very calm manner in the first half makes her terror in later scenes more jolting. The best scenes are actually between Crothers &amp; Lloyd, where-in the meaning of the "Shining" term is explained. Crothers becomes Lloyd's spiritual father or grandfather, replacing the evil dark father, Jack. They also provide a great set-up for the most evil room in the hotel, #237.This film was not very well received back in '80, mostly due to the changes Kubrick made to King's story. But now, with the passage of years, it stands on its own (and #75 in the IMDb top 250 as of this writing!). The ending especially, seemed anti-climactic and unexciting. But, it all seems appropriate now. Jack, during his whole wretched life, was running away or after something, never catching it. Consumed by his demons and those of the hotel, he ends up frozen in place, nowhere, as was always the case with him. And now he's just another ghost haunting an isolated hotel - a very unusual way to end up and, if you really think about it, the most chilling aspect to the whole story. Rumor has it that an alternate planned ending had Jack's frozen head split open and worms pouring out. Horrific in a way and, if this was made only several years later or today, I guess that's the ending we would have been stuck with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this version of the Shining twice; once before I read the full book and once after. Both times I was disappointed. The first time because at first I couldn't find the Jack Nicholson film, but found another version by different cast, and I watched that reluctantly (at that time). When I eventually found the version in question I was disappointed as I found it fell short of the other. Some days ago I finished reading the book and watched it again. Thus I realized how far this is from King's narration (even the room number was changed) and how true the other one was (as films can ever be true to the book). Now I am sorry I cannot find the first film I had seen originally - not even on Google. Can anyone help please? Sorry if I didn't conform!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first read the Stephen King novel before I saw the film version, and even though I knew it would be well made, and genuinely creepy, I didn't have any idea just how well.Stanley Kubrick creates the fear you feel is being delivered into this film, by using claustrophobic shots, that instantly bring you into the screen. The musical score also makes it uneasy for the audience. You feel yourself almost squirming because every shot pulls you in and surprises you. Yet you find it hard to look away, even though you find it hard to visualise what's going to happen. This is why it is scary. The whole film just grabs you and does not let go until the ending, which quite frankly, is probably one of the most haunting endings, simply because the story is of one man's troubled mind. It is very much realistic, and I think this is why it is a true horror film. There haven't been many made that make you think the way this one will.Even if chilling, and some might say slightly disturbing, it is enjoyable, and you can't beat Jack Nicholson's memorable performance.If you haven't seen it already, do. As I feel you would be missing out on a truly great masterpiece of film. You sometimes even forget that it was ever even a book, because it has it's own twists and turns.Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>even this weak Kubrick film is better than 90% of all the movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Kubrick fan and have seen all of his films many times. The Shining has some problems, but even a weak Kubrick film is better than 90% of all the movies ever made.The film has little to do with Stephen King's novel which serves as a basis only. The plot is simple. Jack Nicholson gets a job as the winter caretaker at the Overlook resort and takes wife Shelley Duvall and his son along. They are predictably snowed in for the winter and strange things begin to happen to them.There are many great scenes in the movie that only Kubrick could visualize. When Duvall reads Jack's novel, the dead woman in the tub, the little girls, the elevator flood, the cold storage locker, the bar, the son on his tricycle, the former caretaker in the bathroom. The interior and exterior sets of the Overlook are impressive and amazing.Now for the problems with the film. Positively bug-eyed Shelley Duvall gives one of the worst performances ever in a film, a whimpering wimp, exactly the type of character in a horror film who is so weak you want them out of the way. Nicholson's performance varies from good to completely over the top. His famous "Here's Johnny" line completely ruins the mood of the movie and breaks any spell it might have had. A person in Jack's frame of mind at that point in the film, would never say that line. Danny Lloyd is terrible in the role of their son. Since these three characters take up most of the screen time in the film these weaknesses really hurt the film.Still, The Shining is a movie that should be seen because it is pure Kubrick and as such it's an important film.</fullReview>

It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie, with a tense ending of Jack being locked in a pantry, etc. Although there were no after-effects for me after watching this movie, I was quite nervous while watching. The only thing I must say is that the little girls could have, and should have, been featured more. I don't remember seeing them more than 3 times. Also, they could have been more specific as to which ghost possessed Danny. Although all of the people were extremely good actors/actresses.

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is without a doubt one of the greatest horror-movies ever made. Loosely based on Stephen King's best-selling novel and directed by the master director Stanley Kubrick, it is scary, creepy and in the same time very beautiful touching. The actors are excellent, little Danny is really likable, his mother Wendy played by Shelly Duval really looks scary and Jack... Jack is great. Spooky, hilarious and terrifying, he is really a great villain, even without special powers like Freddy Krueger for example. My only (minor) complain is that the action is a little bit slow-paced in the beginning and sometimes the soundtrack make you jump with no reason. Apart from this "The Shining" is a must for horror-fans. Timeless classic.</fullReview>

Surprises' were around every corner in the movie. Kubrick and King provided everything for a awesome movie with a mood that makes you feel scared but yet in some way you fell bad for the people stuck in the hotel. They couldn't have based the movie anywhere else besides where they did or it wouldn't be as good because the surroundings and weather help the story develop.

		<fullReview>I just watched the Shining again after not having seen it for several years. and what do you know? I got chills. It's a bizarre film, filled with off-kilter touches, but it sure is a Kubrick film--with genuinely haunting images. The melding together of all the various elements--Shelly Duval's unusual acting style, JackNicholson's,...well...Jack Nicholson persona, gorgeous cinematography withthat breathtaking opening and a classic 20th century film score adds up to areally nifty experience. Seen in context of Kubrick's other masterpieces--it is fascinating to see how he weaves his absolutely distinctive style andobsessions into this film. Seeing it in its first run years ago--I remember the audience getting a real jolt, simply by having the word "Tuesday" appear on the screen. A wonderful moment! And the audience roared with laughter at that.But then there were moments such as the ending that you wished would giveyou one final scare a la "Carrie" but instead just seems to end. This is not your average horror movie. The way the characters talk, and their sort of insipid dialogue feels sometimes mundane and even kind of ordinary. But then thosemesmerizing images take hold, and the very ordinariness of the dialogue makes the horror that much creepier. We know Kubrick calculated every single instant of his film--and this one is certainly no exception. With this film he remained a master manipulator, and a master artist.</fullReview>

The great movies don't fall into narrow categories (like 2001 is not a science fiction movie - its a film about mankind). The Shining is simply a work of art. 2. Never judge a movie if you seen it only on TV. The big screen is the place to watch big movies. 3. Seeing a movie for the first time 20 years or more after its first release affects tremendously the capacity of judging, since you tend to compare it with other films made after, and that's just not fair.

The shining is one of the greatest movies of all time. I give it 10/10 Because of Kubricks beautiful artwork. The music is perfect and the actors are very carefully selected. I especially love one seen with Jack Nicholson. He is standing outside with a polo shirt and the camera slowly zoom in to his face. I think that is one of the best scenes ever. The boy who plays danny is extremely good. Shelley Duval looks like she's going to day because shes so scared. Jack is so passionated and alive he truly gives life to his character.If you should compare this movie with the Stepehn King TV Series.

I know I say this about a lot of King films, but still yet, The Shining is one of the best King adaptations out there. Even though it doesn't stick to the book all that well, it is the second or third best film with Stephen King's name on it.It is about a family of three: Danny, Wendy, and Jack. The three of them are going to watch over a large hotel, while Jack works on one of his creative writings. They are trapped in by the snow, but they have plenty of food, so everything should work out... Right? WRONG!

As was usually the case with Kubrick's films, "The Shining" values style over substance. Even though the film is genuinely very scary, it lacks any real, concrete emotional weight. It once made a very funny parody on "The Simpsons" though.Remade as a TV miniseries in 1997.</fullReview>

I would definitely recommend the movie to anyone who likes Kubricks bizare's ideas. I think that the movies was as good as Stephen King's book.The movie starts with an aerial view of the highway 26 which starts in Portland (OREGON), and ends in the little mountain ski resort of Government Camp. And all of the sudden pops the Overlook Hotel. It's breathtaking. The hotel hasn't changed a bit in 24 years. If you ever go to Oregon, make sure to go to the Timberline Lodge ski resort to see it.

		<fullReview>Being from Maine, I have a deep and abiding affection for Stephen King, although I'm not a great fan of his work and certainly not of movies based on his work. The menacing air and feeling of dread can't often easily be put to film, as "Pet Semetary" and "Christine" demonstrate. So, even though our favorite son might have been put off by this film, I think Kubrick did him a favor by altering some plot lines that might not have translated well to the screen-for example, the topiary; it probably would have just looked ridiculous on film. There are some horrid images in this movie-kids chopped up, blood running out of the walls, but for my money the most terrifying scene is when Wendy finds that her writer husband has barricaded himself, and threatened her, all the while writing the same words thousands and thousands of times (word has it that Kubrick actually sat down and typed these pages himself, which must have taken hours in the days before word processing!!) Shelly Duvall said she had to film this movie in a "constant state of panic" and was exhausted at the end of the filming. You can see why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how some here bash this movie. This is not only the best horror movie, but its absolutely one of the top 100 movies. Those who complain about it fall into two categories: Those who like the book better and think Kubrick didn't do it justice, or: Those who see it 20 years later having a predetermined bias against it because of the great reputation it has. I'll just say in response that yes, Kubrick took little bits of the book, and made it something entirely different. Having said that, if you focus on the movie, on its own, it is one hell of a movie. The camera work is terrific. The acting is great. The score, which everyone complains about, is frankly perfect for what the film portrays. The music keeps you on edge right out of the gate, which is the purpose. Its nerve-racking. As for Jack Torrance free falling into insanity too quickly, did you want the movie to be 3 and a half hours? As it is, its almost 150 minutes. In fact, Torrance doesn't fully go insane until the end. What people complain about happen to be the hints, the traits, of a man GOING insane, which is the character arc that critics here say is non-existent. So, in closing, if you're going to see this movie, forget what you heard, forget how great people say it is. Go in clear headed and formulate your own opinion, not one swayed by Stephen Kings eternal whining, or by your instinct , which is to temper your enthusiasm with backlash because of the popular opinion. What you'll find is a master filmmaker making a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** "The Shining", thus far, ranks as the most effective, scary horror ever produced by Hollywood. Working as both a frightening horror and a psychological suspense, this, in my opinion, is the most chilling film ever made. It brilliantly delves into an underworld of terror and destruction, wherein a haunted lodge is once a study for a recovering alcoholic writer soon becomes the subject of his derangement and antipathy. Featuring some of the most brilliant direction ever (particularly the scene in the study where Jack Nicholson surprises his meddling wife) and some chilling music and sound mixing to correlate with sheer horrors (e.g. the bloody river), this is that rare, ingenious horror film many of us film fanatics lust for. Jack Nicholson is brilliantly brooding as the crazed Torrence, who becomes consumed by the lodge's wicked deceptions and is ultimately transformed into the prime villain, when we blindly assume all along that he and his family are the lodge's unsuspecting victims. This is much, much more than a story about a family at the wrong place at the wrong time, but a meticulous study of psychological depression and consumption, and the particular elements that trigger eventual madness. Meanwhile, the prickly hairs on the back of our neck are constantly affected, as you find yourself shrieking through one horrifying scene after another. The woman in the bathtub and the two murdered twins standing at the end of the hall stand out as the scariest scenes of the film as well as cinema. The little boy's special ability to mentally communicate with outside forces ("the shining") serves as an important element to the plot throughout the film, and is an ingenious, original element for horror. This is the most brilliant, chilling, and effective horror guaranteed to make you shriek, quiver, and keep your eyes awake. "Here's Johnny!" "Red Rum" These lines, among other features, are notorious, renewed classics in film-making, and "The Shining" still ranks as a true masterpiece of horror, every bit as effective today as more than twenty years ago, and that is a true accomplishment. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>chilling, but not nearly has horrifying as the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is truly an epic horror masterpiece. The only flaw is that a lot of it was completely different from the more-terrifying story. Starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Scatman Crothers. The story is about a family who is snowed in at a haunted hotel, where the caretaker dad starts becoming insane. Landmark horror, with one particular blood-flowing-out-of-an-elevator scene that made me nauseous, and tons of other terrors.Grade: 7/10MPAA Rating: RMy Rating: Ages 15 and up (images of terror and gore, sadistic violence, language, some nudity)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifying but interesting interpretation of King's book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on one of Stephen King's most legendary horror novels, this movie has come under a lot of criticism for changing too many of the original plot points. I don't see why. However Kubrick changed the story for the screen, the novel's terrifying atmosphere has not been lost. The nightmare of the book translates fully to the screen- don't watch this film alone! For a fan of Kubrick's film-making, this also features some of his greatest work as director, with fascinating use of camera angles and some of his most unforgettable images. Forget the superficial changes from the novel and enjoy this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEADWhen Shelly Duvall starts flipping through Jack's work, page after page filled with this line, that is absolutely one of the most horrific moments I've ever experienced in a film. And how is it done? With a bunch of typed pages. No guns, no ghosts, no knives, no blood, nada. Just a bunch of typed pages, were enough to scare the SH*T out of me. And I'm not faint of heart.I don't universally like Kubrick. I thought EWS was absolutely cold, as well as A Clockwork Orange. Maybe those are great movies, but didn't "reach" me.OTOH, I loved 2001, as well as The Shining. Looking back at this pic, as well as several other films from the era (all starring some of my favorites like Nicholson, DeNiro, etc.,) it becomes incredibly clear how the mighty have fallen. Twenty years ago they were giving amazing performances. Today they do crap like Meet The Parents or Anger Management. I think the only actor who has generally stayed at the top of his game is Pacino. He seems to have stayed close to his stage roots, and just seems to make great choices and follow up with fine performances."Wendy, darling, light of my life, I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just gonna bash your brains in. I'm gonna bash 'em the f**k right in."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i wish i saw this movie years ago (mild spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that if I had seen this movie years ago, when I was much younger, I would have appreciated it much more. But because I've grown up with endless spoofs of it, I laughed out loud through most of the movie. It was the cheesiest movie I ever saw. Lines like "this hotel was built on an ancient Indian burial ground" or "I wouldn't go into that maze unless I had a few hours to find my way out" (both paraphrased) almost brought tears to my eyes. Can we say obvious? and finding out about Jack's previous visit to the hotel reminded me of those terrible stories that end with "but Mary's been dead for 10 years"Of course, as I said before, all those complaints could be related to the fact that I've been desensitized to the horror of the movie by all the spoofs, or that as an 18 yr-old i have a higher tolerance for scary movies. And knowing that this is considered to be a horror classic that most everyone loves, I thought it must be me. But then I came to my senses.To start with, the score was terrible. My parents were in the room while I was watching, but they weren't watching. Every once in a while they would turn around and say "what in the hell is all that screeching?" or "that is the most irritating sound I've ever heard." They were totally right. The score didn't create suspense, it created a headache. Next, and let me say first, I think Jack Nicholson is an amazing actor, but this movie didn't show his descent into insanity. In the scene when the family was driving up to the hotel, talking about cannibalism, Jack had this crazed look in his eyes. And he was clearly a terrible husband and father way before he "went insane." If you ask me, Jack didn't go crazy, he was crazy the whole time.I do think though, that some people are too harsh. Like all these people saying how terrible Danny Lloyd was. Now I'll admit that he wasn't great, but come on! the kid was 7 when he did this movie. And if it's true that Kubrick didn't tell him he was making a horror flick, how was he supposed to know what to do? But then again, maybe I don't know anything, since the kid never got work after the shining.All in all, I found the movie entertaining, but in more of a comical way. Really overdone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's Johnny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so much fun. It's scary, funny, eerie, and haunting. Most fun of all is watching Nicholson slowly deteriorate. He really cuts loose in this film, delivering lines with his classic over-the-top delivery. Lines like "Here's Johnny!", "Give me the bat, Wendy!", and "I'm going to beat your f-ing brains out!" are spit out with such relish, even though they're essentially horrific in their context, somehow I can't help but laugh when Nicholson rattles them off. So many moments in this film are memorable. Nicholson chasing his wife and son through the huge lawn-maze, the gallons of blood pouring like a tidal wave down the hotel halls, the two little girl ghosts, and on and on. When THE SHINING was released, I believe it was slaughtered (no pun intended) by the critics. But to me, this is a fun way to spend a couple of hours each and every time I watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What else but a classic (could there be spoilers after 24 years?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 24 years we are still watching and commenting on Kubrick's The Shining. Like the Godfather, and The Talented Mr Ripley, the last 20 min of The Last of the Mohicans, I have to watch The Shining at least once a year.The movie was so far ahead of King's version, King should have been ashamed to even try it. In 1980 there was not the technical ability to make topiaries that move. I think the maze was more effective when compared with King's version of moving topiaries. The other actors are so sinister too; such at the bartender and Brady, the former caretaker. Loved those scenes with Brady. Kubrick was roundly critisized for making the scene in the men's room too drawn out, but I loved it as I watched Jack's wheels turning, trying to comprehend what is being said. I also loved the end of the closeups of the pictures on the wall and there is Jack the caretaker.Great, scary film. Kubrick's films always bear much discussion. That is why he is great even if you don't like all of his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining is not a Horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am responding to those of you who have commented that The Shining is the greatest horror movie of all time (or things to that effect). Firstly, a couple of you have wondered why Kubrick would have chosen a King novel for a movie. My theory is that Kubrick used the basic plot details of the novel as another way for him to make a movie to express his low estimation of women. The underlying misogyny of Kubrick's films can be seen in A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and even in Eyes Wide Shut. In The Shining, as some of you have noted, Shelley Duval's character is pretty stupid and annoying; in fact, after reading reports about Kubrick's severe treatment of her on the set of the film, I am inclined to believe that Kubrick wanted the audience to 'side' with Jack against her. This leads me to my second point - Jack is the hero of the movie, and through various devices by Kubrick and the charisma of Jack, personally I cannot help but think that we as the audience are supposed to hate Wendy (Duvall's character) and hope that Jack kills her. My other claim is based upon the fact that Jack is damn funny - admittedly because of Nicholson's brilliant performance - and his mannerisms and discussions with a number of the 'residents' of the hotel are so deeply amusing. In sum, I can't believe that anyone could be scared by this movie. It makes me laugh like no other movie. In order to really get 'into' a movie, you have to be able to sympathies with the protagonists (usually the victims) but I think that Kubrick reversed that strategy by making Wendy so loathsome as to make us want Jack to survive, if not 'finish the job'. Funniest movie of all time (maybe just behind Dr Strangelove).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Me, Scarier then Evil Dead, and Exorcist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! This movie is chilling, and scary. On T.V. this was said to be 3rd scariest movie in the whole world. I find it to be scarier then the scariest movie of all time 'The Exorcist' Another horror movie that I think is not as scary as The Shining is 'The Evil Dead' Directed by Sam Raimi.I cannot watch this movie myself. It is about a family who are invited to stay in a Haunted Hotel. Little by little, Jack Torrance who is played wonderfully by Jack Nicholson, is getting more and more posessed. By that I mean crazy. (SOME SPOILERS AHEAD)Danny, Mr. and Mrs. Torrance's child, knows about The Shining. The Shining is something he does with Dick Hallorann. They use their minds to connect with each other.The creepiest to me is when Danny screams "REDRUM REDRUM REDRUM" Backwards "MURDER MURDER MURDER" Another creepy part is when Danny is riding his little bike around the house, he sees these twin girls they say "Come Play With Us" He closes his eyes and then opens them again to see the twin's body dismembered.(NO MORE SPOILERS AFTER HERE)All im saying is if you have not seen this movie, get your lazy bum off that computer chair, stop reading this and go rent the movie and watch it at night by yourself eat some popcorn, get a drink of coke and watch this almost 3 hr film.P.s. Jack rules and REDRUM!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Contains Spoilers*This movie, I think, is the greatest horror movie made. The Ring is also terrifying, but it is all explained in the end. But this movie is done very cleverly, and leaves the viewer to draw their own conclusions. So really, this movie isn't for the not-so-clever people. It is explained to an extent, but the mystery really adds to the sheer tension throughout the the movie.Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrence (in a brilliant performance) who gets the job of being the caretaker of the Overlook hotel. He learns in the job interview that the hotel was built on an Indian burial ground, and the last caretaker went crazy and chopped his family up with an axe and blew his brains out with a shotgun. Of course unfazed, he takes the job and takes his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and his son Danny (Danny Llyod) with him. Danny has a special gift: he is a physic and has a 'boy who lives in his mouth' named Tony who 'tells him things.' Danny says Tony doesn't want to the Overlook, and shows Danny a terrifying premonition of blood pouring through a door, which then shows a flash of 'the two little girls.' They absolutley scared the hell out of me and I hope it scares you the same. What follows is the rest of this horrifying movie that contains some of the most frightening scenes I've ever seen. They include; Danny's eventual confrontation with the two girls, the woman in 237, Jack slowly going mad in several scenes, and the unexplained but strangely scary scene with the guy in the bear suit. This scene, like the little girls was done brilliantly because they seem to be staring at you, and is quite discomforting. Disturbing, strange, terrifying, and extremely scary are only a few words to describe this film. Jack Nicholson made this film what it is with his brilliant acting, and Stanley Kubrick made a masterpiece.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a stunning companion to King's novel, regardless of what King thinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The attributes of this movie have been stated by many others so I will just add this pair of pennies:Some, Stephen King himself most visibly, have griped about the liberties Kubrick took with the original novel, the infidelities to King's pure and unadulterated vision. King even took it upon himself to have The Shining remade...as a made-for-TV miniseries, no less, under his watchful eye so as to have it made exactly as he wanted it.We've already seen his track record with personally supervising film adaptations of his *ahem* literature. I have two words for you: Maximum Overdrive. Apparently, his authorized remake of The Shining also demonstrates that, protective as he is of his novels' integrity, Steve needs to stick to writing novels, and leave film-making to filmmakers. As truly wretched as some King adaptations are, King himself can't seem to do much better--he's not a filmmaker. He had a lot worse offenders to pick on than Kubrick, one of the greatest of all filmmakers, who any writer should have been honored to have translate their work into film.True, Kubrick's movie is not rigorously faithful to the book. But that is a good thing in this case. King's work is often not easy to translate into movie terms without looking silly (as they often do). What Kubrick did was see something in there that King perhaps didn't/doesn't. Perhaps he just cherry-picked the parts that moved him. Whatever...what we end up with is a true HORROR movie, a movie that is genuinely frightening in the classic sense, rather than revolting in the pseudo-EC-Comics way that seems to be King's natural environment. And it's done with impeccable production values and craftsmanship, something sorely lacking in maybe 98% of other King movies.My only complaint is Kubrick's tendency to have actors deliberately, slowly recite lines at each other--kills the believability--and of course Jack Nicholson's overacting comes off as almost comical at times. Kubrick was never really an "actor's director" after Dr. Strangelove...it's one of his maddening quirks that gets shoved aside by his astounding abilities and judgment in just about every other department. Casting, set design, cinematography, music (with all due respect to Wendy Carlos, although her original score would have been interesting to hear inserted into the picture), The Shining is almost the Perfect Horror Movie IMO. Read the book. See this movie. Skip the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Shining on video is a shocker to terrify and thrill and a requisite title in any fan's video library.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King's novel The Shining is a classic of modern horror and one of the author's best and scariest works. The film version of the tale may be more a product of Kubrick than King, but it is in its own way a good psychological thriller.Whereas the novel encompasses far more of the supernatural nature of the Overlook Hotel's ghostly and evil residents, the film instead chooses to see Jack Nicholson's descent into madness as just that rather than largely the product of phantasmal touches. Nicholson's performance is masterful in only the way he can deliver such a role; one might really wonder if he ought to be in a straight jacket at times.Purists and fans of the novel might resent Kubrick's reinterpretation of King's novel--and the film is indeed the lesser of the two in comparison--yet still the Shining on video is a shocker to terrify and thrill and a requisite title in any fan's video library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a great movie. Nicholson was at his best. I thought that maybe if they had somehow made Wendy's character a bit stronger it could've been more interesting. If they had given Wendy more witty lines in the scenes with Jack and Wendy bantering back and forth it would've made Jack angrier first of all and would've made the film more interesting. I take the film on it's own. I don't like comparing it to the book or the other movie that was made in '97. I don't think it's fair. This movie is Kubrick's spin(aka his opinion)on the book. You don't like the movie then why waste time commenting on it . As for Jack Nicholson. He's a great actor. Anyone who thinks they can top Nicholson. Go ahead and try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining, a horror masterpiece from which Stanley Kubrick uses Stephen King's novel, "The Shining" to create a truly terrifying but amazing movie to watch. From reading the book and watching Stephen King's miniseries, although the miniseries is completely adapted to the book, I don't think the characters acted as what you might expect them to to fit in with the book, which overall makes Kubrick's version the ultimate horror. Jack Nicholson's roll is unbeatable and will never be reacted to the extra-ordinary display he showed the world. Also, Danny Lloyds performance was excellent unlike the annoying Courtland Mead. As for Shelley Duval, who plays Jack's wife "Wendy", this movie wasn't made for her participation. But as it turned out her involvement in the film did not effect the excellent screenplay and this has produced the best horror ever. 10/10</fullReview>

Kubricks style is slow paced in the most dramatic and terrorfying way. His style is never matched. Jack Nicholson is scary and gloomy as the devil himself, and Shelley Duvall is equally brilliant as the very scarred wife. I'm never gonna be bored watching this fantastic masterpiece. The older it gets the better it gets. The newer mini series on the other hand is just as interesting as a bowl of frozen snot.

		<fullReview>This film is a classic, it contains everything a good horror should. You won't be disappointed. Well, that is unless you're expecting the film to be just like the book. Like many Stephen King adaptations it varies a good deal from the book (which is a fantastic read), if however you accept the film as it is I'm sure you'll thoroughly enjoy it.Watching the film now it does seem a little dated but hey, that happens to everything. Jack Nicholson plays the role in a deeply scary manner and Shelley Duvall makes me want to kill her as well. All in all this is one of the greatest ever, if you want to see the book literally played out on screen see the newer version (which I vowed I'd never watch but did and was blown away by it), the acting isn't as great but is almost exactly as the book was written. Stephen King's story, like so many of his others just goes to show how brilliant he is. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great haunted house/hotel movie. Top notch acting and truly scary. I've found two things that often kill horror movies are poor acting and no true scares. This movie does not have those problems. The Shining is based on Stephen King's brilliant novel of the same name. Some King supporters blast Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance( the troubled father and husband in this story). I am a King supporter, and I do agree that the character of Jack Torrance in this movie is not perfectly realized. He is not as complex as Stephen King's original character was. Jack in this movie appears to be a bit too crazy to start with. However, I still think Jack Nicholson gave a great performance. This movie isn't a perfect King adaptation, but it is still a great movie. I list it in my top 10 movies of all time. As great as this movie is though, the novel is even better. I recommend this movie, and recommend the novel even more! 9 out of 10</fullReview>

Again, plenty of memorable images, for me, the two ghosts (?) wearing rabbit masks is the best, although few remember this. Writer's block leads to paranoia again, perhaps making Jack more susceptible to the voices inside, and outside his head. The key is that, in a theme which always interests me, no help will come from the outside, and the only escape is via your own skills, and luck. If outside help does arrive, it usually gets an axe in its back. Nicholson wins here, although everyone is great. one of the best horror movies of the eighties. 8 out of ten</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of weeks ago I decided to spent a night at home watching a movie, and as my brother had just lent me The shining, I thought it would be a great idea to remember some childhood's fears that this particular kind of movies used to provoke in me. But to my surprise, those feelings of horror were substituted by an amazing necessity of living the film. I mean, at ten you do not go further than the explicit images you see, but now I felt it more: I tried to imagine how it would be to live without the things to which we do not usually give importance, but that become vital when you are deprived of them. It also must be desperating that your mind goes blank if you are a writer and are not able to write anything.Apart from the most `normal' aspects of the film, there is a sobrenatural side according to the mental powers of the child, the ghosts of the two children, the naked woman in the bathtub and all that people in the ballroom. All these things, except for the kid's powers, did not frighten me as much as the others. It is true that ghosts and all that stuff are frightening, but it is more to become insane without apparent reason. It was like trying to be in the place of Jack and thinking that you can go crazy too.To sum up with, I think this film means much more then the obvious, and if anyone watches it, a feeling of:'it could be me' may appear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the book aswell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of Jack Nicholson, Stephen King and the art of great horror movies, The Shining was just destined to be one of my favorite movies of all time. If you've read the book, you'll know how complex the story of The Shining really is, with it's intricate emotions and sensitive relationships, that come together to give the full picture that the story really should be viewed as, and ultimately, the film is somewhat forced to ignore. What we fail to see from the film is the real sense of a family tie between the three, and most obviously, the affection Jack Torrence really feels for his son. What we see is just a naturally spaced out sense of madness from Jack Nicholson right from the start! And a real feeling of detachment. His performance, in actual fact is colossal no doubt, it's actually fascinating how well he can strike such a sense of madness into the character.My favourite scenes,easily, are firstly when he lets rip at his wife Wendy when she innocently interrupts him while he's working, and then of course the scene with Lloyd in the ballroom. If there's one thing that Jack Nicholson is the absolute master of, it's the solo performance. That scene in the ballroom (before Lloyd appears) is just an absolute master class! As well as the eerie encounter with Grady, the ghostly butler.The main disadvantage of the film is the exclusion of the detailed gradual spiralling of Jack Torrence's mental state. the book is not only an epic horror, but also a heart-wrenching story of the mental decline of a loving father who'd battled alcoholism and re-defined himself and his life, to better his family. But Kubrick clearly had to decide where he was gonna go with the movie, wether it was to follow the book and be a story of tragedy, or just be a flat-out horror. The result is a flat-out horror, but a bloody good one. He decides to remove the substance the book holds, and just create an eerie, psychological masterclass of madness. Jack Nicholson is immense, with Shelley Duvall setting the un-toppable standard of looking absolutely terror-stricken.I'm no expert in directing, but it is clear to see that Kubrick is brilliant with this movie. He knows he can't, for time reasons, afford to show the delicate delcine in Jack Torrence, however, he chooses his scenes so effectively! Each one is absolutely memorable, with Nicholson appearing increasingly detached, along with the brilliant inclusion of his crazed stare as a filler between two scenes. Also to his credit, Kubrick invloves his own creations to the story, such as the two terrifying little girls, the waterfalls of blood and of course, the dead woman in the bath. These help to just pile on the fear factor that the book in parts lacks. Although in truth, i found that it wasn't a particularly scary movie, Jack Nicholson's performance is so 'larger-than-life' and over the top (in a good way), that it almost became too great to watch and over shadowed the real underlying fear of the situation. However, the sight of those two little girls sends shivers down your spine and makes you weary walking down hotel corridors at night!For anybody who has seen the film, but not read the book, i strongly recommend you to do so. It provides a greater outlook, and helps to explain some of the messages that were quickly placed by Kubrick, but were not properly explained due to the restrictions in duration forced on the production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick at his best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen plenty of Stanley Kubrick movies and I gotta say, The Shining is easily my favorite. I would say Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie even tops his part in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He can scare people wihout moving or saying a word. It didn't hurt that his son, Danny, had those freaky twins following him around everywhere. Nicholson "shines" in this movie; his gradual change from a normal husband and father into a psycho killer still scares people silly today, 24 years later. Shelley Duvall, or Wendy, contributed to the movie by playing the part of the innocent wife who just wanted to have a nice family vacation. She also inspired the great, chilling line: "I'm not gonna hurt ya Wendy, I'm just gonna bash your brains in." Gives me chills every time. The Shining's in my top ten. Kubrick and Nicholson hit the mark with this film. A must-see! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an only child, and I've noticed that only children grow very attached to their parents, mostly because they are the only family ties they have made. Such is the same for Danny, he, on the other hand is special. Danny doesn't need siblings, he has a friend in his mouth, Tony. This is a very different kind of friend, Tony can reach Danny's mind and show him things. Danny has the gift of shining. His parents, Wendy and Jack, both have their sets of problems. Jack is a recovering alcoholic, and has problems with child abuse. After being fired from a teaching position in Vermont, he applies for the job of caretaker at the elegant Overlook Hotel, which has its share of stories as well. The Overlook people just want the family to watch their hotel during the winter time and come spring the family will get their pay and leave. The only problem, they say, is the severe isolation. They mention that a few years ago, there was a man Grady and his family that came to care take the hotel and ended up murdering his family. The scary thing is that the spirit of Grady isn't dead and coming back for the kill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Genuine Horror Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's obvious it's not the only - after all, I can't overlook The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Silence Of The Lambs, Jaws, etc. - but The Shining is the only horror movie that has truly disturbed me to this day; after I watched I was afraid of being alone in my house, I didn't even want to go into the bathroom thinking there would be something behind the shower curtain.The Exorcist might have a better screenplay, more engaging characters - Father Karras is indeed brilliant - but Kubrick's take on horror is just unprecedented and I think no one will ever match this movie in its ability to disturb the viewer.Using the classic conventions of horror - a haunted house - Kubrick produces some of the finest imagery ever put in a movie: from the chasing scene in a labyrinth, to Jack Torrance's conversations with ghosts, to the twins, the freaky elevator bursting with blood... it's just too much.And the sound - and sometimes the lack of - add an amazing atmosphere to this movie.For anyone who really wants to be scared, a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a horror movie fan, I like to believe I've seen my fair share of them. And I must say that The Shining is one of the best movies out there, both in the horror movie genre and movies in general. It keeps your attention through out and at the end, at least for me, you feel you saw a great piece of art. Jack was also just great, I almost believed he is just as insane as his character portrays. And for those of you who don't know that this movie was originally a book, it was. I must say that this movie is one of the few that does the book justice. So if anyone is looking for a great movie to watch, especially during a dark and rainy night, then don't forget to check out this great show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick took a Stephen King novel and changed it to suit himself and what he created is one of the best ghost (the dead driving the living insane) stories there is. A family move into a hotel so that the father can write his novel while also acting as caretaker for the Overlook hotel, a location with a murky past. The loneliness of the snowed in hotel and the supernatural force that permeates its entire structure drive its residents insane. Unbalanced personalities, psychic abilities, cursed land and a history of evil events all mix together as Jack Nicholson gives an over the top performance which moves the film from quiet brooding into a crescendo of madness. Watching his wife and son become terrified of Jack, one of their nearest and dearest is a horrifying experience for the audience. Some of the surreal scenes with the deceased Grady inciting Jack to beat or " teach " his family a "lesson" elevate the film above the average man goes mad genre and puts 'The Shining' into a haunted league of its own. Jack Nicholson is excellent and it is his portrayal of isolation maddened Jack that make this film so great. After 'The Shining' I watched, 'The Witches of Eastwick' to see if he could pull off playing Damien (the Devil), he could, and in that film he is extremely aggressive and cunning. In it we see him both being in control and out of control but we never see, as in 'The Shining', the pleasanter, family minded Jack to compare it with and highlight the extreme change into a maniac. The most memorable scene in this film is where the naked nubile young woman giving us a full frontal turns into a decomposing grandmother, scaring men with the destruction of beauty and arousal and the women with ageing and death. If you want more of 'The Shining' Stephen King's original novel is supposed to go into far greater depth explaining the child's "shining" ability, and the history that haunts the hotel such as the elevator of blood and Grady's angelic twins. There is also a 'The Shining' television mini-series available that stays more in tune with the original novel. scream_sheet</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest film I have EVER seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a brilliant exercise in terror! There are moments when watching it where the tension is nearly too much to take. I firmly believe that one who has a weak heart should NOT watch it!After watching it I need to walk through the house with the lights on that night. It is easily the scariest film I have EVER seen! The masterfully crafted score is one thing, although there are others. I have never heard more eerie, disturbing music for a film. I cannot imagine the movie without it, it's perfect. Nicholson is pefect in every way in this film. I cannot imagine another actor in this role. He was born to play it.I've heard people say he approaches high camp, but so what? Over the top is the way to go at times. And the good, but creepy, Shelley Duvall is in high form as well.And young Danny Lloyd in his first and only role,I believe, is excellent as the son as well as Scatman Crothers in a supporting part. I would love to say much more but I do not want to give ONE single thing away about the film if you haven't seen it. That would quite literally be a crime. All I wish to say more is this:Just imagine yourself in the situation from the viewpoint of any of these characters and ask yourself,"Would I be scared?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than The Shining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first memory of this film occured when I was about 7 years old. I was at my Grandmothers watching TV in a big yellow swivel chair. I can't remember the particular show I was watching but during the commercial break a trailer for The Shining played. I slowly spun around in the chair, put my hands in front of my face and didn't move for about 10 minutes. I was terrified. I remember the music and a scene where a kid is running through what looked like a big tunnel and a crazed man chasing him with an axe. Forget about it, I was traumatized. Now, the other memories I have of that film happened a little later when it was released on video and my older cousin would watch it all the time, I was scared of it for most of my life but as I got older I began to appreciate how hilarious Jack Nicholson is in it, I mean, disturbingly hilarious.The Shining is a film that I can watch over and over again, mainly because of the humour, but there are other aspects of the film that definitely make it a classic, Kubrik's direction for one, his choice in camera angles and music set a very creepy and other worldly tone. I think that the opening tracking shot may be one of my favorites of all time. The art design is incredible and I can't imagine The Overlook, looking any different than Kubrik intended. Now speaking of overlook, I think that Shelly Duvall and Danny Lloyd get shadowed by Nicholson, but they are both incredible here, the focus on Shelly tends to be the way she looks, homely or ugly, but I think that she plays of Jack so perfectly and reflects the complete loss of control of someone that is in the middle of a real nightmare. Danny Lloyd was so good as the kid that I can't think of any other kid doing as good a job on another film, he wasn't an annoyingly cute toe head, he was real, and seemed to carry an old wisdom in his eyes. Anyway.Aside from all that, this film belongs to Jack and for my money he can do no wrong, I don't care if it comes out that he is a coke snorting jerk off I will always love the guy. Whenever I hear someone utter these words "As Soon As Possible" I think of Jack. It actually happened a couple of weeks ago, someone said it and I replied as Jack in the Shining "Asss Sooon Asss Posseeebbullll" they didn't get it. Every word and every movement of his eyebrow is a trip. It is one of my 10 favorite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King vs. Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, Stephen King considers this film to be the worst adaption of his novels (I guess he really liked Tommyknockers and that one that started with an "L" that was simply godawful), but an author is not always right. The Shining, in my opinion, is quite the opposite - the best adaptation of a King book I've seen and the only one that has aged well, retaining its ability to put one at unease. There are several reasons for this, but two really stand out. One is Nicholson's performance, which may now seem as a standard Jack act but was really the beginning of the seething, satanic anger of characters that he would later play. It is flawless. There is comic detachment in scenes that he really goes insane, but in that comedy lies horror. It is almost as if the character knows it's quietly (and sometimes quite loudly) going insane and finds the fact amusing. "Why not go out with a bang?" Jack's Jake seems to be thinking, "I am loving this demonic liberation." And that's what makes it so unsettling - the ease and joy with which he allows the madness to take over. The other factor is Kubrick's direction, the reason King hated the movie. It is detached, restrained, and "not emotional enough" (King would complain). Now, while I haven't seen King's version of the Shining (the miniseries), I have read the book which I consider to be one of King's very best. It can be easily argued that Jake's plunge into insanity mirrors King's own personal demons (alcoholism was suggested) and the book depicts it brilliantly. I think Kubrick's film does the same, in a different manner. Since film lacks access to the character's thoughts (unless of course you want to make a movie with continuous narration), this is communicated through atmosphere, which in this case, is dehumanized, desolate and terrifyingly lonely. Thus, while King may not like it, it is the best he has gotten so far from any director - The Shining is indeed a classic modern horror, an achievement rarely repeated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining: What a movie!!!Keeps you well on your sear right from the beginning also being a typical Kubrick tale you get that feeling of tension throughout the movie, always expect that something awful is about to happen this moment the next and so forth. Another typical Kubrick twist is the lack of clues to the audience. We are never to find out why this all happened how it all began etc, even though hints are given.The plot even though might seem predictable you will not lose interest on this movie at any stage. The cast have done a wonderful job and all are very convincing of their parts.The shining is considered a classic of horror genre and I will not disagree as the combination of location, takes, performances and direction along with the storyline, form the ingredients to place it high up among the horror greats.10 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Words: Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film on cable television about 1982 and have thought it was a horror classic ever since. It sort of shocks me that Stephen King doesn't like this film and wanted it remade into a vastly inferior version just recently. Jack Nicholson gives (what I think) one of his best performances ever. If you want to see a genuine horror classic then you need to see this film. I think the five best movies made from Stephen King books are: 1) The Shawshank Redemption 2) This film 3) Misery 4) Stand by Me 5) Dolores Claiborne.Has anybody noticed that Stanley Kubrick film have a certain look to them? For example in "2001: A Space Odyssey" there is a scene early in the film where there is a white waiting room with red chairs (the scene where Dr. Heywood Floyd meets with the russians) and in "The Shining" the bathrooms are also red and white. Interesting don't you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed at times over some of the elements that we've seen parodied so often since this film's release. But to be honest, after it finished I had to go turn the lights on and I'm quite uneasy...and that was while watching it on a small TV. I can only imagine being in a big theater.I think what made it scary to me was the imagery and the atmosphere. We can probably credit Kubrick for that. His casting is top-notch...Shelly Duvall is just a freaky, freaky woman and would scare me doing the morning Weather Report. She's right up there with Sissy Spacek as the only two women I would never want to be left alone with...As was said earlier, the hotel setting is creepy, and the isolation of the snow and dead radio adds to it. The ghosts and "psycho ghostly happenings" (like the river of blood) also come with no warning. The surprise bit with the decayed skeletons is completely out of the blue and very jarring.I've found that moments like that combined with the cast leave me off-balance through the whole movie. It's not like Scream where you know the killer is gonna jump out when the heroine is alone. You're never quite sure what's going on here...or what will happen next. Plus the movie isn't bogged down in self-awareness, irony, camp, or any of that other garbage that ruined so many other potentially great horror films.Kubrick's only goal was to give you nightmares...and he succeeds.Great stuff...and one of the best scares I've had in a long time.I'm giving it a 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most effective horror films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** a few spoilers **This movie almost requires repeated viewings to deliver its full impact, with layer upon layer of quiet dread and small, seemingly mundane moments of bizarreness building up to a devastatingly terrifying climax. The devil here is in the details, and those well-thought-out, lovingly executed details add up to make this one of the intellectually complex and chilling movies of all time.When I first saw this movie in the theater at 16, I thought it was creepy but it didn't really "get" to me until the end. Ahh the simple innocence of youth! The more I've watched it as I got older, though, the more I've appreciated the creepy subtleties of this masterpiece. It's like a good old Islay scotch; at first you might not like it much, but age and experience reveals the true depth of its quality.Most people who deride this film do so because of Shelly Duvall's effective unattractive performance as the hapless and befuddled Wendy, and the fact that it doesn't follow King's masterpiece novel verbatim. I prefer to think of it as Kubrick's near genius-level reinterpretation of the basic theme of a man's slow, inexorable descent into howling madness.Kubrick's trademarks are all here: the clinical, nearly static camera work (until the final whirlwind sequence, when Jack's mind is completely unhinged), the slow, deliberate pacing, Nicholson's stares of what I call "slack-jawed malevolence" (which effectively imply the disorder into which his psyche is sinking).The film's few gaffes include the blood flood from the elevator and the charming Scatman Crothers' desperate rush to the Overlook through a terrible blizzard to save the Torrances from the hotel's evil, only to get an axe in the chest almost immediately upon reaching his goal. The film's dark virtues far outweigh these relatively minor quibbles, though.Nicholson has been criticized for an "over the top" turn as Jack Torrance. I can think of no other actor who could have pulled off his bravura performance of a man, already hounded by the twin demons of alcoholism and writers block, who slowly (and at first unwillingly) gives himself over to the The Overlook's insidious evil. When his sanity finally crumbles, Nicholson's magnificently wicked leers and bestial facial expressions (especially when he unfurls those demonic eyebrows) give fascinating face to a fiend at long last set free to destroy. We all know in our heart of hearts that that same rough beast lurks within us all; some people's control of it is simply weaker than others'. He does overact, but he pulls it off with such masterful confidence and magnetic panache that is impossible to look away.Small touches of brilliance abound: the contradictory feeling of claustophobia in the huge and vacant hotel; the subtle recurring color red throughout the film's sets (implying the bloody ruin to come); the familiar nursery rhymes and pop culture phrases turned on their ears in chilling fashion ("Little pigs, little pigs, let me in"); the boundless horror on Wendy's face when the spectres of the hotel finally reveal themselves to her during the climax. There are too many throwaway gems to mention. The more I see this film (I've seen it probably nine times so far), the more effective it's sense of creeping dread and impending doom resonate.This movie is, in my humble opinion, the "Citizen Kane" of horror films and deserves every accolade that it has received and more. It is a dark gem by the greatest American film director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a writer looking for solitude so he can concentrate on his work. So naturally, when he's offered the job as winter caretaker for the secluded Overlook Hotel in Northern Colorado, it seems like the perfect way for he and his family to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life so he can concentrate on his writing. Little do they know what a hotel built on top of an Indian burial ground could have in store for them and their states of minds.First off, this movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, and from that one might deduce that it sucks?as most of his novels adapted for the silver screen do just that, which a few exceptions. But this one is a remarkable exception and has everything to do with Kubrick. The acting performances are top notch to the degree that it seems the movie was intended with the three main actors in mind. Nicholson easily pulls off being an ex-alcoholic on the brink of insanity, and Shelly Long looks terrified standing still. Anyone who has seen this movie knows exactly what I'm talking about and would agree that she's very convincingly totally helpless. The little boy who plays their son, Danny, is/was an excellent child actor as well. Most young children have difficulty acting terrified and scared, but this kid hit the nail on the head. And I can't even imagine all the takes they had to go through, being that Kubrick was the director and was known for being one of the hardest, if not the toughest director to work for. I heard, and this might be false, that the movie you see was actually only 1% of the film that was used to shoot the movie. Tiny Spoilers:This is the best kind of horror/thriller movie?.no monsters, just plain old insanity and frenzied visions of disturbing occurrences. This isn't a movie that scares you or freaks you out simply by shoving stuff in your face when you least expect it. Anyone can do that. What the director has done here is make the audience feel isolated and secluded just like the characters in the movie, which is done through nifty and careful planning of shots and angles. The movie opens up with Jack's car driving done the sidewinder to the Overlook Hotel around curves and it's just beautiful. And it's meant to show just how secluded the hotel is from the rest of civilization. And that's how the movie begins to freak you out. You know it's a secluded location and you soon find out that it's built on an Indian burial ground, and from there you can slowly see Jack slip into insanity. Both Jack and his son Danny have intensely disturbing hallucinations/visions of things that have happened or will happen in the hotel, which sets the tone for the blood-curdling ending.Of all the `scary' movies I've seen, this is one of the very few that have ever creeped me out or sent chills down my spine, and that's saying quite a bit as I usually find most horror and scary movies complete jokes. I mean, yeah movies aren't really scary anyways, but this movie is freaky?.just imagine yourself in that situation. A Flawless Masterpiece. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a bad for a 25 year old 'horror epic'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just bought the VCD version as soon as I saw the 'Kubrick Collection' on sale in Hong Kong alongside one of my most favorite films: Clockwork Orange. F.Y.O. the VCD colouring is a bit dark and the sound is quite low - a shame if you otherwise have a large screen and surround sound etc. And a large screen is called for if you are to really feel the effects of being positioned inside the vast snowbound hotel complex the characters get locked up in, and the earlier aerial shots of the Canadian Rockies.I used to (about 10 yrs ago) read Stephen King a lot and always found non-stop suspense in his novels. I only vaguely remember The Shining plot however, so cannot judge the interpretation of the novel as King wrote it. This film version is by far better than all the other film adaptations of King's novels, (and there have been some really dire ones), but I'm still left unsure about its high aclaim from other reviewers on this Site. I agree that Nicholson does a great job of 'insanity', but would have liked to have seen even more of it. I can accept the seeming speed of his mental decline if you assume that he was already harbouring something before the family go to the hotel. It's only in the final 30 mins, however, that we see the 'chase' of Nicholson on his family. The suspense wasn't held long enough. I thought the child actor did a fine job, but also agree with others that Nicholson's wife is the soppiest character with some really painful lines. I was actually hoping to see her head roll at the end just to avoid having someone like that being responsible for bringing up a kid alone, and somehow, her and the kid's relatively easy escape was a slight anticlimax. B.t.w., if the wife's character was really so strong to escape, why didn't she put that kitchen knife straight in the eyeballs, as her husband takes eons to axe down the door, and has all the time in the world to peer through and say 'here's Jonny'? Also, there wasn't enough 'gore', which the build up was suggesting to come. About the only 'gorey' scene was the fruit juice spilling from the elevators.Overall though, it still isn't bad for a 'horror epic' if you remember that it's already some 25 years old, and it still has much more class than those brainless films such as 'Scream' etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few films have been as thoroughly absorbed into popular culture as "The Shining" has. Stanley Kubrick's tale of isolation, madness, and murder is an undeniable classic.Jack Nicholson stars as Jack Torrance, a frustrated writer who loses his mind during a stint as winter caretaker at the snowbound Overlook Hotel. This does not bode well for Torrance's wife and son (Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd), who are trapped in the hotel with him.A combination of stunning imagery (particularly a torrent of blood crashing through the hotel elevators) and slow-building dread provide the film with a lingering creepiness. Nicholson's thrilling, wildly unhinged performance takes over from there. Raising his eyebrows and an ax, Jack becomes a poster child for the badly behaved and criminally insane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We all go a little mad sometimes...but do we go mad that quickly???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Kroll, a movie reviewer for Newsweek, called The Shining "the first epic horror film". It is an epic to be sure, considering its length. At times, it goes on a little too long. Jack Nicholson does well as the crazy caretaker, but he goes mad so early in the film that it doesn't give us enough time to wonder what drove him to that point (other than the story about the caretaker who murdered his family in 1970, as explained to him when he's interviewed at the beginning of the film). As for that hotel, it's a nice-looking place, but you might not want to spend a whole winter by yourself up there. Not that you'd get murdered or anything, but you might find it very boring.The Shining is not a classic to me, but it's certainly better than Eyes Wide Shut.Rating: **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of Stephen King's best movies ever. It is definitly one of the top 100 movies of all time. A typical Nicholson masterpiece. The remake was a great movie as well. Not a lot of comedian actors like Steven Weber can pull off an act like he did in the remake. But good old Jack was the best Jack Torrence. Weber was good but not as good as Nicholson. Rebecca DeMorney played a better Wendy in my opinion than Shelley Duvall. Danny Lloyd was a better Doc than Courtland Mead. I liked Melvin Van Peebles and Scatman Crothers equally as Halloren. Elliott Gould and Barry Nelson played 2 diffrent personalities of Mr. Ullman. Gould was a SOB and Nelson played a nice Ullman. That questioned my thoughts about the character. The lady in the haunted room in the remake was creepier than the original. I liked Pat Hingle's role in the movie remake as Mr. Watson. I'm a Pat Hingle fan so that was cool to see him in it. I had the honor to meet him when I was in Colorado a couple years ago since he is from Colorado. I visited the Stanley Hotel where the remake was made and he along with Courtland Mead and Elliott Gould made a guest apperance at the Hotel. They were doing a special tour of the hotel. All cool people. So my rating of the movie 4 stars out of 4, and for the remake 3 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie near perfectly adapts the Stephen King novel of the same name. Jack Nicholson is in a signature role (Heh heh, I got that off the back of the DVD!) as John/Jack Torrance, a once succesful writer now struggling to get on track after battling alchoholism. He and his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) are looking after a motel called The Overlook during the winter. Over a period of a few months, they are apparently haunted by apparitions and ghosts, and Jack Torrence eventually becomes increasingly insane while his son Danny senses things his parents can't with his Shining, a psychic gift.A creepy movie, you will have to watch carefully to fully interpret it's story, and when you do everything suddenly makes sense!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If the book is as intriguing as this movie - some book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes! I admit I have never read the book. I've never really cared for Stephen King most of the time. His work seems well written but derivative - at least those things I have read. Many of his book-to-movie or TV specials have been jaggedly uneven in their final presentations. However, this movie is watched everytime it is on. The ONLY version to see is the uncut version. This movie is jaggedly uneven as well but it works.I thought Nicholson's acting was peculiar. He seemed real insincere and unnatural. At first I thought it was bad or uncertain acting but after a few viewings I am not so sure. He is intended to give you a sense of instability and he succeeds very much so.Duvall is mousey and frequently irritating. She also seemed insincere. But when the situations were genuine (like Duvall interacting with the child or being chased with an axe) - they both kicked into high gear with some extremely convincing performances. The child actor was frequently - well, he seemed camera conscious and not very natural. Still, he provides many moments of unbalanced terror. I guess I can't complain. I watched the movie to get the creeps and this movie indeed gave me the creeps.The background music track is very effective in creating a sense of startlement without intruding on what is actually going on. Much of the time it comes as noises (sinister hisses, piercing dissonance, creaks, moans, etc). They do not seem out of place and in fact are very appropriate.The sets are left in their natural unassuming state until a mental fugue takes place. Then things begin to acquire a otherworldly shimmer, just enough so that the viewer knows that what is going on isn't normal. Anyway, your brain senses it. Well done.Now the story on the screen may or may not be the book. Having no idea what the book was about I decided to watch this one night - I was in my late 20s. A couple of the images really got to me. I had no real idea what 'The Shining' was supposed to be until it is explained later in the movie. If the movie is any indication - the so-called 'Shining', as it was defined, played a secondary or supporting role in the proceedings. Therefore after my first viewing I was wondering why the movie was called 'The Shining'? I have to assume that the book must play more to this concept. Nevertheless, gang, the bottomline here is that I liked this movie a lot. Like I said, UNCUT version only!!! There is one scene that will make you want to hurl. (You guys will know what I'm talking about.) I will go out of my way to watch this movie. it is interesting and creepy every time. The movie is so good - I may just have to read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is one of those horror classics. While it doesn't have much gore, it makes up with that with it's chilling atmosphere. And I haven't met anyone who doesn't know the most famous phrase in horror ever, and one of the most famous ever to boot. It's the famous Here's Johnny!When Jack Torrance becomes the cartaker to the Overlook hotel in the Rockies, he brings along his family. His son, Danny, has a "friend" that lives in the back of his mouth. That is The Shining. Slowly he uncovers the hotel's past, and that past is driving Jack mad. Jack finnaly loses it and blows up at his wife( I'm not gonna hurt you, I'm just gonna bash your F**king brains in.). She knocks him out and puts him in the storage room. When he gets out, he chases his family to the bathroom, and the famous one-liner comes. He chases after Danny(he escaped out the window) and into the hedge maze. He kills the chef who came cause he senced that Dann was in trouble, and continues. The wife then sees one of the most disturbing scenes in the movie ( a guy in a animal suit sucking a mans wiener. Nuff said). Danny finnaly makes Jack freeze to death and the mother and child escape in the chef's car.Overall, this is one of the greatest horrors of all time, along side, Psycho, And the Exorcsit.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS---I love this movie, not as an adaptation of King's excellent novel, but as a Kubrick/Johnson collaboration. While they kept the basic story, they came up with other themes than King (a.o. the native American theme)which works beautifully. Besides Shelly Duvall, the cast is fantastic. Sadly, Scatman Crothers appearance is highly reduced in the International version which cuts several scenes, especially in the beginning and during Halloran's journey to the Overlook. I haven't seen the U.S. version, but I do hope some day I will. It's hard to imagine that the interiors were done in soundstages, they're so elaborate (not to mention eerie). For the soundtrack, I'm glad that Kubrick didn't choose the music which was written for the movie (which appears in the DVD/Laserdisc documentary), but instead opted for Dies Irae. As for the 1997 mini series based on King's screenplay. I think it's great. Both that and this version are highly recommended (but not the latter for the faint of heart).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't scare with ghosts or vampires. It scares with a thinking, that a very close and important friend or even a family member could brake and loose his mind. Stanley Cubrick moves Stephen King's thinkings on a film with great success. Although the movie is old it still scares people around the world. Jack Nicholson (in a one maniac role!) plays the role of a writer Jack Torrance. Shelley Duval makes a good role as Jack's wife Wendy. Danny Lloyd plays the role of a boy with great talent, Danny. This is one of my favourite movies because of good actors (especially Jack Nicholson) and good plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of this movie will of course know that it came from Stephen King's novel of the same name. That is about the only similarity it shares with the novel though. Where as King's novel delved into a man who became something else, and went insane, Kubrick's film initially deals with an already insane character. If anyone was going to become a mad ax murderer, it was Kubrick's character.The film barely touches on the psychological studies evident in the book. It hardly mentions or deals with the shining, which was a gift that both Danny and Jack had. Jacks punishment came about because of his rejection of the gift. The film overlooks all of that. The film also replaces the metaphors within the book. Where as King used the boiler to show Jack's pent up rage, Kubrick decided to use the maze. The maze was symbolic of the maze of Jack's mind. Lost deep within himself the maze became a dangerous space, and gradually darkens throughout. It is also symbolic that Jack dies within the maze in the film. As they take away the shining from the novel, they simply use the cook as a sacrificial lamb, rather than a surrogate father figure for Danny and a superb foil to JackThe film asks the questions, are the ghosts real or simply psychological manifestations of Jack's deluded mind? Just because the film does not adhere to the book, does not make it a bad adaptation. I loved this film, and the study of an already mad man takes nothing away from the film. We no longer have the study of American society and the hotel as a microcosm of America, we just have pure suspense, and a high level of entertainment.Kubrick simplified the plot to go for the entertainment, and he superbly uses music and cutting to provide high suspense. He even makes the wife and child two dimensional characters, to concentrate on the lunatic that Nicholson plays brilliantly.The shining is a superb film. Not highly scary, but it does succeed in making you jump in all the right places. Watch it if you dare</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who take the horrorsection not for serious (I know there is plenty of crap out there) let them see this masterpiece as Stanley Kubrick can be an example of how great horror must be done as it's both great on the scale of cinematographic skills and horrorthrills. The story is quite known : an ordinary family (well, what's in a name?) are taking care of an isolated hotel and even if the cook warns them what happened with the family before who took care after the hotel, Jack is sure that nothing can happen with him, he has the job of his life.... The movie is really superb and that has to do with three immortal performances : Jack Nicholson is the devil himself and along with "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" it might be his best role, Shelley Duvall plays brilliant as the scary wife and the little Danny Lloyd is superb as well (wait till you hear him saying Red Rum!!!!). A masterpiece.</fullReview>

His descent into madness is simply astonishing. On my second viewing, I increased my esteem for Ms. Duvall's work. She isn't a glamorous actress and that is why she is overlooked quite frankly. The child actor was also excellent thanks to his innate child qualities. Unforgettable imagery permeates the entire film. In short, it is a brilliant exercise in psychological terror.

		<fullReview>Enjoyed King's book and had looked forwared to Kubrick's film: not exactly the same (film never is) -- but the ominous unseen *dread* permeates it, and that fear makes it one great feat. As most Kubrick films: it is extremely rich visually, and the music is perfect.Most criticism seems to emanate from it not matching closely enough those viewers expectations: it's not supposed to. It's supposed to convey an author's and director's ideas -- King's protestations to the contrary, it does.The hallucinations are scary, but they're not the really terrifying part of this story: that part's never seen -- yet Kubrick makes it as tangible as your morning coffee.Like others probably, there were parts of the book I really looked forward to seeing in the film that weren't there -- most especially the topiary menagerie -- but Kubrick didn't shortchange me.King writes books -- not movies: but it you want to see his ideas on film then see the made-for-tv one. To see greatness -- in a film: in cinematography and visual style, in acting and directing, in effect -- see Stanly Kubrick's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I see dead people....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*********** SPOILERS ***********Nothing from the age of CGI has yet managed to produce anything as creepy as The Shining. Before the family even move into The Overlook Hotel, Kubrick makes expert use of the screechy, fingernails-down-a-blackboard style music to build a sense of foreboding. Add to that the disturbing flashes about the tragic history of the hotel being experienced by the Torrences' son Danny, and you'll be hiding behind the sofa. Then they move in, isolated in the hotel for the whole of the winter. Jack Nicholson stuck in a hotel with Shelley Duval and all that orange wallpaper. What did they think was going to happen? That's a combination that would have any man reaching for the axe before you could say `All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!' And a hotel built on an ancient Indian burial ground. When will these Americans learn? Before long, the various nasties that live in the hotel are springing into life, giving booze to Jack, a recovering alcoholic, and encouraging him to do in his family in a variety of interesting ways. Kubrick repeatedly uses the same stylistic tricks; the low tracking shots of Danny in his pedal car; the scary music; the shots reflected in mirrors that throw your sense of perspective off balance, and delivers no payoff. The spring just keeps getting wound tighter and tighter, and when the trap is finally sprung you'll hit the ceiling. The real genius of The Shining though, and the reason why despite advances in technology no horror film has been able to match it, is that the really scary thing is not whatever dead thing is going to come crawling out of the hotel rooms next. It's the look on Jack Nicholson's face. Now that's scary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King + Kubrick = Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining has to be Kubrick's best film ever. It's creepy atmosphere is one of the film's greatest strengths. I absolutely love this film, being that it is based on my favorite book. Many people criticize this film for not being a good adaptation of the book and this is true. The film is not a great adaptation of the book because many subplots, plot points, and scenes in the book are left out. However under no circumstances does this diminish the power of the film. The interior sets are very well made and quite spectacular. The Overlook and many of the characters pictured therein are exactly how I pictured them in the book. All the performances in the film are great. Jack Nicholson does classic Jack as Jack Torrance. Shelly Duvall is nothing like her character in the book, but she still manages to make her part work. Danny Lloyd provides a good and not an "annoying cute child" part as Danny Torrance. The late great Scatman Crothers plays a perfect Jack Halloran. It's a great shame that Mr. Crothers is no longer with us as he was a fine, charming actor. His charisma is such that I consider it my loss that I had never known the man. The Shining is a showpiece of direction and cinematography. A beautiful and eerie soundtrack contributes to the film's unearthly feel. This film certainly earns it's place on the Imdb Top 250. Bottom Line: The Shining is one of my very favorite movies of all time and it is a incredible film by any standard. If you haven't seen it yet see it and if you haven't read the book yet then read it. It really completes the picture of the story. This film is a cinematic masterpiece. A work of art. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.First off, I will admit that I dont think The Shining is Stanley Kubrick's best movie, its one of his best but just not quite up to some others. It is the best movie he made during the 80s though. The Shining is psychological Horror. This is Horror that gets under your skin. The film achieves this admirably, you watch it at 2 A.M. and see if you feel the same. The acting is mostly good in The Shining. The kid, cant remember his name, is very good. Scatman Carrothers is also quite good. Jack Nicholson got alot of bad reviews saying he overracted, but I do not feel he overracted. You know this guy really isnt that sane when you see him. My only criticism in the acting is Shelley Duvall, I kind of think she Overracted in areas.The Shining may seem very different from some of Kubrick's other movies. This is mostly because of the material. You still get a claustrophobic feel like in many other Kubrick movies. A viewer might think some questions are unanswered. Mostly asked would be the reason for the elevator of blood. The blood is more symbolizing something. That should be a pretty good hint.</fullReview>

The place that Jack care takes is The Outlook Hotel. The Outlook Hotel has a horrible past with the other past caretakers.Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy, and their son Danny. Jack Torrance during his time there tries to write a novel. You'll see how that ends up. He also is trying to don't drink, and doesn't think he can hold it any longer.In my opinion, was makes this movie scary is one Jack Nicholson, his eyes, two mysterious girls, and the music. And what makes this movie great is the filming, the acting, and the story.Rated RWhat I think it should be rated and why: R for language, Strong horror/terror violence, some sexuality/nudity, and gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Defense of Shelley Duvall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say I'm one of those who thinks THE SHINING is amasterpiece of a horror movie. I don't understand the people who don'tthink it's scary, but I assume they're not lying, so who knows. Itworked for me. It is not my intention to discuss the hypnotic camerawork and pulsating rhythm, the tracking shots, the Diane Arbus twins,elevator of blood, production design, music, or great reaction shots.Neither will I discuss the book, which I read as a kid, but quicklyforgot. No, I am writing this in spirited defense of a geniusperformance by Shelley Duvall that even some fans of the movie seem notto appreciate. She is the heart and soul of the movie. Jack is terrifying in a GrandGuignol way, and Danny Lloyd is great, too, but it is left to ShelleyDuvall to carry the full weight of being scared - in other words, shehas to be frightened for everybody. She is the on-screen person whoperceives the full scope of the horror that is going on. (If nobodyonscreen is scared, a horror movie becomes a comedy.) Shelley does thiswith a believability that is unique in screen history. Most actors can'tdo it; they just fake it and get worked up. When Shelley Duvall istrapped in the bathroom, she reacts with an unhinged hysteria thatobviously comes from a very deep and dark place within her. The hoororof the moment comes only partly from the ax, only partly from themalevolence in Nicholson's performance. The real horror comes fromlooking into the eyes of woman about to be hacked to death, andShelley's eyes convey truth.Now, as for those people who either ignore her, or worse deride her,they have a hopelessly shallow view of acting. I imagine they look formaximum coolness or maximum minimalism, two things that are highlyprized in Hollywood lately, and in horror films especially. ShelleyDuvall does neither. Instead she presents an accurate portrait of a realwoman - and the reality of the characterization rests on theeccentricity of Wendy. Wendy is not a Sigourney Weaver character, alltaciturn strength surrounding a wounded vulnerability, or a Sharon Stonecharacter, all highly strung tics surrounding a wounded vulnerability,or a Julia Roberts character, all smiles and goodwill surrounding awounded vulnerability. No, Wendy in THE SHINING is a woundedvulnerability surrounding a wounded vulnerability. Her character isNOTHING like the Wendy in the Stephen King book - thank God - with herstrong legs and blond hair and take charge attitude. Stanley Kubrick'sTHE SHINING is not about the downtrodden family of a drunk fighting backwhen he goes too far. It is not about empowerment. It is about having nopower; it is about being trapped; it is about evil coming to get you. Itis about the ax you are powerless to stop, and that is why Kubrick wentand got Shelley Duvall. Her Wendy is a hopelessly unsophisticated - butnot ignorant (she reads CATCHER IN THE RYE) - country girl who iscompletely in the power of her husband. This is a VERY REAL character.The Shelley-Duvall-Wendys of this world are the kind who axe murderersprey upon, far more so than the Sigourney Weavers or Sharon Stones. Weknow that this Wendy is hopelessly ill-equipped to deal with thissituation, as is little Danny, and those of us with hearts to feel (fewof us, I fear) are scared for her. Most importantly, she is unable toprotect her young son. If she could, it wouldn't be a horror movie, itwould be a LIFETIME TELEVISION FOR WOMEN movie, and she'd be played byValerie Bertinelli. But beyond the characterization, there is the task of acting it, andShelley is great at this. She is scrupulously honest throughout themovie, and I'm including those loopy line-readings that may be thereason her critics seem to hate her performance. Line readings like"That's OK. I understand." Do you know the one I'm talking about? Whatwe have here is Shelley showing us Wendy acting. Wendy is acting upbeatand positive for Jack, and Wendy can't act. Shelley can - Wendy can't.There are moments when Wendy is annoying, because Shelley Duvall is notout to make the audience love her. This does not reflect on Shelley.But besides an emotionally accurate characterization, and brilliantacting talent, there is the face. It is an exceptionally emotionallyexpressive face. Her bone structure is very much like Loretta Young's,but missing half the beauty. Half the beauty is there, but the otherhalf is Alfred E. Newman. The limpid eyes do most of the work, conveyinga child-like fear in step with the habit horror movies have of puttingchildren in the path of danger. The first time Jack yells at her, herface collapses in a confused hurt that is disguised by NOT ONE emotionaldefense.

Being one of the scariest movies of all time, this movie contains everything a horror movie should: building suspension, shock, great lines, gore, scary music, a great environment, crazy charectors, and an awesome ending. The plot is simple: Jack, his wife, and his son and his son's imaginary friend say they will take care of a hotel, up in the mountains. They find out about a guy who freaked out up there and killed his wife and daughters adn then blew himself away. Not discouraged, Jack goes up there, and slowly begins to go crazy.Jack Nichelson is great in this movie as a crazy writer. Shelly Duvall (the movie's only set back) is not the best actress, but she's not terrible. Danny Lloyd as the kid, is great, one of the best child actors ever. With it's blood, bizzare scares, and fantastically scary music make this movie scary. Run to the video store, buy this DVD, and watch it. But, one more thing... DON'T WATCH IT ALONE!

		<shortDescription>About the only horror movie that really frightened me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well-directed and acted movie about Nicholson's deterioration into insanity. The movie effectively builds up a sense of impending doom, from its panning down the empty hotel corridors, to its music, to its glimpses of the past. I felt unsettled the whole way. Even when Nicholson sees a beautiful naked woman bathing and embraces her, this moment quickly turns from pleasure to sheer terror. A disturbing and effective movie "come on little piggies, Johnny's here!".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best horror-movies ever made. Even better the the famous "Exorcist". Shelly Duvall in her best role, Jack Nicholsons impressive performance and Stanley Kubricks vision together result this thrilling horror-masterpiece. Kubrick atmosphere leaves a deep trace- the big and really scary rooms in the Hotel, the colors, the exterriors, the music, ... all joined in a exciting Stephen King horror- novel makes this film unique. Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers also deserve to be praised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Scary, 23 years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit, I've never read The Shining (never been a big Steven King fan), so can't compare the book and the movie. I won't really break down the plot for you - it's posted on the IMDB main page anyway. Basically a family goes to a haunted mansion to take care of it for the winter. The father, Jack, (Nicholson) is struggling to write a book, while ghosts from the mansion plague his mind. I can't really say much about the acting in the movie...there are really only 3 characters in the movie that appear for any significant ammount of time (the family), and since you can't really judge a child of acting ability, that just leaves Jack and his wife. Nicholson does an excellent job portraying Jack, perhaps one of the best of his career.The score is great, when noticed. Not much to say there.Let me say one thing: This movie is freaky. Not the "Boo!" kind (though there is some of that), but the "Mess-With-Your-Mind" kind. The blood down the elevator shaft is especially scary. That's about all I can say. A very freaky movie that stands up well, despite 23 years of filmaking progress. James "Black Wolf" Johnston</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>different from the book but so what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this stands out as one of my absolute favorites in the horror field. along with THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, THE THING(1982), THE EVIL DEAD, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE SIXTH SENCE, THE OTHERS,(many "the" movies here), JAWS, HALLOWEEN, and the list goes on..hard to pin point anyone, but the shining should be wery close to number one.from the very beginning it has a real creepy atmosphere. the music sets the tone while the camera follows the car on this high mountain road. it just leaves me with a really creepy feeling. the suspence gradually builds up to the end climax, letting you be a part of the claustrophobic athmosphere in the big almost empty hotel. scenes with the kid going through those empty corridors,jack in his huge working office, the party lounge, room 237, the "bleeding" elevator(was this really all set? i thought it was mostly shot on location at the timberline lodge, but later i heard otherwise) And you KNOW that jack will sooner or later go completely bananas and chop through that door(the cover kind of gives that one away) and go for his ovn family.I must note that i have never read the book, which almost everybody wants to compare it to, but i have now seen(and bought)kings´ own tv version on dvd. this is how he wanted it to be.though he had to make it into a mini-series to get all that he wanted.this might be closer to the book, but still Stanley´s masterpiece is superior.how many king stories have been made into a movie and how many have received so much bad mouthing as this one? no one i think, even not the really bad ones. CARRIE and MISERY were also pretty different from the books, particularly the endings, but i think King left those pretty much alone. THE SHINING he bad mouthed quite bit. i heard him say in an interview once that movies and books are like apples and oranges, they are both good, but the taste is different. should be ok then, no?i give this movie a 10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror can be enjoyable without being stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is almost always the case that when people cite a bad horror movie as enjoyable, they find it so because it is stupid. The Shining is highly enjoyable, and yet it has a fascinating script. Add that to Kubrick's typically well judged and lavish direction and an eerie score, and you have a masterpiece. The only downside is that the always watchable and entertaining Jack Nicholson overshadows a fine cast with his scene chewing portrayal of a decent man driven to madness. To be fair, it also lacks the ability to scare now, and perhaps this is why The Shining joins the rest of Kubrick's post 2001 work as under-rated and misunderstood. It's a shame, because it is technically brilliant. But it seems a horror movie is judged wholly on it's terror rather than anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" has a place to qualify for best horror movie of all time. Jack Nicholson is brilliant and his "Here's Johnny" adaption from Carson will be remembered forever. Kubrick here has a fine piece of art, just like many MANY other movies he directed. I never was able to see Stephen King's own adaption of his own novel, but he just isn't as talented at directing as Kubrick. I will have nightmares for weeks after this movie, but I would be glad to watch it again. As I said, Nicholson is brilliant, Shelley Duvall is very good as well, and just about everyone else was decent enough to make this movie what it is.User Rating:*****</fullReview>

Stephen - you may be a terrific writer, but you're a truly lousy judge of film.This is perhaps one of the best horror films ever made, which is both genuinely frightening and intelligent. It forces us to witness a man's trip into utter madness and an environment filled with fear and dread.Some truly shocking moments and genuine scares - this is what horror is all about.Hats off to Kubrick for making an outstanding film.

		<fullReview>i just have to say... I picked up the book out of curiosity and then really wanted to see the movie, when it first came out I wasn't even born yet, so I didn't even get the 'here's johnny' line until someone took pity on me and explained it... but the movie itself left so much out, i was personally disappointed with the film. I admire King's writing (too) much, and to see it on screen made me want to kill the tv. the shining to me will always be about Jack's ultimate try for redemption gone horribly wrong, the fact that he would totally destroy any trace of the loving family man that he once was just to allow little Danny leave him behind is just too powerful for words, the 'detail' that the little kid had a frightening gift having to do with smelling oranges is just a bonus to the 'disturbing' factor. in the movie, however, Wendy (another problem) takes Danny and makes a run for it while Jack (always Jack) stays with his new found booze feeding friend, the overlook, which he doesn't do in the book. where the hell is the sickening love that the kid feels for his possessed father??? I mean, please, where are the original characters... which brings me to Wendy... Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, sweet, frail and weak Wendy? Sound familiar? Well if you read the book it shouldn't! If anything, she was the complete oppossite, here you see her accidentally and mostly out of clumsy fear, escape from her mad husband, but she was suppose to be a strong, well grounded woman. and I could go on and on... whatever your opinion is, if you feel like discussing this or any other 'disturbing' movie, please, contact me (queenofmisery@hotmail.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, but don't watch it after reading the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is scary, there's no doubt about that. But to be frank, it has hardly anything to do with the original book. And without going into detail, I'm not saying that because "it's not what I imagined while reading the book". It's just a different story, with the same names and the same frame.Because of that, you'll be remarkably disappointed if you watch the movie right after you've read the book, because it won't make proper sense. "Jack's not supposed to react that way! This wasn't in the book? Now? Allready?" You'll have plenty of questions. You'll be puzzled by the things added to the movie, and baffled by the things that was removed from it.I'm not going to debate whether and wherefore, and what's good choices and bad choices. That's up to you do decide for yourself after you read the book and watch the movie right afterwards despite/because of what i write. But don't watch it if you want a great impression of Kubrick, and don't watch it if you want a great "Stephen King movie". Do watch it, however, if you like to be scared by both disturbing images, as well as thrilling psychological suspense.It's not really a bad movie, it's just not faithful to the book. At all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most classical, scary and terrifying film of all time. Jack Nicholson played the part awesomely. Everyone in the was good. Stanley Kubrick was an excellent director in this movie. He has filmed so many films but I think this one tops them all. But everyone knows why this film was as good as it was. STEPHEN KING. He was the master-mind of this story because of course he wrote it. He is able to scare the hell out of you no matter what story he writes. But I think the Shining is the scariest movie/book of all time, even scarier than one of the scariest films of all time, the Exorcist. It was so good. But also, the way Jack Nicholson protrayed the role of his character was to me inspiring. It really shows how good Jack Nicholson is as an actor. It's a ***** movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stephen King's complaints seem unfounded to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying I like Stephen King's novels better than the films based upon them, with the exceptions of Stand By Me (The Body), Shawshank Redemption and this film, The Shining.This film matches its source material quite a bit better than previous adaptations I had seen of King's work. Keep in mind I was only two when this came out, so I saw a lot of King movies like Christine, Cujo and The Dark Half before having an opportunity to view this on tape. Based on how awful those adaptations were, this movie seemed sparklingly true to the mood and theme of the novel. That said, I understand a lot of cool things were cut from the manuscript and we should have gotten to see Jack beat the life out of that punk student like in the book, but what we got instead is still brilliant.Just for a moment hold this version against "The Authorized TV Movie":If Steven Weber (Wings fame..snicker..snicker) is right to play Jack Torrance, I'll eat my hat. That Rebecca DeMornay was the wife was appaling to those who have accepted Shelley Duval as Wendy. The topiary scenes would require ILM treatment to look good (which they don't) and Kubrick was right to replace that concept with the hedge maze. I mean really, a hedge maze is a real world thing that can, without supernatural involvement, terrify the pants off you if you get lost!I have said what I wanted to say, and Mr. King, I respect your opinion whether or not I agree with you.</fullReview>

Shelley Duvall is mediocre in her supporting role however Danny Lloyd plays the child beautifully. Its a surprise he's never made many movies considering his fine showing in The Shining.

		<shortDescription>ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES EVER MADE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first became intrigued with Stephen King around 1989. The first book I read was PET SEMATARY, which was a great book, but a horrible movie. Then I read THE SHINING and I was scared out of my wits. As most SK fans know, his books translate into horrid movies for the most part (can anyone say DREAMCATCHER?) The problem is they become so twisted they stray away from the original plot. THE SHINING, the book and THE SHINING, the movie are two totally different things. Two entirely different endings. THE SHINING is the only SK book and movie that I enjoyed together, even though they are totally different. THE SHINING is a horror film that will frighten you out of your wits. Jack Nicholson shines (no pun intended) in his role of Jack Torrance, the caretaker of the beautiful Overlook Hotel. This is not a bloody movie, there are only a selected few scenes of gore. This movie screws with your mind as you watch Jack slowly go insane.For horror fans, this is a movie that cannot be missed. If you want to be scared, watch this movie and THE EXORCIST. Forget this rubbish BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and the truly awful THE RING. These movies are classic horror movies and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very well adapted, but wonderful movie nevertheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film that will continue to be veiwed and criticized even past its 25-year mark. The move is [very loosely] adapted from the bestselling novel by Stephen King-published in 1977. Not that it is a [very] bad adaptation of the novel-you could think of it as Stanley Kubrick's take, or version, on the novel. If you wish to be more in-depth with "The Shining" itself, I strongly advise you to not watch the movie first, instead to read the novel. Yes, you will find several differences between the novel and the film, but, the movie is still something to behold as a great acheivement in film. If you were to view Kubrick's work and Jack Nicholson's work before you watch this movie, you will find that when the two of them come together to make a movie, the outcome will be nothing sort of miraculous. This point is proved in this movie. Also, the adaptation and Kubrick's take have only a few similarities, and they are, to be vague, the names and places. You may have heard things connecting this movie and the rise of "Psychological Horror"; I am not going to say that is wrong. Indeed, what makes your heart gallop is the thought that if it were to happen to you, the same way Poltergeist and The Omen transform their potential horror into kenetic horror. If you were to replay this movie in your mind-or watch it again, for that matter-you will stumble across some rather piculiar facts that prove your original thoughts of the movie incorrect. For example, Nicholson's character-Jack Torrance-is credited as being an ax murderer, but, if you were to remember one particular scene near the end, you will think otherwise. [I'm not one to tell you now!] As said before, if you wish to be more in-depth with this movie and its elements, I strongly advise you to read the novel first; but in order to fully understand many scenes [the conclusion, in particular] it may be in fact very wise to read the novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of Modern Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick has already accomplished himself to be one of the greatest directors in cinema at the time. Releasing classics such as Doctor Strangelove, Barry Lyndon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and more. He then came out with The Shining. Possibly known to many fans of the genre as the best horror film out there, The Shining is remembered as being one of the scariest films. The atmosphere, set design, photography, music all build up to create a very memorable sense of place. Note the dangerous foreshadowing in certain scenes, that really add to the effect. The performances are first rate, Jack Nicholson in a very emotional and crazed performance. Somehow though, it seemed like he was a little over- the- top so doubts around whether it was worth of an Oscar- nomination (it didn't get one). Shelley Duvall really irratated the hell out of me, but her performance was solid, it's just the character that got on my nerves. The kid who played Danny also does an excellent job, adding to great effect the horror. The script is mesmerizing, pouring out fresh and powerfull words onto the screen all while maintaining a very terrifying atmosphere. Stanley Kubrick's unflinching direction bores deep into the skull, crafting powerful images though disturbing ones (blood rushing through the hallways). For some odd reason, this film was nominated for two Razzie Awards: Worst Director and Worst Actress (Shelley Duvall). I can understand why it was nominated for actress, but the directing one was atrocious. It also seems like the Academy really ignored this one, though it has now become a classic by both cult and fans of film. The Shining stands in the mind, it sometimes gets too over- the- top, or too weird (Beaver costume scene) but it manages to maintain such a pace and atmosphere throughout while being beautifully made. Stanley Kubrick wasn't a filmaker. He was an artist, and this, by all means, is one of his best portraits. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" isn't the bloodiest film ever made, or the most violent, and given the plot it shouldn't even be very suspenseful: we know early on that Jack's gonna whack his family. We just don't know how. Yet Kubrick sustains this slowly building tension, with superb help from background score by Wendy Carlos and other incidental noises, until it becomes almost unbearable. He pioneered use of the steady-cam, chiefly following Danny on his Bigwheel, which fast became standard equipment in Hollywood. The scene where Danny turns the corner and encounters the two Grady girls in the hallway ("come play with us DANNY!") still gives me the chills. Fans of the book hated the killing of Hallorann, but it is necessary to propel the plot (and Danny) toward the stunning conclusion. The paradoxical final shot is pure Kubrick; he wanted movie watching to be an active experience. Final stroke of genius is easy to miss, especially in a theater: the soundtrack band was recorded live, and at the end of the tune the audience applauds, then files out of the music hall, shuffling chairs and talking -- exactly what the "real" audience is doing in the theater! Like all Kubrick films, this one rewards repeated viewings, "The Shining" even more than most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody Kubrick Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a considerable deviation from Stephen King's book, this film manages to hypnotize the viewer. Stanley Kubrick creates a beautiful, desolate and creepy world at the Overlook Hotel. A lot of credit for creating the mood in this film must be given to the music, which packs an emotional punch. I can't imagine a better choice for the unhappily married alcoholic psycho-dad, than Jack Nicholson. His timing, facial and body expressions are vintage Jack, which he puts to good use in many memorable scenes. Shelly Duvall is a strange choice and a seeming mismatch as the timid wife, often overplaying the look of horror on her face, but she plays the role pretty well trying to stay one step ahead of her unravelling husband, while keeping her clairvoyant son from slipping too deep into his alter ego. Danny Lloyd does a very good job as the 6 year old with the 'very great talent'. Scatman Crothers &amp; Joe Turkel give good solid supporting performances but Philip Stone does as especially good job as Grady, who informs Jack Torrence, in a terrific scene in the men's room, of how things are going to have to be. If you're expecting a true Stephen King horror flick, well that's not really what this is. Kubrick took liberties with the book no question. But it stands on it's own as a terrific film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blimey what a film! no matter what Stephen King says, Stanley Kubrick has worked wonders with King's original novel.Jack Torrance (God/Jack Nicholson) travels to the isolated Overlook Hotel to take the job of "janitor" with his wife and son during the winter, so as to work on his novel without any distractions. Jack has been told about the horrific past of the Overlook; about the insane man who murdered his wife and two daughters, but never-the-less Jack grasps the job by the...horns.With the exception of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, i believe this to be Jack's best performance, he gets Torrance's quirky nature down to a T. Duvall, who plays the role of Jacks wife, is somewhat lacking in the "good acting" department - she does pull of petrified wife face rather well, only is that acting or just how she looks? well she isn't exactly Rachel Leigh Cook. The kid's ok i guess, if not a little wooden but hey he's only, what, 8? Kubrick definatly strays from Stephen King's Original novel, which is exactly what he should have done, if you've ever seen thinner, you'll know exactly what i mean. Kubrick has done an amazing job on the shining, the relatively new invention of the steady-cam came in handy, you just have to wonder how that dwarf managed to hold the thing up whilst running behind the kid on his pedal powered Tricycle. to sum up, this horror is a work of genius, Kubrick has strayed away from turning it into a gore fest and instead turns the horror to a more psychological level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Kubrick's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I must say: Yes I have read the book and I found it brilliant. And yes it's a shame that Kubrick changed so many things. But let's forget the book and look at this as just a movie. It's pure terror. It's one of those movies that managed to truely scare me, something that doesn't happen very often. Kubrick shows again, he's one of the greatest directors ever, and Jack Nichelson gives us a great performance. My only problem here is the lack of real characters. Lets face it, The only change Jack Torrence made, was from a loonatic without an axe into a loonatic with an axe.SPOILERS But then, that might have something to do with the meaning of this movie. After all, Jack has been at Overlook before, as we see at the end. That might also be the reason he went there again, just to kill his family; it might have been his plan from the start, perhaps without him even noticing. END SPOILERSAnd Shelly Duvall was only there screaming and crying, being no real character at all. But apart from that, and can't see anything that's wrong with this movie (apart form the way it doesn't stick to the book, but I've already mentioned that). It's pure terror. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kubrick disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Stephen King story a la Kubrick is hailed by many as the greatest horror film ever. Well, it´s fascinating but with major flaws. Actually, Stanley Kubrick is my favourite director and I´m a big fan of horror films, but The Shining is the only Kubrick film that hasn´t impressed me much. Kubrick has put all effort on the atmosphere, which is original and hypnotic, but although I have seen the film three times, I have never really been scared. Also, the character studies should have been better. The relationships between the family members are vaguely drawn, which makes the course of horrible events less gripping.Yet the big empty hotel is the perfect location for an eerie atmosphere and innovative camerawork (especially when the boy rides his bike through the corridors), Jack Nicholson and Danny Lloyd as his son are perfectly cast and the last image surely gives you something to think about. However, the film works much better as a psychological thriller. I believe The Exorcist will always be my favorite horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Stanley Kubricks The Shining for the second time. It has to be one of the best horror films of all times (at least in the top three). ++++++SPOILERS++++++ "Darling! Light, of my life. I'm not gonna hurt ya. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said, I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just gonna bash your brains in. I'm gonna bash 'em right the f*** in! Ha, ha!" or the part when Wendy finds the tall stack of typed pages of the supposed "book" that Jack Torrence is writing. The horror that was felt by the viewer when every single page simply said "All work and no play makes jack a dull boy" or when the little child Danny was talking to his mother MRS. Torrence... Kurbic was a film directing genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubricks Horror Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few days ago I bought the Danish DVD edition at my local videostore,I had never seen it before and looked forward to it (mostly because when I was 5 years old, my entire family saw it, and I should stay at my room while they saw it) anyway, when I got home and pushed it in my DVD player late at night with the lights off and a bowl of popcorn between my legs I was terrified. It is one of the most creepy films I've ever seen. I just LOVE the music, that gives the film a even more creepy side. The scene that will be on my mind the most is the room 237 scene, a very sensual and spooky scene at the same time. The only thing I misses is the extra 20 minutes that is missing on my DVD, I would really love to see those minutes, but the movie can without a problem be wiewed a lot and lots of times without those scenes it IS a classic!I also loved the special features:Vivian Kubrick's Making of documentary and the original trailer, I don't know if there is more features on the american DVD, and I surely hope not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>kubrick's working of stephen king's "the shining" is a flawed film. i get the sense that a tighter film (more in the two hour range instead of nearly two and a half hours) would have made this one more of an asset toward his credit. kubrick, however, is often one to let scenes drag. there are many slower paced scenes in here that work remarkably toward establishment of loneliness that steadily becomes insanity. the meat of the film, however, holds up. even with myriad pop culture references made in its direction, since 1980, "the shining" is still worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film. It doesn't recur to gore excesses and the usual horror clichés (the old and isolated grand house that can only be haunted, lights going off and objects moving about by themselves, dark corners and dusty basements and attics...)but we have here a very clean and extremely well lighted place where it seems impossible that anything wrong can happen. But then, the most effective horror can be drawn from normal and totally pleasant-looking environments, which makes it more terrifying. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of visual compositions (his career began as a photographer), and among all of his films this one remains to me as his most beautiful. It is full of carefully composed and paced tracking shots where the hotel decor plays an essential part in the visual symmetry and composition: ample spaces where the characters look vulnerable, endless corridors and huge function rooms where one can almost get lost.The hotel is a gigantic maze that reflects the hedge maze outside, and the Torrance family are trapped in it. The Stephen King novel is very good, but a bit boring and overlong, since it develops sub-stories about characters that are not relevant to this story, and tells the past of the Torrances in several flashbacks. Kubrick goes straight to business after half an hour,lets out anything that does not interest us here and changes the plot significantly and gives the story a completely different ending. Because of that, many fans of the novel didn't like the film when it first came out (it disappointed me too, when I fist saw it on television after reading the novel) and Stephen King himself hated it and fell out with Kubrick for what he considered it was a distorted and self-indulgent manipulation of his story. But new viewings of the film have helped me to discover its real quality and visual beauty and the way in which the horror is not actually shown explicitly but implied in our imagination through the characters' behaviour and the chilling score. The Torrances don't get slain one after the other every time someone goes off wandering by themselves like it always happen in the usual slash movie. Here the horror lies in the increasing hallucinations of Jack, the visions of Danny and the gradual mental breakdown of Wendy caused by Jack's bullying. The most chilling moments are the close-up of a dishevelled and stubble Jack staring blankly into space as his mind is cracking, and Wendy going through his manuscript only to find out that he has been writing one same sentence through hundreds of pages. That is a brilliant way of showing how a man is going insane before he actually starts using violence. The only gore concession in the film is Halloran's axe murder, which may seem gratuitous since he was expected to take Wendy and Danny back to civilisation, leaving Jack to die alone in the hotel. But his failed mission has a purpose too, because his snow-cat is actually used at the end by the woman and the child to escape from that evil place. But then, since the hotel doesn't get destroyed like it happens in the book, the ending is open for another family of caretakers to come in next winter and the Overlook's evil circle to start again. Chilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick and Nicholson prove throughout this horror epic that good direction and acting tell a better tale than multi-million dollar special effects. Berlioz over the opening credits sets the stage for a slow, deliberate feeling of dread. SPOILER ALERT-- If you need an explosion in every other scene and a body-count in the hundreds before a movie reaches its' finale, this is not for you. The Shining is a horror picture that actually requires you to imagine a little of what scares the hell out of you rather than having it spelled out-- END SPOILER... This is an intelligent depiction of what frightens people the most and that, after all, is what can conceivably happen. Isolation equals boredom and Jack isn't very nice when he gets bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this film so great, besides Jack Nicholson's terrifying performance, is Stanely Kubrick's sense of direction. Stanely Kubrick was great at the little details. One thing that freaks me out about the movie is... since there was no drop of alcohol in the hotel ... how was he getting drunk? Ghost liquor? One of the most geniusly scary moments is in the very end, when they show Jack Nicholson in a picture from the early 1920s! Before this film when anybody heard the phrase "Heeeere's Johnny!", they thought of the Johnny Carson show. But now when they hear that phrase, people think of Jack Nicholson going insane and chopping down a bathroom door with an axe! I loved this movie! If you are looking for a great scare rent "The Shining". Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven Kings novels rarely transpose on to the screen with any success (see Tommy Knockers, IT, The Dark Half etc) but Kubricks' mind with the excellence of Nicholsons acting ability create a haunting and mildly disturbing portrayal of Kings harrowing novel.Jack Nicholson plays the part of Jack perfectly. His whole persona with his 'gifted' son and his whining wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall is again ideally cast)collapses as the Hotels presence invades Jacks' already disturbed mind.Danny has the Shining, a gift of for-seeing doom, he too sees his own ghosts and the affect this has on his young mind are disastrous, being asked to play by the twin girls killed by a previous caretaker and then seeing their disemboweled bodies would send any sane adult over the edge let alone a disturbed boy with dysfunctional parents.The blood flow and body count is enough to scare anybody, watch the film a couple of times and really get into the psychological side of the film and it will leave you reeling for days afterwards.A true horror film even if the book ending is different to the film (read it and see), a classic horror that has pride of place in my DVD collection.Remember, 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy'10 out of 10, Rest well Stanley you deserve it.January 2003</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artsy horror...nothing more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be fooled that just because this a Stanley Kubrick movie and it's on the top 250 films here that it's good. Don't get me wrong, the movie is certainly top-notch horror, but only in the terms that it's not a teenage slasher, the body count is not sky high, it has people who can actually act, and the mood is just right. For a horror film, that's VERY rare. BUT...you will most likely fall asleep waiting for the movie to get to a scare. Kubrick lets this movie drag on forever...it's exhausting. If you've read the book, you know it's about a family that moves into the Overlook Hotel where the dad pulls a crazy and goes postal with an axe (actually, a mallet in the book). Sound interesting? It is. If you can wait the 2 hours to get to that part. The only good thing about this is the end, which is terrifying and definitely a horror classic, and the several good scares Kubrick inserts...between all the boring stuff. This "family" just walks around the hotel alone, not even talking to one another except about meals, etc. while Nicholson (a great performance, by the way) loses it for no apparent reason...a little explanation would have helped. Shelly Duvall is a good actress...her character is such a wuss you could hit her with a feather and she would die. Overall this movie has serious flaws like slow pacing...um, VERY slow...and the biggest flaw of all is in the characters. I never even FEEL the connection between these people. You never believe they are a family. I mean, the little boy Danny is being chased by his own FATHER with an axe...that's something absolutely terrible...but in this movie you never even see the two as father and son...you see them as killer and prey. Hello?! They are blood relatives, shouldn't we feel that? This is NOT a family. This movie is just artsy, dressed up horror, boil it all down and you got a boring movie with a few good scares. If you want to see this, make sure you see it alone. That way you won't make your friends sit for over 2 hours watching Danny ride around on a bike, Wendy make meals, and Jack type. YAAAWWWWNNNN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Novelist Jack Torrance and his family have been chosen to become the care-takers of a large hotel in the Rockie Mountains, The Overlook. Jack was delighted. Before long, Jack, his wife Wendy and their 6-year-old son, Danny, head up there. Danny has an imaginary friend, Tony and just recently, he was frightened of am image he saw in his mind of elevator doors opening and blood pouring out. Once at the hotel, the Torrances are shown around. There's a dozen rooms, kitchen, everything. The entire hotel would be vacant for the winter so it would be just the three of them alone. The cook, Dick Hallorann, notices that Danny is clarevoyent. He can read minds.Pretty soon, Jack, Wendy and Danny were completely alone and soon strange things start to happen. Like when Danny rides his tricycle up and down the hallways, he sees two girls standing there. Also, there was a woman in one of the rooms that tries to strangle him. Jack goes to investigate and the woman becomes a rotting corpse. Jack also meets ghosts in the ballroom. One of them is of the former caretaker, Delbert Grady. He had gone insane and butchered his wife and two daughters. Coincidence? Danny continues to exhibit weird behavior and Jack comes down with cabin fever. He was going crazy. He must be, because Wendy noticed a whole pile of papers with only one continuous sentence on them: All Work and No Play Makes Jack a Dull Boy. Jack had been told by the spirits to kill his family. He vowed he would, even Wendy locking him in the storage closet didn't stop him.  It was starting to snow pretty hard outside and Wendy couldn't radio for help, due to Jack had sabotaged both the radio and the Snow Cat: a vehicle built for traveling in snow. Jack chases Wendy and Danny with an axe. Danny summons Dick Hallorann with his mind and he hurries to the hotel in a Snow Cat. When he arrives, Jack plunges an axe in his back then chases Danny through a hedge maze in the backyard. Wendy finds him and they escape in the Snow Cat, leaving Jack to freeze to death and join the spirits in the hotel. A pretty good movie. Both perplexing and scary. Jack Nicholson was good. Shelley Duvall was good also, so were Scatman Crothers and Danny Lloyd. Crothers and Nicholson also starred in 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, also a good film. Scatman Crothers is sadly no longer with us. He died in real life in 1986. If you're a fan of Stanley Kubrick and/or Stephen King or Jack Nicholson, I recommend The Shining! Both perplexing and scary!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT-I saw this movie when it first came out and was not impressed. I even watched it again a year or so later on cable and still didn't like it. A few months ago I was talking to a couple of guys who loved the movie and they were talking about all this subtle, symbolic stuff that was in the movie that supposedly made it so creepy. I started to think that maybe I'd been missing something all along. One guy described the "blood-filled elevator" scene as representing "fear of menstruation". Since I was 16 or 17 when I first saw the film I thought that maybe some of this "symbolism" had gone right over my head. So I go out a couple months ago and rent the movie and watch it again for the first time in over 20 years and all I could think afterwards was that those guys were talking out of their a**es. Fear of menstruation? Huh? The first person in the movie to have this vision of the blood-filled elevator was the kid, Danny. How old was he? Five? Six? Why would a 5 or 6 year old BOY have a fear of menstruation. Wendy (Shelly Duval) sees the same bloody scene later in the film but I guess her son is more afraid of menstruation than she is since he had the vision first. These guys also tried to tell me that the movie had something to do with American Indians. An earlier post on this site says the same thing and suggests that we research it on the internet. This movie was released in 1980, way before the internet as we know it existed. Were we supposed to sit around waiting for the internet to be invented and for someone to put up a "The Shining" site so that this movie would finally reveal its scary treasures? If I have to research the movie on the internet for it to become scary then the movie doesn't work. As for the Indian thing, one of the guys observed that as the movie progressed Wendy started wearing her hair like an Indian (whatever that means) and that in one scene she was wearing moccasins. OOOhhh SCARY!!! Didn't this story take place out West? Don't people out there who AREN'T in symbol laden horror movies wear all kinds of Indian and Indian inspired clothing and jewelry? What the hell?! So what. Finally, I thought that Shelly Duval was horribly miscast and Jack Nicholson was creepy right from the beginning of the movie so that I never got the sense that he was gradually going insane once he arrived at the hotel. For a time I thought that the movie was being intentionally ambiguous about whether the hotel was having a malevolent effect on Jack or whether his "personal demons" were getting the better of him. The film might have been better if it had maintained this ambiguity but instead it scuttled it altogether as soon as we see that Wendy is seeing some of the same apparitions that her son and Jack saw. So it's not all just in Jack's head. And of course there was the fact that the previous caretaker had gone nuts and murdered his family. I'm not one of those people who was disappointed that the movie wasn't faithful to the book. I didn't like the book either. If only someone could go back in time and stop Stephen King from writing that novel we could have been spared both his dreck and Kubrick's.</fullReview>

In the book this is a family which loves each other. The father has a drinking problem and has had problems in the past, but he loves his son. I no more believed Nicholson loved this kid than I believed he was married to Shelley. The gore was laughable and superfluous. Shelley Duval starts out as a totally neurotic, chain smoking woman which, of course, gives her nowhere to go with the performance. There is no family here. Kubrick's 2001...brilliant. Dr. Strangelove...Incredibly Superb. But you don't have to care about those people. Here, you need to...and you don't. Watch the TV version which follows the book.

Not only is she just not fit for Wendy, but she can't act at all in the first place. Let's think of some times when the funniest "Shelly Duvall Crappy Acting Moments" are...1.) Talking to the doctor after his fainting-Tony spell. She can't do it. It's very fake and annoying.2.) Anytime when she is running through the hotel in her "scared" mode. It's annoying and fake. You wouldn't flail your arms up in the air, waving a knife around, screaming. You just wouldn't.3.) After Wendy finds "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" written a million times, she is confronted by the author: Jack. She carries a baseball bat with her, and as he backs her up the stairs, she screams and hollers, "Stay away from me! Jack! Please!" Ahhhh... this was annoying and Shelly Duvall was again... terrible at it.Other than every moment Shelly Duvall was acting, "The Shining" is a classic, not only with horror, but as a classic anyway. The amazing tracking shots, the really cool sets, the mind-setting performances of Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall... HA! NOT! Hehe, that was funny... only of Jack Nicholson and Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers... but especially the un-settling, mind-boggling performance of Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance.The macabre this movie causes to the mind is really something un-imaginable. Kubrick really takes you into the mind of the hotel and Jack, he really shows you an awe-inspiring look at what the "dark" side may very well be.To add to this already brilliant movie (besides the "less-brilliant" Shelly Duvall performance), Kubrick took chances that were big for the late 70's, early 80's. The grotesque violence, especially when Holloran is killed, is all-around horrifying and a pure delightful romp if you're in the mood to be freaked out a little... more or less... to be freaked out a lot.You may even be freaked out by the bad acting Shelly Duvall puts on as Wendy!Stanley Kubrick may've been extremely crazy. Stanley Kubrick may've been weird, but he certainly made no mistakes while filming this movie... except, of course, the choice of Shelly Duvall for his leading lady.Kudos,Blake</fullReview>

If i were you i would read the book first because it tells you more about the story and its better.. Stanley Kubrick did a great job tho.. But he skipped lot of parts from the book..

		<fullReview>I have to admit when i first saw the shining i got the movie to the begining after watching to the end and played it again, it is intense, great full-filling masterpiece! I can't say this is the best horror that goes to "halloween" but this movie rocked. REALLY GOOD ACTINING AND STORY. Basically a man and family go to a hotel for winter with no one else there but them he is left to see if he can be the caretaker as the hotel is shut down every winter. But i dont think the guy will get the job, becuase he gets posessed and taunted by ghosts and then after time after time and being isolated he comes crazy and goes to kill his family, but the only thing is the hotel is snow bound and there is no way out of the hotel pluss it is freexingly cold out side, if you get trapped out there there is no turning bakc, so the family must try to survive their husbands vengence other than doing somthing they cant "Escaping"!And yes this is one of my all time favourites! the movie is very suspensfull and great. A classic masterpiece!The movie also gained three memorable famouse scenes!"Redrum"!"blood in the elevator"!And most notably "Heeeere's Johnny"!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Work And No Play Make Stanley Bad Director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough of the crap already! Puleeze! Let's face it, Kubrick fans this version of the Shining is pure and simple crap! Doodoo, Kaka, s**t. Your exalted, genius director of perfection really misfired on this one.Don't give me this bulls**t that that we don't understand his genius in movie making.He blew it on the shining. Am I saying Kubrick is a bad director. No. Only on this picture. He has had some great films and I have enjoyed them. This is one of the exceptions. You Kubrick fans come off as sycophants who feel you genius can do no wrong here. You need to get out of your Kubrick enduced trances and put down the Kubrick Kool-aid, this movie doesn't even resemble the book. Oh, yeah the characters and the hotel's name is the same, but little else is. First of all, some of you critics say that Stephen King didn't like this movie because he had wrote the book and that he was too close. Well Kubrick made the movie so wouldn't any of his ideas he put into it make him too close to it as well? Kubrick's major problem is that he doesn't seem to have a grasp on good and evil. That does play a factor in the Shining. In the book anyways. Secondly it's a little hard to take Jack Nicholson serious as a mad slipping into madness after playing a character who was in a mental hospital in One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest. What in the hell is wrong with a director who has one of his characters talking to his finger in the mirror as an imaginary friend? Couldn't they afford the money to have an actor play the imaginary friend. That was totally stupid. Then again, you Kubrick groupies are convinced that is genius. It takes all kinds I guess. You can say the Kubrick's version is loosely based on the book. Hell, I'd say very loosely. It is so loosely the damn thing collapses under Kubrick's ego. Where is the details of the book it was supposed to be based on? You Kubrick fans just can't admit, you genius icon who can do no wrong made a piece of celluloid manure. Face it, this is one of his worst movies. Not only is the movie miscast, it is misdirected. Kubrick was the wrong man for the task. Spielberg, Wise or Carpenter might have been a better fit for this movie. They at least have had track records with horror/ fantasy. Can any of you Kubrick sycophants really tell me with a straight face that a movie that deviates from the book on a major scale is better than one that follows the book? get real. Your letting your infatuation with director blind your judgement. Face it this movie, this version of The Shining sucks. This version should be flushed, great director or not. I laughed more than I was scared.Even the greats screw up now and then. If you want to see a good Shining rent the 1997 mini series. It's a hell of a lot closer to the book. This is major crap and should be flushed!</fullReview>

And unfortunately, one of the most frightening parts of the movie isn't even in the book. The twin girls. And what the *@$# were they thinking when they cast Shelly Duvall?!?! Wendy Torrance is supposed to be blonde, and beautiful. Shelly Duvall is neither of those. The recent T.V. remake had perfect casting as Wendy anyway. Rebecca De Mornay. Now if you're never planning on reading the book, by all means, see the movie, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Just don't expect to enjoy it AFTER reading the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is one of the greatest horror movies out there. Based on the novel of Stephen King, The Shining which was directed by Stanley Kubrick had a great plot, essentially great actors, and great music. What I really liked about this kind of horror movie was that it was a psychological horror about the supernatural and the paranormal. This movie had blood (especially the elevator scene) but it did not have any gore or guts spewing around, which is a good thing. This movie also had many of todays memorable quotes from "Redrum" to "Here's Johnny" (in a twisted way). All and all, The Shining is one of the greatest horror movies in the 20th century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Horror Movies Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and definitely the best movie Stanley Kubrick ever made. Beautiful, haunting, very subtle but brilliantly explicit when it needs to be, this film is a great balance of suspense and revelation, build and pay-off. The sense of tension and claustrophobia that pervades the movie is absolutely incredible and the constant, seething supernaturalism is so eerie, so overpowering, you find yourself getting scared by nothing half the time. The ghosts are very well done- totally unsettling and clearly unearthly while at the same time lacking things like dripping ecotoplasm or other stupid, heavy-handed and fairly typical Hollywood touches. Unlike most of Kubrick's other movies, the characters here are well fleshed out (maybe that's because, for a change, there is so few of them)and all the actors really put in stellar performances. Nicholson's legendary psychotic is of course, the show stealer, but Shelley Duvall carries her role very well, a powerful combination of vulnerability and hidden strength, she moves through the movie like wounded, frightened animal but still makes her moments of ingenuity and courage totally believable. Danny Lloyd is very believable and never precious- so rare among child actors. Many of the smaller roles are also well played- Anne Jackson, in particular, is very convincing and the scene between her and Duvall where Wendy casually reveals Jack's history of abuse and alcoholism is one of the best examples of the subtle strength of this film: Duvall's fluttery, nervous smile screaming evidence of a darker, deeper, un-talked about fear waiting to erupt and held in check by a very, very delicate boundary. All in all, a brilliant film, chilling and enthralling and practically perfect in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the book. Apparently the mini series is closer to the book. Even so, it's not a good movie. It's supposed to be horror, and not one time during the whole 6 hours was I scared. Steven Weber is a bad actor, and should stick to doing comedy series'. Jack Nicholson is absolutely perfect. Weber doesn't even come close to his performance. Kubrick is a genius. All the changes he made from the book, that I'm aware of, enhanced the whole story. The ending he created had a greater impact. The camera angles he uses are great. No one can do a review on this without mentioning the bath scene - the use of the camera in this scene is great, and the whole scene will freak anyone out. I usually hate horror movies, but Kubrick has managed to turn this into a classy, respectable, clever horror movie. It's scary without being gross, and will completely freak you out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" is one of the most stylized movies I have ever seen, and probably the most for an American film. The horror genre has long used the camera to manipulate the audience, using quick zooms, tilted angles and hand held camera to create tension and visual distortion. The sense of danger and panic was conveyed by the camera as much as it was by the narrative elements. In "The Shining", the camera is used quite differently. Instead of hand held shots, Kubrick employs steady-cam which moves with a fluid sense of menace. Also, instead of wide angles and rapid cuts, Kubrick chooses to use long takes with symmetrical framing, creating a new style that dowmplays the tension an action, but creates more terror as it works so well with the steady cam. "The Shining" also has some terrific visuals. The red bathroom that the father talks to the butler in is incredibly stylish. Also, the strange carpet designs add a unique visual flair to the movie. The insert shots of the butchered girls and butler are pretty weird, but nothing can top the guy in the bunny suit fellating the business man. Creepy and coocky. The best part of the movie is Jack Nicholson. He is in top form for this movie, especially in his scenes of metamorphisis into a lunatic. His conversations with the bar tender are extremely entertaining, as is his meeting with the butler in the red bathroom. The dialogue in these segments is great as well. Overall, "The Shining" is one of the best horror movies ever made, and worth a look for fans of the genre and Kubrick alike. It's a fun movie, but has many great merits as well, something not very common.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Here's Johnny!!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What he did for science fiction with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, Stanley Kubrick did for horror with THE SHINING; he made a film that got people talking. Adapting Stephen King's superlative book, though changing it considerably, Kubrick made what I have always believed is one of the best horror films ever.Jack Nicholson is at his maniacal best as Jack Torrence, a failed writer who takes on the job of winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, located high in the Colorado Rockies. He is advised by the hotel manager (Barry Nelson) that the big requirement for the job is that the person who takes it on should be able to handle five to six months of absolute isolation. One past caretaker couldn't, and went insane, killing his wife and two daughters with a hatchet, and himself with a shotgun.Nicholson nevertheless takes on the job, and brings his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) up there with him for company. But Lloyd, blessed (or cursed) with extrasensory powers (the "shining"), is acutely aware of the Overlook's inherent evil, embodied in his mind by the ghosts of the two girls, and in Nicholson's ever-crumbling mind by a sinister barman named Lloyd (Joe Turkel). And once the winter snows shut the Torrence family in, these elements combine with isolation and claustrophobia to turn Nicholson into an axe-wielding maniac.Shot primarily on one vast soundstage in England, THE SHINING has some of the most awesome cinematography and production design ever made for a horror movie. The camera work (using the Steadicam, one of its first uses ever) is incredible. Kubrick's choice of music is also very savvy: dissonant works by Bela Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti, and, most ominously, Krzysztof Penderecki really give the film is epic sense of terror. And of course, no one can ever forget Nicholson's celebrated "Here's Johnny!!" during his final rampage.But perhaps the best shot in the film, and one of the pivotal moments in horror history, is of the torrent of blood spilling out of the hotel's elevators in slow motion, punctuated by the avant-garde rumblings of Penderecki's music. It is one of the best scenes of its type since the shower murder in PSYCHO, and Kubrick should be commended for such a feat.Note to all book-versus-film folks out there: While the film and book versions of THE SHINING differ considerably, the basic structure of the novel is still in place. I myself liked the book AS A BOOK, and I like the movie AS A MOVIE. This is why I'd give THE SHINING a "10" rating.</fullReview>

Because after Shelley Duvall hits the screen you love to hate her. Kubrick also did this in Clockwork Orange as the main character and narrator was Little Alex (the most twisted and devious).Nicholson goes crazy a little early, but Kubrick is trying to show us something within that. Last half an hour is filled with symbolism and things I still gotta figure out.Interestyingly Stephen King (who wrote the book) hated the film.

Jack Nicholson was ideal for the part of Jack Torrance by both his looks and wonderful acting. Shelley Duvall was a great actress as well, and Danny Lloyd wasn't the type of kid who was in the movie to look cute--he acted just like Danny Torrance did in the book. Not only were the actors perfect for their roles, but Kubrick captured the horror from Stephen King's popular book. I'm not trying to offend anyone, but if you love scary movies and didn't like "The Shining," then you are not intellegent enough to capture the brilliance of King's writing and Kubrick's directing.10/10 You should definately see "The Shining" if you love to be creeped out!</fullReview>

No matter how many times you watch this movie it still makes you excited and scared to see the next scene. You still jump when you see something surprising come onto the screen. I would tell anyone who likes horror movies, or just a great movie with good acting, to rent this and watch it with some popcorn after dark.

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding classic of modern horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't care for big-budget movies--especially in the horror genre--but The Shining was magnificent in every department. In adapting Stephen King's often-trite novel, Stanley Kubrick wisely excises or down-plays the elements that didn't work and builds up the ones that did. The components of alcoholism, cabin fever, and the supernatural are blended seamlessly, resulting in a film that, while long, is completely involving. Technically brilliant, the film benefits from John Alcott's amazingly fluid cinematography and a masterful use of sound. The sets, locations, and haunting score create a palpable air of eeriness even when nothing overtly scary is happening. When the terror really kicks in, watch out! You may never look at an elevator or a bathtub the same way again.The acting is astounding. Jack Nicholson may not come off as the world's most normal person (and, lest we forget, normal is BO-RING!), but he's fantastic; his transformation from edgy-yet-likable protagonist to ax-wielding monster is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Also stunning is the underrated Shelley Duvall as the quiet, gawky housewife who displays a surprising amount of resourcefulness under extraordinary circumstances. While Nicholson may not be an everyday type, the unglamorous Duvall certainly is. The great Scatman Crothers excels in a kindly supporting role, and Danny Lloyd is a refreshingly likable, unobnoxious child actor.A truly terrifying, beautiful, controversial Gothic epic, The Shining is truly a masterpiece of modern horror. Beware the butchered, overdubbed TV print.</fullReview>

It is a wonderful cinematic masterpiece in which the acting directing and cinematography produce a feel that i beleive is unparalleled in the horror/phycological thriller genre. For a start Steven King stories are over exaggerated, predictable and totally stupid featuring monsters and supernatural activity that is so unbelievable its almost humorous. Keeping that in mind I was so refreshed to see the brilliant Kubrick take a completely different spin on the movie.This film is about the Psychological effects of solitude and differing environments on a normal man. I believe its not a cheesy horror film about an evil house. Although the little boy who can see the future is pretty stupid the scenes with Jack Nicholson are so believable and so well acted and directed this film sends chills down your spine. Its about mental insanity and has echoes in films such as fight club and M Nigh Shylamans the Sixth sense.I think that if people watch this film and look at it as a cheesy horror flick they will take nothing from it. Look at it as a human behaviour study mixed with elements of uncertainty and supernatural or halucinagenic imagery and you will take heaps more out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about Al Bowlly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say What?WHAT about AL BOWLLY?Or the Ray Noble Orchestra?I feel any "User Comment" I may have about this film would be in vain given the hype and controversy surrounding the director, the book, etcetera, as this was written more for those who HAVE seen the film or are seeking other opinions by reading these reviews. I am largely annoyed with this film (I liked Kubrick's "Lolita" myself, much more!), but this picture does have some splendid, provocative, frightening images, and for these alone I would recommend this film, however, these have been discussed to death.SO -What about that lovely big Gold Room Dance? The incredible ambiance created by the elegant 1920's ghosts walking around that enormous airplane-hangar of a ballroom, the potted palms, the balloon clusters and sparkly streamers tacked beneath them? AND WHAT ABOUT THE SONGS?Okay, when the soundtrack LP came out, I hastily ran out and bought it assuming the lovely lilting vocal which lures Jack Torrance into the Gold Room, and repeats again in full during the end credits, would be there.It wasn't.Instead, the song "Home" (which is indeed heard, only in the highly-reverbed background as Jack and Delbert Grady discuss things in the "Gentlemen's Room") was on the album, credited by an ersatz made-up name like "Henry Hall and the Gleneagles Hotel Band," or some such ludicrous thing, and the fact is, Warner Brothers just didn't credit Al Bowlly, the actual crooner who performed "Midnight, the Stars, and You" in 1934, nor the Ray Noble Orchestra which accompanies him. Perhaps "Home" was by a contemporary artist of the time, and recorded specifically for the picture, but I doubt it. This point aside, this music is what so sets the glittering vintage ambiance of the Ball, and it seems significant as it plays again at the very end and well into the end-titles. Yet no one acknowledges this. Why "THAT" song? I love it, but is there "a meaning" that has yet to be discussed or revealed?It is almost as if this aspect of the picture is swept under the Gold Room Carpet, for every other little thing about "The Shining" has been analyzed with a finely-honed axe, except that wonderful song and its role in the picture. There are few if any who note it, care about it, or wonder why The Genius Called Kubrick doesn't acknowledge or even credit it anywhere, to my knowledge, at all. It establishes a mood and a presence as important as any other visual or music cue, and the director deemed it intriguing enough to repeat in the finale. The lyrics are relatively clear and audible, perhaps containing a message, perhaps not, and the lushness it conveys is palpable; that particular instrumentation just *IS* the Overlook Ballroom (muted horns, sax, saucy little high-hat cymbal-fox-trot rhythm, etc.).I daren't pursue a "meaning," but please, note it when it plays. It wasn't just Source-Music (music pre-recorded by unknown studio orchestras and stashed in a vast music bank for use as MUZAK in restaurant and bar scenes in motion pictures), it was a real song, recorded by a real band. I will say this: as the film has it, the whole "July Fourth Ball" and the ghostly party and so on were supposed to have taken place in 1921, yet "Midnight" was recorded in February 1934, according to the liner notes on the compact disc it was finally released on.So HEEE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really haven't understood this whole fight. I think that half of you hate this movie just because it isn't word for word like the novel. If Spielberg would've done a story closer to Peter Benchley's novel, would it have been NEARLY as good as it was? Of course not. In movies, changes are necessary. And this whole thing suprises me because you guys are talking about Stanley kubrick. This guy is way up there with Hitchcock and Copppla. He knew what he was doing, and he did a damn good job, too.Kubrick isn't Stephen King. They think much differently. Novels are meant to be more complex because they're NOVELS. As for a real movie review, The Shining was good but atcually a bit disappointing. But I think whatever the book is like should have NO effect on how you enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let us put this to rest, shall we?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ladies and gentlemen, I have read all of the comments on "The Shining", both negative and positive, and I must say I think that it is my turn to shed some light on this mysterious movie.For the detractors, I have these points to express. Many of you claim that it sucked horribly because it was not loyal to the novel. I would like to point out that the TV movie made in 1997, which was approved by King and was as faithful as possible, was even worse than Kubrick's vision. So don't knock this one because it is different. Also, you have all claimed that "The Shining" was boring and overlong. Your main error was seeing this movie, expecting to see a horror movie instead of a Kubrick film. Sure, it doesn't have things popping out every second or ridiculous hedge monsters coming to life, which is excellent. If you want all of that, I suggest the "Friday the 13th" series instead. Kubrick's films deal with the horrible aspect of the darker sides of men (Full Metal Jacket, A Clockwork Orange), and not monsters that go bump in the night. You have also claimed that Wendy was too weak and stupid for her character. Personally, I believe that this is essential. It creates the feeling of the audience wanting to kill her as well, so strangely we can understand a mad man. To the supporters, I have these things to say. This is definetly not a masterpiece, and is not Kubrick's best work. I consider myself the biggest Kubrick fan out there, but I have to point this out. The boy who played Danny was not very good, to be frank (still better than that Anakin Skywalker brat though) and Shelley Duvall does have her acting slipups (especially with her scenes with Jack before he goes psycho). The scenery and the camerawork, and Jack are all excellent indeed, however. And the ending to the film is twenty times better than that hokey and predictable finale to the novel.Sit and watch "The Shining" alone and away from distractions with an open mind. Only then will you fully appreciate it from an intellectual standpoint. I will state once again that this film is still not Stanley's best movie, but it is not his worst. That honor belongs to "Barry Lyndon".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of nonpareil substance. Simply put the greatest horror film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the greatest horror film ever made. There's not a doubt in my mind. I have seen many films in this genre, but none, none come near the brilliance of this one. I have heard several criticisms over the years and I always find this interesting, because typically the hangups people have about this film are personal hangups, and are shortcomings that stem from the viewer's projection of those hangups on to the film. That unfortunately is one of the few obstacles that stands in the way of film possessing total universality. Of course the obvious hangup is people that read the Stephen King novel first and didn't appreciate the fact that the film was a departure from the source. Well I hate to differ with you, but the film is ten times better than any book Stephen King could ever write. The simple and undeniable fact is that Stanley Kubrick is one of the best directors ever if not the best and the same can certainly not be said for King as a writer. The changes that Kubrick made to the film gave it a depth in its medium that King's novel seldom exhibited. Some other examples of hangups would be people who won't watch or disapprove of films like Raging Bull, because they have a strong aversion to violence, or people who think films like The Searchers and Vertigo are overrated because they don't take those genres seriously. So in order to see this film for what it really is and not be blinded by your prejudices, simply sit down, leave your hangups at the door, and watch your superficiality and pretentiousness melt away in the resplendent light of this radiant film. The photography by Kubrick's terrific visual collaborator John Alcott is unbelievable. Kubrick in his youth broke in as a photographer, and the incredible photography of his films are testimonies to that background. The performance by Jack Nicholson is amazing, maybe the best of his career, certainly the most animated and entertaining. I know that some will say that it is over the top, but it fits the film perfectly. The biggest difference between the film and the novel is that in the novel it is purely the hotel that is evil, and in the film Jack is someone looking for an escape, not just to work on his novel, but to escape the failure that his life has become, to be something he could never be in reality, to renounce his responsibility, to renounce his shortcomings and awaken into the person he wants to be. The hotel provides him with that opportunity, and in the nightmare scene which is a spectacular metaphor Jack's subconscious after a lifetime of social and moral repression is finally awakening. This accents the relationship between modern man (his relationship/kinship to the hotel which is obviously intended as a metaphor for escape or retreat) and his carnal need to become something greater than what he is perfectly. The bottomline is the performances are great, the script is great, the direction is flawless, and the photography as always is unique and interesting. The splits and doublings have never been as fully accomplished or realized in any other film ever made, and I should mention that though I labeled this a horror film at the beginning of my critique it is so much more. This film transcends not only the genre, but cinema in general. Also, not to be ignored is the wonderful symmetry of music and imagery to create intense fear in the audience. Last but not least the ending is so much more expressive and unique than the typical horror ending that the book had to offer, in seeing it you come to understand that as is so often the case in life there is more than one side to the coin of every entity. This is an immaculate film made by an immaculate filmmaker and any shortcomings that are perceived exist in the minds of the viewer and not on screen. The viewers that will be blase, critical, or indifferent in regards to this film are intellectually indolent peasants (lacking vision and imagination) who don't deserve to delight in a film of such nonpareil substance. The Shining's ambiguity does not limit it, but immortalizes it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie. Dull parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is easily one of the best horror movies in my eyes. All I know that is different from the book (I haven't read the book yet) is the ending. How *SPOILER* Jack dies and how the Overlook gets destroyed in the book. Wendy acted in my eyes good. But she just seemed to fragile and weak. I mean Danny seems to be more brave than her. Speaking of Danny, when he saw the two little girls, He acted as if they were his friends. No scared face or surprised. And he just covered his eyes and peeked through them. Jack Nicholson probably made the movie good as it is. With his special taglines, as in every movie consisting of, "Heeeeeres Johnny. Little pigs little pigs, let me come in. and Wendy, I'm home" as he hacks down the bathroom door where Wendy and Danny are with a fire axe. That part was probably my fav. I am trying to find the book to see if it is better or worse. Well I think the movie is good as it is. Kubrick kind of made up his own plot. Or added more to Stephen Kings. I recommend this movie. Oh, Just one more comment. What was that part at the end where Wendy looks into a room and sees that guy in the dog suit leaning over some other guy. Some sick felatio thing from a couple years back? Either way it creeped me out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is actually wonderful! Stanley Kubrick doesn't choose to commit much of the actual book to film; however, he does a great job at creating an atmosphere of terror and confusion of all characters involved. This movie delves into a lot of things. There is not so much terror in the supernatural, but more in the little it takes to lead Jack Torrence (by the ghosts) to try and kill his family. That this character wants to do it and tries is what is horrible. Both the book and movie show this. I think that is the main plot of both stories. For there are almost no other connections to the characters Stephen King created and the ones that Jack Nicholson and cast became.The scene with the bathtub lady is the most memorable for being frightening. Well...for being gross and horrifying. I recommend watching this movie but with the intent to look at it as a film separate from what you know about the story of The Shining. It is in itself a masterpiece.</fullReview>

When Jack Nicholson sees the naked women who supposedly tried to kill Danny rotting, it just freaked me out. How he screamed and the way she got up the shower.

		<shortDescription>In Defense of Duvall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read several negative comments regarding the performance of Shelley Duvall, I took it upon myself to defend the actress. You see, I simply cannot envision anyone else in the role of Wendy as Duvall has a quality of innocent quirkiness and weakness that lends itself beautifully to the character. She also proves highly effective in conveying a state of shear terror, and emotional devastation in her scenes with Jack Nicholson, which never fails to curdle my blood. In addition, I feel her character is not supposed to be necessarily likeable as her behavior is often blind and irrational. However, at the same time, the viewer roots for her to escape, as she is human, and does not deserve to be a victim of Jack's insanity. I feel that many may mistake their feelings of frustration with Duvall's character for Duvall's performance, which I happen to find pitch perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After getting out The Shining for the first time and watching it for about the third time this week, it is definitely a new favorite of mine. After only seeing one other Stanley Kubrick film, Eyes Wide Shut, which is also just brilliant, The Shining highlights Kubrick's style, and makes a horror movie into more of a psychological thriller. It wasn't like your typical 'I can see that you're wearing a mask' horror movie, it was more like a Silence of the Lambs type. SO much more satisfying and disturbing. I had always wanted to see The Shining, and I only just remembered by chance in the video store that I should get it. I must say, it was one of my best choices ever! It is funny how you don't have to get a new release out on video that you missed in the movies to be entertained; a classic from the 80's has turned my head away from the Hollywood movies which don't catch my attention half as much anymore.The only thing I was withdrawn about was that in Australia, it was given an M rating, which means 15+ years can watch it, or at least rent it. And in other countries it is R, I don't understand this. I think this is a dramatic mistake on the classifications part, because there is no way I could stomach or mentally accept this movie if I was any younger. I am 19. And it deals with way too much that a child would not understand and would be frightened by. I am a psychology and counseling student, and not all of it was clear to me either. Was the fantasy all psychological? It should be much more restricted viewing. It was not like any other horror movie, and is not something I will forget anytime soon. It still lies with me like the wood-chipper scene in Fargo. Kiddies should watch out for this one when they are older.Great movie, Jack Nicholson can certainly pull off those stares!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is a strange movie. There are many disturbing scenes and characters, but it is a great movie. It is set at the Overlook Hotel deep somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, and it has absolutely no winter guests or employees, except for the winter caretaker and their family. Jack Torrance applies for the job with his wife, Wendy (Shelly Long) and son, because he is working on a novel and needs six months of peace and quiet to get it done. Right before he accepts the the job though, the hotel owner tells him of the caretaker a few years before that went crazy and murdered his wife and daughters with an axe, then put both barrels of a shotgun in his mouth. When they move in for the winter, strange things start happening that only the little boy can see. The movie escalates into all-out insanity, with blood pouring out of elevators and a being in a bear suit having sex with a man. Kubrick conjured up some truly disturbing pictures with the help of the original book, to make this classic horror masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Terror Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is an exercise in true eerie terror. There will never be another movie like it.It starts off with Jack, his wife Wendy and their clairvoyant son Danny, who knows something isn't right with the hotel that they are staying at all winter. The hotel was recently a hell house, when they previous family staying there were murdered gruesomely by the father, who went crazy from the isolation. Danny predicts a similar fate for his family and the longer Jack stays, the more insane he becomes.Everything about this movie is perfect, the dreamy tracking shots, the meticulous direction by Stanley Kubrick, the deliberately slow but nightmarish pace, and the deliciously over-the-top performance from Jack Nicholson, who was disappointingly overlooked for an Oscar Nomination, but the real star of The Shining are the sets, which are hypnotic. If you are a true horror fan, than this movie is a must-see. Likewise for anyone else except for fans of the book, who will be turned off by the way it wasn't like Stephen King's trashy novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is one of those rare artworks which dig deep in the human mind and reach the ancient core of the struggle for life. Stanley Kubrick's outstanding work creates a dark and stressing ambient which makes the story the most horrendous adventure a human being can live.This is a masterpiece of the Seventh Art. Excellent acting, a perfect ambientation, a shuddering screenplay which makes you hide in the farthest corner of your soul... simply the best horror film ever made. But the horror featured in this film is not the classic "sudden stimulus" resource, but a kind more violent which deals with the supernatural and the true sense of madness.Watching "The Shining" is undertaking the responsibility of a journey to the center of the abyss of loneliness, a pact between schizophrenia and the evil of a place that lives in the killing, and that's why this movie is a really hideous experience.Don't watch it alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Haunted House Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember going to see "The Empire Strikes Back" in May of 1980 and seeing the trailer for this film. I was only 6 years old so my first reaction to Jack Nicholson was to be completely terrified of him.I am a big fan of Stephen King's novel of which this film is based on. As different and as simplified as this movie is from the book, this is still an exceptionally spooky horror film. I think Stanley Kubrick did a great job by NOT explaining every supernatural vision portrayed here. The best aspect of his films is that they demand not only repeat viewings but also open up situations that can be debated among viewers long after the film is over. Kubrick does not take the position of someone who knows all about the supernatural - he is just as human as the rest of us. He can only explain as much as we all can see. What it all means is something that creates great conversation although people tend to become frustrated when all the answers are not provided for them.Whether or not you liked this movie, there is no denying that you will never forget it, especially the images Kubrick creates - the blood pouring out of the elevator, the two little girls, the lady in the bathtub, Jack Torrence's repetitious novel and Jack and his trusty axe chasing a little boy through the hedge maze. And pay attention to the opening credit sequence as Jack drives to the Overlook Hotel - it appears as if the glaring sun in some shots are lined up with Jack's car, as if pulling him towards his dark destiny.And it's time to give credit where it is due - Shelly Duvall is excellent. The first few times I saw the film, I found her quite annoying. Upon watching it again recently I began to realize that she has many childlike qualities which make her relationship with their son much stronger than what she has with her husband. This gives the films climax more credibility. The rest of the cast is great as well - Danny Lloyd, people claim, is too bland in his role but I think he translates perfectly the insecurity of a child his age having the power he has - capable of conjuring up images that no one should have to bear. I have always been a fan of the late, great Scatman Crothers. Here, he was given a dramatic role and I think he gave his best performance. And, of course, Jack is Jack at his (appropriately) over-the-top best.But this movie works because of Kubrick, the wonderfully creepy music and the sets for the hotel. I've never seen such ordinary rooms appear so frightening. His use of wide-angle lenses in tight areas make you feel the characters tremendous sense of isolation.This is not your typical film viewing experience and that is what is so fantastic about it. Films that actually make you think and debate with others - a perspective that many film makers today have all but deserted for "safe, throw-in- everything-including-the-kitchen-sink," story structure. I believe this is a primary example of why our society has become lazy in the way our minds think. We want all our questions answered at the push of a button on our keyboard.If you want to be truly spooked, you near to obtain that fear of the unknown. "The Shining" will do just that. I promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is a movie which characterizes very well the essence of Kubrick's cinema, this movie is The Shining. Even though it is based on a Stephen King's novel, Kubrick took it to celluloid from his point of view, that is to say, adding and removing what he considered necessary. It was a good transcription. I was really apalled when I first see it when I was a child. I could feel being there, behind the boy's tricycle, flowing fearfully through the Overlook corridors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is simply the most horrifying film I've seen in my whole life. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a writer who goes in a hotel with his family(his wife and his son)to be far from the city and to don't get his concentration broken every five seconds. But a long time ago, another caretaker killed his wife and his two daughters with an ax. The whole family already has mental disorder problems(the son, Danny, has an imaginary friend, Tony which is his second personality). The boy sees weird things in the hotel; the two girls that got killed long ago by their father are talking to him. Jack becomes more and more ''psycho'' day after day and finally wants to kill his family... There are lots of details in The Shining that you don't understand the first 5 times you watch it...that's why I bought it. And especially a weird ''time warp''which makes you ask yourself;do the characters have been in the Hotel before? I did not already find the answer. In this film, based on the novel by Stephen King, the horror is intelligent and is not based on blood and guts, Kubrick knew our fears, and he put them together. He is a genius. Jack Nicholson plays his character like a pro(he is!!!) and Danny Lloyd says REDRUM with a very scary voice. By the way, when I realized that REDRUM was MURDER, I told myself that I had a lot more to understand about this masterpiece. Stephen King written the story of Sometimes They Come Back, which is about zombies, which I call a STUPID AND SIMPLE HORROR SUBJECT, the opposite of The Shining's subject. He also written the story of The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption, two excellent movies that are not scary at all. He is definitely an excellent writer. Stanley Kubrick, well, it's Stanley Kubrick. He is the director who made some excellent movies, masterpiece after masterpiece. He takes his time to put us in the most sensational atmosphere possible, depending on the kind of movie. BUT NOW HE IS DEAD!!!AND IT MEANS THAT HE WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER MASTERPIECE...AND THAT MAKES ME SAD...But The Shining is still here, and I'll never forget it! I give it 98%(and maybe I am not generous enough....)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kubrick Komplex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read, many, well - founded critiques praising Stanley Kubrick's work on this movie, The Shining, but, I thought an opposite opinion would be welcomed, even as a novelty, perhaps. I've seen this movie with a great friend of mine, and one of the most addicted fans of both Kubrick's and Nicholson's work. She obligated me to see the movie, knowing that I hate horror films, and I'm not much of a fan of the great Kubrick - but I did made her watch Joanna with me that same day.. After seeing it, I just stumbled upon my usual opinion on Kubrick's movies. Visually striking, no context whatsoever. It seems promising, at first, and there are absolutely masterful camera angles, but, it's all part of the pretty package that surrounds this overrated piece of junk!The movie has absolutely no story, Nicholson's performance reaches the highest camp ever seen after 'Valley Of The Dolls', Shelley Duvall's is extremely annoying as the loving, ever so comprehensive wife, that only reacts to his husband when he becomes obviously menacing to herself and their child, and no explanations of the going ons, at all! It is not the same case as Hitchcock's The Birds... on that, we have clues, little insights that makes us feel we know what happened... on The Shining, we have no clues, just tons and tons of episodic happenings, and gatherings of odd, bizarre moments. IS Nicholson posessed by the old caretaker? IS Nicholson posessed by an antique spirit that lived within the Hotel, a long time ago...? IS Nicholson going mad? Do we care...? The only relief that we have is a solid performance by Danny Loyd, great soundtrack, and as I 'd said before, dazzling camera angles. Otherwise, confuse, contrived, arty and irritating piece of trash.It's The Kubrick complex... visually striking, where's the story?For A Good Early Kubrick, rent Lolita, or Paths Of Glory, Or Dr. StrangeLove. Keep away from this supposedly arty dead end of a movie.</fullReview>

It's nothing but non-stop thrills the whole time. The two girls frieked me out the most. It's not the least bit boring. You watch as Jack slowly goes insane...what's boring about that? Jack Nicholson does a fantastic job playing the role of Jack Torrance. Shelly Duvall is a bit annoying, but I think that's just the character. People ALWAYS compare this movie and the book. Look, it's based upon the novel, not the exact novel word for word, scene for scene. If you want to see the novel in a movie, go see the mini-series that was way more based on the book, but wasn't as good as the original movie! See this one, it's the BEST!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that really changed my life on horror movies as I percieve them today. The directing and style is impeccable, while the performance of Jack Nicholson in psychotic overdrive adds to the horrific atmosphere. The rather simple story- a struggling, former-alcoholic writer and his wife and kid go to take care of a large hotel over the winter. Eventually, he goes crazy and tries to kill his family. There, the simplicities end and the complexities begin. Then, we find out that the kid has the ability to see through things as they really are- a Sixth Sense-ish ability called "shining". Also, add to the plot a cook who also has the ability to "shine". I won't say any more, but anyone who has not checked this film out owes it to themselves to rent it.

		<fullReview>I have read the Stephen King novel upon which this film is based. It was probably ten years ago, though, when I was very young, so I don't remember much of it. However, I do know that I wasn't scared by the book at all. This film, by Stanley Kubrick (one of my fave directors), scares me. Well, I don't know if "scare" is the correct word, but it certainly makes me feel *very* uneasy. Watching "The Shining" is a very intense movie experience, much like watching "The Exorcist". The brilliant music, the direction, the acting and the camera angles adds up to a very strange and disturbing movie indeed. I wouldn't call "The Shining" a masterpiece, but I will not hesitate to say that it is certainly a great film and one of the best horror movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I chose to visit the user comments to see if others felt the same way as I did about this film, and with a few exceptions, I guess I must have watched a different film. The majority of comments here indicate the film was worth watching. This is wrong. The film is pure crap.For a film that is supposed to be so full of suspense and horror, I found it laughable. Obviously Kubrick has his disciples that will not allow themselves to say anything bad about his productions, and I presume this is the reason for the large number of good comments.The following summary is bound to contain spoilers of some sort, so turn away now, if you want to reserve seeing pure crap for yourself at a later date...At the start of the film, the audience gets introduced to the story of the last person who stayed all winter, went nuts and axed his family to death. "Not me" says Jack Nicholson. A couple of days later, Jack is going nuts and looking to axe his family to death. Gosh. That was a surprise. Not. However would we, the audience, have expected that, were it not for the rather poor directing effort at the start that gave away the whole plot?I turn my attention now to the black guy who senses something is wrong from a thousand miles away due to his psychic ability. He then jumps in all manner of vehicles to get to the mansion, only to take an axe in the back one minute after getting in the door. Perhaps Kubrick's point was to make it as sudden and primal as possible, but it comes off as being a pretty lame way of getting the wife and kid access to a vehicle out of the place.All in all, a piece of tripe that stinks. If you are considering watching this film, don't. Get another one. If you want to be scared, watch anything with Adam Sandler in it and fear how crap the entire film industry has become in recent years. If you want to be bored, watch the Shining. If you want to rent a turkey, watch the Shining. If you want to see a shockingly bad movie, watch the Shining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself to be a discriminating viewer. I consider myself to be fairly urbane--but this movie got to me. Until the end of the film, I was thinking that no matter how many freaky faces Jack Nicholson makes and no matter how spooky the score tries to be, this movie is just another one of those flicks from that time period that tries really hard to be scary, but just isn't (such as The Exorcist, The Omen, etc.). Usually, movies that are so-called 'psychologically scary' take a truth about the world and follow it to a logical conclusion--thereby making it scary, but this movie has nothing to say. Most slasher films don't have anything to say either, but by the time this film settles into being a slasher flick, it has laid a foundation and spun a plot that makes it one of the scariest and definitely the creepiest movie I have ever seen. Since, it has obviously been a source of inspiration for film-makers such as Wes Craven and David Lynch.</fullReview>

If you prefer the book then fair enough, but as far as I'm concerned, Kubrick creates top end, visually stunning cinema in comparison to which King writes pulp fiction. I mean, just go back, forget the plot and check out those visuals one more time and you'll maybe see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries to have the best of both worlds, and ends up with the best of neither</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Torrance, a writer, applies for a job as winter caretaker at an isolated hotel. The hotel is set high in the mountains, a long way from the nearest town, and is normally cut off by snow during the winter. Jack, who wants the solitude in order to concentrate on his writing, accepts the position, even though he has been warned by the hotel manager that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, went mad and killed his family and himself. When we hear that we know exactly how the plot will pan out. Jack will go mad and start attacking his wife Wendy and their young son Danny. I love Stanley Kubrick, whom I regard as one of the greatest directors of all time. I love "Paths of Glory", "Spartacus", "Doctor Strangelove", "A Clockwork Orange" and "Eyes Wide Shut", all of which I regard as masterpieces, with "Lolita", "Barry Lyndon" and "Full Metal Jacket" not far behind. I don't love "The Shining", which I regard as one of Kubrick's rare failures. I realise that I am in the minority on that score, although I would probably have been in the majority when it was first released in 1980. Many critics at the time disliked it and although it was not nominated for a single Oscar or Golden Globe, it earned Kubrick his only "Worst Director" Razzie nomination. (Shelley Duvall was also nominated as "Worst Actress"). Since then critical thinking seems to have shifted and the film is regularly ranked among Kubrick's best, but watching it again recently, for the first time in a number of years, has not persuaded me to revise my generally unfavourable impression of it. Before I set out my criticisms of the film, let me first say what I liked about it. Jack Nicholson, who had earlier won an Oscar for portraying another mentally disturbed character in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", is excellent as the tormented Jack. (I was less taken with Duvall). There is some excellent photography of the mountain scenery, and Kubrick's shots of the eerie, deserted hotel are often highly atmospheric. Kubrick's previous film, "Barry Lyndon", had been criticised for being too long and slow-moving, and was a box-office failure in America. He therefore decided that his next film should be both a critical and a commercial success, and hit on the horror genre, possibly influenced by the fact that horror films like "The Exorcist" and "The Omen" were very much in vogue in the seventies. I have always felt, however, that his style of film-making was not well-suited to horror. It was in my view admirably suited to a historical epic like "Barry Lyndon", but horror has generally been a genre which requires something tauter, leaner and faster-moving than Kubrick was used to. "The Shining", at least in the cut released in America, ended up nearly two and a half hours long; the British and European version, with which I am more familiar, is 25 minutes shorter, but even that seems overlong and to move at a glacial pace. Although, as I said, Kubrick is often able to conjure up a disturbing atmosphere, that atmosphere is too often dissipated when nothing happens. One of the film's critics in 1980 was Stephen King, the author of the novel on which it is based. I have never read the book, so am unable to enter into the controversy about whether or not the film is faithful to it, but some of King's other criticisms seem justified. King disliked what he saw as the ambiguity of the film. He stated in an interview that his story was definitely a tale of the supernatural, of the "sheer inhuman evil" haunting the hotel. He felt that Kubrick, whom he described as a "visceral skeptic" and "a man who thinks too much and feels too little", was unable to grasp this and therefore sought to locate the evil within Jack's own personality. Now there would be nothing wrong with a film about a man who is driven to madness by loneliness and isolation and who, in his insanity, believes that he is seeing ghosts. That interpretation, however, does not really work here because there are other elements in the story which do indeed point to a supernatural explanation. It is not just Jack who sees the ghosts; Danny can see them as well. The hotel appears to be haunted by not just the ghosts of the Grady family, who died in 1970, but by spectres from an earlier period, the 1920s. It is said to have been built on an Indian burial ground. (Has there ever been an American ghost story which does not involve Indian burial grounds?) Indeed, the film's very title has a supernatural meaning. Danny discovers that he possesses psychic abilities, something he shares with the hotel's elderly chef Mr Halloran; "shining" is Halloran's term for these powers. I felt that "The Shining" could have worked as a straightforward ghost story, with Jack's violent behaviour explained in terms of possession by paranormal forces. (I am generally as sceptical as Kubrick about such matters, but am prepared to leave my scepticism at the cinema door). It could have worked as a straightforward psychological thriller, with the ghosts and apparitions which seem to haunt the hotel explained in terms of the delusions of a deranged mind. Kubrick, however, tries to keep hold of both possibilities, with the result that the film ends up muddled and confusing, with no satisfactory explanation ever being given. Ambiguity can sometimes be an artistic strength, but here it is more of a weakness. "The Shining" tries to have the best of both worlds, and ends up with the best of neither. 5/10</fullReview>

But then he is enchanted, he slowly turns mad to the point that he is consumed by a state of crime. Instead, in the movie, Nicholson goes nuts from the beginning, hardly plays his true character, Duvall shouts, and then the ridiculous chase between him and his wife and their son, and the final trail inside this ice maze, was the ultimate embarrassment. You have a great cast, and the only intention is to sabotage a great story just for what ? Ego and pride ? As usual, Kubrick demonstrates again his intentions of betraying great novels to turn them into silly soap movies. I'll give it a two because Nicholson tries hard, but the script is so bad that it is basically the same ambiance that reigns from the start to finish. It is really maudlin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who haven't seen The Shining, there is a chance you may have missed the boat. What I mean is, this is a movie that you will have needed to watch in the decade it was released. There is a good chance it won't be appreciated by the CGI hungry viewers of today's movies.This is arguably the most over analysed film in history. The basic synopsis is this. Jack Torrence, played by the legendary Jack Nicholson, is a school teacher who is aspiring to be a writer. He decides to take his family to an isolated hotel (The Overlook) for the winter, where he himself will be the caretaker. He learns briefly about the hotels rather gruesome past in his interview with the hotel manager, Mr Ullman. Undeterred, he takes the job regardless.His son, Danny (Danny Lloyd) has the ability to see the future, aided by his imaginary friend, Tony. Tony warns Danny beforehand to stay away from the hotel. He has an uncanny way of trying to scare Danny from potentially dangerous situations by showing him horrifying visions of what lies ahead. Taking a rather less graphic approach, the head chef, Mr Halloran, explains to Danny that the hotel does have a past, however there is nothing here that can hurt him in any way. Halloran knows instantly that Danny is in a precarious situation in this hotel, due to his psychic power (The Shining). When Danny provokes Halloran to come clean about one of the guest rooms, room 237, Halloran is clearly rattled and rather forcefully tells Danny "there ain't nothing in room 237. But you ain't got no business going in there anyway. So STAY OUT, you understand STAY OUT". As the viewer, this is a very gripping scene as we can now see that Halloran was sugar coating the issue of the hotels danger to Danny. There are things here that can hurt him and his family.My only gripe with The Shining is the pace of the movie. Jack becomes absorbed by the hotel far too quickly. Actually to the point of total madness. His wife, Wendy, played by Shelly Duvall, can sense all is not rosy with her husband. But it could just be the isolation, couldn't it? No way. The forces are getting stronger. The power of Danny's Shining ability is enough to stir up whatever entities or apparitions are lurking in the hotel. You will love the scenes where Danny is riding his tricycle around the hotel, turning every corner, not knowing what may be lurking around. He runs into the ghosts of 2 murdered little girls, he cannot help but take a trip up to the 2nd floor, having the nerve and audacity to try and get inside 237. But oh damn it the door is locked. Don't worry he will return.The sense of isolation is intensifying as the movie gathers pace. Jack is losing his marbles. Danny is foraging around, just aching to find something in the hotel which he will regret, and Wendy just seems to be oblivious to the whole situation.Danny decides to return to the 2nd floor. But instead of trying to open the door, he chances his luck by playing with his cars just slightly down the corridor from the room itself. A tennis ball suddenly rolls towards Danny, who looks up only to see nobody there. So what's the best thing to do in this situation? Run? Probably. Call for your mum and walk towards the door of 237? Definitely not. But what does he do? Walks towards the door of 237 to find it slightly ajar. Then of course he walks inside. Big mistake. Why was it a big mistake? Well I will leave this to those who haven't yet seen it to find out.Jack is now becoming a complete nut job. Wendy is the terrified wife. Danny sends a signal to Halloran to come and help. The poor sod goes through a lot of effort to get to The Overlook, to then be bumped off quite quickly by a crazy, axe wielding madman that only Jack Nicholson could have pulled off.This review is fairly brief but I just wanted to point out the main theme. There are lots of theories regarding this movie. Were the ghosts real? Did Danny even enter that room? You will hear a lot of nonsense regarding moon landings and ancient Indian culture blah blah blah. I guess the thing to do is watch the movie and then decide for yourself.A Kubrick masterpiece. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ranks among the best horror films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is Stanley Kubrick's epic attempt at surreal horror and his achievement stands as not only a magnificent film but as one of the best films ever made. Starring Jack Nicholson, in what seems to be his most notable role, and Shelley DuVall, this film is the definition of creepy. The use of the tracking shots, the use of Kubrick's trademarks, everything about this film is damn near perfect. Telling the tale of Jack Torrence, an angst ridden author in need of some serious down time takes a job watching over a Colorado hotel for its off season. As the season progresses, Jack's cabin fever becomes the center point of his descent into madness. The reason this film is as scary as it is, is Kubrick's style. Without it, this would be your average run-of-the- mill haunted house story. Kubrick's intense dedication to his process along with the caliber of acting that he managed to bring to the screen time and time again, it makes for a truly unnerving and deeply disturbing look at what the fall of man looks like, mentally and physically. To read a review or anything else on this film isn't doing it justice. Like most of Kubrick's films, The Shining is a film one must experience for themselves. It is THAT good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of Jack's best films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance in this fine 80s horror gave a whole new meaning to the terms 'cabin fever' and 'haunted house horror' as he plays a family man who is influenced into a state of murderous insanity. Nicholson agreed to be force-fed cheese sandwiches during the production process- his most hated food- in order to create his revulsion for the shooting of the picture. Jack's delivery of certain lines went on to generate possibly one of the most quotable utterances in film-making history: "Heeeeeere's Johnny!" Although in the modern day this film is seen to be an "80s horror that's not particularly scary" in comparison to all the other horror movies that have come out since then, it is still a truly terrifying piece of filming when you look into the psychology of the story and empathise with Torrance's wife and son.</fullReview>

The director of this film,Stanley Kubrick, intended for Danny to be telepathic. This ability is also referred to in the film as, "The Shining" and is shared with the seasonal chef Dick Hallorann. As the time passes Jack slowly becomes insane, and the imaginary little boy in Danny's mouth named Tony starts to show him horrible images of what happened to the caretakers' family before them. The turning point of Jack's insanity is when he threatens to bash Wendy's head in. During this same scene, Danny came into the room with bruises on his neck claiming that someone tried to strangle him. As soon as Wendy realized that her son may have something wrong with him, she sought out help. Unfortunately, the phone lines were down and there were twenty feet of snow on the roads restricting her search to find help. Jack regresses very rapidly after this point. Wendy notices this when she goes to check on Jack and she finds a stack of hundreds of papers all saying the same sentence, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." Soon after the horrified Wendy realizes that her husband is insane, he comes up from behind and threatens to bash in her head. In return she hits him in the head with a baseball bat and locks him away in the kitchen pantry. The screen view changes to show Dick feeling suspicious. He buys the next plane ticket out and gets a snow cat to make his way up the snowy mountain. Somehow Jack manages to unlock himself from the kitchen pantry while Tony is busy taking over Danny's body and writing "REDRUM" on the bathroom door while Wendy is asleep. Wendy wakes up just in time to find Jack breaking down the bedroom door with an ax. She locks herself and Danny in the bathroom and then shoves him out the window. Just before Danny reaches the ground, the cook arrives and goes in the hotel in search for the family. Jack hears him, so he leaves Wendy and Danny alone and goes downstairs to kill the cook. After he manages to do this, Jack chases Danny into the maze in search to find and kill him. He gives up and freezes to death while Wendy sees ghostly figures in the hotel. The film ends with Wendy embracing Danny in her arms. They end up driving away in the snow cat to get help. The last scene is of a framed picture with Jack in the front and center in a ballroom titled, "Overlook Hotel, July 4th Ball, 1921".Review: Solitary Confinement With less than five months alone in a deserted hotel, Jack Torrance begins to go insane in the captivating 1980's film The Shining directed by Stanley Kubrick. Insanity can come about in various ways; it can arise from family origins, or it can be brought on by extended periods in solitary environments. Anyone and everyone can go insane, the right environments are just required. It's still possible to go insane in healthy environments but then the insanity isn't due to isolation, it's due to genetics. Although there are a couple reasons why a person may become insane, the sole reason why Jack Torrance goes insane in the film "The Shining" is because of isolation. The fact that Jack could have been genetically insane is not realistic in this case. Insanity derived from genetics is not rational because the film shows no signs of insanity before he was isolated. Yes, the fact that he got dunk and dislocated his son's arm is horrible, but at least there is a reason for his violent behavior. He also had the clarity to realize this was a horrible thing to the point where he gave up drinking and sought out for another job that would be more fitting. Nothing indicates that he was going to freak out and try to murder his family until he became isolated.It has been said that "just about any ordinary person can slip into madness, believes APA President Philip G. Zimbardo, PhD. In fact, all it may take to trigger the process is a special kind of blow." (Jennifer Daw). In the movie The Shining directed by Stanley Kubrick, it is strongly inferred that Jacks special kind of blow was the sudden change to isolation. The immense amount of free time with an almost infinite amount of work to get done lead to Jacks downfall. He had so much time to get everything done, but the work had to be perfect. Imagine how sitting in an office all day long thinking about plays would be painfully hard. But what broke him down mentally was the fact that he couldn't take a break to have fun or talk to friends, he was just trapped with his wife and son for months on end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you truly loose your mind....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some great reviews here so no need for redundancy. Simply put, this is one of the greatest horror films of all time in every way imaginable, the music scores, cinematography, lighting, cast, character development, location, plot, special effects and even the trailer is scary as hell.Hollywood hasn't had an original thought in decades. All you see in today's films are incredibly attractive people who lack any substance or the ability to act making them hard to sympathize with. A really good movie will put you in the characters shoes. This movie is over 34 years old and still scares the hell out of me. I have watched at least 30 times and can sit through it riveted from start to finish as if I've never seen it before. I don't like to watch it alone. *****this part may contain spoilers*****The truly scary thing about this movie is the cabin fever effect of it all knowing how people can turn in on each other in a crisis situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What else can be said about the Shining? I see it as part of Kubrick's work as a whole and his critique of mankind. As with all his films so much is going on in every shot. You are looking at a family maintaining an empty hotel for the winter, but look carefully and beneath it you will find the violence of man, elitism, colonialism, racism, misogyny, and the darkness at the heart of western civilisation ? some common Kubrickian themes.The Overlook hotel is a microcosm of western white imperialism and power. 'All the best people' have been there. The rich and powerful, namely. The place was built on an Indian burial ground, some of whom had to fought off during construction. These were not described as all the best people. You can hear native American Indian ghostly voices in the opening sequence. The blood in the elevator is the blood of all peoples who have died at the hands of others. This is surely a metaphor for the usurpation of land in America in the name of civilisation, as Bill Blakemore suggested.In Jack , we have a man who is an aspiring writer. He has written little, and has to do odd jobs to get by. He clearly feels he is worth more than shovelling out driveways. He feels he belongs in the Gold Ballroom with the jet-setters, movie stars, and royalty. He sells his soul to the devil-barman for a drink and becomes one of them; becomes the new caretaker, and all horrors that it implies. To join the club requires a willingness to do violence.His wife and kid are well beneath his true status (the old sperm bank upstairs). He has hurt his kid before, and quit drinking as a result. He is completely bored of them during the initial drive up to the hotel, and it just gets worse.By the end we see Jack reduced to a grunting beast, limping through the labyrinth like the Minotaur, the ancient mythological symbol for the beast within man. And that is what Jack represents: the willingness to do evil acts, to make war, to hate, to feel contempt, to kill ? and that this same compulsion has shaped human history on a grander scale.None of this is rammed down your throat. You are not meant to be spoon fed, you are meant to engage and participate in watching the film. To think about it. Kubrick is enticing you to enter the labyrinth on your own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Heeeere's Johnny!" and "All Work and No Play, makes Jack a Dull boy". Just so wonderful and insanely masterful in placing such scenes and depicting them on screen.Stanley Kubrick, the master story teller has indeed made one of the most spine chilling and scariest movies ever. Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance did an awesome job. This is a film that not only scares you but also gives nightmares. Dare to watch it non stop without fast forwarding or pausing and you may feel something like you have never felt or rarely felt before. It is written superbly by Stephen King but I will say this is more a Kubrick masterpiece as he visualised the whole and brought the writing alive. A wow to the master Kubrick. It works on many levels be it psychological or technical, there are steadicam scenes, some insane scenes, some symbolism. Like REDRUM is reversed as MURDER and many many more. Jack becomes from being completely normal to tally mad. There is a history to the whole setup and it's all so very intriguing.The whole cast has to be awarded for doing what they did and specially that boy Danny Lloyd. While Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall did perfectly. Over and above everything was location and art direction here. Be it the creation of a vast maze or that creepy hotel and that detailing of every room and nook and corner of it. The trail to the hotel, wow everything was so masterfully done. Cinematography is something that we can learn, those strolling scenes of kid on cycle through the hall, or those maze scenes, or the car travelling through high road. Each one is shot so exquisitely, I fell in love with most of them.Watch it for Kubrick's brilliance, it's the perfect suspense film. A 5/5 for this. Just can't say more. Go and understand what Shining is, they know everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True fear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of humanity's greatest fears is instability. If we have nothing to hang on to or support us, we are unsure of our fate and become afraid. Stanley Kubrick's The Shining realizes this and plays it to the utter maximum, and as a result it becomes one of the scariest films of all time. The Shining is so unsettling, so unstable, so uncomfortable, and so terrifying. Kubrick's direction gave his films an otherworldly feel that would make the audience feel however he wanted them to. In The Shining he uses his unbelievable talent to terrify the audience. He directs and films the movie with such terrifying atmosphere. He always used long, wide shots in his film that would make the audience uneasy, and then add a terrifying score to the film to add to the terror. The score of the Shining hits every wrong note in a good way. It's frequently eerie, quiet, and terrifying. Sometimes it sounds like someone's laughing at you, at other times it sounds like it's wailing with agony. The direction is primarily what makes the film, and the cinematography and score are huge factors in the success of the movie as well. Everything in this story is unstable. We have a recovering alcoholic called Jack who's not all there, played by Jack Nicholson. Jack as a person looks creepy, with his wonderfully creepy eyebrows and facial build. And whenever he speaks, there's always slowness or a pause before he responds to someone speaking to him. We have Jack's young son, Danny, who's not all there. He has conversations with an imaginary (or is he imaginary?) friend called Tony. Is Danny insane? Does Tony really exist? We don't know. And then we have them backed up by the tragically underrated performance of Shelley Duvall as Jack's wife and Danny's mother Wendy. Duvall's performance is so good at making you believe that she is a terribly stressed and scared housewife, and Kubrick's harsh treatment of her while filming greatly helped this (the Razzie Award she won sickens me). And the overall story and setting are terrifying. We don't know what's going on. We don't know if Jack, Wendy, and Danny are insane. We don't know if the ghosts they see in the hotel they're staying in are real. We don't know if it's even both. While the hotel seems like a pleasant place at first, the decent into madness and the atmosphere makes one fear every corner. Instability- our greatest fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Shining years ago and thought it was a great horror film. Visually stunning and full of unpleasant moments, and not just some popcorn and cola slasher flick. There is nothing to complain about if you have not read the book. The acting is great and the score is haunting. If you want creepy memories, you should rent this film. The small things in the film is what made me want to pick up the book; and the small things are what makes the film so good too. But if you have read the book, I think you will be disappointed, as a lot differs from the original story. I can see why King did not like this film. But King himself said. "Films and books are two different things." I think this film, like the novel, is timeless and definitely one to watch with the lights off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, first of all, The shining is one of the most atmospheric films ever to go to print. The haunted hotel, the creepy twins, the seemingly demon possessed boy who scribbles "redrum" in lipstick, the downward spiraling father who writes a full novel with one simple line, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." This movie gives you a deep since of cold isolation. Of being all alone with no one to help you. The scene where Jack chops through the bathroom door and peers through saying "Here's Johnny!" resonates with me still today. The climax has Jack chasing his family through a frozen maze with an ax in hand. As the mother and son gets whisked away to safety, the final scene of Jack frozen to death in the snow just leaves you feeling like you need a shower. This movie gets 10 stars from me. If you enjoy movies that will potentially give you nightmares, then surely check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is a 1980 English-American psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick, co-written with novelist Diane Johnson, and starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers. The film is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel of the same name, though there are significant changes.[4]In the film, Jack Torrance, a writer and recovering alcoholic, takes a job as an off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel called the Overlook Hotel. His young son possesses psychic abilities and is able to see things from the past and future, such as the ghosts who inhabit the hotel. Soon after settling in, the family is trapped in the hotel by a snowstorm, and Jack gradually becomes influenced by a supernatural presence; he descends into madness and attempts to murder his wife and son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Director's New Clothes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is probably my favorite film maker. Dr. Strangelove and 2001 are on my top 10 list. Clockwork Orange blew my mind when it first came out. I think Barry Lyndon is a visual masterpiece. But The Shining has always struck me as "the director's new clothes"? a film that forces me to question whether Kubrick was really a charlatan.I remember being at a bookstore back in the late 70's and seeing a paperback book called The Shining with the tag line "soon to be a Stanley Kubrick motion picture." I immediately grabbed it and devoured it in a day or two. I had never heard of the author and I had never experienced such intense horror while reading it. I absolutely could not wait for the film to come out.I imagine that Kubrick must have had a similar reaction to the book which is why he bought the rights. The advertising for the film promised a horror roller-coaster: the blood pouring from the elevator, the creepy girls, Jack Nicolson with the ax, the boy and mother running through the maze in the snow. But when I sat there at the first showing the movie just never took off.Was it me? Had I been expecting the book? Shouldn't I have known better than to expect a faithful adaptation from an iconoclast like Kubrick? But the screenplay seemed amateurish and way over thought. The whole production struck me as an attempt to create big effects with music and sound to cover up a complete lack of substance.What went wrong? I think that Kubrick picked the wrong book in his attempt to recreate movie horror in the same way that he redefined science fiction with 2001. I'm guessing that he was bowled over by the book and committed to it before really thinking through whether it was the right material for his style. Once he started working on it and trying to break it down to its essentials (throwing out half of the book in the process), he found that the "bones" of the piece just didn't work.So, in essence, Kubrick became the character Jack at the typewriter, struggling to create something but going mad in the process. To me, Kubrick's Shining is the cinematic equivalent of "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying and well acted horror film, being another brilliant achievement in Kubrick's career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been meaning to revisit The Shining for the last couple of months and I'm glad I finally did it. Stanley Kubrick succeeded in creating a brilliant psychological horror film with memorable characters and a lot of surreal and fantastical elements. You really need to watch it at least twice in order to understand all the subtle and disturbing allusions. Also, there are many breathtaking landscapes and I am always amazed by Kubrick's exquisite camera work. The first shot showing the river mirroring the mountains and trees or the one where we follow Danny playing in the hotel corridors, not knowing what he will find next are a few examples of the master in action.Now let's talk about the acting. Jack Nicholson delivers a terrific performance as Jack Torrance, making you really believe how insane and tormented his character gradually becomes throughout the film. Shelley Duvall is excellent as Wendy, this very innocent and quirky wife, who will do anything to protect her child. Finally, Danny Lloyd portrays Jack and Wendy's son who has a very peculiar ability and he provides a convincing and solid performance as well.The Shining is chilling, unforgettable and manages to shock you until the end, with a striking final shot. It's certainly one of the finest horror films ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining, 1980, Stanley Kubrick, USA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is one of the most chilling and memorable horror movies of all time. The film follows a writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) and his family who are offered a job as winter caretakers for the Overlook Hotel. Despite the dark rumours about the hotel Jack accepts as he believes the quiet will help him overcome his writer's block. Little does he know that the hotel will bring out a lot more than the artistic side of him. Kubrick gives us the eerie, elegant and wonderfully lit spaces of the Overlook Hotel. You sense this isolated and mysterious place the Torrances now call a home isn't quite right, the place is filled with memories of it's violent past and the true horror and suffering that has taken place here is soon revealed. Kubrick tries to simultaneously unfold two stories, one being the hidden secrets the Outlook Hotel possesses and another being a family drama. It has to be said, some of the supernatural sides to the film are badly explained remainders from Stephen King's novel and they are irrelevant to the main story plot at some points. Like the mirror that reflects some things but not others and the ghosts that haunt Danny then just stopNicholson's performance as the abusive father is thrilling and has a kind of black comedy side to it, and the final shot of his face in daylight is brilliance.Jack is a vibrant character, fueled with anger and madly alive in every scene. I regard this film a huge success for Stanley Kubrick, it was not terrifying in the conventional way a horror film is supposed to be. So because it doesn't fit the usual horror genre, some viewers don't like it. But this is the very reason I do like it because it's abstract, clever and at some points even funny and with all of that it still effectively scares the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS is horror, and it's from Stanley Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is a cult Horror film, made by Stanley Kubrick and Warner Bros in 1980. It is based on Stephen King's novel with the same name as the movie. The film's real running time is almost 2 1/2 hours, unless you are thinking about the 25 minute shortened European version. More about it later in this review.Plot: Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson) drives to an isolated hotel called Overview Hotel, together with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd). There he is supposed to work with some writing project. Meanwhile Danny is "seeing" disturbing stuff like blood flooding from the elevator and two scary little girls who wants him to play with them, while talking to his imaginary friend Toby. While time passes, Jack becomes more and more psycho while surrounded by the ghosts of the former hotel guests...I can't tell you anymore of the plot, mainly to avoid spoilers. But this film is really a great masterpiece, if not one of the BETTER Hollywood Horror movie i have seen in a while. Stanley Kubrick and Warner Bros, who also made the highly controversial "A Clockwork Orange", made a good effort with this film. Referring to the longer American cut I saw in a week earlier, Mr. Kubrick also managed to make a somewhat good character development, which many of these scenes have been reported as missing from the two hours long European cut. The music is the thing which made the many of the intense scenes creepy. I sat through this film as if my eyes were glued into the screen.My favorite scenes must be the surreal "elevator blood sequence", and the climatic sequence beginning with the iconic "axe-through-the-door" scene.Different versions: The ending of this film was originally around two minutes longer when released theatrically for the first time, but Stanley Kubrick and Warner Bros decided this ending to be cut, making this film to run for 144 minutes, not 146. For the European release, Kubrick cut off further around 25 minutes of stuff mostly involving character development and scenes taking place far away from the film's iconic hotel. As good as 99% of the intense scenes are intact in this version. If you don't mind the cuts, the European version is also a good choice.This film is rated 18 in Norway. It's Norwegian title is "Ondskapens Hotell", which would have been literally translated into English as "The Hotel of Evil".Conclusion: Unless you can't stand scary movies, I will highly recommend you to watch this film at least once. Some other great masterpieces from Stanley Kubrick include "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) and "A Clockwork Orange" (1971).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most directors like to tie themselves down to one, maybe two genres when they make movies, some experiment with untypical stuff from time to time. But then there's Stanley Kubrick: a man that explored completely different topics with each of his films, yet never without leaving his thumbprint on the work. And while I don't adore every single one of his movies as much as some others, I can't find a single bad movie he made in his entire career. He may have been unfaithful to the source material he was given (Anthony Burgess and Stephen King both publicly vented their displeasure with his adaptions of A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, respectively), but he always created a uniquely interesting movie. The Shining is my personal favorite.His 9th full-length movie and his only foray into horror confronts the audience with a seemingly normal American family in the 70's. The father, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson arguably doing the best turn in his career), is an unsuccessful writer that gladly accepts a job as a caretaker for an isolated hotel in the Rocky Mountains since he expects a lot of leisure time to focus on his new writing project. His wife, played by Shelley Duvall and his approximately 10-year-old son accompany him. The two will be the only people he sees during the freezing winter months. Kubrick doesn't waste too much time with exposition; the movie starts to get quite frightening after a couple of minutes in. Actually, the opening scene already gives you goosebumps because of the ultra-chilling theme that would probably make a cat feeding its kittens seem frightening. We already get a glimpse of the prodigious set design and the huge symbolism after that, even though the real horror is yet to come. The audience, together with Jack, learns some ghastly background stories about the hotel and Nicholson's crazy grinning gives us justified reason to expect that his character isn't the sanest fellow in this movie. It is also revealed that Danny, Jack's son, is suffering from 'Shining', an illness/ability that gives him various abnormal skills which his parents seem to overlook. Contrary to most horror movies, the audience can't predict what's going to happen in The Shining, a chilling masterpiece that doesn't make you jump out of your seat or disturb you by excessive amounts of gore, but totally works against the 'rules' of its genre. And still, Kubrick manages to scare the hell out of you and give you nightmares of two little twins standing in front of you or even naked women (if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about). The American auteur understands the concept of psychological horror and perfects it in this movie: seeing some things from the perspective of the young boy Danny was a masterful move and the rides through the hotel never fail to creep me out. Those scenes in the first half of the movie actually have always scared me more than the dramatic climax, an undoubtedly intense and well-made chasing sequence that, however, suffers from a simple, almost banal structure. It can be said that Kubrick created an extremely intense atmosphere in The Shining and that it's one of the most genre-defining horror movies of all time, yet there's another aspect of the film that should be treated with at least the same amount of attention. Its symbolism, greater than in any other Kubrick's movies, and so comprehensive that some fanatics made a feature-length documentary entirely focusing on the hidden meanings in it last year - fittingly named after the mysterious Room 237 in the original movie - is sheerly unbelievable. While some theories (Minotaurs; The Holocaust) really got carried away, I like to believe that many of the ideas, written on countless blogs in the Internet, were actually intended by this weird genius named Stanley Kubrick. The exceptionally long shooting process and the exasperation some cast members (especially Duvall and supporting star Scatman Crothers) developed are indicating that Kubrick was in fact aiming for absolute perfection with this movie. You don't even have to tinker with the movie on Internet blogs and studying each frame like the creators of Room 237 did isn't necessary either; you can be fascinated by The Shining just because of the strangeness that lies in every single scene. It's almost impossible to describe the brilliancy in some of them - Kubrick's use of colors, numbers, or the Steadicam are just perfect. Even the editing, a part of movies that most cinema-goers (including myself) tend to overlook, is fantastic.Most of the cast members in the movie did quite good in the movie with Danny Lloyd acting impressively realistic for such a young age, but main actor Jack Nicholson is incredible at portraying the growing insanity of his character. His grumpy psychopath has got to be one of the most iconic villains in film and the fact that he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for this role is clearly one of the biggest snubs in the history of the Academy. And, of course, the "Here's Johnny" part wouldn't have been nearly as good without Nicholson who gives a gripping intensity to this and every other scene he's in. It's a bit sad that his on-screen wife Duvall is so completely unable to keep up with his terrific performance, but still, nominating her for a Razzie Award was a big exaggeration.THE VERDICT: The Shining is an insane horror trip that is likely to haunt you and fascinate you on the same level. It's one of the most rewatchable movies and contains some of the best scenes in film history.</fullReview>

I can't recommend this movie enough. Ever scene is shot to perfection, one of Kubricks best movies. This movie was nominated for worst actress Shelly Duvall and worst director, critics didn't like and even Stephen King said he hated it because it didn't stay true to the novel, this movie aged great now Stephen and Roger Ebert considers it one of their favorites. I will admit Shelly was terrible in, but she didn't win and Stanley mistreated her to get her into the mood of a terrified housewife. If you think you won't like because critics didn't like it, I have one response to that, Critics didn't like Psycho. If you like horror movies you will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is fantastic. Its not so much scare the mess out of you as it is eerie and creepy. I remember watching this for the first time thinking wow, what in the world is this? Kubrick movies never disappoint. I was lucky enough to see some of the original props for this movie just a couple weeks ago at the LACMA.No one can debate that this movie is incredibly well done. You simply have to see it. Whether you are a film person or not, it should be required for people to see this.All in all, recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Horror Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By far, the best horror movie ever made (other than Hitchcock's "Psycho"). Its imaginative, chilling, groundbreaking, well acted, well directed, and an all around masterpiece. To be honest, this movie is the reason I love Stephen Kings books and movies, it set the stage. The main reason that I like the movie is that its a horror movie but its not like a generic slasher flick that depends on the gore and violence, its not like that. Its an extremely imaginative movie that is based off of psychological horror, there's a lot of psychedelia in this movie, I'm not going to lie to you. It will put your mind to the test, it makes you think, how many movies can do that in such a beautiful way. I recommend this to all movie goers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Modern Horror Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" (1980) is one of the films that you need to see in order to call yourself a horror fan. From the opening shot of Jack's car and the unnerving soundtrack, you know you are in for a creepy journey. The film is over 2 hours long, something very rarely heard of in mainstream horror, but the film never bores its viewer, even with the slightly slow pace. Those accustomed to the in-your-face jump scares of the recent horror films may find this movie dull and slow, yet Kubrick is masterfully building tension that pays off in a brilliant finale (the last 30 minutes of the film being incredibly creepy). With the release of "Room 237" (2012) recently, you've no doubt been hearing much of the subliminal imagery and symbolism embedded in Kubrick's film. This symbolism, whether you believe it was Kubrick's intention or not, adds another layer to the film, making it much more re-watchable than other entries in the genre. There are many infamous scares featured in this film (one of the most famous being the twin girls in the hallway early on in the film), but the entire film packs nonstop scares, thrills, and tension that become more and more unnerving the more times the film is viewed. In conclusion, "The Shining" is a rare gem in the genre, a truly horrifying film that will stick itself into your head and never let go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Good! (My First Review!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, with. This is my first review, and I am no genius as far as reviews go. However, I decided my first should be for my (probable) favourite. (I know I haven't given this 10/10, but that is only because there is one film I like more than this).Now I have watched this film around 50 times, but it can still keep me enthralled. There are not many films which can manage to do it, but this one succeeds. I think, apart from the great performances from the leads, albeit a somewhat 'over the top performance' from Nicholson, the acting is first rate. So let's move on from there.The one thing which really makes this film stand out in its genre is the cinematography. It is beautifully filmed. The soundtrack fits perfectly. and on a visual level it is near on impeccable. It has to be said that I am a horror film fan, so, my view could be classed as maybe biased. But look at it the other way. I have seen a heck of a lot of horror films and this one takes some beating! All in all, a great film. Try and grasp the storyline, rather than expecting a gorefest. You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's films are consistent in creating indelible images; from the sexualised bare foot, being caressed in the title sequence of Lolita (1962); the ominous sight of the black obelisk in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968); or the mechanical device holding Alex's "glazies" open in A Clockwork Orange (1974), his utter devotion to the image, its composition, complexity, and depth of meaning, leave his films plastered on your memory (Kubrick began his career as a still photographer for Look Magazine in New York). 1980's The Shining left the spectator with some of the most iconic and memorably haunting images in horror cinema (and in general cinema); the Grady girls, serene but disturbing, standing in the hallways of the Overlook Hotel; the blood gushing from the opening in the lifts doors; or Jack's face starring penetratingly through the axe-damaged door announcing, "Here's Johnny!" amongst other memorable imagery. Kubrick's meticulous approach to cinema, in all of it's forms, not only gave the world beautifully constructed images, but he also explored his subjects with such masterful detail.Kubrick has a capacity to take a genre and strip it of it's overt conventions. Kubrick took a conventional ghost story, with all the visual trappings of the genre, and created a psychologically complex and enigmatic cinematic experience. The film hides its secrets. What we do know within the film's space is that Danny (Danny Lloyd) - the young son of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), who has taken a job at the Overlook hotel - has some extra sensory power, referred to by Scatman Crothers' Dick Hallorann as 'The Shining' (which is more explicitly explored in the longer US version)Kubrick expressed an interested in the subject of ESP and the paranormal, specifically in psychic ability, in an interview with Michel Ciment, and it is this aspect of the story that creates the films many ambiguities. Is it specifically a "haunted" house, or are the psychic abilities of Danny (and possibly Jack?) creating psychic chaos, the rupturing of historic trauma? At the start of the film Jack is interviewed by the manager of the hotel (Stuart Ullman), and he is informed of an horrific event that occurred some years ago. The Grady family were hacked to death by the father/husband Delbert (Philip Stone), who had previously occupied the halls of the hotel, in the same employment position. Jack informs that his wife (Shelley Duvall) would be delighted with this history, being a "confirmed horror addict". Perhaps an apparition of Grady appears to Jack (he only sees "ghosts" when he is facing mirrors), to inform him of his families dysfunction. Is this a ghostly manifestation of the former janitor? A psychic memory brought on by Jack's own extra sensory ability? Or has isolation (or even cabin fever) gripped the increasingly anguished, and frustrated writer?The Shining has that Kubrickian sense of ambiguity and imagistic beauty. Along with the beautifully composed shots, the camera itself becomes a haunting, and hypnotic character in the film. The Shining was one of the first films to utilise the recently invented Steadycam (Kubrick of course, went for the source and employed the inventor, Garrett Brown, to operate the camera), which gave the almost constantly moving camera, gliding through the labyrinthine corridors of the hotel. Another indelible image came from this (a now commonplace technique), the camera at a low level, following Danny on his tricycle, moving over wood and carpet, creating an in-camera sound that serendipitously produces impending horror, it's rhythmic pattern evoking fear - we are waiting for those Grady girls around every corner Danny takes.I was surprised to discover only around a month ago, that the version that I grew up with, and was released in Europe, was shorter than the US release. In fact a whole 30 minutes was absent. So I did watch the US version (as well as the "UK" edit), but found it to simply include some rather long scenes, largely dealing with unnecessary exposition involving Danny's relationship with "the boy who lives in my mouth" as he refers to his abilities, and with Jack's recent move to cold turkey after a drunken incident which resulted in violence towards his son. All of this exposition is not at all needed, as they are revealed more implicitly in later scenes. It was after the release in North America that Kubrick was aware that the film was not successful. Therefore, Kubrick re-edited the film, and released it to other territories in the shorter version. This was Kubrick's preferred version, and I have to agree with him.The Shining is for me, one of the top five horror films of all time. It's mysteries, ambiguities and atmosphere culminates in a film that is genuinely terrifying. The experience of fright, horror, and fear is exacerbated on repeat viewings. This was the first time in many years that I watched it, and I was scared more than ever before. It's a richness of cinema that makes Kubrick the absolute master of every subject, any genre, and possibly everything that he touched. The very nature of the hypnotic stylistics of this film would leave me to associate it's mesmeric pace, and the camera's ability to hold its subject for long moments, with David Lynch's debut feature film Eraserhead (1977), which was an even more surreal inclusion to the horror genre. I have read that Kubrick saw the film, and was impressed, and The Shining was his next film. I believe Eraserhead could have been an influence - but this is speculation of course. With or without any conjecture of influence, The Shining is an incredibly rich cinematic experience, and has been furnished with many varying and interesting theories. The films ambiguities will be the subject of debate long after we all have disappeared, and that enduring quality means, for me at least, that Kubrick was (and is) the greatest filmmaker to possibly ever work in the medium.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spectacular Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick is probably the best film maker ever in the English speaking world. In The Shining he once again shows his wonderful imagination, attention to detail, and obsessive nature that made him the master he was. This is a complex movie about horror, ghosts, deep psychological issues and the effects living in an empty very large Hotel in the middle of nowhere...may have on a fragile individual. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall ...with their 9 year old son Danny Lloyd move in as winter caretakers to the very remote Overlook Hotel. Jack plays a recovering alcoholic and he intends to use up a lot of the spare time he will have...writing a novel. The Hotel is built on an old Indian burial ground...and a few years earlier a caretaker had chopped up his wife and children...because they were...mis-behaving. Cracks soon begin to appear in Jacks personalty, and the appearance of ghosts don't help him. What he needs is a good stiff drink. The sets in this are in a grand scale..as you would expect from Kubrick..and the use of the Steadycam (new at that time) is a huge plus. Its a great movie, but you should not expect to get all the answers. There are loose ends. But thats perfectly O.K. in a movie like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every genre has its Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently there's no genre Kubrick cannot ace. Be it sci-fi, historical drama, political satire, war movie, film noir, erotic mystery thriller, or - as in this case - horror. "The Shining" undoubtedly has a very firm Kubrick stamp on it and made Stephen King's material entirely his own, a fact that King didn't particularly like and thus had it remade for TV years later. While the TV version has some merits and follows the book more closely, the way it is it will always be compared to a master film maker's take on the material King provided and therefore doesn't stand a chance. As what Kubrick's "The Shining" offers is Stephen King plus the necessary extra to make it legendary horror cinema."The Shining" shines most of all because of Jack Nicholson's tour de force performance. He plays the protagonist Jack Torrance chillingly real, making his inevitable descent into madness in the deserted haunted winter resort a frightening experience to observe. The traditional horror clichés are all there of course: stimulation of imagination, the ghostly apparitions lurking in the corners, the air of eeriness and anticipation that permeates the place, the constantly widening shadow of a deadly menace. What makes it different is the director who knows his craft, uses effective POVs in intimate scary moments, long shots to add to the felt isolation and dehumanization, convex lenses to enhance surreal qualities, so that the master's handwriting shows in every action. Undoubtedly creating a unique horror picture is difficult. But well, fortunately every genre has it's Kubrick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Combine director Stanley Kubrick with writer Stephen King and the acting talents of Jack Nicholson and Joe Turkel, and you have one of the all time classic horror films of the modern age. This thriller is subtle and nearly misleading as we open. Long shots of open highways winding through incredibly beautiful scenery, incredibly appointed rooms with lush beauty, and some small background moments to give you a little insight into the characters. But once the preliminaries are over, the film begins to step up the pace. Little Danny is having visions, as is Jack, and the characters are portrayed like all the characters in King's books...unremarkable until affected by the evil that is the Overlook. Nicholson is incredibly powerful as Torrance, a man with little moral background, a recovering alcoholic and child abuser who has already injured his son. Slowly but surely he is drawn into the Overlooks plans through the manipulations of Lloyd the Bartender, exceptionally portrayed by Joe Turkel. While Shelly Duvall's character is two dimensional and somewhat weak, she nonetheless manages to pick up the gauntlet of the challenge and we witness a transformation from the weak-willed, battered wife to a mother intent on saving her child. While the MPAA did not have the rating system in place at the time, this film would be an should be rated R for language, brief nudity, and scenes of horror and violence. Definitely collectible, they will be talking about this film for years to come as one of Nicholson and Kubrick's greatest achievements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of genius horror with 1,000,000 times more terror than a typical slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is such a breath of fresh air compared to the usual teen slasher crap where one by one gets taken out in obvious circumstances. Jack Nicholson was the ideal person for this role and watching him slip slowly but surely into total and utter madness was breathtakingly terrifying simply because of his acting, and the build up from little signs that something isn't right to a rampage with an axe !although i found her unbearably annoying through most of the film i do feel after watching the documentary footage "making the shining" by Vivian Kubrick that Shelley Duvall was treated unfairly by the director and that she deserved to be cut a bit of slack during filming.Watching a normal man driven totally insane by sheer isolation is terrifying simply because it could happen to just about anyone and is much more believable than most horror films and the fact that there was only one on-screen death was refreshing because in pretty much every horror movie it is just relentless slaughter from beginning to end. the. Everything I have mentioned is what makes this a true psychologically chilling and controlling movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horrors ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining truly is an incredible film and is one of my favorite Kubrick films (it is hard to pick just one). Having watched it several times, I can say with great confidence that it is my favorite horror film ever made.With a thousand other reviews on here, I am not going to talk much about the plot, but I will give a brief summary. Basically, Jack Torrance is a writer who takes a job to look over the Overlook Hotel (pun not intended) for the winter when it is closed. He brings his wife and son with him to live there. However, not all goes as plans and he essentially goes crazy.I love this film for reasons I could talk about all day, but I will try to keep it short. I think the film is quite different from most horror films I have ever seen. It is filled with foreshadowing, symbolism, black comedy, and has an actual exciting story, as opposed to most horror movies that are clichéd, predictable, and just meant to scare you. Now the first time I watched it, I found the movie to be a bit on the boring side, especially the first half. I think many people might also feel this way. But after a second viewing, I definitely changed my opinion. This is for sure one of those movies that can be viewed on various levels.I believe that above all, this film works because of the actors. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the lead role and could not have done a better job. His intensity and emotion is incomparable. Wendy Torrance, played by Shelley Duvall, received a lot of criticism for her acting, but I thought that she did a fine job. Jack Nicholson once said that the role of Wendy Torrance was "the hardest role anyone has ever had to play." Finally, Danny Lloyd, who played the son, pulled off an incredible performance.Above all, I would highly recommend this brilliant film to anyone and everyone. This movie is definitely a contributing factor to why I consider Stanley Kubrick to be one of the greatest directors of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good movie. Quite thrilling. A horrifying movie of the 80's. Although I didn't really get completely horrified. The story is kind of far away from reality, which made it not horrifying for me. Great acting by Jack Nicholson. His facial expressions scared the heck out of me. I was really convinced that he was insane. And also the kid, Danny Lloyd, really did creep me out. However, horrible acting from the lead actress, Shelley Duvall. It's so ridiculous. It's what kept me from really getting into the storyline and feel the movie. I mean, Jesus Christ. Whenever she would act like she was scared or shocked, I couldn't help but laugh at her face. If she hadn't been in this movie, I would've liked it a lot more. Overall, a nice movie. Horror/comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What always strikes me about this film is that there's next to no chiaroscuro - no shadows. Most of the shots are comprehensively well-lit, stark even. It's a very straightforward film, almost ritual. Nothing emerges from a gloomy screen. Everything is precipitated in the gloom of the audience's imagination, rung like a bell in empathy with the increasing psychological delirium of Jack Nicholson's Sam Torrance.Indeed, Nicholson is at the head of a small cast which admirably fulfil their roles. Naturally, one gets the impression that Kubrick had already mapped out almost exactly how each character would move in each frame; nonetheless Nicholson manages to maintain an integrity and charm.Charm might well be a key idea in The Shining. As in all horror movies one moves from the everyday to the demonic. The Shining manages to twist its screw with the lightest of touches, holding the audience with poise, humour and irony - the charm of the dance partner. The final sequence is a virtuosic, runaway escalation of what has come before. Hideous and dazzling. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's less than authentic take on a great novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so looking forward to this film when it came out. The Shining was the first Stephen King novel I ever read and I thought it was brilliant. Sadly, the same can't be said for the film version. Whilst it does retain some aspects of the plot, there are so many changes (many of them unnecessary and confusing) that it ceases to be the story King was trying to tell.There are some great set pieces - the bike riding down the hall, Jack Nicholson going bonkers, and of course the famous 'Heeeeere's Johnny!' scene, which is good but not actually terrifying, despite Shelley DuVall's very believable performance.I was impressed by the fact that most of it is filmed in the light, so that Kubrick doesn't rely on dark corners and jumps to frighten you, but overall the film doesn't work for me. It's overlong for a start, the stuff with the barman and the photo is pointless and doesn't make sense; and poor old Halloran. He hears Danny's shining and travels halfway across America to help, only to be immediately hit with an axe! Kubrick is just cheating the audience.So set pieces aside, this is really one for the Kubrick fans only in my opinion. Anyone looking for the authentic King story is going to be disappointed, and I defy anyone to tell me what the end to this film version actually means. I seem to remember that when interviewed even Kubrick wasn't quite sure.So it's The Shining, but it doesn't shine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True horror isn't a monster running around eating people, a ghost, or unexplainable phenomena. Sure, all these things can be made scary with enough skill, but what is truly scary is the idea of somebody that you are close to and love more than anybody else in the whole world turns and tries to hurt you and that they aren't the person that you thought they were. This film taps into that idea and uses these ideas as the backbone of what makes this film scary, and by golly it's scary. I actually feel that this is one of the scariest films ever made. No other movie has given me such a sick feeling of vulnerability and being unsafe. I can never forget some of the images in this film, no matter what horror films i watch. This is supposed based on a Stephen King novel, but it is too different to really compare. Just see it. It's the perfect Halloween film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Kubrick's finest, but still leagues above your average horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" for me is far from Stanley Kubrick's finest film, if only because it lacks the philosophical depth of "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "A Clockwork Orange". This could be a problem, because Kubrick is known as a cold and emotionally distant filmmaker and not always adapt at crafting likable characters. Still, its leagues above your average horror film and is a completely fascinating film. Kubrick's detached style only makes the events all the more blood chilling and terrifying. This is a film drenched in cold atmosphere - the viewer completely feels present in all the madness at the Overlook Hotel. Its not an emotionally powerful film like Kubrick's other works, but its still an involving film. In fact, this is a rare case where the film is better than the book (King's novel is one of his most mediocre).In addition to Kubrick's direction, and possibly even more so, there is one reason why this film sticks out in the public memory. That is Jack Nicholson's most crazy and over-the-top performance. Even though I don't appreciate the route Nicholson's career took as a result of this (hes been typecast since as the smart alec jerk), there's no denying how engrossing his turn is. Its simply put a masterpiece of dark comedy - Nicholson is playing a terrifying psycho who is often amusingly funny because of the sheer over-the-top nature of the role. The rest of the cast is only decent (including a rather bland Shelly Duvall), but this is Nicholson's show all the way. "The Shining" itself isn't a perfect film, but its still very well made and definitely worth watching. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Classic Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another of the great classic films and screenplays by Stanley Kubrick which he based on the novel by Stephen King. This film was considered one of the best horror films at the time it was made and also is really the film that launched Stephen King's writing and film career in earnest, he was even the stills photographer on the crew. This film also highlighted Jack Nicholsons career and he plays recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance who brings his wife Wendy (Shelley Duval) and son Danny ( Danny Lloyd) to the "Over Look" Summer Resort as a live in caretaker for the winter period when it is closed down. On arrival they are greeted the Head Chef Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) who immediately establishes that Danny is a spiritual psychic and that his grandmother called this ability the Shining. Left alone the family set out to endure the isolated winter at the hotel with Jack also able one to use his spare time to pursue his career as a writer. one-dimensional Eventually Jacks behaviour gradually becomes manic and severely crazed after various episodes and lapses into various demented states. These episodes are triggered by real and/or imagined encounters with staff and patrons from several decades in the past various tragic occurrences at the Hotel. Danny is also able to tap into evidence of the past tragedies with his "Shining" abilities. As Jack turns on his own family his countenance becomes what is now considered one of the classic crazed facial expressions of cinema history. From this point Wendy and Danny have to contend with Jack and fight for their lives. Kubrick's production values and graphic horror scenes add a unique ambiance to the film. Kubrick's unique cinematographer, directing and editing abilities combined with his meticulous hands on approach to film making make this film suspenseful and intriguing at every turn. It is one of the great horror classics of all time without the today's one dimensional gratuitous use of body mutilation</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrifically Brilliant!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King's name is added to the credits somewhere along the line but I truly believe this shows Kubrick's genius in changing the ending. Iv'e seen the King approved version of The Shining, and it sucks, big time. King is supposed to be the master of horror but have you actually read one of his books? I have and I think he's only given that title due to talented directors converting his stories. Kubrick took a decent novel, not too scary and transformed it into a visually terrifying piece of filmaking. Casting is 10/10, who else than Nicholson to portray the mad caretaker, the role was made for him. I reckon Kubrick read the book and pictured our Jack from the start. The ending played a big part in why this movie became legendary, if the hotel had blown up as it did in Kings book it would of neglected the cold atmospheric winter the characters were in a bit I think, instead Big Stan kept to the shivering cold theme that he started with and made the bloke freeze to death. Kubrick kept the story within the realms of reality, i.e. we never get to see Doc's imaginary friend, etc.. In the straight to video version (King approved) I'd say its rated as a PG-13, it just isn't scary. I advise you watch the crap the King approved version with Rebecca de Mornay and then watch the true Kubrick masterpiece to see the difference and understand what I mean about King not being that true horror genius as he is so usually tagged. The title should go to Kubrick, he has horror vision, horror story-telling and is basically effin brilliant!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin... This movie was 100% perfect. The actors, storyline, atmosphere, everything. Jack Nicholson gives what I believe is one of his best performances here as Jack Torrence, the estranged, alienated father of the Torrence family. Shelly Duvall gives another great performance here as Weny Torrence, Jack's stressed out wife and Danny's mother. I often wonder how her character was able to take so much mental abuse throughout the film but she somehow managed to. The scares in this movie were many and great. They made you not want to go to a fancy hotel for a while after watching this movie. This film felt like The Thing in parts, people trapped in a vast alienated place trapped in by snow and extreme weather, but at the same time was different because of the haunting. Some scenes were shocking, others very disturbing, all of them 100% eerie. This film is a classic and always will be. Horror fans should check this out if they have not already. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's worst film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King, if he had been dead, would have been spinning in his grave. Stanley Kubrick's version of "THE SHINING" lost me as a fan when it departed so radically from the novel. I do not wonder that King had another version of the story filmed later. While Kubrick is a great director has done wonderful films, this one missed its chance. I am not saying that it is not a scary movie, it is that. But the casting of the film was all wrong, except for Scatman Crothers as Halloran. It is his murder, among the other changes from the book that disappointed many King fans. I also felt cheated when they substituted the maze for the scenes in the Topiary Garden and the playground, which to me were some of the most terrifying in the book. In it's defense I will say that the scenery and sets for the movie were first rate. I would like to have heard Wendy Carlos' complete score for the soundtrack. Still it is watchable, but just not the film it should have been</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A totally silly film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is laughable. It's great if you believe that people can see ghosts, the future and the past, but if you have any kind of grip on reality, then forget it. It's not horrifying at all, but funny. It's hilarious. It's so silly and absurd that it makes a great comedy film. Genuine psychological horror has to be based firmly on reality, not on an invented supernatural world of spooks and telepathy, as this film is. The plot is so ridiculous that the viewer ends up with no sympathy for any of the characters. I could not have cared less if they all got chopped up, as from the first moment a ghost appears, the viewer knows that he is in a completely make-believe world. It is not possible to suspend one's disbelief for a film as obviously unreal as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining is one of Kubrick's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is one of only a handful of Stephen King adaptations that is as successful as a film as as a book (others include, in my opinion, Carrie, Misery, the Shawshank Redemption, the Green Mile, Stand by Me, and Dolores Claiborne.) It is, however, vastly different from the book (Stephen King was highly disatisfied with it), and belongs more to Kubrick's genius than King's. Numerous story changes are made, and there are numerous additions. But the end result of both is the same: a terrifying masterpiece. Jack Nicholson gives his greatest villain performance (not including the Joker) as Jack Torrance, hamming up the role and playing it so far over the top that it is great fun to watch. The story concerns Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall, not a great choice for the role), and his son Danny, who serve as winter caretakers to the secluded Overlook Hotel in the Rockies. The hotel, of course, is haunted, and its aura of death and terror soon intoxicate Jack, driving him into a murderous, cabin-fever rage to kill his family. In his typical style, Kubrick takes his time, with long shots, scenes without dialogue, and visions of the horror that the hotel represents. I have always found Kubrick a sort of icy genius, and his films for the most part are coldly intellectual. The Shining is no exception. One feels detached from the characters, as much as they are detached from each other. This matters little however. If I had to choose one word to define the Shining, I would say disturbing. It is not a slasher flick, and gets its tension from the images and situations it presents instead of from characters. There are great images that have become classic in film history ("Here's Johhhhny!!!", "All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy,", the two dead girls, room 237, the sea of blood in the elevators, Redrum, the fight on the stairs, the ghost ballroom, and the chase through the hedge maze). Ultimately, it is a horror masterpiece, which, though utterly different from the source material, is just as terrifying as King's classic book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest melodrama ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining can be watched in many ways: as a horror film, as a novel adaptation, or to contrast insanity and the afterlife. But the next time you watch this film, pay very close attention to the music. One thing that is unsurpassed by Kubrick is that he has an innate ability to find the most appropriate music to score his films, and this film is one of his greatest examples. Listen to how the music not only scores the movie, but is brilliantly juxtaposed to what is going on and what is being said. The music builds, it swells, and it strikes in the most surprising and frightening places. It never interrupts the action or duologue, it highlights it. The music itself is the sound of horror, and it never stops, especially when you want it to.When you watch The Shining with this in mind, you will realize that the acting and direction of the film was intentionally meant to accentuate the music as well. If you really think about it, the film would have been just as effective if there was no duologue at all. The Shining is directed in a melodramatic fashion, not unlike Hitchcock's Vertigo, and Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge. It is expressionistic, not realistic.So many modern day horror film directors attempt to frighten us with "realism", attempting to eliminate the suspension of disbelief. What they don't realize is that the horror genre REQUIRES the suspension of disbelief! But why attack the problem that way? If you truly want to scare your audience, don't waste time with realism. Creep in slowly and deliberately, and make the atmosphere of the film your main concern, whatever that entails. That is what Kubrick does, and he does it by showcasing the most terrifying musical score in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unrealistic.. only for people who over-love horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realized some things this month."Just because a movie is the top 250 list of IMDb it doesn't have to be a great movie necessarily." "Just because US voters gave high points a movie it just doesn't have to be a superb movie necessarily." "Jst because some big screen play writer or some great director was included in the total cast of movie it just doesn't have to be one of the best movies. I have seen a couple of movies by Stanley Kubrick so he was for sure a good director but I always found S. King's writings preposterous. In the movie We are introduced to Jack Torrance, driving up to the Overlook Hotel in the mountains of Colorado, to be interviewed for the position of caretaker for the winter, where the snows often completely block the path to the hotel and make it inaccessible. Jack sees this as an opportunity to start off a writing career. However, the manager informs Jack about the previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who killed his wife and two daughters, cutting them into pieces. Jack, however, seems unfazed by this, saying his wife, Wendy, is "a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict." Now after we saw that introduction it is not difficult to predict the rest of the movie at least if you are a fan of horror movie it is not supposed to be. Maybe I am living in a relatively balanced society, maybe it is just some unrealistic crap but the screenplay seemed stupid to me.What is real or what is imaginary? An isolated man who is on the verge of madness is trying to chop his wife and his little kid and there is no one at the hotel no one ever who will hear his noise and the noise of his axe? Wait a minute should we just reduce ourselves to the enjoyment of the movie? After all Jack Nicholson is doing his job great? I don't think so. Jack Torrance's monologues may be redolent of Protestant Work Ethic. Grady character may represent skewed commentary upon American history. you cans say something on the White Man's burden but if you can't realize all of these things in a reality-this is what we are living- it turns out to be a just a horror movie who over-loves horrors. And there is nothing more to that movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never realized how good looking Shelly Duvall was until this film, her beauty consumed my entire attention span the whole 149 minutes and 24 seconds I watched this film. I actually did not see that it was a horror film until the old lady in the tub. The relationship between Jack and Shelly was a perfect extension of my parents marriage. I was awe-inspired when Jesus miraculously saved Jack from the jaws of that catfish. My dad was the only person that enjoyed that scene more than myself. My grandma was drunk when she watched this movie and kept asking why the little boy was so poorly spoken. I'm 46 years old and still live with my parents, I was grounded the other night because I said the word 'dammit' which I had heard in this film. So if such language is not acceptable in your household then I recommend not viewing this film or at least wait until your parents go to bed. My parents usually go to bed at 10 pm and when they do I usually watch shows I'm not supposed to like Real World on MTV. I love Landon from the Philadelphia show. He's funny, although he does bad things when he's drinking 'liquid evil' as my parents would call it. The ending of the movie is predictable and contrived, I saw it coming all the way. Speaking of movies with predictable endings, did anyone catch The Passion. Boring!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King vs Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows that Kubrick was a genius whereas King is merely a popular horror writer. I read the book, filled with cheesy sentiment and deus ex machinae, after watching the film and brother, am I glad. Kubrick stripped the tripe from what, by the end, is an uninspiring horror novel and turned it into an enduring work of art.The movie refuses to explain or redeem the father's madness, demonstrating that Kubrick understood better than King the root of horror: inexplicable, unapologetic violence. Where King insists, finally, on preserving the parent-child bond, Kubrick wounds it irrevocably, because what is more frightening to a child than being hunted by a father who, truly, wishes it dead? Not moving topiary animals, I'm afraid, Mr. King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack pulling faces, Shelly acting scared - then the weird science bit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a grand overall theory about music and film. Much popular music is the kind of music you can easily ignore because most people that buy music never listen to it in isolation. It is background noise. Easy listening - more like not really listening.Growing up the biggest selling LP was Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. This was for me the perfect example, they even used it on the soundtrack of the Exorcist. You could even watch a feature film while it was playing!In the same vein most blockbusters are not really proper films at all. Merely novelty rides or one trick ponies. Star Wars (video game), Jaws (man eating rubber shark), Superman (man that can fly) and Psycho (confidence trick) are four that I can throw up without thinking. Nothing wrong with them - all well worth one sitting - what bugs me is that people think they can convert them in to art simply by throwing a lot of long words at them. They are fast food for the brain. You enjoy and move on - unless you are being paid to make them more than they really are!Here is another perfect example of the thrill ride format. Nothing really happens that doesn't happen in a horror B, but it has one or two image ideas that it pulls off. But overall it is just a short ghost train ride in the snow.Kubrick was a very rude man making this film. Indeed he showed himself to be a total pig. Treating Nicholson with only the greatest respect and dignity; while being utterly rude and ignorant to Duvall (Nicholson confirms this) to the point where she often broke down in to tears.(The little boy was protected by minders from the perfectionist.)Whether this was to help her performance I don't know - but I know that whether you are a star actor or tossing burgers at the local greasy spoon no one has the right to tear strips off you when you are trying your best.Kubrick might well have been a genius - although this is not the best evidence - but as a human being he left a lot to be desired. We might not see his like again, but at least future film sets will not fall foul of the Geneva Convention on Human Rights. As regards the film, watch and forget - although it might turn up in a few nightmares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first 2 1/2 hour movie to keep me entertained the whole way through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.:::*SOME SPOILERS*:::.I like a lot of two and a half hour movies, but all the ones I saw had some boring/un-interesting parts. Maybe not a lot, but at least one or two. Then I saw The Shining.In 1997, my friends and I read the book and then saw the TV movie. We all liked the book and the TV movie. Then, one of them saw this film and told us not to watch it because it disgraced the book. Well, I watched it anyway. I can't believe my friend didn't like. Sure, it wasn't all that true to the book, but it was great and entertaining, which is what most movies aim for.The book scared the crap out of me. The TV movie was kind of scary, but not really. This movie is the scariest thing I've ever seen. Everything about it was terrifying: the blood in the elevator, the woman in the bathtub, and, most of all, the girls in the hallway. I can't tell you how much that scared me. I literally had to pause the movie to make my heart stop beating so fast. The thing was, I had read about how scary the girls were in this movie, but I didn't think they'd actually be this scary! I was proved wrong. So everything you read about the girls is true. And everything else, yes. They are horrifying.Yet, in a way, it's mind-blowing. Stephen King's book really makes you think and it took my friends and I a long time to fully understand everything. Kubrick adapts that book into a screenplay and adds even more for the viewer to think about. If you haven't read the book and you go to see this movie, I couldn't imagine how much thinking that is. Something like that is extraordinary.Jack Nicholson was perfect. There's no other word to describe it. When I saw the TV movie, I thought that actor was okay, but he wasn't how I imagined Jack Torrence when I read the book. Jack Nicholson not only gives his best performance in this film, but he also portrays Torrance like I had imagined him. Danny Lloyd was terrific in his big screen debut (and sadly, his last) and Shelley Duvall was....decent. Oh yes, Scatman Crothers was good as well. You know what, I'll just stop naming people. Everyone from Nicholson to the extras were great.Overall, this is a movie you simply can't miss. Don't listen to anyone when they say that The Exorcist or Psycho or Rosemary's Baby are the scariest movies. They are all scary, but I can't imagine anything being any more terrifying than this masterpiece.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is simply the best horror movie ever made and one of Jacks best performances, man can he be scary. I think this is also Stanly Kubricks definitive movie as well. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with it's intense pshycological horror as well as it graphic ahead of it's time bloody special effects. The script was solid as was the acting from the entire cast. The music was perfectly set to match the mood for each scene. My favourite scene was that of Jack and the beautiful naked woman in the bath and then what followed (for those that have not yet seen the movie I will not give the scene away). All in all like I said the best horror movie hands down ever made and should be a part of anyones movie collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest (In my opinion)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, the greatest. I love other movies but I am addicted to this one. There is only one other that I feel this way about and that's Reservoir Dogs. I prefer The Shining though because I grew up watching it.While other kids were watching Barney the Purple Dinosaur, I was sitting in my living room watching this brilliant Kubric Horror CLASSIC. Classic is a word I hardly ever use but when I do, I mean it. This movie was VERY underrated. It was never nominated for anything but a Razzy Award which is the award for worst movie of the year.When I read about that I was shocked. I don't understand how such a great work could be put on the bottom with movies such as 'Gigli'.Everything about this film is great. You're never bored because the characters keep you interested. Even in the silent parts you are on the edge of your seat. When this movie was remade in 1997 I was embarrassed. They gave the lead to Steven Webber, I have no problem with him other than the fact that he destroyed my favorite movie. If a movie is great- LEAVE IT ALONE!Don't remake a movie because you THINK you can make it better.Anyway, back to the ORIGINAL. This films camera shots and music flow so beautifully together. Stephen King and Stanley Kubric work so great together and this is the prime example.If anyone asks me to recommend a movie, this is the first one to come out of my mouth. It's one that never gets old...I grew up watching it and I will most likely die watching it.-Review submitted by: Tony Z.-Rating from Tony Z. ~ 5 (out of) ***** (5 Stars) -O.o_TONY_o.O-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick is a great filmmaker. 2001 is among my favorite movies and I like most of his other movies. But no matter how much I think about the Shining I can't convince myself that it is a good movie. I have now seen it twice and to me it is nothing more than a different, but average movie.What bothers me the most is the fact that it is boring. A family moves into a house and weird stuff starts to happen. But it all happens so slowly. What should have been a 90-minute movie has been stretched out to 2 hours. It has its moments. There is one scene involving a decomposing naked woman that frightened me just a little and flashing images of two murdered girls. Apart from that, nothing in the film scared me. That is not enough to make it a good horror movie.Another thing I don't like is the visual look of the film. It's set in a hotel with too much white, poor lighting and not very nice carpets. That may sound silly to you, but visuals are very important to me and The Shining is just plain old ugly. Even the apartment the family is living in before they move into the hotel is white and horrible. Maybe the whole thing is intentional, maybe it's suppose to seem like an ugly place so you don't want to be there. But that would be like making an incredibly boring film and saying it's supposed to show boredom.The characters are all annoying. I don't like any of them, I can't relate to any of them and none of them are very deep. I don't think Shelley Duvall deserved the Razzie nomination for her part. As annoying as she was, she was just doing her job. Kubrick probably didn't deserve a Razzie nomination for Worst Director, but I think he did do a pretty bad job.There were a few things I liked. For example the way Jack treats his wife or the scenes in the ballroom. But that's not enough for me to say I enjoyed the film. Maybe the film is just to out of date to scare me. In which case it's a bad movie for not surviving the test of time. I give it Six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick Lite still Makes for One of the Best Horror Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you compare this film adaptation of King's hack novel to other films from Kubrick ("2001" or "Clockwork Orange"), there really isn't much depth here. The stuff is pretty straight forward. Family shacks up at haunted hotel and dad goes nuts and tries to ax everyone. Still it's pretty damn scary because Kubrick films it like a work of art (the aerial shots of mountains and the Overlook are haunting to say the least, as are the creepy interior shots of the hotel), and he sets the mood so well (there's an underlying sense of doom sleeping beneath the slow pace and cold feel to the film). This film has aged very well, and is often sighted by fans and critics alike as one of the best horror movies ever made (even if it is Kubrick's slightest film). The reason I think it has held up so well over time is because it can be watched on two levels. You can take it all very seriously and creep yourself out big time, or you can enjoy it tongue-in-cheek and howl over Nicholson's over the top performance, Shelley Duval's incompetent whining, and the flat out weirdness of it all (dead old naked lady laughing in bathtub, blood flooding out of elevators, a little boy driving a Big Wheel down the haunted halls of the Overlook). Let it give you nightmares, and then get your revenge by playing a drinking game to it the next time you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another overrated Kubrick film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why so many people like this movie. The minimal plot is so lame, they seemed desperate to fill in the holes with meaningless scenery and scenes. Scatman Crothers, who played the chef Dick Hallorann, seemed to think he was in a completely different movie than the rest. Talk about not having chemistry. This was the extreme. The intensity and over-dramatized fluctuations in his lines sounded like he thought he was giving an infomercial sales pitch. He stood out like a sore thumb and just his presence is very questionable, as if they only added him later to fill some sort of socio-political gap, if you know what I mean.The entire story was very weak. They tried to explain Jack's random insanity by suggesting the hotel was haunted with the spirits of past guests whom I assume were murdered or died there. And he was supposed to be falling in the footsteps of a previous caretaker who went on a murderous rampage, killing his entire family for no apparent reason. Say what?It didn't work. There were too many different ghost and horror elements thrown in for it to many any sense. That's all it was: just a bunch of elements "thrown in", nothing more. As hard as they desperately tried to scare me, I just became more bored. In some of the "scary" scenes, I found myself chuckling at the absurdity of it all. It has to at least be a little believable. It falls way short.There are much better films out there to try to pass off as great horror films. But like most of Kubrick's work, the legend of this film exceeds the quality by miles. Another example of the most overrated director in Hollywood history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is considered one of the scariest movies in film history. I'm not completely sure why. Sure it is very cold and leaves the audience disoriented in many great shots, but what Kubrick film doesn't? Spartacus?Every time I have seen this film, I find more things I like and more things I hate. By the way, if you have read the Stephen King book, do not see this movie! If you have seen this movie, read the book! If you have done both already, you know what I'm talking about.I am an avid fan of Jack Nicholson and he does spit out some classic lines in this movie. " Heeeeere's Johnny! " (where on earth did that come from?) and " All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. " I'm sure that was the mantra he chanted while working with the irritatingly perfectionist Stanley Kubrick.There's one thing of Jack's performance I didn't understand. Where did he go mad? One day he's joking with his wife and the next he's staring off into oblivion with cold, soulless eyes. Insanity needs some sort of explanation. It's funny how Kubrick can edit out scenes from Nicholson's growing cabin fever and leave in so many scenes of the dreadfully miscast Shelley Duvall and the unfortunately wasted Scatman Crothers doing virtually nothing.One member of the cast that does a wonderful job is Danny Lloyd as the moptop kid with a special gift. "Reeeedruuum!" He is used in the movie's scariest scenes, especially the one with the two little girls and room 237. Brrrr... What keeps this movie from evolving into a horror masterpiece is that it tries too hard to be epic with so many holes to fall into along the way. There are so many moments where the viewer needs an explanation, but Kubrick is too busy trying to make you feel cold and uneasy. I still don't know what he intended for the final shot. Maybe he wants you to read the Stephen King novel yourself.</fullReview>

However, there is a big flaw: It is never properly explained exactly why the lead character goes psycho. In the book it is because he is a reformed alcoholic who's just had his first drink in three years, and the hotel he is taking care of is playing with his mind. In the film, we are given a slight hint that he used to be an alcoholic, but not enough. We are just left confused when he suddenly goes mad a while later. As I said, though, it's a thoroughly scary and entertaining film.</fullReview>

CinematographyCONS Not scary Too long Too many 'ways out' - so many opportunities for them to escape/do something differently. They are in a MASSIVE HOTEL, Jack hasn't slept, he's hated them both from the start - it is not a surprise, the kid is telepathic, Jack yells wherever he goes so you know where he is... blah blah. Too easy.Perhaps I am hardened to modern movies that have been forced to remove all options of escape for characters (moving house in Sinister springs to mind as an example).I find scary movies SCARY. My boyfriend doesn't like me watching them because he has to deal with the nighttime fallout after. This did not scare me one bit.Finally, the characters are too hard to relate to for you to really sympathise with them - connected to the 'too easy' discussion above.Glad I watched it because it is a classic, but unfortunately I was quite disappointed. It is far more drama than thriller/horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a faithful adoption of the book, but still very effective!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE SHINING is perhaps one of the better STEPHEN KING novels adopted for the big screen. While this adoption of his infamous novel is far from being faithful to the book, it nevertheless has accumulated a fairly good reputation from fans &amp; critics alike &amp; is often cited as one of the best horror films ever made &amp; it's deserving of it's praise. The camera work here is perhaps some of the best technical work you will ever see in any film, bar none. The late STANLEY KUBRICK makes very good use of the steadicam here, in fact he almost shoots the entire film with it! the camera hardly if ever stops moving here &amp; I absolutely loved the opening credits segment as the camera follows Jack's car through the long winding country road, it really soaks up the beautiful scenery of the Colardo mountains! The steadicam shots that follow Danny while he is on his tricycle riding through the large hallways of the Hotel, are also a real technical achievement &amp; keeps one on the edge of their seat, since they never know just who, or what, might be waiting to scare them around the corner. The winter setting also adds to the films creepiness. The film also is infused with many haunting images, the two long dead twin daughters of the previous caretaker showing up in the hallways, an elevator opening up, sending a torrential tidal wave of blood, eerie images of dead bodies in the hallway &amp; a creepy image of a naked woman rising out of a bathtub &amp; kissing Jack, only for the gorgeous woman to turn into a homicidal cackling hag. The hotel set was so gorgeous &amp; expansive a really work of art! &amp; yet oddly despite it's expansiveness, it also feels oddly claustrophobic at the same time. JACK NICHOLSON puts in a grand performance as the former teacher turned writer, who slowly but surely, as the days go on, turns into a complete lunatic &amp; it's hard too imagine anyone else in his role doing a better job.But THE SHINING also did something else besides scaring it's audience too. It also happened to divide the fans, while Kubrick's fans defend the film &amp; call it not only one of his best films, but also one of the best Stephen King adoptions ever to reach the screen, mainly due to many of the directors infamous trademarks &amp; impressive technical work &amp; taking the film in a much more different area, making it more enigmatic, wherein certain things aren't made very clear. Many of King's most die hard fans have cried foul, citing the dropping of many character &amp; plot elements of the book, Jack trying to overcome his alcoholism &amp; his past abuse of his family is seemingly underwritten here. In fact, King later disowned this adoption, stating he was unhappy with the way the direction of the film was taken &amp; that he felt Kubrick made this film to hurt people. Weather or not that is true is up to each viewer to judge for themselves, I will say that while I enjoyed the film immensely, I felt there were a few things that could have been done better, more particularly in the running time, it runs 140 minutes long! plus I would really have enjoyed seeing a bit more faithful version of the novel, at least as it regards some of the novels character &amp; plot elements many of which were abandon here. In fact the movie is really only the bare bones version of King's infamous novel &amp; while some elements of the novel are here, they aren't fully developed. In the novel Jack has an alcohol problem, but that's never really covered here, making the scene where he says he'd sell his soul for a drink confusing to fans who have not read the book. The maze of hedge animals is also gone from this version, (understandably so since the idea of making them come to life just would't be possible in the days before CGI) but I personally think Kubrick came up with a much better ending here, with a suspenseful stalk &amp; chase scene that sees Jack pursue his little boy through a garden maze, while hefting a razor sharp Ax that he intends to hack him up with. The connection between Danny's ESP &amp; the Overlook Hotel is also never explained here &amp; the "Shining" that Danny exhibits, is paid very little attention to here, instead Danny motions with his index finger &amp; this is supposed to represent the "Shining" but I thought this was absolutely laughable &amp; only served to make things unintentionally comical, because it looks so stupid! &amp; the "Shining" seems to bear very little to no connection to the hotel. Jack's wife both physically &amp; mentally is also changed from the book &amp; while I did enjoy Nicholson's performance as Jack, the rest of the cast I (personally) cared less for, feeling many of the actors (especially Shelly Duvall as Jack's wife) were badly miscast, I just wasn't buying into anyones performance here, with the exception of Nicholson (than again he was born over the top so?).All in all, THE SHINING is definitely recommended to horror fans, while I felt the film could have been cut a bit shorter, to make it more tighter &amp; faster paced, it never ever loses any steam, especially after repeated viewings. However I tend to be more of a Kubrick fan than a King fan, so if you're a die hard fan of the book, or Stephen King himself, you might be disappointed, in fact, if you're a die-hard fan of King's work &amp; of his novel in general &amp; looking for a far more faithful adoption of the story, skip this one &amp; check out his 1997 TV mini series of the same name. But for everyone else, enjoy!**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I also take the authors opinion to heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Book "The Shining", is an amazing book. It has suspense, terror, and an awesome plot with unexpected twists. The movie while having its moments in suspense and "scary" parts there are times when the affects are over- done and trying to hard to have a impact on you. I have had read many of Stephen King's works, and the Shining is one of my favorite. In an interview he gave, King had stated that he was not able to voice his opinion of the movie, now he says after a time he just does not care to share his mind and I agree 100%. King stated that the movie added things that did not add to the movie and also added that the plot barely stuck to what he was trying to accomplish in the book. I think a good rule of thumb when turning a book into a movie is that you consult the author and READ the book you making a movie about. I know there will be those that disagree. I however tend to agree with the person that wrote the book that the movie was based on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a fan of the original novel, this movie makes me sad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to get a lot of hate for this opinion, but I'll say it anyway.I don't like this movie.Mainly because I love the book.If this movie wasn't associated with the book, I probably would enjoy it more.I'll keep this quick, but the main reasons I don't like the book are as follows.1. Wendy Torrance: What is a fantastically strong mother figure in the novel turns into an annoying screaming woman who does nothing productive in the movie. She takes little responsibility for her son, and when Jack snaps, she cries in a corner rather than try to get out of the situation. I get that both reactions are legitimate for the situation, but I don't understand why Kubrick decided that a weak female character was better than a strong female character.2. The Shining is severely underplayed. In this story, the Shining is the name Hallorann gives the psychic powers he and Danny share. In the novel, the shining is very important to the film and is the main reason that Wendy and Danny survive the ordeal, whereas in the film, a lot of it could be chalked up to coincidence.3. Hallorann dies. There's a reason that the weapon in the novel is a croquet mallet, as opposed to an ax. I get that an ax is much better for the purposes of tension than a mallet, but it's hard to survive being hit by an ax. So in both the novel and the movie, Hallorann is summoned by the Shining, and is the first victim of mad-Jack, but because in the movie it's an ax rather than a mallet, he dies. Why does the hero of the story, and the only African American character die? He's also the only person that dies. The only victim of Mad Jack is the only African American character, who is the hero in the original book. I don't think that Stanley Kubrick is racist at all, but it's a very perplexing decision anyway.4. It overshadowed the book. While the novel is a typical haunting story with great characters, the movie is the exact polar opposite of that, and is therefore more respected in terms of plot. I'm sure most people who have seen the film haven't read the book, and consider it as a stand-alone work. The conspiracy theorists that connect this film to the moon landing also probably consider this film independent of the book. This is sad because I love the book, and I feel that the characters in said book are very well developed, three dimensional and not-too- stereotypical. It's strange that a director known more for his purely cinematic and plot-centric movies adapted a story that relied more on emotion and character than logic. I completely understand why Stephen King didn't like this adaptation and licensed the television miniseries as a reaction (a series that was panned because it was compared to the film) It's also an odd thing to adapt compared to Kubrick's other adaptations (A Clockwork Orange and 2001, both of which are very niche novels to my knowledge) that he would also adapt something that is more 'NYT Bestseller' than 'Literature'. I'll just stop here. I already probably annoyed a lot of you with my ignorance already, so just consider this: People probably also hate the LOTR films because they abandon something that was in the original film. I personally love them because they are great films, but just because a film is good in its own right, doesn't mean that it's a good adaptation. And because there's no such thing as a good adaptation, there will always be someone who hates the film because it doesn't compare to the book, and vice versa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece? Not quite. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this flick, and was really excited, thinking I was gonna watch a classic. What a load of garbage. This was a waste of 3 hours of my life. OK, so Jack Nicholson did a good job in the lead. So what? The script was a disorganized mess that made WAY too much use of foreshadowing. You can't really use spoilers in reviewing this movie, because it spoils itself so much: much of the first half of the movie consists of clips of several scenes you see in the second half. The foreshadowing used absolutely destroyed any suspense/horror that would have existed for me (I can't be scared of it if I know it's coming).Next there's the music track: I'd like to say it consists of several great pieces of music that adequately set the tone for the scenes they accompany. Nothing could be further from the truth. Half of the instruments used I couldn't recognize and most of the musical effects seemed pointless.Finally there's the acting. As I mentioned above, Jack Nicholson's performance was superb. He's the only reason I don't give this movie a 1. The other characters? Except for the little boy, they were used as cardboard cutouts, and most of them acted that way. Even Scatman Crothers couldn't save the other acting performances: his considerable acting talent was underused.In short, not a classic. Just a gore-fest wanna-be dressed up as a masterpiece, and WAAAAY overrated.I give it a 4, for Nicholson's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary, Yes, But Not Coherent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only recently saw The Shining for the first time and I have to say I was quite disappointed. While the performances by the actors are fantastic, and Nicholson plays a fantastic lunatic, I found the movie to be in-cohesive and to lack structure. Maybe it is necessary to read the book first to understand everything in the film, maybe not. Not having read the book, however, I found the movie full of loose ends that were never tied up. On a positive note, the film was sufficiently scary, I did find the suspense/thriller aspect of it very well done, and the scene with the blood spilling was very clever and disturbing. However, I found there was no explanation for many things. Danny's "Shining" ability seems pointless in the film. He sees things that we already know happened, he has this ability that doesn't help him in any way. His father still goes mad, and it is his mother's resourcefulness that saves them, not his ability. All his special talent does is make the kid a little scary, especially in the "redrum" scene. Apart from making him creepy, I don't think his "gift" serves any purpose in the film. It summons Halloran, and this part is built up and up with him coming to the rescue, and he is butchered before anything even remotely interesting happens, thus making his and Danny's ability an utter waste of time. The scene with the woman in the bathtub is gross, true, but pointless. It shows nothing. And the ending is very drawn out. When the film finally does conclude, and I was waiting for all these loose ends to be tied up, that photograph is shown of Jack in the past, confusing me ten times more and leaving the storyline completely open for interpretation. "You've always been here" is what he is told, and we see that, so what the heck was happening in the mean time, with Grady, with Jack's wife and son, with Halloran (didn't he know Jack was already caretaker?)... Nothing is answered, nothing is concluded, I found the ending really frustrating and disappointing. If this film was meant to be only a frightening thriller, then it has achieved its purpose. But if it was meant to be clever and cunning and show some hidden meanings, then it fails dismally. Good cast, good thrills, crappy structure, very stupid ending. I'll try my luck at the book and hope it is more satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kings version WAY better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My view is that Stephen King's version of The Shinning is a lot better than Kubrics. I have read the novel and there are several things that are in the book that when you watch Kubrics version, you just say, "What?!?!?". For example, the woman in room 217 (although it's, what, 237 in the film?) turns into a younger female and makes out with Jack which does not make sense at all. The woman in 217 killed herself and therefore remains an old dead ghost, there was absolutely no reason to put that in there. I really do not think you can compare the two too much. Kubric's version is way different than King's. I am a fan of Kubric, and this film, but the Kubric and King were on completely different wavelengths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MAJOR Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is easily the biggest disappointment in the great career of Stanley Kubrick. It's a shock that this film isn't better since they combined a great director with a terrific novel by Stephen King. "The Shining" is not a bad film but not what it should have been.The problems, and there are many, began with the casting. Anyone who read and loved the book will know what I mean. Jack Nicholson, great as he is, is totally wrong in the lead. One of the great things about the book was seeing this fairly normal family man disintegrate into madness. You take one look at Nicholson and he comes off as a nut. There's no tension at all. Nicholson does what he can and isn't bad but someone a little more straight laced was needed. Shelly Duvall is completely wrong for the role of Wendy. In the book she was described as a beautiful blonde. What was Kubrick thinking?Kubrick also unwisely took liberties with the book which was a real mistake. There is no sign of the hedges shaped as animals that seemed to move on their own. Kubrick has added a giant maze that added nothing to the film. The ending of the book was frightening and effective. The ending of the movie is quite bland. And flaws that most novice directors would have picked up on are overlooked. The most blatant involves a character who has the gift of the shining and can sense from hundreds of miles away that the family is in trouble. Yet when he arrives to help he cannot sense danger only a few feet away from him.On the positive side Kubrick did create some unforgettable moments. Little Danny encountering the ghosts while riding his tricycle is a moment of shock and fright that is terrific. I imagine if you haven't read the book the film plays much better. That might explain the very high rating the film has gotten here. But diehard fans of the book and diehard fans of Kubrick certainly see this as a step down considering all the talent involved. This is the only Kubrick film I would not highly recommend and that's a shame. What often looks more like a 50's B horror movie by Corman or Castle should have been a horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get it why so many people think that's a horror masterpiece.It didn't scare me at all with only one or two exception for the whole movie. The biggest problem of the movie is that the plot was simply awful.I've read Stephen King's book(and liked it so much more than that movie BTW)and there a lot of unnecessary changes from it, but even putting that aside,there's so much plot holes it's just ridiculous.Kubrick just removed what he thought was unnecessary from the book,but didn't replace it with anything else so often the movie didn't make sense at all.*SPOILERS*It was never explained why Jack started to go insane,why he started seeing ghosts and such.He just went from an normal(just a little weird) man to a complete psycho in one or two days.There was nothing about Jack's problems with alcohol and his previous disappointments as a writer,which are two essential elements of the book's plot.There was no explanations why Jack was seeing those ghosts.And last of all,Haloran came from thousands of miles away knowing full well something very bad was happening,but he entered calmly trough the front door and asked "Is anyone here".Most of the best moments from the book was omitted without being replaced with something that makes sense.*END SPOILERS*The acting wasn't very good either,Nicholson was great but the others were quite bad.The camerawork was great for most parts. And it was moving painfully slow,with nothing happening for big periods of the movie.The best feature of the movie was the scary music and sound effects,but they couldn't save it from being a big disappointment for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack is an aspiring writer who takes a job as a winter caretaker for a huge, historic hotel, bringing along his wife and son for some peace and quiet. As he starts to learn more about the hotel, he discovers that the former caretaker killed himself and his family after going crazy due to the intense seclusion. But, he is yet to be discouraged from taking the job. The little family treks up to the hotel and the father immediately begins losing his mind.To make the long story short: wife discovers husband has been writing about his decent into madness, husband gets violently hostile and tries to kill his family. Starts off pretty well, but it has far too many flaws to be anything special. First of all, Nicholson plays intense to it's hilt during his introductory scenes so it's impossible to tell at what point he actually goes insane. Second, this was not tailored for Stephen King fans. From watching this, you can tell this was made strictly for fans of Kubrick. The two styles clash and this film is unlike most of King's films because of the mind games Kubrick is always playing with the viewer. Third, it's overlong and doesn't make good use out of the time it has. Except for the opening credits, this film is perfectly skip-able.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually creepy let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having just read "The Shining" I was jived to see this flick, even though Stephen King didn't like it.And I can see why he didn't like it.First: the good. This movie has the right look and feel to it. The hotel that serves as the setting fits wonderfully, and several of the creepy scenes work to full effect. (Interestingly enough, the most chilling scene in the entire movie- the famous 'All Work and No Play...' one- wasn't even in the book!) So, in that limited way, the movie works.Now the bad: Where are these characters? Where is there ANY development?? You have Hallorann: By the end of the movie you have to wonder why the even chose to put him in it at all. Danny: doesn't do anything in the entire movie but mumble a bit. Wendy: All she does is cry and sob. Very annoying. Not that it was her fault. That's all she was given to do. Jack: This guy is supposed to DESCEND into the madness of the hotel. He is supposed to be flawed at the beginning of the story, but still be a *good* human being. In this movie, he's very harsh with his family from the start, and we never see him really interact with them before he starts to go off the deep end, so to speak. (Not that there was a chance. Seemingly, the second he steps in the hotel he's halfway to the end of the movie)The line reading was just that. READING. So much of the movie seems forced... contrived... And though there are nice efforts to alter parts of the novel to facilitate the different medium (such as the doctor scene at the beginning of the movie, which culls elements and plot points from the whole book in mere minutes) there are too many complete changes that don't make much sense. (why the hedge maze? Why end it like *that*?? I think I know why Kubrick didn't use the same ending/main plot point from the book, but still... could have done better) Not to mention huge themes and elements from the novel that you would think should have been present.I likely need to watch this movie again in awhile after the book isn't so fresh in my mind, and perhaps I can look at it more as a separate movie and not a movie based on the book. As it is, I found it it to be very un-affecting for the most part, except for about half on hour towards the end.For now, I give it 5.5 out of 10, based on artistic merit, that half hour, and the best scene that seems like it should have been in the book even though it wasn't. (1= awful, 5= average, 10= perfection)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>creepiness that haunts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a former teacher trying to do some writing. He gets a job to watch the Overlook Hotel for the winter with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and child Danny. Danny has an imaginary friend and premonitions of future horrors. The family arrives at the hotel just as it is closing up. Danny continues to have visions. The chef Dick Hallorann is able to communicate with Danny telepathically. Dick calls this 'shining'. Danny asks about room 237 and Dick tells him to stay out. A month later, Jack's writing is going nowhere and he's growing more distance.As a horror, this is not scary. It doesn't make you turn away from the screen. There is not a thrilling drama or an exciting action movie. This is simply art and nothing less. Director Stanley Kubrick is impeccable in his vision. It imparts a mood of foreboding. There is a feeling of wrongness about every scene of this movie. It makes the audience uneasy. There is a creepiness that haunts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laying down more tracking shots than the Union Pacific did rail during its cross continental building Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is an empty horror flic rich in production design and due to his methodical style void most of the way of suspense. For nearly two and a half hours Kubrick drags his camera around the empty surroundings of a deserted off season hotel and its grounds inexorably building up suspense but failing to follow through as he lets scenes drag on endlessly with superfluous dialog and hollow disjointed action.Writer Jack Torrance along with his wife and child take on the duty of caring for a grand Colorado hotel that eventually becomes closed off from the outside world. The son Danny has special powers that allow him to see the past as well as well as channel thoughts of others. As the days pass Jack slowly becomes unhinged and Danny's abilities become more vivid and gruesome. Meanwhile wife Wendy's hand wringing increases but it's clear that only a bloodbath will be able to satiate a patient audience slowed down by Stanley's innocuous attention to detail which impedes the pacing.Kubrick's visual style was at good as it got in the last half of the century and in The Shining we have some bravura compositions backed by a muscular score and soundtrack that ratchets up the suspense but fails to sustain it as Kubrick plods along with superfluous tracking shots and slow zooms that add nothing but time to the story and loosen tautness.Nicholson is a superb chilling presence but Shelly Duvall as his suffering and clueless wife is all wrong and the chemistry between the two is non-existent from the outset. It is left up to Nicholson's sick sense of humor to give some spring to the (you guessed it) drawn out finale that salvages moments from this polished bore.The Shining is a shining example of a master filmmaker out of his genre depth, slumming with his pedigree and being incapable of delivering the goods done so well and for a lot less by fellow directors who would not be mentioned in the same breath as this giant. The thing is he could have learned a lot from them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat Of A Disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the moment, I'm reading the Stephen King novel. I'm a little past halfway through the book. I'd seen fragments of the movie before, including the end, so I thought "What the hell? I'll watch it while it's on." I was engrossed for the first thirty minutes, until I realised how little interest I held in the characters. Yes, Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance is amazing, and his descent into madness is one of the most interesting parts of the film, but... How could anyone sympathize with him? Or Danny? Or Wendy? In the novel, you understand what motivates each of these characters. In the film, you're just expected to accept them doing what they do as they do it. I can give Kubrick that he didn't have a whole lot of time for characterization if he wanted to add in all he did, but I'd have liked to see more, which is rare for me after watching a two and one-half hour movie. One thing the film gets completely right is the mood: along with the characters, you actually feel trapped within the Overlook. Even the establishing shots of the road leading up to the hotel are foreboding, despite how amazingly beautiful they are. Each of Jack's hallucinations (if you can call them that) are startling and, for lack of a better word, trippy. His slow descent into insanity is enthralling. Tony's "appearances," though considerably disappointing when put next to the novel's version, are also horrifying. However, as I said before, the problem is characterization. I could have cared less for anyone on the screen, whether they lived or died. I can look past the lack of wasps or firehose snakes (though I would have loved to see Danny call one a "cheap little prick") or hedge monsters; I just want characters I can sympathize with, who I can feel something for. I congratulate the actors wholeheartedly for doing what they can with a script that seems sometimes forced, as if dialog was hastily thrown in just for the sake of it. All I want is to care what happens to the characters in the end. That's not to say I wasn't scared or tensed-up when the time came; it's just to say that, after all I've heard of the film, this is just somewhat of a disappointment. If nothing else, Nicholson's performance alone makes the film worth watching.</fullReview>

I did not get scared watching the movie, there is not a scene where you can get goose bumps. Maybe in those days the (80s) people could not imagine what was happening to Jack Torrance. But in todays horror movies there are a lot of situations in which people are possessed by a demon or just strange thing that could be happening.

		<shortDescription>This interesting failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Stephen King often refers to this adaptation and well, I have to agree. Did Mr. Kubrick understand what the story is about? I seriously doubt it, no wonder Mr. King remade it. Nicholson is over the top from the very first scene, what need to go to the Outlook Hotel if he already lost it? And the kid is creepier than the ghosts themselves, so what is this about? Yes, the result is scary but I insist, this is not what the story issues. It's the lost relationship between a boy and his father, something the miniseries portrays well. Watch that instead. Mr. Weber may not be the best actor ever but his slipping into madness is gradual and emotional, something the movie adaptation lost. The screenplay is too direct in its pretensions: let's scare people but forget the human content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terror Is Not An Option In This Bloated "Masterpiece" Of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'll give The Shining it's dues... it has excellent creepy sets and meticulous cinematography typical of Kubrick now armed with a steadi-cam but it is all mostly wasted in a underwhelming average horror movie.Because the film lacks a strong psychological backbone, in fact, it is spineless. The Shining does not play on audience's minds like I feel it should have. The problem lies in the fact, Kubrick lent his own interpretation to one of Stephen King's greatest novels ever. A book that shouldn't be adapted into film anyways. He stuffed this movie -to-the-gills with not even remotely terrifying "ghosts-in-sheets" shocks.The Shining fails because the director never leaves any room for the imaginations of his audience, it is not an option apparently to Kubrick. The Overlook is never presented as a nebulous threat and thus the claustrophobic excitement is absent. Kubrick fails to enliven the gradual degradation of Jack's sanity in the lens of his camera, there is no intelligent and plausible mounting horror, it lacks episodic precision key to ante up the level of terror and suspense.And Jack Nicholson is pure ham and beans. Life imitates art.Kubrick's choice is to formally introduce the Overlook Hotel with "Ello, I am the Overlook Hotel, a place with a dark past, please shake my hand" William Castle glee.The offerings are a balderdash of flash floods of blood down corridors, two ugly little dead girls stalking Danny for a playmate, a little boy that talks to his finger, a mousy wild-eyed helpless mother (Wendy in the book is a strong independent personality and a looker), and a father that never had a strong grasp on his sanity to begin with.In the book, Jack Torrance is a recovering alcoholic and aspiring writer, whom broke his son Danny's arm when the boy was younger and just recently fired from a comfortable prep school teacher job both during alcohol fueled binges. Jack Torrance in the King novel is both terrifying (while he loses his mind over the course of the book) and a pitiful tragedy (as he does prove to love his family). In contrast Kubrick's Jack Torrance is not merely "possessed" but remains disconsolately distant to both wife and son. Danny is often playing alone unsupervised or with his mother. This all boils to the surface in the Overlook Hotel of course. In fact, Jack Torrance pursues this seething hatred unrelented to his own death. Halloran gets axed for trying. Perhaps, Kubrick's imbalanced vision of Jack Torrance had always held his family responsibility for all his shortcomings and failures. I spare no pity for any of these characters.The Shining leaves me cold, detached, and unperturbed by this overlong banquet of cheap visual scares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw many many movies based on Stephen King novels...... so i thought it would be a great film . But it turned out the quiet opposite. I never felt it as a horror movie, all the actors acted very well but it was a totally slow with an unexpected tragic type of ending to the story for people who want to see a good horror mystery flick. I did not get why the movie ended in that manner, i went back saw the end again but still didn't get what the director or the writer wanted to show. If u r alone in house and want to see a horror movie for fun being never choose this.If u really want to see this then sit with the ones u hate most so u can irritate them. I was utterly disgusted by this movie. If this is supposedly the best of horror, I will never want to watch the horror genre again for fear of seeing its worst. the movie really stinks and i don't know why is it rated so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the book, and I've seen the miniseries, so my anticipation were huge before I was going to see this, the original movie, the classic. But alas, it didn't take long before I understood what this is - crap. Jack Nicholson is a great actor, and does his share here as well, but a single person cannot hold up a movie alone. The rest of the acting is really, really bad, and The Shining isn't even frightening.I really do understand now why Stephen King didn't like this, it isn't even as close to the book as the miniseries.</fullReview>

Movie drags on for a long time... Like the sets.. Not much horror either.. The music effects in the movie are great, they create a very good sense of suspense.. But nothing actually goes on.. (A person is lifting up a paper and a lot of hype is created for nothing).. The acting is good though.. Overall, its a highly overrated movie.. has good acting, a bad story and music effects that immerse you without actually justifying their use. P.S... there are some incidences which I feel have no reason for being in the movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never understood the hype &amp; love for this film. It must a Kubrick thing - people praise his work regardless of actual merit. Any Stephen King fan should be ashamed of this film. Sure the hotel looks great and spooky and ominous and the deep focus photography is excellent.But the story, OMG! what went wrong? for starters, everything. The SK novel was basically chucked out the window except for the most general of character sketches and plot outline. The details that made the novel scary and fascinating were ignored. No hedge animals?!? The entire alcoholic subtext was removed and this just becomes another haunted house story.Plot holes abound. (SPOILERS AHEAD) I gave up on this being even a watchable film when Scatman Crothers' character, a man with great psychic ability, is summoned back to the hotel from thousands of miles away knowing something is horribly wrong, and then walks in the front door and asks "Is anybody there" prior to getting killed. Monumentally stupid!If you are an SK fan, stick with his miniseries version which far more accurately captures the story he wrote. There's a reason why he hates this film. A very good reason. It sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has not aged well. Kubrick uses a very old-fashioned camera stance and the dialog is often stagey back-and-forth medium head shots.Scatman is apt, but Kubrick asks Jack to be more external, and that's dangerous with his unchecked exuberance. Duvall needs pumping up.The problem is an old one, and one Kubrick knows. Successful storytelling is bound by its media, so a successful print story can be only a starting point for cinematic narrative. He clearly believes it best when a character or device is external, like Hal, the spirit here, or Hitchcock's mcguffin. His handling of the unseen contrasted with and contained in huge interiors is his strategy and it may have worked better when the film was new. But its just too tame now.What's very nice is the selfreference. It is another piece of an obsessed storytelling about an obsessed writer, engaged in creating a story.I gave this film extra points because it tried to use architecture well. But it did a poor job. Part of this is the unimaginative camera eye. But even a better eye couldn't have exploited the set well. If you want the set to be a character, you need to give it soul, and incorporate the viewer's eye into the form. Welles knew how. Why didn't Kubrick?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I saw this on network television and never saw it in the theater or on video, but this movie was a piece of crap. It was never explained how or why Jack Torrance ended up being the maintenance man for some godforsaken hotel in the middle of the Rocky Mountains during the winter. I don't even think it told you he was an English teacher in a prep school and that he was fired for punching out a student in an alcoholic rage. If I had never read the book, I wouldn't have known these things. It had the look of a Tuesday Night Movie of the Week. The whole thing looked rushed. It was a joke. Shelly Duvall and Jack Nicholson both looked like caricatures. Jack Nicholson gives me the creeps anyway, and I can't look at Shelly Duvall without thinking of her as Olive Oyl in POPEYE. She looks like her, even in this movie. My friend and I laughed our asses off when Jack came in with that ax and started chopping up the hotel. His, "Hi, Wendy, I'm home!" And "...Heeeerrreee's Johnny!" THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SCARY??? Please!!! Not worth another viewing. Well...maybe after I've had a six pack or two. 2 out of 10, only because I'm in a good mood. I can't believe this is from the same director who gave us PATHS OF GLORY.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I'm being deliberately over-harsh in the grade. Really, the movie probably deserves a three or four star rating. But it is my wont to skew low when I think a bad movie has vastly too high an overall rating. And this is indeed a bad movie.The problem here is that the story just doesn't make any sense. It didn't make any sense to me, and, after a lot of reading online, it appears it doesn't make sense to anyone. There's vastly differing opinions over just what was real or imaginary and just what was going on. And you know what I think? I don't think Kubrick himself had a clue. I don't think HE could tell you who unlocked the door. He clearly wasn't the tiniest bit interested in telling a coherent story, he just threw in whatever bits seemed cool. A flood of blood from the elevator? Sure, that's cool! Who cares if it makes no sense! A quick unrelated shot of two unknown people making love, one in a bear costume? Wow, that's weird, throw it in! To me, this whole who-cares-if-it-makes-sense approach constitutes inexcusably bad film-making.Seriously, by the time I saw the quasi-Twilight-Zone last shot, I had a clear revelation of what this movie reminded me of: The Planet of the Apes. No, not the great, original, Charlton Heston Planet of the Apes, the abortion that was the Tim Burton remake. But, more specifically, it reminded me of the experience of watching the DVD of that movie with Burton's commentary track on. Where he explicitly admits that he really had no idea what was going on with the ending. This seemed totally like what Kubrick was doing. The. Plot. Makes. No. Sense. I can see why King hated it.I've never read the book, but I've read a fair bit online about differences between the movie and the book, and it seems clear to me that the *book* *does* make sense. So I come away with the strong sense that what we have here is a movie that utterly butchered the book it was based on.One other thing I hated about the movie: the music. The music is just awful. I don't mean intrinsically, qua music. But it is SO heavy-handed. We CONSTANTLY have *overbearingly* suspenseful music-- even in scenes which aren't suspenseful at all. This is especially noticeable early in the film, before much of *anything* has happened yet. The music screams at you "Ooooo, this is a scary movie, so be scared!" whether something scary is happening or not. It frankly comes off as amateurish.Oh, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this film triggers a pet-peeve of mine, my least favorite movie device ever: the Pointlessly Cryptic Clue. In this case, it's "redrum". It makes NO sense. The kid has "the shining" (whatever, exactly, it may be) and therefore sees the future. That's why he has any clue at all. OK. So why is his clue *encrypted*???? Why is he yelling "redrum" instead of just "murder"???? Somebody give me some rational explanation of why it's backwards and requires a mirror to make sense of it. Pointlessly Cryptic Clue!It's a shame the movie is so bad, because the basic premise seemed very promising. The notion of being isolated and snowbound in a big old hotel and someone going nuts from cabin fever seemed really interesting. You know what movie *I'd* like to see? I'd love to see this movie if Hitchcock had made it. Then, there'd be no question of supernatural stuff, it would all be purely psychological. Then, the music wouldn't be overbearing from scene one, it would be happy and upbeat, to lull you into thinking that they're going to have a happy time at the beautiful, luxurious hotel, so that the degradation into insanity comes as a surprise, instead of being telegraphed from the outset. Hell, Hitchcock might even have thrown in a delightful twist; for instance, maybe while the father clearly shows signs of strain from cabin fever, it turns out that it's actually the *mother* who has quietly gone nuts and is the one who actually goes homicidal.Anyway, that's the movie I would really have liked to have seen. But I would have settled happily for a faithful, coherent adaptation of the original King book. I think Kubrick picked the wrong week to give up sniffing glue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go read the book instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick was like the proverbial little girl with the curl...when he was good, he was very, very good, and when he was bad, he just *stunk*. This film, sadly, is one of the latter occasions.The book, a dark and frightening masterpiece, is hopelessly gutted and all the characters turned into caricatures by a director apparently obsessed with his own cleverness. The ending is inexplicably altered (one of the lynchpins of the original story being thereby removed), and we see none of the loving but dysfunctional relationship between the parents.Danny, the central character, doesn't have confusing internal visions - instead, he behaves as though he should be seeing a psychiatrist, talking to himself in an "exorcist"-like voice. Dick Halloran, who in the book is a major supporting character, becomes a token cameo. The scariest scenes in the book, so leisurely and haunting, are either removed entirely or changed into cheap and gaudy shocks.Nicholson is his typical over-the-edge self, and is horribly miscast as the conflicted semi-alcoholic father with a history of childhood abuse living who slowly becomes the abuser under the 'guidance' of the hotel. Shelley Duval's performance is flat, and gives no indication that she is slowly beginning to fear her husband.Do yourself a favor and just re-read the book one more time.</fullReview>

This is so bad it's laughably awful. You want horror? Try The Devil's Reject's or The original Nightmare on Elm Street. There those movies have SUSPENSE. This movie is also too damn long. Great, long and boring. The worst a movie can have. I ask again, how is this scary? How?The Last Word: Please make it stop! This is plain awful. A pathetic attempt at horror.

		<shortDescription>A cinematic masterpiece that demands repeated viewing? Absolutely.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite Stanley Kubrick film. Everything is designed to make you feel uneasy while watching it. You didn't like this film? Perfect! Many of us didn't like the film after only seeing it once, either! For Stephen King followers, it departs from the novel in several ways that reveal a much more disturbing portrayal of the Torrance family. For Stanley Kubrick cinephiles, it becomes an existential Road Runner cartoon about the history of violence that is repeated and then ignored throughout mankind's existence. And how a huge, empty maze of a remote hotel makes us feel uncomfortably agoraphobic and lonely. This is a big, sprawling location. Then we also feel cramped and claustrophobic inside of the Torrance family's tiny living quarters.We don't always know where we are. We enter the frozen meat locker with Wendy, Danny, and Dick Hallorann and somehow exit from another door on the opposite side and further down the hall. And now that door's hinges have magically switched sides.Pay very close attention to the dialogue: words are spoken in ways that will sometimes mask their true intent. Think about how Wendy doesn't get to see anything that Jack, or Danny sees. We unfairly judge her based on what we, the audience, have seen. Wouldn't you also be freaked out by what seems to be happening to your husband, and son? I know I would.Others have commented in the past that Jack's descent into madness should have been more subtle and gradual as in the original novel. But contrast this with the later King-produced 1997 TV miniseries where Jack's character becomes downright annoying because he changes so slowly and the characters talk constantly. Not every word or hallucination experience from a novel can be replicated faithfully on the screen. And some people think Kubrick's film is too long already at 144 minutes for the U.S. version. So would you prefer to sit through an even longer King miniseries at 273 minutes? Then by all means, "go check it out!"If a film has anything to do with Stephen King the famed horror writer, then we automatically know that psychotic supernatural behaviors are going to occur. It's what King does. Jack Torrance is NOT the hero or the martyr, he's simply a resourceful imp who can fool almost everyone into believing he is somehow a good person. A good father doesn't dislocate his son's shoulder in a drunken rage, banish his wife from his sight, or withhold sex from her for months. And Jack Torrance did all of these things while insisting on the importance of his "job." No wonder Wendy/Duvall looks like the timid, typical spouse of an abused alcoholic instead of the strong blonde stereotype (De Mornay) who stands up to Jack Torrance in the miniseries and novel. Look at Jack. Jack Nicholson is no trophy husband. He can't even keep a job because of his drinking.This film plays tricks on you, and even on the characters within the film itself. You can say that THE SHINING is "not scary," "too long," "boring," or anything else. But please stick with it. You will never forget what you have seen. Every time that you step into any hotel's hallway, you will think of this film. And what might be hidden in that hotel's past. And what isn't scary to you might be terrifying to me. The novel and the film are two very different interpretations. I personally think that the film is much more disturbing because of what Kubrick NEVER explicitly showed to us. This is a film that requires many viewings because there is so much that is hidden, mirrored, and overlooked that it won't even become clear until you see the ending. And even then, nothing is explained.Kubrick wanted to make a horror film that was different from what we expect. So when you see things that might not look like the typical horror film, remember: that was precisely why he made this film. He wanted to tell a different story in some ways, from what King originally wrote. So expect references to other famous films from that genre, like Danny's "Exorcist"-like wiggling finger when Tony's voice is speaking, that the child actor himself invented. And Hitchcock's "Psycho" with the infamous translucent shower curtain which shows up again in the bathroom of Room 237. Where Jack really decides to sacrifice himself physically to The Overlook Hotel's ghosts.THE SHINING is a perfect example of the psychological concept of "The Uncanny" as Freud once described it. The familiar, which is anything but normal. THE SHINING is a surrealistic nightmare where you never know whose version you are supposed to trust. It's only a simple winter caretaker's job - or is it really something much more diabolical, ritualistic, and predestined? And doomed to repeat itself?There's a lot written here, but it doesn't even begin to describe one of the most complex and visionary films ever created. The more I see THE SHINING, the greater my appreciation for it becomes.We all warmly invite you to stay at The Overlook Hotel. And do come again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like to watch horror movies, and this one is said to be the classic... so I gave it a go last night and I must say that is not bad. I believe I remember when I was a kid that we had this movie on the VHS or somewhere... I remember the twin girls and the lift and that blood pouring into the hall but that's it. After 25 years, these scenes do not seem to trigger any horror. In fact, the twin girls seem kinda out of place - and they seem very old?! Are they even girls? I believe that the roles of all 3 main characters were played out very well, though the woman seem - at some scenes - uncertain ( to me) as if she does not know if she played right or not. Also, I found it a bit silly that when she is chased, from all the places she could go ( including the outside which I am sure is the best solution) she goes into her room ( where, normally, she would be caught!) and locked herself with a child in the bathroom. OK, I know that add to the suspention and all, but those unprobable 'moves' kinda turn me off.All in all, not scared. Maybe in the 80's it was... I give it a rating of 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best viewed as an adaptation, not a translation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched "The Shining" again for the first time in years and I still don't know what to think. The first time I viewed it, 20+ years ago now, I utterly hated it because I literally had just got done reading the book earlier that same day. A few years later, after reading about it in John McCarty's excellent book "The Modern Horror Film," I gave it another shot and found I enjoyed it much more. McCarty says the film is best viewed as an adaptation, not a translation, of King's novel. This is true.There is no denying that the film is magnificently crafted. The cinematography is graceful and beautiful, and the production design is to die for. Every time I see the film I'm still astonished that the entire hotel was built on a soundstage. Where the film suffers is the casting. Jack Nicholson seems like he's on the edge of madness right from the beginning. He's great in the later part of the film once the madness has fully taken hold of his character, but in the first part of the film I can't help but wonder, "Why would anyone in their right mind think it would be a good idea to leave this guy in charge of a hotel in the middle of nowhere for six months?" And Shelley Duval just spends the whole movie seeming like she's on the verge of fainting. Granted, that may not be her fault so much as the script's, which turns her character into a rag doll that is seemingly afraid of everything.Just my $.02.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of author Stephen King not being happy with Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his novel, The Shining (1980) has proved to be a critical and commercial darling.It may not be in the spirit that King wanted, but it's undeniably a skillful piece of film making, a mixture of beauty and terror, of bravura techniques and simple but effective scares. With quality acting performances to match as well. The story unfolds at a deliberately slow pace, claustrophobia oozes from practically every frame, while the narrative smarts brings to bear the ghosts of the human and supernatural kind, all bone chillingly rendered for great effect by the vast spaces - the cold winter grounds outside - of the Overlook Hotel.It's not all perfect, the screenplay is very average, which makes Kubrick's work even more impressive, but with that comes the wave of feeling about style over substance. A churlish gripe? Maybe? But with Jack Nicholson on scenery chewing overdrive and Kubrick pulling the strings, The Shining still represents a highlight in horror. A horror movie that all horror fans should see at least once - and in the best format available as well! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is a shiny example on a horror film easily described as a psychological drama, this film is the best Horror flick i've seen at this point, while the film is a slow film With poor following to the novel, it is a timeless horror masterpiece, the film while creepy and intense isn't scary. Here's why.The film centers around a Haunted isolated hotel where a Family goes to as caretakers for the Winter. While in the hotel, The son of the Family Danny experiences strange visions from past and the future while the dad Jack Torrance, an alcholic writer goes insane and begins murdering everyone in sight, while Jack has the same hallucinations as well, while the mother Wendy Torrance must find out as well for Danny the case why Jack is crazy, With Dick Hallorann helping Danny out, when he Calls out The Shining.The film's atmosphere is dark and fascinating, the opening shot already explains that the Movie is dark and creepy, and it is, but the issue With it, is the lack of scares, this doesn't produce any scary direction whatsoever.The acting is good, but god does Shelley Duvall suck, her voice makes me petrified Beyond belief, hate when that crap happens, Danny's performance is the highlight, he delivers it great With such serious manner. Jack's performance was good, but not great, the script could have been better.The Shining is a great example for a horror flick but the film lacks pacing and scariness and acting could've been better, overall great Movie but has it's flaws, The shower scene is the part that nearly got me, the other scenes not, i saw the 115 minutes Version and saw deleted scenes the other day. Highly recommend for a horror individuals10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For you aficionados who are gasping at my claim that it's "almost a masterpiece", I really only have one complaint about this film...but it's a big one: Shelly Duvall. For me, one of the worst actresses of all time. And as I watched this film...again, in every scene of hers all I could think of was Olive Oyl...although I had TOTALLY FORGOTTEN at the time that she had actually played Olive Oyl in the Robin Williams film. Throughout the film, her expressions of horror were akin to scenes in comedies where a character shows their acting ability by aping various facial expressions (fear, love, affection, etc.). The only more horrific aspect of her performance here was when she was "acting" normal...not an easy thing to do when you have zero personality.Aside from that, this film has elements of brilliance. Chief among them being the iconic performance of Jack Nicholson. By the time I first saw this film, I had already seen Nicholson in "Five Easy Pieces", "Carnal Knowledge", "Chinatown", and "One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest", but it was this film that said to me that Jack Nicholson is something special. An admiration that ultimately grew into my belief that he was the finest actor of his generation. I am aware of the criticisms that Nicholson overacted here, but I think not. I think it was a conscious decision that imprinted Jack Nicholson's acting ability on the consciousness of America. So for Jack Nicholson here, A+.Danny Lloyd, the child actor who left the profession soon after this film, is excellent as the little boy haunted by spirits. And what a joy Scatman Crothers is here as the hotel chef that attempts to save Danny. Not much of a part, but it was nice seeing Barry Nelson as the hotel manager. Similar situation with Anne Jackson as the doctor.The other thing I find iconic about this film are certain visuals that you almost can't forget -- the blood gushing out of the elevator, the "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" scene, and of course, "Here's Johnny!".So, I would probably have given this film a rare "9" were it not for Duvall. Ah well. So be it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family takes on the caretaker job of a haunted hotel - the father develops homicidal psychosis.When the 1980 'Shining' came out, it was considered surprising that Kubrick should take on the horror genre but there are many touches in TS that echo the spine-tingling bits in 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc. And the extended (typical Kubrick) shots following Danny Torrance either on his go-kart or running through the snowbound maze in the hotel grounds are exactly like a 'haunted house' fairground ride. Good stuff.Jack Nicholson nails the nasty psychopath writer, the kid acts well in spite of being overdressed most of the time, and Shelley Duvall only just goes over the top. It's an entertaining haunting/horror yarn. Unfortunately there's a dreadful plot mistake when Jack gets locked in the kitchen storeroom, which would seem to have cooked his goose. The ghosts unlock the door. This completely breaks the logic of the story because either the haunting is all in the family's heads (which is what we are led to believe), or it isn't. For the ghosts to physically intervene in the story when they haven't before and don't afterwards is a complete clunker. If Jack Torrance had 'always been the caretaker', why not give him inside knowledge of the kitchen that allowed his escape? Stupid, stupid plot turn. But a movie you can re-watch, nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ShiningThe best thing about an empty resort is you can combine the tiny shampoo into one normal sized bottle.However, personal hygiene isn't on the mind of the crazed writer in this psychological thriller. Hired to maintain the Overlook Hotel during the winter, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) moves his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his mentally gifted son Danny (Danny Lloyd) into the servants' quarters.While he tries to write, Wendy runs maintenance checks, and Danny rides his big wheel past ghostly twin sisters, a hemorrhaging elevator, and the forbidding room 237.Downstairs, Danny's dad - spurned on by an evil bartender - decides to murder his family with an axe.Based on Stephen King's book, director Stanley Kubrik transforms the novel's intuitive narrative into a subversive and superbly shot shocker. Malicious ghosts aside, what would drive most people crazy, would be abstaining from the mini bar for 5 months.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a watch, but not so recommended for nowadays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was told that this is a great movie, but after I watched it, it didn't seem to be so good. However, I found out that it's the starting of such a kind of horror film that presents in a closed set and it was even shot at 80's, I realized how incredible it is. The main characters seems to be a little affected considering in today's ways. The black man seems to be a significant character, but he dies so suddenly and it's really makes me confessed. It was created from a novel, but seems to be with some modifications which gives the movie another meaning about Indian Americans as far as I understand. But still, first impression is hard to change~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing classic thriller that you could watch time and again. This film is filled with beautiful yet horrifying imagery that you remember well after the film has finished. The film is layered with mysterious occurrences that I sometimes after watching multiple times begin to take on new meaning. The entire thing is brilliantly constructed and amazingly imaginative. It's like your worst nightmare come true. The child was brilliantly casted. To me, he's the creepiest of them all. I especially enjoyed the set design and special effects. Everyone should see this film at least once. It is one of my favorites. And I have not read the book so cannot comment on how the film compares.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson's finest role or close to it.. Shelley duvuall is excellent as well, Scatman Crothers is wonderful as well,, a writer goes for some peace and quite to an exotic winter hotel , to be the caretaker for the winter so he can get plenty of peace writing his new novel,, unbeknownst to him however the previous caretaker had murdered his wife and children. he get's the job,, and is told what has happened at the hotel.. but it doesn't seem to bother him at all.. his son has the ability to "Shine", you will just have to watch the movie it's hard to explain,,, anyways, strange things start happening at the hotel as the snow flies and winter set's in,, cabin fever is striking,, I would say this is in the top 10 or 20 of all horror movies ever made.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson was really drowned in his character.Locations all get limited in a hotel with the beginning of the winter. It's one of the movies that really makes you think about it.It's really involved and the people who don't think about movies they watch call this terrible.The ending scene is really great.With a same rhythm zooming the picture gets close to a photo of a party that makes everything clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror movie ever made???? Yeah, but waaayyyy more than that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stephen King, the greatest writer of all time, never bothered much about the adaptations of his works to the big screen. Not even should it, after the great critical and box office success that was "Carrie" from Brian Palma, King thought that everything was secure in his job. BUT, Stanley Kubrick was already knew for making films that cause scandals and make controversy. King hated the adaptation (so much that he did a series based on the book years later) and the reviews were very mixed, but the audience (I'm part of the audience) LOVED.The story begins when the writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) gets a job offer that involves taking care of a huge hotel during the winter. Jack decides to take his family along for an unforgettable vacation while also working on his next book. Everything seems going well, but a dark ghostly presence changes everything and start's haunting the family chamber by chamber of the immense hotel, causing small attacks on Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) who seems to have strange psychic powers, and Jack start's having disturbing visions that initiates a large development of pure madness.I think Kubrick intention never was to ridicule the work of King, the lack of loyalty was due to the immense work dependence that Kubrick always had. But this just opened place to the extraordinary originality and dark philosophy that Kubrick always given us.As always with Kubrick, the film contains a flawless script and follows with a outstanding narrative from start to finish, and with the horror genre in film is best to wait for dark dialog's with the disturbing soundtrack of John Jacob. And the direction (since "2001") has never been EXCELLENT giving a amazing and truly frightening filmography.Kubrick with this film just created the "scary-house" horror genre, thanks not only to the history, but thanks to the mixture of the splendid performance from Jack Nicholson and Kubrick's dark philosophy. That throughout the film thanks to the excellent narrative and one dark scene in the bathroom, it creates the scary and crazy environment of the 3rd act, and face a insane and unforgettable phrase Nicholson everything ends in another unforgettable masterpiece that Kubrick always knew how to give us. And the final message is that in all of us there is a crazy and murderer side waiting to be released.All I have to say is: "Hi Johnny, but you are seriously not welcome in my bathroom"! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shining is Chilling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course "The Shining" has its decidedly chilling moments ? particularly the appearances of murdered twins, Nicholson's ax-wielding attack on wife Shelley Duvall and a memorable chase through a wintry labyrinth. Unfortunately, it has some glaring problems narratively and with its lead performance that cannot be overlooked. The title of the film is the slang term given to a psychic power possessed by both Danny Lloyd as the son and Scatman Crothers, as a hotel chef. In the King novel, the power was a major player in the story. In the film, both Danny and his power seem an afterthought and the hotel ? which was decidedly malevolent in King's story ? comes across as rather a neutral entity that just houses nasty specters. Danny's primal fear that his father will turn into a monster that will murder he and his mother is oddly muted in the film ? largely because Kubrick treats the characters and their emotional plight as of little consequence and is much more concerned with setting the stage for Nicholson to enact his raving madman performance. Sadly, Nicholson's much-ballyhooed central performance nearly derails the film. At no point does anyone buy him as a caring husband/father who makes a shocking transition into a psycho. Instead, Nicholson plays him from the outset as a creepy nut with pedophile mannerisms to such an extent, that it becomes impossible to believe that anyone would follow him into another room much less into a 3-month isolation with a young child. While Lloyd is largely relegated to prop status speaking in a strange voice and drooling, Nicholson stomps and chomps the scenery sputtering, snarling, and hissing in between inappropriate one-liners. There is no doubt that his madman act is impressive, but it is also one-note and robs his character of any sympathy. Seriously, from frame one there is not one moment where he seems relatively normal and there is no moment where he shows any reluctance in his descent into madness. This film also serves the dubious distinction of marking when Nicholson's performances segued from real acting into caricature until About Schmidt came to the rescue. By contrast, it is not until reflection that one realizes Duvall, as his terrified wife, has delivered the film's best performance and shown him up. Additionally, the final shot of the film, which is apparently supposed to be a surprise, is anything but, indicating that Kubrick and his writers are not overly familiar with horror genres conventions. Yet for all its faults, the atmosphere and lavishness provided by Kubrick is a definite must-see in that few subsequent thrillers have been able to compete with it and he does provide moments they stay with you, even if the end product is not as impressive as some of its parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Stephen King!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the work of Stephen King, what we have here is a classic horror from director Stanley Kubrick that may not please those expecting a slavish adaptation but will certainly please all genre fans.It's all about Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson, in top form and providing some iconic moments), a struggling writer and struggling man who takes his wife and son with him when he gets a job care-taking at the Overlook Hotel during it's off-season. The brooding quiet, the isolation, the fact that his son keeps seeing nasty visions that don't seem to be there - all of these things upset Jack and start to wear away at his soul. This is all encouraged by the hotel itself, a place full of bad vibes, ghosts and inherent evil.In an annoying way, The Shining is one of those movies that has already been dissected to death and while reviewing it you feel you will never have anything worthwhile to add. The cast is okay (while Nicholson is superb and Scatman Crothers does great with his small role Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd are alternately weak and annoying at times), the direction is masterful and the frights are, well, frightening. Often referenced and/or parodied by others there are plenty of plus points to offset the few negatives; THAT dangerous room, the "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" revelation, conversations at the bar, etc.What I will say is what I have said many times before, something that has made some people disagree quite vehemently. A couple of moments aside, it's quite possible to view The Shining as a movie WITHOUT ghosts and simply as a study of descending into madness, an unflinching look at the constant machinations of evil. I am not saying that the movie has to be watched this way, and I certainly do not consciously think of it while watching the film, but I am saying that you can enjoy yet another layer from it if you do view it as such and it makes for an interesting conversation starter.Haunted hotel or not, there's no arguing that it's simply a classic modern horror movie and should remain so for years and years to come.</fullReview>

I truly believe the movie is better than the book. You will love this movie because of the hidden meanings and conspiracies that have made many people think of what does it mean. Jack Nicholson is at his best. A man drives his family to a hotel to take be the caretaker for the winter. What could go wrong?? PLENTY!! Shelly Duvall stars as 'Wendy', Jack's wife. Their son Danny has a special gift. The music to the film is perfect. It's creepy, but it sets the mood very well into the story. This is a MUST SEE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabin Fever Blues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I love about Stanley Kubrick is how he can intensely captivate me like no other director. There is a certain intensity to his movies that is so hypnotic in that it holds my attention so much that I find myself trying not to blink in order to catch every detail. Within every shot, there is a lot of attention to detail and from the films I have seen from Kubrick, he seems very meticulous about the visual details and he is so clever how he can make little things add to that disturbing intensity. These little things make Kubrick's films feel otherworldly and grandiose, which is definitely a bit of how I would describe some details about 'The Shining.' I knew who Kubrick was, but during the time that I first randomly watched 'The Shining' on television as a teenager, I was completely unaware that he actually directed it. All I knew after having watched it for the first time was that I was mesmerized by it. I had a thing for horror flicks, but this was the first horror film that I truly loved and the more I watched it on AMC, the more I discovered more nuances that made the movie even more disturbing. What made me love this movie was the fact that for the first time ever, I was actually analyzing a horror film.It made an impact on me in that it brought out my worst fears, and that would be the paranoid feeling of isolation. Where most horror today only manages to startle, The Shining manages to actually disturb and that to me feels more effective in making me feel a sense of dread, and how Kubrick executes that is astounding. Whether it be imagery that is just straight up odd, or its cold, lonely atmosphere, all these scenes are capable of evoking some type of reaction from anyone who would watch this film. What really resonated with me were the long drawn out scenes of dialogue between the characters and knowing from listening to their tone, that something did not quite feel right and this is executed so well by Kubrick. The decision to film close-ups of the actors' faces added an even greater emotional effect that adds to the disturbing anxiety permeating the film.I don't know what else to say about The Shining, but after watching A Clockwork Orange and 2001, I have come to respect Stanley Kubrick as a director more than ever. He has a style that feels distinct, but at the same time he is versatile in ways I didn't even know of. I wouldn't be able to name my favorite director, but Kubrick is definitely one of the top contenders for that title. Mr. Kubrick not only a great horror film, but one that is memorable in ways that it manages to leave a disturbing impression on you permanently. I will never forget the first time I watched 'The Shining,' and although it probably might not scare me as much the next time I will put this on, I will always be able to enjoy being disturbed by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson's performance is as good as they say. Sorry, just wanted to get that out there. This man is a legend for a reason and, yes he is as good as they say. Stanley Kubrick does a phenomenal job of directing this flick. I give him credit for distancing from the book's plot. It really shows what his interpretation of the novel is and power to him. He made this material iconic and that is all one could ask for. Last, the only drawback this film has is the casting of Shelly Duvall. She was completely miscast for the role, it needed to be with someone who could give a more emotionally stable performance. She seemed like she was having a panic attack in a majority of the scenes that she was in. But that's a minor complaint compared to what a great film this is, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>REDRUM! All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't exactly say why, but up until today I had never seen even any part of this movie. I have it as one of the 9-movie Kubrick DVD set from my public library. I am not a big fan of the horror genre, it just doesn't satisfy my movie-watching tastes, but I mostly enjoyed this one. More for the visuals than for the story. It starts grandly, with an overhead (helicopter) shot of a small car traveling along a secluded road in a mountainous setting. I immediately recognized it as the Going to the Sun road in Glacier National Park, going westlerly along St Mary Lake towards the Continental Divide. Only this opening sequence was shot there, to establish a sense of isolation, of a man making a trip that perhaps he was not prepared to handle.Jack Nicholson is writer Jack Torrance , and he has taken an over-winter job as caretaker of an isolated mountainous lodge that gets snowed in from October through May. Bringing along his wife and young son, he hopes the isolation will allow him proper inspiration and time for his book.Shelley Duvall is his wife Wendy Torrance , and Danny Lloyd is his son, Danny Torrance, perhaps 6. The other key character is veteran Scatman Crothers as Dick Hallorann , the normal chef at the lodge.The title comes from a reference that "shining" is a psychic ability that allows people to communicate telepathically, and even a building, like the old lodge, can "shine." This is what causes Jack to gradually spiral down into a form of madness, causing him to threaten his wife and son with harm or death. And "seeing" parties of long-dead hotel guests.Ultimately I found it to be a rather empty thriller, but I really enjoy Kubrick's sense of style, and the way he framed scenes cinematographically. Nicholson is good, but his character is somewhat the same but an expansion of what he plays in movies such as "Five Easy Pieces" and "One Flew Over."SPOILERS: In the end Wendy, fearful of Jack, gets a baseball bat, and defending herself whacks him on the head. He tumbles down stairs, she drags him into a food storage area, locking him in. He does get out but chasing his son in the snow gets lost in the huge maze outside, and freezes to death while Wendy and Danny take the snow vehicle to safety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Boy?you read my thoughts! You've got the Shinning," says Groundskeeper Willy."You mean: 'Shining,'" replies Bart Simpson."Shh! You want to get sued?" answers Groundskeeper Willy.That was 1994. The Simpsons came out with their fifth of twenty-third "Treehouse of Horror" specials. The year, now, is 2013. To this day. I've never forgotten that quote and I remember hearing it live as the fifth "Treehouse of Horror" special aired. Whenever The Shining is brought up in my presence, or whenever I start a conversation about it, I quote those lines. And yes, with the Scottish accent for Willy and never calling the movie by any other name other than "The Shinning."For those as nostalgic as me, it gathers a few laughs. Mostly from myself. But?I sincerely digress. I'm here to talk about The (real) Shining. And, sadly, I cannot accomplish this without spoilers. So, you are warned.** If You Have Not Seen The Shining, or even The Shinning, then just know this: I highly recommend this movie. Watch it now. Don't wait, call out sick and get a copy. Watch it and then continue with my review. Press stop now. **Whew. I truly believe I could write a novel on how fantastic, how awesome, how truly incredible this masterpiece is. Maybe, one day I will, but for now, I will give you my basic, run-of-the-Thesar review.First, let me start off (again?) with how pleased I am that I bought this on BluRay. I had originally planned on it by setting aside April 2013 as the month to re-watch and finally review a bunch of older movies from my past and I included The Shining. You see, this was one of my first horror movies I ever saw as a kid. And I distinctly remember that I was disappointed because, and yeah, these are my words: "Only two people died. And, one of them was the killer!"Moving right along, the last time I saw this, after several more viewings, was about 1994, I estimate. So we're talking 19 years since I last saw this and just about the same time that Simpsons episode aired. And back then, I was sadly, and unfortunately influenced by who I saw it with who said: "It's one of those movies (that's so boring) that if you fast-forwarded a bit, you'd be in the same place as you were when you initially hit 'fast-forward.'" Due to my typical disdain for "slow-moving" pictures, I (now, regrettably) believed him.Fast-forward, once again, to 2013 and I heard about a documentary called: Room 237. I wanted to watch that, but since it's been about 19 years since I've seen the original, why not purchase it on BluRay and revisit the classic. My eyes opened so wide during this viewing, I didn't know if they close.Any small infraction of my poor feelings about this movie was wiped clean. This is?a?near PERFECT MOVIE. Mood, cinematography, atmosphere, dialogue, suspense, score, acting, originality, fear?it's all here. Generally, I am weary of very long movies, especially long ones that take?it?slow. But, this movie never, ever, felt slow. Thanks to Director Kubrick, he moved the film along with rich dialogue, excellent scenes of the ever-so isolated Colorado hotel or score. He accomplished what Hitchcock set out to do and what M. Night Shyamalan could never touch.Now, there will be some, or possibly, many, who will compare it to the equally masterful book it's based on. I have read that incredible book, and loved every page of it and this movie, well, took themes, characters and settings, but overall, it was fairly far off target. The nice thing about judging a project on its own merit is that you can enjoy both and be honest about it. Not to mention, now you get two alternative universes to enjoy. Much like the original Star Trek legendary films and series and the updated J.J. Abrams vision. So, I like what direction Kubrick took with this story.I also love what Jack Nicolson did to the role of Jack Torrance. And both Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd were also very good, as was Scatman Crothers.Already "off" Jack takes a job as the caretaker of the gorgeous Colorado hotel for the off-season winter and brings his "special" son and wife in tow. Jack's excited because the job requires little maintenance and care, and he gets to finish the novel he quit his teaching job for. Only?the isolation/cabin fever is starting to get Jackie boy a little, well, more tense.Little by little, Jack gets more stressed and agitated. More and more that "special" son of his has visions of past guests who met unfortunate ends there, to say the least. And Mom, well, she's growing further and further concerned.See? The overall tension builds as the minutes of the film passes for all parties involved. And as more is revealed around them, the very worse things get for the Torrance's.Hands down, one of the most memorable and scariest movie scenes of my whole life was when (now-GONE) Jack breaks into the bathroom to "teach" his wife a lesson, or final one, at least. I don't recall now, but I believe I couldn't get that image of the axe through the door, or Wendy Torrance striking back, out of my head and possibly dreams for many years. It's still enormously effective today.I literally could dissect almost every chapter on the disc and fill up volumes of my own chapters. This should be taught in film school. Each scene, each set, each line, each facial expression or, lack thereof, were all so masterfully crafted, it's good that it "appears slow" (even when it's not) so we can sit back, absorb and understand how a real film should be made.Would I recommend this? Well, you don't need the shinning to figure out if I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shining brightly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With only a couple of caveats, it's entirely justified that Kubrick's "The Shining" be lauded as one of the most frightening horror films ever made. More on those deterrents later, but there's no doubt the film is a technical masterpiece in its use of sets, lighting, colour and sound to create an increasingly more terrifying atmosphere as the film reaches its conclusion.What Kubrick does brilliantly is subvert the stereotypes of the horror genre, so that instead of a darkened claustrophobic atmosphere, he gives us a vast brightly lit hotel for the Torrance family to be moved around in while his ghosts aren't shadowy phantoms but vividly drawn presences.Only at key moments does Kubrick stop the constant movement of front and back-tracking camera-shots, notably in depicting Nicholson's Torrance character's conversion to madness and his grisly death by exposure to the snow overnight. Otherwise, we get the wonderful device of the steadicam following young Danny's buggy as it wheels around the hotel corridor, the remarkable shot of the sea of blood pouring from the elevators, the eerie lighting used in the chase sequence in the maze, but the best shot is when Nichoson gazes down at a model of the house maze which cuts to a an extreme long-shot of his wife (played by Shelley Duvall) and son, lost in the real-life maze.It certainly gripped me from the start but there were odd scenes which defied explanation, such as the pin-up pictures of black women in Scatman Crothers' character's home, Nicholson miraculously escaping from a locked room after conversing with a "ghost" and Duvall's ever stranger visions as she escapes out of the hotel near the end.I must say though that I do agree with the original writer Stephen King's opinion of the casting of the leads. I've never been a fan of over-actor Jack Nicholson (his "Here's Johnny" scene, far from being terrifying strikes me as hilariously over the top) while Shelley Duvall as either wife or mother seems like an even bigger mis-casting, which is an understatement compared to the usage of Scatman Crothers as another "shiner" who makes an unlikely attempt to save the day, or should that be night.For all that though, "The Shining" is a bravura work, injecting new life into an old genre, thoroughly out DePalma-ing DePalma along the way. Oh, and don't watch alone as I mistakenly did tonight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining ? A classic suspense with incredible atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is by now a classic, and it has the well deserved title of master piece. Stanley Kubrick came up with the a jewel, no less.The strong point of the movie, and one of Kubrick's best talent, is the atmosphere. You get sucked into it by the time the couple settle in as the guardians of the lodge.The young boy really is the meat to the horror of it all, he's the one to give you the chills, helped with some very smart editing and a deeply persuasive soundtrack. The music is great. Jack Nicholson on the other hand is the one to make us afraid with his excellently well played psychotic behavior. Shelley Duvall is the born victim, excusing her husband, bending to his will, doing his job, mostly clumsy, rather clingy, a bit clueless... it's all in her acting, and it's spot on.The film is obviously getting old, but you really rarely take stock of it, like the awkward generic, and a few lousy sound pickups in the beginning. I'll relegate the general stiffness of the introduction, until they are alone at the hotel, as building up the atmosphere.Overall, if you haven't seen it yet, you should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Jack Nicholson looks exactly like my mother's ex boyfriend. This film had nothing I had ever seen before. Though having seen some of Kubrick's work before, I could not have imagined his innovative use of symmetry and mirror work to shine through. Especially in a horror; saying this, I am part of a generation who's grown up on countless Scream and Final Destination sequels which have, lets face it, as much creativity as a hair brush. Throughout the film, it is revealed that Kubrick is the master of cinematography. As a Film student, I now find it hard to not analyze a film whilst watching it. Yet the sheer amount of incredible camera work overwhelmed me into sheer submission and horror bliss as the film worked itself into my head. Jack Nicholson. Is there anymore to say? In this film, Nicholson gives the horror performance of the 20th century. In complete harmony with the script, Nicholson delivers such fantastic lines as "Here's Johnny!" and "Wendy, give me the bat" With such an over-the-top performance, it almost relates to an earlier period of horror, Nosferatu and German Expressionism. The film opens with an overwhelming shot of the surroundings giving a foreboding sense of the environment around. Throughout the picture, a further use of the subliminal helps us as the spectator foreshadow events to come i.e. the use of of a back and red teddy bear on the floor at the place in which Crothers is killed, the use of repetitive banging noises in the hallway with the tennis ball to foreshadow the Axe murder attempt. Upon multiple viewings of this film, multiple interpretations come to mind, and I think this is the genius of Kubrick's work. All in all I gave this film 9/10 for its stunning appearance, fantastic filmography and exceptional performancesMax ChurchCo-Founder of Pukka Pride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror film of all time? Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, yes -- one of the best at least, and certainly the most affecting, suspenseful movie since "Psycho." Kubrick takes a run-of-the-mill Gothic horror story and infuses it with so many overtones, undertones and mind games that it's practically unrecognizable from Stephen King's book (which I have read, thank you, and is badly overwritten to the point of unreadability).Much has been written about various subtexts contained in "The Shining," including Native Americans, child abuse, mirroring and subliminal messaging. A great resource is Rob Ager's Collative Learning website. I'm not sure I buy all of Ager's theories, but they are thought-provoking and well worth the time of anyone interested in this or Kubrick's other films. This much is certain: Kubrick had much more in mind when making this film than just a guy who goes crazy one winter and tries to kill his family (one synopsis from SK himself).Take, for example, the compression of time and space. The cue cards take us from months to days, then hours, slowly ratcheting up our anticipation of some inevitable horror. Kubrick also makes excellent use (as always) of sound, as when Danny tours the Overlook in his Big Wheel, which moves from carpet, to wood floor, to carpet, to floor, in a rhythm which simulates a heartbeat. The scene in which Danny encounters the Grady girls at the end of the hallway imploring him to "come play with us" is simply the scariest damn scene in all of cinema; even after dozens of viewings, that scene makes my skin crawl.There are elements to "The Shining" that I admit I still don't understand. Why does Mr. Grady have two different first names? What was the guy in the bear suit doing? Why was this shining ability only good enough to bring Halloran to the Overlook, but not foresee Jack's axe? Most perplexing to me -- if relatively trivial -- is the function of Bill, who is not only present in several scenes but in the center of the frame? He has little to say, let alone do, in any of the scenes, leaving the viewer (this one at least) to wonder why he's in the movie at all.Nicholson's performance has been widely criticized as "over the top" and worse, yet I find it not only perfectly suited to the Jack Torrance character, but right up there with anything he's ever done. Shelley Duval went through hell making the picture (for evidence see the making-of doc by Kubrick's daughter on the DVD), but she is quite good. The scene where she's reading Jack's "all work and no play" pages, growing ever more distraught, is another highlight.As with all Kubrick films, "The Shining" must be seen several times to be fully appreciated. I first thought it was just a really good horror film, but have come to appreciate it as a great film, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The twins, Johnny and room 237! It must be The Shining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"THE SHINING" is a 1980 horror-thriller-suspense film directed by Stanley Kubrick and written by Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson. The story follows a man, his son and wife as they become the winter caretakers of an isolated hotel where Danny, the son, sees disturbing visions of the hotel's past using a telepathic gift known as "The Shining". The father, Jack Torrance, is underway in a writing project when he slowly slips into insanity as a result of cabin fever and former guests of the hotel's ghosts. After being convinced by a waiter's ghost to "correct" the family, Jack goes completely insane. The only thing that can save Danny and his mother is "The Shining".The direction and cinematography of this film is absolutely beautiful and it really adds to the creepy and scary atmosphere of the film. The music, dear god it freaks me out every time I watch it! The ending with Jack and Danny running through the hedge maze and that music are almost unterrifying without that music. The writing of this film is also equally amazing.All in all, it's a great film and is worth many rewatchings. Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good if you haven't read the book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Spoilers...OK for me this is an odd one. Firstly I should say that I loved the book and the book scared me rigid. The movie, while based on the book, ignores several (some might consider important) aspects of Mr King's masterpiece.So having watched the movie I felt a little disappointed at the changes in story line, especially the failure of Jack to be slowly seduced into madness, for me it all happened a bit to quickly and easily. There were none of the scenes of him alone in the boiler room discovering the troubled history of the hotel. In the book stuff starts happening to Jack before the others suspect anything to be wrong and he travels a gradual path towards insanity. The topiary animals in particular was a scene conspicuous by it's absence. Apparently it was left out due to SFX budget restrictions, but how hard would it have been to have some hedge animals appearing closer to him every time he looked round? Some clever camera work and appropriate music and it could have worked well. A chilling scene from the book lost in the film.I also didn't find it particularly scary, however I think this is because having read the book I kind of knew most of what was coming and how things were likely to turn out.A final couple of negatives - Shelly Duval's acting in the early stages of the film was very wooden and unbelievable, and even later in the film you wonder if she's just reading the lines, her reactions at times are pathetic and unrealistic too (I mean the waving of the baseball bat at him on the staircase - was she trying to hit him or swat a fly?) but to be fair her performance in the bathroom as Jack axes his way through was terrific. The other negative for me - the much lauded musical score grated with me and sounded hideously dated. (Yes I know the film is over 30 years old but some music is timeless, this sounds like somebody experimenting with his new synthesiser).So why the high score you may ask? Well I have to be fair. Suppose I hadn't read the book? The story remains classic, Jack Nicholson's performance is superb, the cinematography is amazing and there is genuine tension and suspense. I remember watching the film many years ago (before I read the book) and I remember it affecting me considerably. There is no doubt that it IS a very scary film, I had just been desensitised by knowing the story (nothing is ever as scary the second time around) And it was the psychological stuff that was especially scary too, not the traditional baddie jumping out of a cupboard kind of scary - the scene where Wendy discovers Jack's 'work' by the typewriter for example was utterly chilling.So overall a thumbs up. An excellent film, flawed certainly (especially if you know the original story) but nonetheless a very good watch.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potential for greatness ruined by the "auteur" mindset?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's mostly how I view this film. First off, it's too long, meaning it didn't need to be this long. There have been many interpretations of the symbolism and inconsistencies in the film but the major problem for me is the psychic ability element. All three family members see ghosts, so why is there a need for psychic ability? How does that contribute anything, other than to be make us have to suspend more disbelief that is required? Thus, there is clearly a "lack of economy"' here.This is exacerbated by being told that another family had been in a similar position in the recent past and was murdered by the father/husband. Again, why is this important? It could be, if we are to think that ghosts were responsible, but then are we supposed to believe that one member of that family had psychic ability too? Instead, psychic ability should have been omitted entirely from the film, and then hearing about the previous caretaker family would "play better," because we can believe, in the context of a film at least, that ghosts were responsible.Or, we could have the child's psychic ability being the portal to the ghost world at the hotel (with no need for Hallorann's psychic ability, which just makes things less believable). Then we should not be told of a previous caretaker who killed his family. Instead, this film possessed a bit of a "let's throw it all at the wall and see what sticks" quality to it, which is it's major flaw, IMO. Towards the end, one is thinking, are extraterrestrial aliens going to make an appearance soon? How about "bigfoot?" I'll bet he's a little jealous by now!What does this film do very well? The repeating maze theme is excellent, compelling the viewer to ask what the point of it is. The ghost theme works, and in fact is two ghost stories rather than one. The "whites" of the early 1920s are trapped in a kind of purgatory, where they essentially dance on the graves of native Americans. They still have their racist (and other nasty) attitudes, and are stuck in that maze of evil until they are presumably finally relegated to Hell, where they belong.In the meantime, people like Jack are sucked into their world, perhaps aided by alcoholism in his case. For me it was a case of deincarnation (my term, AFAIK), and his frozen body shows what happens to those who allow others to tell them how to think; they no longer grow and get stuck in past notions that have been rejected by history, so to speak. So, there is a bit of clutter in the middle of this film that could (and should IMO) have been omitted, but overall it was an excellent idea for a "ghost story," with appropriate symbolism (for the most part), cinematography, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There ain't nothing in Room 237 !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Torrance (Nicholson) takes on the job as winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, as he wants to use the time to write a book. His wife and son Wendy and Danny are also part of the package, and will also stay at the hotel with him. There are a few tantalising facts thrown at us both before and after the Torrance's arrive, and are ultimately left alone at the Overlook. Firstly, in the interview for the job with the Hotel Manager Mr Ullman, Ullman feels it necessary to warn Torrance that some years before, at the beginning of the 70's a previous winter caretaker had lost his mind, and murdered his wife and two daughters. Torrance, laughs this off, cheerily telling Ullman that isolation and quiet is what he's looking for, and probably sealing the deal and getting the job with his well mannered and charming response. The second is that Danny is not a "normal" little boy. He internalises a lot, and has a special "friend" named Tony who lives in his mouth and shows him visions. This is The Shining of the title, an ability to see things that no one else can see. Unfortunately for Danny these visions are without any frame of reference, definition and vague to the point of frustration. All he knows (and we know because we see the visions along with him) is that they are disturbing, foreboding and scare him half to death. Another fact, which may go some way to explaining why Danny is as he is, is that we are made aware that Jack is a recovering alcoholic, who although hasn't touched the hard stuff for five months, is still trying to work off the debt with Wendy of having done semi-serious harm to Danny. Apparently Danny knocked over one of Jack's half written manuscripts, dozens of pages of carefully drafted work all over the floor, and in a fit of anger, Jack grabbed the boy a fraction too hard and broke his arm. Jack, we find out is angry that he did it, and even angrier that Wendy can't forgive him for it, or at least doesn't appear to have yet. Then, the Torrance's are left alone in the Overlook, and the film kicks into a higher gear. The sheer space available to the Torrance family is overpowering, and a building such as a hotel which is designed to be filled with people, is an entirely different proposition when it is completely empty, and there is no sound whatsoever, except the tip tap of Jack's typewriter as he gets stuck into his book. Can we really not have been aware of the precariousness of the situation ? We suddenly are, and it is uncomfortable. Jack's irritation, while almost certainly derived from his inability to come up with a good storyline, is being massaged and manipulated by the Overlook itself. Whether the Overlook itself is inherently evil, or whether some evil force dwells within it seems irrelevant at this point, and it is not long (one more confrontation with Wendy) before Jack's mind is hopelessly lost. There are many chilling scenes in the movie, and Kubrick is indeed a master at turning the Overlook into a very sinister place indeed. There are hundreds of empty rooms, and the building itself is very old, with a dubious history. What have these walls seen ? When inevitably Danny find his way to room 237 and then turns up shocked into silence displaying wounds on his arms Wendy assumes these can only have been inflicted by Jack, because the hotel is empty right? Depends entirely on your definition of empty. The scenes where Jack speaks to Lloyd and Grady are masterpieces of understated film making. It has been posed that Jack is simply talking to himself and these apparitions are simply manifestations of his damaged mind, but I prefer to think that these are simply tools that the Overlook is using to manipulate his already damaged psyche. The hotel, the very building itself, deep in its wood and brick has a hunger, and it wants Torrance and his family. So we in the audience already understand the nature of the danger that Wendy and Danny are in, but they do not. A second visit to the lobby, finds Jack's manuscript lying neatly on the table, and while we understand that Wendy must read it, we know there will be implications if she does. In a scene of unadulterated ratcheting freewheeling terror does she realise that her husband is lost to her forever. There must be 1000 pages of typed manuscript on the desk next to the typewriter, and every single line reads "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". It is written with the mechanical, thundering repetitive ferocity of a man whose mind has snapped. Suddenly realising she and her child are alone with a madman, Jack appears behind her. Some of the remaining scenes in the movie are even more terrifying as Jack loses all pretence of sanity, and sets about "correcting" his errant family, ably assisted by the hotel itself, spurring a host of ghostly apparitions, including an entire ballroom dance scene circa 1920's, and even when Wendy does manage to lay Jack low and lock him in the huge hotel's food locker, the ever malicious yet helpful apparition Grady turns up to free him so he can continue on his mission. Kubrick plays with the themes of isolation and claustrophobia as a virtuoso plays the violin. Sure there are hundreds of rooms and corridors and kitchens and basements for Wendy and Danny to hide in, but where can they really go ? Jack smashes the radio. More tension. Jack rips the engine out of the snowmobile, More tension. The use of the Steadicam creates an atmosphere of something always behind you, creeping, waiting, biding its time. I recommend this film to all horror fans although surely most people have seen this terrific movie by now ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining has been rated as one of the best horror flicks of its time and a Stanley Kubrick classic. It was a first of its type horror/mystery movie and brought cinematic novelty for the audience of 1980.Though I do believe its an excellent work of cinema, but I would not rate it as Mr.Kubrick's best, or comparable to classics from his stable, like "A Clockwork Orange" or "full metal jacket".That does not go to say that The Shining did not have its moments of brilliance. The aspects of this movie which I appreciate are the plot (family in a haunted hotel), cinematography, background score, sound editing, direction &amp; Jack Nicholson's maniac portrayal of the central character.Stephen king had chosen a perfect plot for his novel - isolated hotel, dark winter, no one to help, just the caretakers to deal with the supernatural and of course, with themselves. Gives me the shivers. The story and direction had a lot of grip and flow up to the point where Jack started to lose his mind (had a nightmare) - the build up was really nice. I have come to realize that the secret to a good mystery movie is if it continues to unravel bit by bit, but never giving the viewer the whole story, or the climax. As I said, the build up to the climax is critical. If it has a shocking end, all the more better. The shining had many such moments in the first half - psychic son, hotel with a murder history, a busy hotel suddenly shown as a big empty mansion, room 237 conversation between the cook and Danny, the twin girls being seen a couple of times and maybe a few more. This build-up was ably aided by haunting music &amp; good camera-work. But somewhere the plot was lost. Some of the scenes were quite flimsy &amp; cheesy for an audience like me - like the wave of blood coming from the lift and flowing across the lobby. Or the old lady with boils (or just bad skin) which Jack tried to kiss. Or Jack's multiple encounter with imaginary people, and maybe the real ghost of Delbert Grady. Such scenes actually led to more bitterness than pounding heartbeats. But nonetheless, Mr.Kubrick was successful in maintaining the plot based madness and continued it till the end. Maybe I wanted to get more chills.The background score, sound editing and the cinematography deserve a special mention. The background music was haunting for sure and added that extra dark-wintery feeling to the already freezing winter.The same played from the opening shot of car traveling in the mountains - beautiful scenery, haunting music. Did set the mood. The sound editing was fabulous. Its not like the clichéd tricks of sudden loud noises, but a potent combination of silence and background sound. The cinematography was classic horror style. Camera-work had this quality of making the viewer expect that there is something around the corner, which the camera will see at the same time as the character in the scene. It builds up the feeling of the "unexpected"and magnifies the shock factor. Its a feeling which we all are familiar with when we close our eyes while watching a horror flick to avoid the shock. I know I did it a couple of times! The awesome co-ordination of sound editing and cinematography could be seen in a scene where the kid is riding his tri-cycle in empty corridors of the hotel - nice zippy work with just the background noise of tyres running on the wooden floor (and carpet) and camera behind the kid. Really thought the twins were just around the corner!All the above needed a central character for anchoring - Mr.Nicholson obliged. He is an artist who uses his face and various features in a brilliant manner. His expressive eyes, broad smile, ever moving eyebrows, deep crackling voice - all tools for a top class entertainer like Mr.Nicholson. He displayed cold frustration as effectively as outrageous anger. Portrayal of a frustrated madmen who slowly looses his mind was very detailed and must have resulted from a lot of homework.All in all, The shining had a lot of things which went right. For 1980, Mr.Kubrick did deliver a never-seen-before cinematic horror experience. But maybe having seen current horror flicks like "The Ring" and "The Grudge", I was expecting more chills. At the time of this review, IMDb rates The shining @ 8.5. I rate this as 7.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something obviously falls out when you're watching the movie on a 60" high def. It looks like a circular object connected to a lump. They say Kubrick spent months perfecting that scene, so I mean it can't just be like a prop discrepancy? This scene was heavily planned and Kubrick was obsessed with aesthetic symbology. My theory is that the elevators represent Danny's mouth and him screaming was the elevator doors opening and Tony spilling out. All the bloodshed from melanin-eating white people killing native indians and black people was all symbolic for the hotel being America and the history loops back in the destiny of evil white men. White men's novel is the destiny he writes for himself and that destiny is rage, cannibalism and psychic vampirism. "all work and no play (murder) makes jack a dull boy".... even when they first showed him throwing a ball at a wall that had a native painting of Indian deities that look a lot like the dead twins in blue outfits; the scene first started off with the blank typewriter. Him throwing the ball was symbolic for throwing or chopping an axe. hence the axe in the hallway scene of the dead twins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson takes on horror in this adaption of Stephen King's 1977 novel "The Shining" directed by Stanley Kubrick. Nicholson plays recovering alcoholic writer Jack Torrance who travels with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall,) and son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), to a Colorado hotel for the winter. While there strange events start occurring and terror soon erupts. The film is a typical Kubrick one with weird elements and a quirky cast. This one is not one of my favorite King films with the a pretty mediocre cast. Nicholson is chilling at times, but spends more time with booze. Duvall is a weak female lead and some call her whiny and the kid doesn't do much at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Mix of Horror and Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I began to watch this, I expected a overrated mediocre film that was supported only by Jack Nicholson's performance. I was extremely happy when I found out that I was wrong. I was stunned by triumphant directing and storytelling. Kubrick manages to create a believable descent into madness while concentrating on all characters and building plot. He succeeds in exploiting all possibilities of the hotel from nice outlook to interesting history. The hotel looks cozy and menacing at the same time and later on there is also a supernatural aspect that adds to film's horror. Atmosphere in this film is one of the greatest ever achieved in film. You can feel the pressure and terror at every moment. This is achieved by art direction, music, directing and acting. Every aspect supports each other and creates atmosphere so intense that you feel madness, anxiety and fear all at the same moment. Even in the beginning you feel the unease in the air. That said first 20 minutes were the weakest part of the film because they took too long and practically were not even necessary. It just tells the basic idea of the film that we all would have realized even without the beginning.Then there's the biggest fault in the film: The Shining. What was the point with it? The fact that the kid has telepathic gift was truly waste of time. It didn't do any good yet the film spent at least 30 minutes to tell us about it. Other bad thing was the characters. Every one of them was annoying. Jack was very cold all the time, Wendy just cried for everything and Danny wasn't much of a character.Because of annoying characters the horror wear off a bit but the ending managed to stay exciting and interesting nonetheless. (I can't say I was really scared in any moment). Drama was brought to the film by the anguish of Wendy and the ending.The Shining manages to overcome it's flaws by it's atmosphere and is truly one of 80's best films. It's far from perfect but if you wish to see psychological and intense film The Shining is perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Shining' (1980)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most epic and extraordinary films in the history of horror films - and all of cinema in general - 'The Shining' will be forever rooted into the subconscious minds of people all over the world, including myself, images burned into the mind: Jack Nicholson's face as he chops down the door with an axe, Shelley DuVall's terrified screaming face, the two little girls standing in the hall as Danny Boyle rides his big wheel around the hotel.Stanley Kubrick's most horrifying presentation builds on mounting tension and an overall growing sense of dread that continues for the entire two and a half hours of movie up until the very end. The haunting soundtrack is at times just as terrifying as the images on the screen, and the film's effective camera-work are legendary. Scatman Crothers is also highly notable as Dick Hallorann, as is Joe Turkel as Lloyd The Bartender.I haven't read Stephen King's original novel yet, but I am aware that he was disappointed in Kubrick's interpretation of his work. Although, from watching his 2007 television remake, I can probably say that I am a bigger fan of the maze rather than the animals made from the bushes. A bit lengthy, but well worth it in the end. And by the film's third act, the viewer will have no choice but to be transfixed and mesmerized by the horror unfolding on screen every time.THE SHINING -----10/10.</fullReview>

I can remember the feeling of that night which was in the middle of 1990. our generation didn't have a chance to watch it in time but the movie is always fresh and scary. Of course it was some censored scene on that version but we enjoyed it so much. after that most of us found the completed Video CD edition of the film and watched the whole movie. some years after that, they showed it through our national TV and because the dubbing system in Iran is well graded, they dubbed it for us. we saw the movie again and this time Jack Nicholson was speaking Farsi. his dubber's name is Naser Tahmasb and he treated just like Nicholson which all of us felt that it is Nicholson who is talking in Farsi. very good film that would be in your mind after years...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 48Here's the shortest horror story ever: the last man on Earth is alone in a room when he hears a knock on the door. That one sentence provokes so much thought: why is he the last man, what happened to everyone else? What's on the other side of the door? But the most important question raised is: is there something actually there, or was the knocking in his head? That sums up The Shining. A fear of the unknown, the uncertainty in seeing what you do, and having your mind involuntarily the think of terrible things happening offscreen at the Overlook Hotel.The Shining is the best horror film of all time, better than The Thing, Alien, or The Exorcist.This surprisingly straightforward Kubrick tale focuses not a message, but plot, atmosphere and theme. The themes here are isolation and madness. A family has to look after a mountaintop resort alone for 6 months. We're told of the hotel's sinister past and we learn of Tony early, both ominous, planting the seeds of terror laced throughout the film. The great success of the opening act is that plot points and setting are explained, making us familiar without seeming blatantly expository: this works perfectly. We learn as Jack learns.Speaking of Jack, he rules. Every line he says is an instant classic ("Cozy!") due to Nicholson's sarcastic, biting, sinister voice and look. He's such an amazing actor. And we can tell he's a little off right from the start, setting him apart from other 'descent' stories featuring white knights. Lots can be inferred about his character: we learn he hasn't had a drink in 5 months, despite the "pivotal accident" being 3 years ago. I think my understanding and sympathy for Jack, initially at least, is because I know a Jack Torrence, so you might not be so caring for him. The IMDb FAQ may say his alcoholism isn't a factor in the film, but from his mannerisms and attitude, I can tell you that it is.Other than Jack the whole cast is superb. Wendy (Shelley Duvall) is woefully meek and vulnerable. Big eyed and likable, unlike her husband. I also know a Wendy: these are real characters. Danny is an exceptional character, really well acted, one of the best child performances. Hallorann, Lloyd and Grady (who really amps up the creepy and is possibly the only actor to work with Kubrick on 3 films) round out the impeccable support.Of a good horror film needs to be scary, and I deem The Shining the best. There's no cheap scares with loud bangs. There's no real "shock" horror, only true eeriness and fear that chills right to your bones. The fantastic music that accompanies the film really adds to the horror, especially the cranking music in late scenes. The horror feels believable because there's nothing computer generated and everything is realistic looking. This makes the line between psychological and supernatural blurry, the key to the whole film. The uncertainty lets your mind wander and create genuine fear. Sure, there's some gore and the most horrifying nudity ever, but most of it is relevant to the story. There are some unexplained elements though, like the "bear room".I haven't read the book but I know that the film does leave out several aspects and changes others. The goal of a horror film is to scare the audience, and the Shining scares, creeps and shocks more than any other horror film I've seen. But it also has an excellent story, a haunting atmosphere and amazing acting to compliment these scares. Another masterpiece. 9.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining: A show of mental terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, a film based upon a Stephen King novel, is a wickedly terrifying film set in an isolated hotel in Colorado. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) agrees to become the caretaker at the Overlook Hotel over the winter. Jack's desire to become a novelist is part of the driving force for his decision to take the job. In the need of some quite time, Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd) make the long winding trip to Colorado. There is a hauntingly disturbing history that comes with this hotel. One piece of this history is in regards to a previous caretaker, Delbert Grady (Philip Stone), that brutally murdered his wife and two daughters with an ax. Grady subsequently takes his own life with a shotgun. Jack's son Danny, as we see in the beginning before it is known if Jack has accepted the job, is reluctant to go to the hotel. Danny has a psychological gift known as "the shining" that resonates within his imaginary friend Tony. This gift allows him to see visions of what has happened in the past or what will come to pass. The film builds upon his ability and Jack's, as the Torrance family's stay becomes one of physical and psychological terror and fear.Effectively used throughout the film are segment cuts. This technique utilized in the editorial process enables a compression and expansion of time. Each segment is shown as a black screen with white lettering and all capital letters. The body of the film takes place after the first month of the Torrance family's stay at the hotel. By utilizing jump cuts as well as flash cuts at various speeds throughout the remainder of the film time between segments, although shorter in length, seems to stretch beyond realistic boundaries. The drastic difference in the segment labels adds to the grandeur of the Overlook Hotel and the feeling of isolation that is dramatically apparent throughout the film. The audience receives its first inclination of Jack's slow loss of psychological coherence as he stands over the model of the large, menacing hedge labyrinth. An uncanny smile comes across Jack's face as he gazes into the maze and the scene slowly transitions to an aerial view of Wendy and Danny running through the actual maze outside the hotel. The carryover, of the maze from one scene to the next, shows that there is an unnatural evil looming in Jack's mind. In conjunction with the scene cuts and transitions, music adds to the intensity, suspense and terror. The high toned, almost screeching, sound of the music is similar in reaction to that of nails on a chalkboard. The sound makes you cringe. The cringe feel in the film is dramatically effective in terms of association. This music is initially used to alert you to the onset of visions experienced by Danny. The progression of Jack's loss of sanity brings out increased use of this music. The new association of music to film gives you the sense that things are only becoming worse than initially portrayed. As we witness Jack's evolution to madness, we find that he too, like Danny, may have "the shining". Jack begins to have visions of events that took place in the past at the Overlook Hotel. One such scene is of a party in the Gold Ballroom where Jack meets Grady and reaches the final stage of his insanity. Another scene is in room 237 where Danny is supposedly attacked by a woman in the bathtub. Jack makes his way to the room and discovers a woman that is much to his delight. As the scene continues, the woman transforms to an older woman that is depicted as having rotting flesh and most likely died in that bathtub. A striking similarity to this film is that of M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense. We get the sense in both these films that the obvious focus for special abilities is on the child character. As both films and characters grow we see that it is not only the apparent character(s) that have this ability, but that multiple characters have these abilities as well.It has been many years since I've sat down to watch The Shining from start to finish and thought it was probably time to do so again. I remember how I felt watching this film the first couple of times, jumping at every turn, and not much has changed. The beauty of this film is that it makes you really think about the situation. What would you do in that situation? Do you think you are a person that could handle that type of isolation? Would things have turned out differently if Jack was not aware of the hotel's history? Are Danny's visions merely just the imagination of a young child that is afraid of being alone in such a large place? Are we all capable of losing our minds to some degree? It takes many elements to make a film successful in achieving its goal. The Shining was able to keep the focus on psychological decline through various techniques used in film making. Through the use of music, sound, editing, acting, cinematography, etc. the film kept the viewer hanging on to each scene. Sitting on the edge of your seat, heart pumping, fear and terror are just a few emotions and ways you will feel throughout a viewing of The Shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 Razzie award for this movie???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the hell??? How come there are 2 Razzie Nominations for this movie??? Shelley Duvall nominated for worst actress??? How the hell it was given to her??? Honestly i really think that she is one the reason and character which makes this movie a classic! Let's us think again... Shelley is definitely NOT a pretty woman at all. Nowadays directors only focused on pretty woman and chicks and gave them important roles to make their movie a success, because they thought people would watch pretty woman in a movie instead of judging their acting performances. Well, this does not happens in Kubrick's The Shining.... Shelley was given the role because she is a natural. The role for her perfectly fits her, and she has the ability to control her emotion and tension. She didn't become totally insane and scared because this is how normal people naturally become when something happens. Jack Nicholson has shown a superb acting especially when turning into a maniac! I wonder why he didn't won any Oscar for this kind of performances??? And as for Kubrick...how come he is nominated as the Worst Director???? This is totally insane!!! Come on people...we all knew the Shining is a classic until today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detached, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of 'Hollywood talk', which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak 'on the nose', and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focused on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as 'Wendy' gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let's face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That's what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I often struggle with Jack Nicholson, finding his distinctive off-screen persona so evident in his acting that it's hard to for me to accept the bloke as anyone but himself. Occasionally, though, Nicholson's crazed appearance and unmistakable mannerisms are perfect for his role, adding credibility and weight to his performance; such is the case with The Shining, in which the actor plays writer Jack Torrance, who, under the influence of evil spirits, slowly turns from family man to murderous axe-wielding nut-job. Never has Jack's wicked grin been so perfectly suited to a character?not even for the Joker.Of course, it doesn't hurt that the man calling the shots behind the camera was one of the finest film-makers to have ever lived?Stanley Kubrick; if anyone could get a convincing performance from Nicholson, it was going to be Stan. With an unforgettable central turn from its star and flawless direction from Kubrick, The Shining is one of the best horrors of all time, offering stunning camera-work, unsettling music, iconic visuals, and scene upon scene of unbridled suspense and terror. In fact, it's so scary that I find I can even overlook (pun intended) Shelley Duvall's freakishly large eyes and scary teeth, and that's saying something!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a classic no doubt. It may appear cheesy but that's by todays standards. Back then it was the height of scary. It is scary in a different way. It doesn't have "jump out of the wall" moments as nearly all films these days have. Instead it is more of a creepy and intense movie. Jack Nicholson nails the part perfectly as an angered man who becomes psychotic. The other star actors play their roll very well also. A good movie to me is when you look forward to seeing more instead of sitting and waiting for it to be over. This movie is definitely good. The only downsides I find with the movie is the backstory to it is a little bit underdeveloped. It is explained in general which is OK but a little more info would help to explain further scenes in the movie. It does however leave one to wonder why such things happened in the first place. I won't go into details but if you've watched it you probably know what I mean. As far as violent/bloody, this movie does have some blood and a cringing scene with a woman but there is no gore, just blood. The blood is not excessive though and is fine by even my standards. As far as profanity goes there's several F bombs and B words but isn't used every sentence like so many movies are today. The N word shows up a few times as well. All together I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic psychological terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film a number of times (although the DVD I purchased a while back had edited out some crucial scenes i.e. the doctor conversation) However getting away from my usual moan, I have to say this is probably one of the best psychological horror movies ever made, the psychological terror is always more haunting than constant bloodbaths seen in other horror films.The film by legendary director Stanley Kubrick stars Jack Nicholson as an author who takes on the job as a winter caretaker at the isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado during off-season.Shelley Duvall stars as his emotional but loyal wife while Danny Lloyd stars as his psychologically troubled 5-year old son.It is revealed that the "trouble" is actually a strong communication gift called "the Shining".Scatman Crothers also appears as hotel chef and fellow in which both he and Lloyd share a brilliant scene discussing the gift.As the film carries on with only the three central characters alone in the hotel and with a big snowstorm isolating the location even more, the terror becomes more apparent.Jack Nicholson's character struggles with writer's block and begins to be haunted with events in the hotel meeting people that shouldn't be there, experiencing horrible nightmares and slowly falling into madness hysteria.Danny Lloyd's character through his "shining" goes through some bad experiences of his own while Shelley Duvall is overcome by it all and tries to keep the family together.Without getting into more description I would recommend this to anyone to watch at least once and see the affect it has on you.It is a classic psychological terror movie (with some blood and gore I might add) with a great director, great cast (even the support I haven't mentioned all make a good count for themselves), great location, fantastic soundtrack and to top it off an incredible ending worth waiting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great collaboration between Kubrick and King...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen 'The Shining' a couple of times before but I never realised just what a great film it is until this time around. I guess watching it late at night after many beers can take away the impact of it somewhat though. This time, its morning, I'm a little hung over but nothing a good strong cup of coffee and a decent breakfast couldn't cure! I have to admit I haven't read the Stephen King novel on which it is based, but it is on my reading list. As a fan of the work of both Mr King and indeed Mr Kubrick I was more than thrilled to see this collaboration. More of my thoughts after this brief summary.The Overlook Hotel is in a very remote part of Colorado high up in the Rocky Mountains. So high up in fact that it is shut down every winter because the roads become impassable. To this end a caretaker is employed to look after the place during the winter months. This time around it is writer Jack Torrance along with his wife, Wendy and young son, Danny that gets the job. Before he starts, Jack is told of an incident a few years back where one of his predecessors had gone mad and murdered his family before unloading a shotgun into himself. Jack is not put off; he is looking forward to the solitude so he can work on his new novel. Oh, I should point out that young Danny has a special gift, one that doesn't go unnoticed by chef, Dick Hallorann before he leaves. Things start out well and the family soon settles into a routine. Danny goes off riding his trike around the long halls of the hotel while Jack writes and Wendy tends to the everyday maintenance tasks. When Danny starts to see things, (two strange girls), and Jack begins to lose his cool, it becomes apparent to Wendy that all is not what it seems at the Overlook Hotel. I'll leave it there as I'm sure there are one or two out there that may not have seen this one. And anyway, the Spoiler Police will be locking me in a store room if I say much more.The film is brilliantly shot with some truly iconic scenes and some beautiful scenery to balance it up. I must also say the music by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind really added to the mood and gave the film an extra dimension. Brilliant performances all round, particularly from Jack Nicholson, chewing the furniture and really letting rip as Jack Torrance and from Shelley Duvall as the put-upon wife Wendy Torrance. I also have to give a shout out for the young Danny Lloyd who coped really well with the (at times) demanding role of Danny. Finally, honourable mentions go to Scatman Crothers as Dick Hallorann, Barry Nelson as Stuart Ullman, Philip Stone as Delbert Grady and Joe Turkel as Lloyd the Bartender.Stanley Kubrick was a master of storytelling and also a master of the visual arts. I loved the look and feel of this film but, just occasionally, I found the dialogue got a little bogged down. It was almost as if it was lifted straight from the novel and didn't flow quite as well as it might. I can forgive that though because the film as a whole really works and I must give credit to all the filmmakers for that! Most definitely one I will watch again (without the irritation of commercials next time) and one that comes highly recommended.My Score: 9.1/10.IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 222,736 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 88/100 (based on 49 reviews counted at the time of going to press).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>probably the best horror film i have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who has read Stephen King or seen films based on his books, it is unsurprising to find Kubrick's horror classic driven by King's fascination with the supernatural.I'm not the biggest fan of the horror genre, as all too often many films have the sole aim of just trying to scare you witless and forget to build the horror aspect on the foundation of a good, solid story. Thankfully this film, like most Stephen King adaptation's, has a very clever story, with many genuinely chilling scenes and moments. For me though, the best thing this film has is it's lead performance from Jack Nicholson. He is so watchable and I found myself longing for him to have more screen time as his character descends into madness.An utterly gripping story, the horror side won't be for everyone. Probably my favourite film in the straight-up horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King, 'The Shining' is a true classic in filmmaking. This Psychological Horror, Directed remarkably by the godly Stanley Kubrick, is chilling, engaging, captivating &amp; amazingly performed. 'The Shining' Synopsis: A writer, Jack, takes a job as an off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel. His young son possesses psychic abilities and is able to see things in the future and past, such as the ghosts who inhabit the hotel. Soon after moving in (after a winter storm that leaves the family snowed in) Jack becomes influenced by a supernatural presence at the hotel; he descends into madness and attempts to murder his wife and son.'The Shining' begins superbly and ends shockingly. The film offers moments that leave you frightened. In fact, the second hour, especially, is haunting. The Adapted Screenplay Written by Diane Johnson &amp; Kubrick himself, is captivating &amp; chilling. Kubrick has directed the film remarkably. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing is razor-sharp. The Art Design is superb. Performance-Wise: Jack Nicholson delivers an unbeatable performance. The iconic actor leaves you mesmerized with his frightening performance in here. This performance is easily amongst his finest to date. Shelley Duvall is very good. Danny Lloyd is fantastic. Scatman Crothers is impressive, as well. On the whole, 'The Shining' is a Cinematic Masterstroke! Go, Get Spooked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange, bizarre, freaky stuff and... REDRUM = MURDER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is typically Kubrick weirdness. Difficult to rate. Nowhere near as confusing as '2001' but some elements from that one can be found here. Then again, Kubrick's typical treats.'The Shining' is a bit of a test to patience, being long and slow. But if you have no problem with that, that's not a reason why it shouldn't please you. If you like Kubrick's cinema and weird films, then this is one film for you.It's interesting but hardly really good. There is some disturbing and gross content, as well as some takes which are too long and boring. When it comes to mystery, weirdness, suspense, tension and terror, it shines like its title.After seeing this I finally understood what Richard Dreyfuss meant by saying that Jack Nicholson is too crazy. And he is particularly crazy on this one. Have you seen Jack Nicholson when he gets angry? Boy, he sure is scary when he gets mad! That's what happens with his character Jack Torrance, whose transformation is notorious with strange and even aggressive behaviors and other insanity symptoms. He goes as far as attempting to murder his own wife and child with an axe! More than simply playing the character, he becomes the character. And his face in the famous sequence when he sticks his face through the door he broke with his axe and yells «Here's Johnny!» is crazy! He almost looks like a werewolf in that particular scene, becoming almost unrecognizable. Jack Nicholson is formidable in this role.Shelley Duvall is excellent as Wendy. She deserves all the praise from us. She worked really hard for this role and went through a lot of stress during filming. She successfully manages to stay away from her "Olive Oyl" image and honestly people should see her as a very capable actress and not just as "Olive Oyl".And finally, the kid is cute and amazingly played by Danny Lloyd. His performance is so realistic and believable that it's as if he becomes the character himself. Such a difficult role for a child to play, but he is so good that he makes it seem so easy.The ending is bad. After all of that, it simply shows pictures? That's it??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick's craftsmanship speaks for itself- but his greatest strength was definitely TECHNICAL (as opposed to artistic). Case in point: THE SHINING. Superior cinematography, to be sure... but not much else. Cold and uninvolving, THE SHINING has the dubious distinction of being an overblown technical exercise with some of the worst performances of all time. Casting is partially to blame: when Jack Nicholson first appears on screen, eyebrows arched and making comments that can't help but seem somehow snide, one can only think: "This ----------er is crazy." He OOZES Crazy from every pore. Shelley Duvall is so miscast that she looks like she's on the wrong PLANET. And don't get me started on The Kid. Only Joe Turkel seems reasonably comfortable in his part, but he isn't given enough to do to make any real difference whatsoever. Kubrick was a great Technician, but when it comes to a genre as visceral as Horror, he simply didn't have what it takes.</fullReview>

Rather, it's the fact that the relationships are not believable, the script is awkward, and the dialogue trite.Expressionless Shelley Duvall is a terrible actress and Jack Nicholson is badly cast (he fails to play a regular guy, which is what's needed at the beginning of the film). Danny Lloyd does a great job, however.The build-up to the climax is inadequate (though the ending does have some suspense). It looks as though Kubrick could have done something great with this, but he never gets a complete handle on the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is better than the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a group of fans who seem to be disappointed by the fact Kubrick has drifted away from the book. The King is the King and who touches His Kingdom should be punished by 1/10. You know the truth is that King writes very repetitive books. They are not scary nor suspenseful. Kubrick actually took the good idea (moutains, the isolation) wasted by King's schematic writing and picked the best of best to create movie which is WAY better than the book. I have seen the TV series which is more adored by the fans because it is closer to the book and I have to say the TV series may have more ghosts in it but it is laughable. The "gradual descent" into the madness is laughable actually, especially the scene when everyone shouts at everyone. Good for the Simpsons, maybe. Kubrick actually created incredible atmosphere - ill looking child, the black cook who dies in attempt to save the family, scary twins, amazingly looking hotel, incredible sounds and the soundtrack. He simply took forgettable book and created amazing imagery and incredibly thick atmosphere. Kubrick's place is completely abandoned, mysterious, beautiful, the ill looking family seems to be so fragile. I would like to spent a winter on such place. No need for long talks or morale dilemmas. The movie may be slow and drift away from the book, but it is very beautiful creation. Best enjoyed with a glass of good wine, really. I like this move most of all other Kubrick's movies. If you like amazing imagery, great shots, astounding sounds and you are willing to accept slow flow of the movie, you will enjoy this masterpiece as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: DO NOT WATCH ALONE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is without a doubt one of the scariest films ever made. Jack Nicholson in my opinion had his best moment as an actor in this film, so scary, sadistic, and insane. Living in a hotel for 6 months Jack Torrance (Nicholson) and his family think that this would be a nice get away from their hectic city life, but within a few days Jack becomes increasingly bored and starts to hallucinate things, talking to people who aren't actually there, seeing horrible images. His wife and son know they must get out, but the spirits in the hotel tell Jack that he must punish them, or more over kill them. I have just scratched the surface only giving you a little taste of the maddening and yet beautifully told story. Stanley Kurbrick deserved at least an Oscar nom. for this, but nonetheless The Shining is one terrifying and draining experience filled with nightmarish scenes and a score that scares you more than the movie itself. You might have to watch a few times to understand, but no matter what The Shining is one of the greatest horror films, I don't believe that it will be matched anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old thriller; Jack Nicholson &amp; Danny Lloyd make it worthwhile!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of those old classics among thriller/ horror genre! Nearly three decades old and over two hours long, the only thing that can keep you glued to the screen is Jack Nicholson&#x2019;s mesmeric performance while the eerie setting of a lonely hotel in the hills, everything around covered in snow and an untold story of death complete the picture.Jack Torrance (Nicholson) a writer doubles up as a school teacher to make ends meet. When a position opens up as a caretaker at the Overlook Hotel in the mountains that closes down for the entire winter, Jack grabs the opportunity knowing fully well that a decade ago, one of his kind failed to handle the solitude and murdered his two daughters with an axe and then drowned his wife before shooting himself.Joining Jack in his sojourn are his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall), a fan of horror flicks and son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The little boy though seems to have visions of Overlook&#x2019;s past and flowing blood. A casual chat with Chef Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) reveals that he too like Danny can foresee things and know unspoken words, a skill that is called &#x201c;shining&#x201d; here and is adequately demonstrated at significant turns in the film.The long winter soon gets on Jack&#x2019;s nerves as he is seen to be visibly stressed by his work and the loneliness of winter. As is must in horror flicks, he soon starts talking to the dead who tell him that he was always the hotel&#x2019;s manager and compel him to &#x2018;correct&#x2019; his son and wife who seem to guard themselves from the ominous. Hallorann, meanwhile envisions the happenings from Miami and flies down to save them.While Jack Nicholson is an accomplished performer par excellence, Danny Lloyd thoroughly shines in his role. Be it his conversations with the imaginary Tony or his curious cycling around the hotel, chance encounters with the dead girls, his visions of death and the spooky humming of &#x2018;Red-Rum&#x2019; which is read backwards as &#x2018;Murder&#x2019;. Shelly Duvall as the mom already looks spooky and is a fine fit for her role.Based on the book by Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick the experienced Horror director makes sure that &#x201c;The Shining&#x201d; has its moments. Danny&#x2019;s cycling scenes, sudden appearance of ghosts, conversations with them and the silent emptiness of locale are done well. The chase sequence in the snow-laden giant garden-maze is apt too. Despite its length, the performances will keep you glued to it. Worthwhile on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Too Much !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies gained over-hyped fame and so many praising epithets along the years to an extent makes discussing it a kind of blasphemy! (The Shining) is one of these movies. It embodies the blind glorification at its best. But I won't be terrified. So.. Let's blaspheme ! This movie has a clear problem. It wants to say a lot in the same time. After 3 viewings I couldn't settle what the main theme was ? There is a writer who can't write. A shining thing between his little kid and the old guard. A haunted house with ghosts. Maybe a satirical message; with the "hotel" that was built over red Indians' cemetery, the maze, and the presence of the American flag which could aim at America and its end as bankrupt crazy frozen ?? Moreover, there are twin silent sisters (?), beauty that turns into corpse (life ends fast isn't it?!), a kid who repeats one word backwards (may god help him), and a big rabbit at the end (a thing that provoked me to the MAX!). And finally, a reference, at the last shot, to a transmigration of souls !!?? This is too much already. Plainly, whatever Kubrick forced of high issues and sophisticated ciphers seemed inharmonic, complicated the movie, and chopped off any simple drama ? or drama ? it had, along with any coherent one meaning !It looks too artistic; which differentiates it between any usual horror. But what this quality did further than making it visually polished ?! Most of the classic tracks were shockingly boring. The movie is long. Ahh, this is to contemplate. But what was there, and solid, to be concluded ?! The performance (especially from the kid's side) was laughable yet shown as extremely serious so it was scary enough ! Generally when a movie achieves this degree of being not understood and not enjoyable then this is failure. And with commendable novel and one of a kind director then this is turkey ! I believe that (Stanley Kubrick) got conceited as he aged. Look at his late movies to understand that well. Just read this : "Stanley Kubrick ordered more than 120 takes in the scene where the camera simply slowly zooms in on Scatman Crothers as he "shines" in his bedroom. Kubrick wanted approximately 70 takes of the scene where Halloran gets killed by Jack Torrance, but Jack Nicholson talked Kubrick into going easy on the 70-year-old Crothers and stopping after 40. At one point during the filming, Crothers became so exasperated with Kubrick's notorious, compulsive style of excessive retakes that he broke down and cried, asking "What do you want, Mr. Kubrick?!!" I have no idea what the heck Kubrick wanted. And this confusing question can fit for the whole movie as well !Strangely, among this heavy mix and this bad ego the movie managed to be scary. Its general dark character, unfamiliar artistic taste, and Nicholson's charismatic madness; made it exceptional horror. Then its forever vagueness gave it certain magic. Millions think that Comprehensible + Kubrick = deep stuff, high art (and most of all : something can't be criticized !). In fact, being mixed up, long, overstuffed, perfectly ambiguous, not to mention "Kubrick's"; left all the chances in the world so the die-hard fans could put their own explanations in the big empty spaces making up disparate, or rather desperate, theories. However, none of them would ever have the ability to connect all of the movie's mishmash. See how this movie's faults are big part of the very reason why it's cult classic ! It's nothing but a lost movie in the maze of its director's very own points of view towards many matters. Kubrick kept mixing a lot of constituents till the final product became just like the movie's hotel : big and blank with different ghosts and unexplained everything !Too much of something is bad enough. So how about too much of many things !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, dated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really am unable to understand why this film has got so many accolades. It has quite a number of loopholes, underdeveloped characters and not-very-extraordinary performances. The film itself looks dated and not like an A-grade movie some of the times.The plot is really good, my credits to Stephen King, the author of the book. The thing is that most of the film is finished in conversations only. Though the conversations are interesting for a while, they get to be a bit long. The background sound was creepy but the scenes do not make you jump even once. There were some stirring moments but as a whole, not even one scene scared me. The thing that is good about this film is that it is watchable. Jack Nicholson gives a good performance but I have seen his eccentric acts before. Shelly too does a good job but falters a bit towards the end. The kid however was a bit annoying. The camera effect could have been better. Many of the things were unexplained in the film.I will go with a 6 for this movie. A good one-time watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say??? When people told me that this film was quite possibly the scariest film ever, I immediately thought that I had to see it but sadly I was proved wrong. It started off very slow like all common horror movies do but gradually got a little better. I was waiting and waiting for the terror to take hold of me but it didn't only boredom did. The only scary moments in this film are the old lady in the bath, the blood pouring out of the doors and when Jack chases Danny around the maze. I would really not call this film a horror but more a tense thriller as it does have you on the edge of your seat for most of the film wondering what's going to happen next. The chilling music in the background adds to the effect of surprise but does get annoying when the characters are talking and it is constantly playing over them.I have to admit that it did get better near the end but apart from that I wasn't frightened at all. For all my friends who told me this is scary, you've wasted a good 2 hours of my life making me want to watch this film.A good try though as I do like Stephen King but for horror movie amateurs, do give this a go as I'm sure your flesh will creep!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sense of failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick made one of his most commercial films based on this Stephen King story, and while it's not one of my favorite Kubrick films nor one of my favorite horror films I do think it's a very effective bit of cinema, and one that really used to chill me when I saw it as a kid. Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall are both great in my opinion, though Nicholson sometimes is a bit too over the top. I even noticed in one scene where he seemed to be channeling Bruce Dern because his psycho act looked basically the same as Dern's in various biker movies they made together. Duvall's taken a lot of heat for the movie, but frankly people should take note of the fact that Kubrick never got a great performance from any actress in any of his movies. Maybe a lot of the problem is with Kubrick is what I'm saying and not with Duvall. Her work in the film seems perfect to me -- in the beginning she's the very image of a co-dependent, making expert excuses for her husband's abuse of their son, and when Jack has his melt-down she goes into a very convincing "mama bear" mode protecting her son above herself.I'd like to talk about some of the themes in the book that draw from both King's work and Kubrick's work in general. First of all there's this prevalent image of the corridor, both in the hallways of the Overlook Hotel and also in the hedge labyrinth (and references back to corridor shots in "2001" and even as far back as "The Killer's Kiss"). I think the sense of this image is that freedom of movement and freedom of thought are to a certain extent an illusion. When you're moving down a corridor you're under your own volition, but there's only one direction you can actually move in without turning back. And don't turn to the side, don't think you can go into room 237 to find some kind of escape or release. It's important that the image is of Danny on a "big wheel" tricycle; those were very popular at the time and I'm about the same age that Danny was supposed to be and for us kids in the late 70s those big wheels were like the equivalent to how kids from the 50s talk about cars when they were grown ups. Heck I can still remember this feeling of freedom when I would ride my big wheel around the cul-de-sac, and I remember one time when I was very small crying because someone had parked their car out so far in the drive-way that I couldn't get around them without going into the street. So there's this feeling of freedom associated with the big-wheel, and yet it's a kind of illusory freedom, just like the corridor itself.It all ties into the sense of personal failure that seeps through the cracks of the Torrance family. And Jack is a man who feels very much trapped in his family, that his needs as an individual have been sacrificed for its sake. He finds something he loves even more in the Overlook, and thinks that he has chosen this path even though it must have been chosen for him; of the two men in the family who have "the Shining", he's clearly the less talented and the one that the Hotel could manipulate more easily. The mania takes the form of an obsession with the fact that he has "signed a contract" to take care of the Overlook and that he sees the rest of the family as an obstacle to that "sacred trust" -- yet he doesn't even take the time to keep the generators running, he lets his wife do all that actual work. So he's not truly concerned about the "trust" but moreso the fact that it allows him to believe that he has chosen his path instead of having it chosen for him. His aspirations as a writer, his failed attempt at a teaching career, and finally as a father he has ended up a failure. Danny's mental problem and his fainting spells become a symbol of personal failure -- there's a feeling when Wendy is talking to the social worker for example that Danny's problems are the result of parental abuse or neglect. Gradually Danny himself becomes for Jack a visible reminder of his personal failure, and the "contract" with the Overlook becomes a kind of salve or a way of "correcting" the failure.Scatman Crothers' character is also very interesting. It's similar to in "Misery" (spoilers) how King has the character played by Richard Farnsworth solving this mystery all through the story only to get waxed by Kathy Bates as soon as he solves it. So it's a King trademark, but Kubrick certainly could have chosen to ignore the character so it's interesting that it's so prominent. One thing is that I think it allows again for an illusory feeling of freedom; we're snow-bound and cooped up with the Torrances for so much of the film that every time we see Crothers (lounging in his decadent condo in Miami, flying on a jet liner) it's a breath of fresh air and freedom, of the outside world. But it proves to be an illusion because he can't save Danny and Wendy, no "outside influence" is going to decide the fate of these characters.When I've seen the movie on the big screen, it still has the power to shock and scare an audience. I remember seeing it in Sacramento in the middle of the afternoon and the audience came out of the theater looking shell-shocked. On video it feels more intimate and I tend to see it that way less as a good horror film than as a good character study. Either way it's a very interesting movie even if it never achieves quite the heights that Kubrick is capable of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneven exploration of one man's mental meltdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will about Stanley Kubrick, the man was a passionate filmmaker. Never afraid to skirt the waters of controversy, he was one of the few willing to take a plunge in those waters. Dr Strangelove remained his finest hour, but many of his films have polarised audiences. Some think he was one of the defining directors of our generation. Others believe he was a pessimist with a nasty nature. I think there is room for both viewpoints.And certainly The Shining elicits similar responses from people. Some who believe it's one of the greatest horror films ever made. And others who believe it's a film that makes no narrative sense. My opinion of the film is a little guarded. It's an impressive film to be sure, but it comes up a bit short in other areas, and is certainly a lesser film in Kubrick's canon of work.Stephen King allegedly hated the film upon its release because it strayed too far from the novel. And it's true. The novel was a tightly focused horror story about a haunted hotel, the Overlook, which was possessed by the spirits of those who had lived within its walls. One thing I liked about the book was I always got the impression the hotel had a persona. It felt like a living creature roused by the people staying there, and played upon their insecurities to destroy them.But that only feels half realised in the film. Kubrick isn't really that interested in the supernatural elements. His interest lied in the themes of isolation and alienation. The character of Jack Torrance (a characteristically over the top performance from Jack Nicholson) is a recovering alcoholic suffering from a severe case of writers block. While acting as caretaker of the Overlook, he wants to devote his time to writing a novel. The first month passes without incident (helpfully marked by ominous captions). But as Jack becomes more immersed in his work, he begins to slowly lose his grip on reality.One thing that can be admired about The Shining is its technical craft. Kubrick's direction is crisp and concise. And the Overlook is an impressive piece of set-design. Built on a single soundstage, with interconnecting corridors, ballrooms and passageways, the Overlook is a vast, self-contained world unto itself. You really do feel you could wander through those corridors for hours. And Kubrick makes great use of Steadicam, allowing for fluidic tracking shots, like Danny on his tricycle riding through the corridors or running from a demented Jack through a frozen hedge maze.And Kubrick is very effective at setting up a tangible atmosphere of dread and unease. You do feel there may be something lurking around every corner at the Overlook. I like the scene when Danny turns a corner and runs right into the twins. That scene never fails to send shivers down my spine. Or the chilling scene when Jack is stalked by an old hag in one of the rooms.It's just a shame the actors themselves sabotage what could have been a very effective horror show, and Kubrick lets his own pessimism about the human condition get in the way. Jack Nicholson was all wrong for this part. We can tell right from the start that he's stark raving mad, so there's no sense of surprise when he loses his mind and lashes out at his family. That type of character arc was explored to much greater effect in Falling Down and One Hour Photo. A much more normal person would have greatly added to the last half hour, and provided more of a jolt. There's only so much of Jack Nicholson cackling wildly and grinning like a loon that you can take before you feel tempted to switch off.Shelley Duval isn't much better. She spends the film either shrieking like a banshee, looking horrified to the camera, or mumbling "Jack" over and over. And Danny Lloyd isn't very sympathetic either. He has a very inexpressive face, and his waggling finger, which is supposed to represent the Shining is an embarrassing letdown.The film isn't very fair to Scatman Crothers either. He got to play hero in the book, but here the film turns convention on its head, and disposes of him in a most callous way. Another example of Kubrick's sensibilities getting in the way.The climax in the hedge maze is good, even though by that time you've long since stopped caring about these characters. In the end, The Shining emerges only as a good idea for a film when it could have been a masterful exercise in supernatural paranoia. If you want to see a really good film about a spooky hotel, check out the Coen brothers under-appreciated Barton Fink. It's a far superior film, and is everything The Shining could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Scary Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining," Stanley Kubrick's funhouse ride through hell, terrifies me. It scared me when I first saw it, what, 20 years ago, and it continues to scare me to this day.Aside from borrowing a sketchy outline from the book's central premise, Kubrick's film does not much resemble Stephen King's novel. Kubrick vastly improves on the original story, and makes it far more horrifying -- and memorable -- than King did. King was not so much interested in the domestic drama elements of his story, and so the novel focuses overtly on the supernatural -- there's no doubt in the book that the demons plaguing Jack, and driving him to insanity, are quite real. Kubrick, on the other hand, creates a dysfunctional family horror film. Rather than explain away Jack's behavior as the work of a menacing dark spirit -- though Kubrick does allude ambiguously to that -- the film spends most of its time exploring the dynamics of this small nuclear family, one that is trying hard to ignore some ominous signs of serious domestic trouble. It's much scarier to think that a dad and husband might just go crazy from isolation, responsibility and a male inferiority complex than from demonic possession.In Jack Nicholson, Kubrick found an actor who could both make you laugh and scare the pants off of you at the same time. He takes Jack so over the top that he sails right past hammy and circles back around to truly effective. Shelley Duvall is a wonderful actress when she can find a role to fit her unique physical characteristics, and she's perfect as Wendy, the suffering wife, who isn't quite as much of a doormat as you think she's going to be. And Scatman Crothers is great as well, as the head chef of the Overlook Hotel who knows a little something about its secrets.Kubrick is an expert at knowing how to use images to frighten us. He creates isolated images in this film that I've never been able to forget: the twin girls hacked up to pieces in a hotel corridor; the vacant stare on Jack Nicholson's face as he slowly cracks up inside while his wife and son play in the snow outside; and creepiest of all, the sight of a man in a bear costume fellating a butler in one of the hotel's rooms, an image that has psychologically scarred me for life.Add to all of this Kubrick's chilly, stately tracking shots that prowl through the hotel like something alive and that distorted, eerie musical score and you have one of the scariest movies ever made.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie and I have seen it various times. I love Shelley Duvall playing Wendy Torrance. I think that is the best performance of her career so far. During the filming which they show a documentary after the movie on my tape, they show how Shelley was pushed so far. I guess it was easier in Kubrick's direction to make things rough for her to get the outcome he desperately wanted. Shelley forgave him because the outcome was worth the effort. Kubrick was not known for being a genius for nothing. He had scenes done over a couple hundred times just to get it right. But this film shot in England was worth the effort, Kubrick captured the story nearly perfectly although he altered the outcome slightly. Jack Nicholson might have won three Oscars for other movies but he'll always be remembered for saying "Here's Johnny" in a demented way. The kid who played Danny Torrance was perfect in the role. I love the imagery and visual art direction that the film provided. I also loved Scatman Crowthers as Danny's friend and the cook. There are few horror films that I watch over and over but this is one because I liked the characters, the story, and the supernaturalness around the hotel. There were questions that it didn't answer but that's okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read King's book; a non-pretentious review; I will not critique Kubrick....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read King's book right after I saw the film, (at a still impressionable age, twenty years ago) I will not presume to critique Kubrick (the man obviously knew what he was doing). Even "Eyes Wide Shut", while being a bit too deliberately abstruse, was an interesting film, and as I am a writer and not a film student, I will defer to Kubrick's camera angles and color schemes.That aside, this film DOES hold up. It is not dated. I disagree with a previous review critiquing camera angles and colors. The film creates a sense of alienation and solitude, and Jack Nicholson (character Jack Torrance) is feeling all of these things as he descends back into alcoholism, psychosis and homicidal rage.I must make a few comments about the book; Anyone interested in this story MUST read Stephen King's book. I will grant you, his more recent novels are too over the top; this one, however, was a stand-out.Everyone probably knows the story at this point, but I cannot emphasize enough how reading the book will enhance your impressions of this film. Yes, many details of the book were left out in the film (But the remake, with Rebecca De Mornay, kept the details, and it doesn't translate well to the screen).Therein is Kubrick's genius. What translates to the screen?... hedge animals?.... a homicidal father?... a child prone to trances?; these are difficult subjects, and while much of the logic (included in King's novel) is omitted in this film, one may piece together Jack's decomposition through the visuals.All in all, if anyone has not read the novel, they should. It is a bit different, but the psychodrama is the same and this film has done an accurate job of depicting these issues visually. 9/10.</fullReview>

There are a lot things that are now, classics in this genre, and in this movie you can't be surprised by Kubrik's use of them (the haunted house, the kid with paranormal powers, the Indian cemetery beneath the house). I'm not saying it's a bad film, but i didn't enjoy it as I expected. All in all, this movie is well done, it has a great work of Nicholson, but it lacks of surprise and originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy horror send-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and I had not read the book to compare it by so I viewed this for what it was a film. Is this an intellectual thriller or a campy send-up of horror movies and the horror genre? Maybe a little of both. An unemployed recovering alcoholic writer has lost his ability to write and is in a marriage with a young son when he accepts the position of a caretaker of a Colorado summer resort. It's big Lodge dating from the 1920's and no roads leading to it are plowed in the winter months for six months of the year. He figures it will be an ideal chance to work on his masterpiece novel and be close with his wife and son at the same time. His son has an ability to tune in to the supernatural. Not a lot of reason for supernatural to be getting all creepy out in the remote Colorado mountains unless of course the old lodge is built on an Indian burial ground and a former caretaker once went mad there and murdered his family. Upon closer inspection it appears that there have been quite a few murders over the years there. Stephen King wrote his novel The Shining while staying at an old Colorado hotel but the hotel used for the films exterior shots is the Timberline in Oregon. The opening scenes were shot in Montana. Interior scenes of the hotel are inspired from various hotels dating back to the 1920's and were constructed on a sound stage. Jack Nicholson stars as the hotel's new caretaker in a character thats kind of a cross between his roles in Five Easy Pieces from 10 years earlier and Little Shop of Horrors from 20 years earlier. Shelly Duvall is the submissive hysterical wife and youngster Danny Lloyd is the son in his first and second to last film role. Scatman Crothers and Barry Nelson are among the cast. The screenplay was written by Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson. Stanley Kubrick directs. John Alcott who was Kubrick's cinematographer on A Clockwork Orange and Barry Lydon is the film's cinematographer. Nicely stylized film but the meandering story and it's vague subplots are so peppered with comedy that it never really can concentrate on being a horror film. It's entertaining but the relentless victimization of women and children by the the film's lead character while delivering one-liners is kind of disturbing. I would give it a 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

The scenes which presents isolation and depression glances, are masterfully designed, most of the illusions could be considered one mind's cluttered thought that ramble everywhere in people's head and that exaggerates and indulges one simple sense of realism all over the movie, but some of them are NOT that obvious and could be taken as fiction tales for some people; the scene that Jack talks to the previous caretaker and reveals enthusiasm about killing his family is actually in Jack's mind and he, himself lets the door open, but how is that possible with the huge bar blocking the door..I think this wasn't quite a good sample of this great man's pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson at his unhinged best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Shining" is without doubt, one of the scariest films I've ever had the privilege of watching.What really does it for me is the way in which the film charts the main character, Jack Torrance's slow, day-by-day descent into madness, Jack Nicholson's powerhouse performance frequently veers from being darkly funny to downright terrifying. I certainly wouldn't want to be left alone in the same room as someone Like Jack Torrance when he's having one of his turns! All throughout the film, the director, Stanley Kubrick's trademark attention to small detail shines through-from the eerily lavish production design (such as the deserted opulence of the Gold Room), to the sweeping Steadicam shots.Some have criticised the pace of "The Shining" for dragging too much, though personally, I have found that after quite a few viewings, it doesn't seem to drag anywhere near as much. It could have done with explaining in a little more detail the strange telepathic link between Danny and the hotel chef, Halloran (Scatman Crothers)There is an effectively cold and isolated atmosphere throughout this film.All in all, "The Shining" is a beautifully well-crafted shocker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The shining is a scary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining deserved its new found title of no.1 scariest film of all time, because of the very unique manner it was filmed. The vast use of extremes in colour and pitch of music, give the settings in the film an unbelievably ominous atmosphere, literally from the very start to the very finish. Thus playing on people's fear of there being 'no escape' very successfully. Rooms of bright red and gold portray the huge isolated hotel as nicely quaint and yet very paranormal. This along with Jack Nickleson's great performance of a man progressively turning insane is enough to scare anyone you know. Cubricks use of bizarre visions and flashbacks seen by our characters in the film emphasises the fact that there certainly will will be horror as there has been similar carnage in the past. The shining was incredibly influential with almost every aspect of the film. Original idea's in the story and directing etc. have been so badly imitated over the years they now come across as slightly ridiculous and a bit boring. Overall I believe its the film, along with Halloween, that will have you sitting and watching it with absolutely no comfort at all, which is of course what you want from a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Shining review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining has now become one of the most famous pieces of film history, perhaps so much so that when one actually gets round to seeing the film, they know exactly what happens, as television decides to show every single part in the movie on various TV shows, adverts, etc. However i found this not to be the case. When i watched The Shining for the first time, it was truly brilliant, even though i knew some of the storyline, and had seen "heeeeeres johnny" countless times before. This, in my opinion goes to show the sheer brilliance of Kubrick's film-making. The cinematography in this film is amazing, the techniques of using mirrors throughout the film runs strongly, and has the amazing effect of making the audience unsettled, not knowing what is truly going on inside the mind of Jack Torrance, making it all the more horrifying when we realise his mental state. the music and sound in the film are used to create intense dramatic effect, so much so that it is not even music, just a series of noises to emphasise what we are seeing on the screen. The roles of Jack and Wendy Torrance are played so brilliantly in this movie that they make it what it has become today. It is only the brilliance of Jack Nicholsons face as he pokes through the bathroom door that could make a line like "heres johnny!" so terrifying, and Wendy huddling in the corner of the room, looking at the axe as it comes through the door, screaming with tears flowing out of her eyes, that make us so scared of what could possibly happen to her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that 'The Shining' was one of the best films of the 80's without question. It comprises the amazing talent of Jack Nicholson and the brilliant writing skills of Stephen King, it would have been a crime if this film hadn't been produced, but Stanley Kubrick transferred the novel to screen perfectly. The famous scene where Jack appears through the door is built up incredibly well and the simple but effective line "Here's Johnny" is timeless. The film has the ability to continue 'creeping out' generations for years to come, where special effects movies will grow old and be forgotten. The novel IS better than the film but this is only due to time limitations.If you still haven't seen this film then see it... NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best "horrors" ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shining" is another masterpiece in Stanley Kubrick's filmography. As usual, the director gets in touch with a new genre -this time it's Horror-Thriller (even if "Shining" is more a thriller than a horror movie).The film is based on the book of Stepehen King. A writer is offered to do the caretaker (during the winter season) in a big hotel in the mountains. The man carries with him his wife and their young boy. The hotel is a mysterious place, where something terrible happened in the past... The writer becomes more and more lunatic...The film still scares 25 years after its release. Shots and cinematography are lavish -this is also one of the first features in which Steadicam is used. See the tricycle scene. It's useless to say that Jack Nicholson's performance is wonderful -his way of playing "Joker" in "Batman" (1989), in certain ways, seems a parody of this role...The DVD edition contains also an interesting documentary (directed by Kubrick's daughter) about the shooting of this film. I suggest to see it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's "The Shinning" is recognized for many things. Some have said in other user comments that it is perhaps the best horror film ever made. I'm not quite sure about that. I personally would give the film and 8 on the viewers fear factor scale. However, I am convinced it deserves a 10, due to the beautiful editing job by, Ray Lovejoy. I'm sure Kubrick, probably had some hand in how his masterpiece was edited. So the next time you really want to watch "The Shinning" take a closer look. Don't just watch it but pick it apart and really study it. I'm not quite sure why my editing/aesthetics class never chose this film to critique.</fullReview>

The acting is superb with Jack Nicholson giving an Oscar winning performance in his role as Jack Torrance. Also this has got to be Stanley Kubrick's best film he did, and should have won more awards then it did. The cinema-photography in it was breathtaking, with scary music to match the suspense. Viewers who have not seen the film must be urged to watch is as it is the scariest film I have ever seen and ever likely to see. Danny Lloyd was also on top form as Danny Torrance. This film is 10 out of 10 and will always be my best movie of all time.</fullReview>

The characters' and then makers couldn't have made a better film. When I first saw it I was scared to death. It's one freaky movie with a great story line and action. There was never a dull moment. Surprises' were around every corner in the movie. Kubrick and King provided everything for a awesome movie with a mood that makes you feel scared but yet in some way you fell bad for the people stuck in the hotel. They couldn't have based the movie anywhere else besides where they did or it wouldn't be as good because the surroundings and weather help the story develop. If you even like horror movies, you have got to see this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the greatest horror movie ever. I viewed it recently with a group of friends, and was blown away. What makes it so great was how well it transcends time. While "The Exorcist", which is widely regarded as the scariest film ever, may have been scary in 1974, it is now one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This is not the case with "The Shining". It is not the modern "Thriller", as it lacks gratuitous gore(although the scenes with the little girls and the woman are plenty disgusting), but it still kept my friends and me jumping. It is the definitive psychological thriller mixed with a haunted-house movie, and this combination creates a brilliant mood that is unmatched still. A definite must-see for horror movie fans, or really anybody who appreciates a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Movie I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was amazing. I did not even thing it would be scary cause it was made it 1980. It's the first older horror movie I've seen, now I think the horror movies made in the 80s and 70s are a lot better than the horror movies today. It is my favorite horror movie. I rented this a few weeks ago, now I wish I bought it, I will. If your going to see it for your first time you should wait till its really dark on a cold rainy night. I was it in the day light and I still thought it was scary.The plot is simple Jack toke a caretaker job at the Overlook hotel for the winter, the closet town is miles and miles away. So he takes his wife, Wendy and his son, Danny with him so he wont get lonely. Danny has a special gift called the shining, his mom and dad don't know about. He can see these dead people(ghosts)in the hotel. After about 2 months at the hotel Jack starts to go mad. The main idea is he trys to kills his family with an ax.I love this movie. The Overlook hotel looks anazming, I wonder where its located? The movie you might already know its made from the book by Stephen King. I'm half way done the book and I have to say there is a lot of stuff they didn't put in the movie, I know that happens when they make a book into a movie. If you love the movie read the book a lot of stuff with be explained in the book. Even by reading the book I'm still not disappointed with the movie, and that usually happens. I give the shining 10 out of 10. Watch It.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Check In at the Overlook Hotel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick outdid himself when he made The Shining and I thought Full Metal Jacket would be the only one I would remember him for. Jack Nicholson tears you a new one with his character Jack Torrance. Jack is a writer and teacher who gets the posh "dream job" of running a old and very fancy resort, The Overlook Hotel as its caretaker. Jack is told that the winters there are especially brutal and that him and his family will be shut up there for several months. He is also told the hotel was built on an ancient Indian burial ground (Stephen King's favorite plot element) and that many years ago one of the caretakers went crazy and slaughtered his family. One of those "Just thought you ought to know" embarrassing moments for the management type things. But Jack is unconcerned. He doesn't drink at all and needs solitude to write his book. They are given the grand tour and meet the head cook who "establishes a mental rapport" with Jack's young son Danny. He and Danny have a gift where they can hear people talk without them talking and can sense impending danger. The family moves in and so begins the long winter siege. Jack likes the place very much in fact he loves it and he gets the impression that he's been there before. His wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall), who is enthusiastic at first, gets the impression that the hotel is not quite normal and is affecting her son in a bad way. Jack becomes more and more irritated with her attitude and day by day he spirals deeper into madness. Jack is determined to correct Wendy's and Danny's behavior and stay at the Overlook forever. Now young Danny and Wendy must find a way to thwart him and escape with their lives. Watching Nicholson slowly lose his strong mind is a joy to watch. It's as entertaining as it is frightening. Only Jack could make it so believable. And Duvall and the young boy are so good they don't even need to be tailored to fit. Danny Lloyd the kid is damn good I don't know how they made him do it for being so young. This film is the best adaptation of a Stephen King book and of the highest quality of cinema. Another one of the select few horror movies of the past 25 years that holds up to its fame and success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shelley Duvall, underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people seem to overlook (ha ha) the acting on Shelley Duvall's part. She is the catalyst to the horror and her reactions not only reflect ours, they also seem to amplify them. No one has ever played someone so heart-stoppingly terrified and I doubt the movie would have been nearly as scary had it not been for her eyes popping out of her head. You need to have someone convince you of how terriffied they are in order to sell the intensity of their "situtation". I'm sure a lot of people don't recognize this because they are merely looking out for the scares around every corner and are focused on Jack Nicholson coming after her. So, in a way, you are guided by the victim as she runs about but often don't notice. So 10 points for Ms. Duvall. I don't know who or what was scarier, the hotel, the story, Jack Torrence, the ghosts or simply Wendy freaking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thriller/Horror Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is one of Kubrick's most renowned and beloved films, along with his other classics "Full Metal Jacket" and "2001". This film takes the best elements of fear, psychological, horror, adrenaline, and pure insanity to keep you pumped from start to finish. The story of a couple and their young child, after experiencing a move to a strange locale and it's ghostly inhabitants, seems simple and clichéd at first, but the movie takes a serious turn as the one you would always expect to protect you, turn out to have a burning desire to mutilate you with an ax. Some classic horror scenes such as the "Grady Twins" and the unforgettable "Here's Johnny!" Have spawned a thousands rip-offs and a massive following to this films unsurpassed quality, truly a gem if there was any in the exhausted horror genre. The basic story can be summed up in a few sentences. A family moves into a hotel. A horrible murder occurred there. The hotel has a mind of it's own. A ability called "Shining" enters the scene. The husband grows more and more "weird &amp; unstable". Family becomes worried. Strange events occur. Pappy tries to murder family with ax. The End</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful car with a V8 engine...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the critical success and commercial failure of Barry Lyndon (1975), Kubrick's next project was an adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller about a writer who goes insane whilst taking care of an off-season hotel plagued by malevolent forces; this may have seemed a surprising choice of subject matter given the high-brow, prestigious source material of his previous film. Several years before, Kubrick had passed on the extremely successful The Exorcist, and was now understandably keen to make a hit.Kubrick's desire to please audiences was reflected in his casting, and he chose Jack Nicholson to portray the demented Jack Torrence, the caretaker with writer's block whose son triggers off the spiritual forces at the hotel. Nicholson's over-the-top performance is what makes the film so memorable, recalling George C. Scott's eccentric mugging from Kubrick's earlier Dr Strangelove. Improving on the novel's tedious generic clichés, Kubrick attempted (and generally succeeds) in creating a cerebral, psychological horror movie which is as much about inner space as 2001 was about outer space. (The hotel's outdoor maze functions as an apt metaphor for Jack's interior state.) The film is high on atmosphere and chills, particularly in its depiction of the various 'shinings' (paranormal visions), and is as glossy and beautiful as you'd expect a Kubrick film to be. Fans of the book may be disappointed (as indeed was King himself), yet it is arguable that Kubrick once again takes a relatively formulaic and uninspiring novel (c.f. Clean Break, Red Alert or The Short-timers) and from it crafts a magnificent work of art. It is just a shame the superior 140 minute version (which I would rate 10/10) is not available.</fullReview>

Stephen King, as usual writes stories that scare the daylights out of you. As if that were not enough, the casting of Jack Nicholson in the lead role is inspired. Nicholson is so convincing in his role that I wondered whether or not he was really off his rocker. I saw the movie in Germany, in German and I've seen it in English and they translated it true to the original script. On my way home after the movie, I walked through a church cemetery, which was on the way to my apartment. Big mistake!

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest horror films. So deserving of its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the scariest movies ever made. This one is bound to give you nightmares! The actors, the settings, the depressing mood, the bizarre plot twists - everything about it has you biting your nails and swelling up with fear and dread. Although Stanley Kubrick DOES in fact rely on blood and gore to develop disgust, fear, and dread from the audience, he also relies on psychological factors and other effective "tools". So you have to use your initiative and observe what is happening to FEEL the threat.The bizarre ending keeps you thinking, and with no one from the movie to explain why this and that happened, you use your mind to determine the purposes till you go crazy and at the end, it's from YOURSELF that you drive yourself mad - just like what happened to Jack. Stanley Kubrick had shown us how Jack violently reacted to being cooped up in a hotel, with more questions than answers, and with no escape.Jack looking out the window with his frozen, stupefied face, his lobotomized and strained eyes as the pressure of isolation sinks in, is the physical ego to how WE the audience feels as we try desperately to determine why things in the movie happened.Kubrick has perfectly combined the audience, Jack, the hotel, and the overall movie as one.Danny Lloyd was an exceptionally good actor, given that this was his first starring role and also that he had no idea he was working on a horror movie. His constant reluctance to explain the bloody visions in his head and his invention of Tony, his imaginary friend, adds strain on the already-crumbling family. The only father-son interaction he has with his father is a cold, halted, strained conversation, and while they are talking, Danny and Jack look way, never looking at each other.So yes it's a scary film, but not just on the supernatural, psychopath-related aspects but also of the family and how they are falling apart. The dread relates to the audience's fear of a family splitting apart, and the breadwinner of the family losing all self-esteem and proclaiming murder and denial of his family.Overall, a terrific horror film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Shining' is one of those classic horror movies that marks a key moment in the genre. The storyline is pretty bizarre and enigmatic until the end. Even then it doesn't explicitly explain what you just watched. It's one of those rare things, an intelligent horror film. The music is haunting, so is the atmosphere, and I have to say it's one of my favourite films, if not my actual favourite. It sucks you into the story from the beginning and just gets weirder, but by the end you know you've seen a classic. The acting is brilliant, with Jack Nicholson in one of his most famous roles. Shelley Duvall as his wife was inspired casting; she can act completely hysterical and there's something about her face that adds to the eerie atmosphere. Danny Lloyd, the little boy, is great, especially since it was supposedly his first time acting. If you need any more persuasion?Stanley Kubrick is the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS After seeing the movie and reading the novel, I now understand why so many Stephen King fans hate this movie, not to mention King himself. They have a legitimate beef. Doing things like turning Ullman into a nice guy and not showing the hotel's maintenance man was bad judgment on Kubrick. I know that it's very rare when a film follows a novel right down to a tee, but this here is way off kilter. On the other hand, if you go into this movie blind without reading the book like I did, then you're in for some good, solid chills. First off, the score by Wendy Carlos is very good and sets the creepy mood from the opening credits when we see the Rocky Mountains. I also liked the scene where Danny's playing darts in the game room and all of a sudden he see's the Grady twins staring at him from the door. Very simple yet powerful scene. This movie is different from the book because Stanley Kubrick wanted it that way. Since this film packs a punch and never let's down, I'm not complaining. But the novel also packs a bigger punch. Either way, go for both.Score, 9 out of 10 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick had without doubt become one of the most original and best directors in Hollywood by the time he made THE SHINING. The terrifying movie about Jack Nicholson going insane at Overlook Hotel will always remain one of film history's biggest and most exciting classics.Jack Torrance gets the job as a housekeeper at Overlook Hotel and will be staying there to take care of it at winter time with his wife and son. Their son Danny having a unique ability called Shining that's a sort of telepathic thing in his head, starts experiencing odd and scary things at the hotel... and that's just the start of the terror of their husband and father, Jack going insane...The intense terror of Jack Nicholson in this movie goes beyond limits as he is possessed to kill his family with a ax. Shelley Duvall starring as his terrified wife acts brilliantly and the movie is from the start to the end one big, evil terror against the audience. The ugly things of it all, giving creeps down your spine as Jack goes just mad and mad. THE SHINING is the ultimate masterpiece horror film, the directing of Kubrick is amazing and the use of music is exciting and creepy, and the horror effects being used is genially in use of not too many jump-out-of-chair experiences, but more true evilness.Jack Nicholson does one of his best performances ever, this and his starring in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST both stands as his most amazing and great. THE SHINING is probably the best horror movie ever made, much because of it's originality, it's terror and brilliance threw it all.</fullReview>

The film contains some of the most memorable lines and scenes. The scent were the two dead daughters scared the hell out of me. The bath tub scene grossed me out and was scary. Of course the best part of all HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEREEEEES Johhny! Scatman Crothers played very good as the main chief of the hotel. Through out the film you can see Jack getting crazier and crazier. I will not forget the bartender Lloyd(Joe Turkel). Great horror film to see. IT so much better than its remake because there so much different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Exorcist never scared me the way this film still does. Exorcist has the lower lighting and creepy sounds littering the soundtrack from the get go. Save for the ominous opening music the Shining starts out with bright colors and open spaces then gradually closes in like the ghosts tormenting the Overlook and particularly its newest caretaker.This earlier adaption has noise and shadows and brings home again and again the sense of peril of isolation--The hedge and after that the mountains then the snow. There's the one scene where Danny escapes out the window and I'm holding my breath; if the kid were to sink in it he'd be dead in in an instant.There's a heap of of others too. Nicholson suddenly kissing the ghost (corpse?) and the briefest of shots of old hag form rising out the water. The twins girls at their hall of death and the blood coming around the corner. Danny's silent scream as Halloran is murdered before his psychic eyes.That probably 30 second shot of Jack Torrence dead in the snow is in my opinion the most banal but terrifying moments in horror movie history. I've watched this version of the Shining many times having owned the film and I still wind up shying away from this image.Sight, sound, a group of actors who could pull me in to the mounting terror going on and how desperate times are and one has to do to survive (Shelly Duvally &amp; Danny Lloyd). In that Kubrick far and away exceeding the later version. In less than three hours he made me very, very scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of the most effective horror films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is based on the novel by Stephen King, but the film is so full of Stanley Kubrick's directing techniques that I would consider this to be more of a Kubrick film than a King film. The Shining is an excellent and entertaining film, but it really requires more than one viewing to appreciate it. The first time I saw The Shining I actually thought it was kind of slow, but the second time I thought it was one of the most entertaining horror films I've ever seen. (Possible Spoilers) I'm sure you all know this by now, but the movie is about a writer named Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson) who goes with his family to take care of a hotel in the mountains. Throughout the film, he gradually becomes insane over a period of time, as caretakers from the past have experienced in the hotel.The film is shown through dream-like sequences and nearly perfect following shots that add realism and more life to the film, and believe me this has plenty of life like effects that put you right in the center of everything. The book is still better than the movie, but the movie has plenty of likable features and a great cast(I don't think you could come up with anyone more perfect than Jack Nicholson for the type of role). I'd suggest watching The Shining during the Halloween season, or better yet, during the winter, but you should watch this movie twice to really appreciate everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A master class in terror and suspense, The Shining brings a claustrophobic atmosphere to a film whose walls close in for its characters. Set at the Overlook Hotel, The Shining stars Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence, a man who takes a job as a caretaker at a hotel in the off season, and stays there with his wife and son (Wendy and Danny). However he is told that there was once murder there when one man killed his own family before killing himself, gripped in what the locals called "cabin fever" (when isolation becomes too much) Jack is undeterred however, and just wants five months of solitude so he can get some writing done. Soon the horror left over from the murders before starts to seep back, while Danny, who has telepathy and some clairvoyance, begins experiencing "shining , talking to spirits and seeing visions. Jack starts seeing these too, and it is not long before the same madness that gripped the last occupant starts to affect Jack, sending him into a psychotic rage. Can Wendy and Danny get away, and just what is in room 237? One of the scariest films to be put to celluloid, The Shining succeeds in its ability to hold suspense and horror to breaking point before uncoiling it to devastating effect. Nicholson is superb as the tormented Jack, driven crazy by spirits, writers block and isolation, while Shelly Duval deserved an Oscar for her portrayal of the helpless wife. Nothing in this film fails in its objective, from the cleverly woven score of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique during the opening credits to a simple piano key that signifies terror. Kubrick may have made more respected films, but he never made better.</fullReview>

It is an adaption BASED on a book. The Shining is a classic, superior horror film. Comparing a film to a book is like comparing apples to trucks. No, it is not a Stephen King film, it is a STANLEY KUBRICK film. King can snuggle with Mick Garris and that stupid mini-series cheese (btw, Trannon Goble's review IMDb review of this 1997 cheese series is right on the money).Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING IS A SUPERIOR MASTERPIECE OF HORROR.</fullReview>

The music for the movie is by the scariest music I have ever heard from any film out there.

The scenes like when those two twin grls down the hallway are talking to Danny or when Jack Nicholson goes into that haunted room are probably the scariest scenes I have ever seen in any movie. This is the #2 scariest film of all-time with The Exorcist being #1. Still this movie freaks me out.Hedeen's outlook: 10/10 **** A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finest Horror film around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS When it comes to the horror genre the viewer has to be careful. There are some truly dire horror films out there, particularly in the last three or four years. Yet horror, when done effectively, is the most powerful genre there is and 'The Shining' is without doubt the best of the bunch.There are contenders for it's horror crown, with such varying classics like 'The Thing', 'Scream', 'The Evil Dead' and the original 'Dawn of the Dead', but 'The Shining' just has that little something else that sets it apart.This is an immaculately constructed film, from the escalating tension in the narrative, the ominous ear-deafening sounds (both diegetic and non-diegetic) to the remarkable visuals that come from paying such intricate detail to every shot. Just one obvious example is the torrents of blood that come gushing from the lifts that visually represent the horrors that the hotel has contained within it's walls for so long.As well as scaring the life out of you with the sights and sounds this is that rarity, a horror film that really makes you think. There is an ambiguity created that you can never quite fathom out, and leaves you immensely intrigued each time. Was Nicholson already insane before he arrived (I believe so)and the hotel's isolation or it's inherited evil simply tipped him over the brink? Or does simply anyone who spends any fair amount of time in that hotel go mad due it's being haunted. Then there is the final twist of Nicholson being in the photo from about 50 years before in the final frame. Either he found a great anti-aging cream or there is something seriously spooky going on.I haven't even mentioned the legendary performance by Nicholson or indeed by Duvall yet, or the iconic axe to the door, 'Heeeeeeeeeres Johnny' scene. That's how good this film is. Of course everyone knows Stephen King's (who wrote the original novel) opinion on this. He hates it. Well, Stephen you may well be an exceptional author but your taste in films suck big time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is a pretty good movie, although I expected a lot more. Very few question the talent of Nicholson or Kubrick, and the idea of them working together is exciting.However, the movie never seems to quite work for me. To me, there are no genuinely scary moments. Perhaps it has just dated in the same way as other classics like the Exorcist; or perhaps, as a member of Generation Y, i am hardened to this sort of movie.After seeing a lot of low-budget Stephen King conversions (I'm thinking It, Pet Sematary), some of which were awful (Langoliers anyone?), it's interesting to see what a big-name director with a Hollywood budget makes of the book.The over-the-top performance by Nicholson makes the rest of the cast look a little insipid - although i think if the rest of the cast had been of Nicholson's stature, he would probably have looked great.This movie is probably worth seeing. However, not for a place in top 100 of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Kubrick's best, but still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS-----------------------------------------------------------------------Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" is not his greatest film by any means, but it is still a good enough picture to get a real grasp of Kubrick's fresh style.Something that I really appreciate about the film is the amount of hidden meanings and messages it has. Kubrick plants so many, so subtly that it's hard not to ignore the films intelligence.http://www.drummerman.net/shining/essays.html^ This site features most of the films hidden meanings, if you did not like the film, I promise that this will make you admire it just a bit more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Not onto my negative opinions on the film:I think that Kubrick got too caught up with his artistic and creative vision - he seems to be so keen in showing of his flare, that he wants to turn Nicholson mad as quickly as possible. There is no build-up, it just happens. If Kubrick had spent some time building up the character, then I think that the film would be just as emotive and powerful as the book - we'd actually feel for Nicholson's character, and we'd feel saddened over the break-up of their strong family bond.I don't know about you, but I felt that Nicholson and Duvall lacked any chemistry. The only chemistry that was there was when they were killing each other. The scenes before that - the close-up shots of Duvall saying something stupid, Nicholson using the old eyebrow technique - they all were just...ugh.I don't think the timing worked very well either. During the end of the film, when Jack was on his final rampage through the house with an axe, the scene would awkwardly cut to Halloran sitting in a plane or something - I felt that it completely lowered the tension and the mood.-----------------------------------------------------------------------I don't want you to think that I hate the film, I really don't. I just think it's more fun looking for the negatives, rather than the positives. You know what makes this horror work so well, I don't need to tell you that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag, as far as I'm concerned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screenplay (co-written by Stanley Kubrick) largely ignores the details of King's original novel, omitting all but the basic premise, and stretching everything out for the best part of three hours. It seems as though the first act (the set up) lasts for only the first 6 or 8 minutes, the second act lasts for about two hours, and the third act lasts for about 30 minutes.Gone are the subplots of finding the box in the basement containing records of all the former guests in the hotel, and their involvement in the mob. Instead, we have numerous, lengthy scenes of this trio wandering around the deserted hotel, and hallucinating, or being taunted by the ghosts of the hotel's past.Gone also are Jack Torrance's sympathetic characteristics. Nicholson's character starts to go off the wall in his second scene. We never really see what he is like before he goes mad, so we can't really get involved with his already off-putting character. The mallet-chase climax from the book is replaced by a penultimate ax-wielding scene straight out of a slasher movie. The climax to the film, with Jack chasing his wife and son through a huge hedge-maze (ever so loosely derived from an earlier sequence in the book) is one of the film's few highlights, but the effective ending from the book, hinting at redemption, was replaced by a joke/ shock twist ending in this film.Scatman Crothers' underused character is another highlight. He flew back to Colorado from Florida to try to save them and ended up being killed, yet his arrival was enough to distract Jack, and give Wendy enough of an opportunity to escape from the locked room and distracted Jack. Brothers character was a hero in that regard, yet also the sacrificial lamb.Duvall, panic-ridden, telling Jack "There's someone else in this hotel with us!" was one of the creepiest moments in the film.Odd art direction throughout, as the colour composition in a lot of scenes is almost comical (e.g. notice some of their clothing, and the bright red in the John). The music score also is effective in some scenes, and nearly comically overdone in others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It hasn't aged well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked out "The Shining" on DVD and was disappointed to realize that it hasn't aged well since the last time I'd seen it. It had always been one of my favorite movies and probably my favorite Stanley Kubrick film, but several things troubled me on seeing it again recently. In fact, I shut the player off and didn't even finish the movie.To be blunt, the movie opens in terribly boring fashion, a series of static head shots involving Jack Nicholson and two actors of zero charisma. I refer to the scene in which Mr. Ullman explains to Jack Torrance the horrific history of the Overlook Hotel. Frankly, today it looks like amateurish filmmaking as it is nothing more than people talking and reacting to what they're hearing. Given Kubrick's mastery of the image, couldn't he have found a more visual way of giving us the Overlook's backstory? I think of how Peter Jackson handled the backstory in "Fellowship of the Ring," and "The Shining" just looks so made-for-TV by comparison.The movie is so static, so dialogue-driven, that I can't imagine how it played on the big screen. As I was 10 years old in 1980, I've only seen "The Shining" on TV. I'm afraid it might be more at home on the small screen, given Kubrick's curious preference for a locked-down camera and predictable editing style.Something else totally kicked me out of the movie. As Ullman is touring the Torrances around the grounds, they come to the Snowcat, and he asks, "Can both of you drive a car?" What the hell? Why wouldn't Wendy be able to drive? Was this movie made in 1957? It's a tiny point, but I just couldn't go on with a movie that had aged so terribly over just 23 years.Intellectually, I know this is a film of superior intelligence and great style. It's just that the style played better 15 years ago than it does today. Here's a suggestion: Peter Jackson should do a remake. He could really do a great job with the story, blending Stephen King's terrific characterizations and settings with seamless special effects that would terrify and enthrall today's audiences.Too bad it'll never happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I shouldn't have read the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems as if only everyone who read the book first didn't like the movie. I'm no exception. My problems with the film have nothing to do with it not exactly following the book. That's not something I expect from a move, they're two different mediums, differences are to be expected. My problem was that the move took the elements from the book and boiled them down to a couple of seconds and put them on the screen without explaining what the meant (for example the twins, they were a developed subplot in the book, in the movie they were just there).I may be the only person on the planet who didn't like the blood pouring out of the elevator scene. It was as if a special effects guy went up to Kubrick and said "We got this great effect, it ain't taken from anywhere in the book, and it don't have anything to do with the story, but it's really cool, ya wanna use it?" And he said "Sure."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book vs. Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In books you get the visual aspect that you make up and you create and identify, thats the magic with books is that every scene and every image is conducted by you and you navigate through your mind with people that the writer brings to you and in movies its the alternative where the director brings you the images, the characters and you see it through the movies eyes and I guess with The Shining everything just drops both ways.May contain Spoilers: I think Stanley Kubrick arguably is the best director we have , he didnt spoil us every year with a movie, in fact he only directed two movies during the eighties, what I like about Kubrick is his artistic visual sense. His craft blends in with perfect chemistry of character and that character's surroundings (hence Barry Lyndon). This movie was nothing from the book , and it was changed drastically in almost every scene but I overlook it for the fact almost seventy or ok maybe sixty five percent of movies today from books are rearranged or dont add up to the book. That's how movies are different than books, it doesnt necessarily make it right and Kubrick really should of went by the book and he could of captivated the audience with his art the same way if it was a maze or if it wasnt. If the building blew up in the end or if it didnt, the same attraction we would have. But I also think that once the writer gives his works to movies then its out of his hands and Stephen King can regret and resent Kubrick all he wants but its been twenty three years now and this movie has skyrocketed to fame. It's got eight stars out of ten on the IMDb and it deserves it. My favorite part from this movie was the cam tracking of the kid and in the hallway he see's the beginning of doom by the twins. I have seen bits and pieces of this film when I was a kid and I wouldnt even go near it, I was always watching Freddy Krueger movies and that was more simpleminded. But as I grew up I watched it in its full length and was stunned , I didnt even read the book then and when I did I found out some horrendous errors but to me it didnt matter, cheat or not or however Kubrick had done it, was done and you cant take away the artistic view because he changed the storyline. You can nail him on that but taking away the possession of this masterpiece for what it really boils down to , you cant!I dont know if I would say Kubrick is my favorite director, so much of my favoritism isnt really in movies or actors or screenplays, etc. There for me is too much and hard to make a final decision but I know Kubrick is at least on my top five list. I liked the fact he only directed sixteen movies in a span of nearly fifty years. And the thing was they were all beautiful, the atmosphere in each piece brought us into a world as if we stepped into the movie, like in the purple rose of cairo where the movie star steps into reality, well its vice versa for us in Kubricks movies, in most of his best movies like Space Odyssey and Barry Lyndon he shows us a world as if it was painted and after staring at it for ten minutes or so your drawn into that world , your moving along as it goes. Not many directors can do that and when they can that is the genius of which we can identify as a truly, gifted, honorable giant of a place for two or three hours we can get lost in and not worry about anything...for the record Kubrick is the master of that!!!</fullReview>

SHINING is a tale told by a King, Full of Kubrick and fury, Signifying nothing!I liked the contrast between the seeming sophistication of the civilized hotel in the wilderness and the monstrous atmosphere created. But there is much less here than meets the eye. I guess I would have to say, "All atmosphere and little story makes SHINING a dull thing." Ironic, ain't it, considering the title.The real horror of the movie is the excruciatingly slow pace. It would have been a much better movie if it had been edited to make it move faster. But then this is a Kubrick production which means that it is self-indulgently long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective but sometimes confusing and slow horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a fan of the book, this movie can only halfway satisfy you. The basic plot of the Torrance family watching the Overlook Hotel during the winter season is the same, but many pivotal elements that make the book so fascinating are missing or are hinted to but not explained so as to confuse anyone who hasn't read the book. (The scrapbook next to Jack's typewriter as Wendy talks to him, the two men in the bedroom, the whole party going on around Jack and Wendy during the last scenes, etc.) However, Nicholoson's performance definetly makes up for at least part of this. He plays the crazed caretaker very well. Duvall, while a good actress, is somewhat of a letdown in her role because she plays her character as a very wimpish girl who cowers to a lot of her husbands bidding, she redeems herself somewhat at the end but overall she is rather dissapointing. Overall Kubrick tries very hard to make the movie his own, and while there are some very good scenes the movie runs slowly and there are just way too many liberties taken with the book to truly show what Stephen King was trying to show when he wrote the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, sound horrific fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched a documentary about Stephen King recently. One of the critics interviewed (a critic favourable to King - there was no other kind present) gave us an old line: King uses brand names, makes references to popular television, and has his characters eat at McDonalds, in order to bring horror out of the musty old castle and into the streets of the very suburbs in which his readers live.The interviewer didn't actually say, in so many words, that this was a good thing. He didn't have to. It's almost impossible to say something like this without it sounding like praise. But I consider it damning criticism. I LIKED the musty old castle. Why I should I rejoice when it gets demolished to make way for some fast food outlet? McDonalds has managed to invade our cities, our countryside, our airwaves and our sporting events; I don't see why it should be allowed to invade our fiction as well.Sure, our imaginative has been enriched by artists who have managed to find beauty where none had been previously thought to reside. But it's not possible to find beauty just ANYWHERE. McDonalds (for instance) is so squalidly banal, so dully horrible, that it would defeat ANYONE'S attempt to find something attractive or even picturesque about it. Some things can't be romanticised. Not, I suspect, that King would romanticise McDonalds even if he could: he seems to have been infected with the modern idea that one must never romanticise one's subject, that romanticism is a kind of a sin, or at best a 19th-century toy which we have now outgrown. King, remember, is a writer of fantasy. How can he write good fantasy WITHOUT romanticising one's subject? He can't. No one can.At this point I should mention I haven't read `The Shining', but I have seen the 1997 miniseries which King wrote and produced, and the pattern holds: the hotel is, you know, just this place. But KUBRICK is a romantic. (Look at anything he's made in colour and try, if you can, to dispute this.) HIS hotel doesn't have Big Mac wrappers in the driveway and used chewing gum under the seats to invest it with a boring plausibility; instead it's the kind of grand place, the very archetype of a haunted hotel, which anyone with a soul will WANT to visit. Fictionally speaking.Each of the four principle actors is perfect, even the kid (I'll concede that Nicholson looks a bit too familiar, but that's a problem generated by other films, not this one) - they certainly beat the insipid, T-shirt-wearing nonentities in the miniseries. Many of the complaints you'll hear about the acting are foolish ones. Nicholson does not overact. Maybe real madness should be understated; but this is fantastic, supernatural madness - what did you EXPECT it to be like? And Shelly Duvall is there to gain our sympathy, not impersonate Sigourney Weaver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much time, not enough scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a combination! The legendary Stanley Kubrick adapting a Stephen King novel and starring Jack Nicholson. It couldn't miss . . . and yet it did! The problems I had with this version of the story is that I think that Jack Torrance (Nicholson) isn't wrapped to tightly at the beginning of the film in the first place, so we don't exactly have that much tension when Jack finally does snap. While I haven't read the King novel, I've heard that Wendy (Shelley Duvall) was no where near as wimpy as she is portrayed here. I was also more annoyed by Danny (Danny Lloyd) than frightened or sympathetic towards him. I probably would have taken an axe to him as well. On the plus side, I DID like Scatman Crothers' performance as the cook who can also "shine". I also liked the use of sound, such as when Danny is riding his Big Wheel alone through the halls of the hotel. The sound of the cycle going from the carpet to the wooden floor and back was a little unsettling. Also the appearance of the twin ghosts was a bit of jolt as well. However, I think the main complaint I have is that for the amount of time this movie runs, there aren't nearly enough scares to occupy them. That's why I'm about to commit a blasphemy: I'm going to recommend the '97 TV version of this over this one! THAT one scared me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Shining at All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining was an extremely long, boring, and dull film. It's regarded by many critics and film enthusiasts to be "one of" or the "scariest film" ever, yeah right.I bought the DVD seven years ago and watched it late at night. It was boring and i nearly fell a sleep. It was not scary at all.I watched the movie again today twice. Still boring and not scary at all.Technically the movie was brilliantly made. Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall delivered great underrated performances, but the story was flat, hollow, and has no depth. It came across more as a psychological drama disguised as a horror film than an actual horror film, therefore had it has no depth beyond the surface.Stanley Kubrick is a great filmmaker, but this film was not his best. It's unfortunate because I'm a big fan of all his other films, not including Fear and Desire, that was pretty bad too, but that was his first film. Anyway, I'm not going to lie and say that "The Shining" is a great movie just because I'm a big a fan of his other films.I later read the Stephen King novel on which this film is based and it's far superior than the film, but then that's almost always the case with any great book made into a movie with a few exceptions (The Exorcist, Dune).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as everyone makes out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film last night for the first time and the be honest was thoroughly disappointed. The reviews and 'scores' had me anticipating a classic. What I got was a film that was in my opinion so badly acted that it was actually funny in places. The storyline was so butchered that it frequently failed to make sense (with random ghosts popping up all over the place with no 'back story'), and was so slow and boring that I really could not understand what all the fuss had been about. Suddenly I could understand why Stephen King had reputedly been so annoyed by the movie - it would certainly have put me off reading any of his books had I not read any previously!In my view the film's only redeeming factor was its musical score, which was indeed a bit spooky and tension building - but it was never going to be sufficient on its own to rescue the film entirely. It may well have been ground breaking in its time (but I don't feel qualified to pass judgement upon that), but it left me completely cold in 2015 - and not even vaguely 'concerned', let alone 'scared'! I honestly thought the reviews must have been for a different version, as this turned out to be one of the worst films that I have ever watched, and believe me I have seen some rubbish!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic example of a murder horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts out slowly, as eventually all he other murders will gladly follow suit. But this movie's start up doesn't take very long. It soon takes the viewers to the lonesome world of the big hotel. The thriller sets in very nicely, building momentum for the barrage of horror moments. What I like about this horror is that Stanley Kubrick dared to use minimal amount of dark lit environment, compared to what almost all of the recent horrors are depending their scares upon. The repeated long shot on the corridors are very nice touches that help build curiosity. Those shots puts the object right on sight but with lacking clarity, sometimes prompting the viewers to slant their eyes to have better glimpse of what's being shown. The acting by Jack Nicholson deserves a legendary status indeed. His role gets into character very nicely that when it comes to the twist of the typed pages, even I was surprised, although I have been anticipating such a twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the low frequency string, the movie start on a family with a deliberate husband searching for job hoping that will give the isolation and environment for his writing with a homemaker wife and a little son who talks to his own calling to a character Tony. The casting for the wife is a interesting one. The cast makes the character is physically weak, and not of a great beauty that adds to the disinterest of Torrance in his life. The conversation between the couple shows her as always trivial with Torrance making her puny. When this family goes to a isolated hotel for maintaining it through out the winter which already has spooky history. During the period Torrance turns insane and attempts to murder his own family. But there is no real shots or space in the script that shows the change in the character of him, how insanity acquired him with the isolation and obsession on his writing. The concept of shinning that was fresh in the movie and having a positive ending with determinant Wendy Torrance character are aspects that can looked on the movie .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Did I Just Watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little background before I start: I'm a sixteen year old with no experience in horror. I watched a few horrors as a child that terrified me to the point of small amounts of sleep. Since then I have watched no horror films. I've avoided things that may scare me. So no, I'm not like most teenagers that have watched the modern horrors and "don't understand" the classics. I decided to watch this film because I wanted to introduce myself to horror through what is considered to be the most psychologically terrifying film of all time.Was I disappointed? No. Did I get what I expected? No. This film didn't scare me at all. I scare easily, so this came as a shock. I can't understand why everyone finds this film terrifying. So why the 8? Well, it may not have terrified me but I still loved it. I can't really say that it was a masterpiece, as others have, but I certainly loved it. I'm a huge fan of the surreal nature of The Shining. I loved the way it was filmed; the style. The shots were very creepy and unique. The director, Stanley Kubrick, certainly knew what he was doing.Another thing that made this film great was the music. Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind did an amazing job with it. If anything made me scared in this film, it'd be the music. It, along with the camera work and lighting, made the entire thing surreal and brilliant. This is the thing that made the film so fantastic. Well, this and Jack Nicholson, who plays the main character. The creepy atmosphere was perfect for this film and added a perfect tension to everything. It made everything just a little more insane.I can't say I enjoyed the writing too much. It didn't really add up and could have been written better. I heard that there was a reason for this, but I see no reason except to confuse the audience. It felt like the writers, Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson, were on some sort of drug. Although to be honest it sort of felt like the whole film was. It wasn't bad writing, just confusing and muddled. At times it was in fact quite intelligent and well done.Apparently the movie is nothing like the novel (when is it ever?). I have never read the novel, but from what I have heard from Stephen King, the writer of the novel, and many fans of both, it is much more terrifying and creates a very different atmosphere to what the film does. I must disagree with the author of The Shining on his opinion that this isn't a good film. What I do agree with is that Jack Torrence, the main character, should gradually become insane, as he apparently does in the novel, not start off as insane like in the film. Or maybe that's just the brilliant Jack Nicholson. He does have that insane affect on his characters.Unique? Yes. Creepy? Yes. Surreal? Yes. The most terrifying film ever made? No. To be perfectly honest, I don't think this film deserves the attention it gets. It was and is still a great film, but it certainly isn't the most terrifying horror ever, as many have stated. I would recommend this to people, but not for the same reasons others have. The surrealistic nature of this film is what stands out to me. It's what makes the film completely fresh and unique compared to anything else ever made.I'm sorry if I'm repetitive or my review is of low quality; I'm awfully tired.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson plays a psychopath who takes his wife and child to a house. But he slowly loses his mind and threatens to kill them both.Of course since its a horror film(and I'm not a horror fan WHATSOEVER) if you love a good scare then check it out.

		<shortDescription>Arguably the best horror of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This thoughtful and provocative horror film is what puts modern slashers and gore-fests to shame. Hidden meanings and clues are hidden throughout the entire film, provoking many to argue the message and meaning of the story. Some say it represents the holocaust, some say it represents the massacre of the Indians. But in any case, on its most basic level the movie is about a family moving to an isolated hotel in the winter when the father (Jack Nicholson) lands a job as the Winter Caretaker. Some kind of presence influences the father to slowly go insane and turn violent. Unlike Stephen King's book this movie leaves many things open to interpretation that the book did not. The ending in particular is quite strange and many look at it in different ways. The acting in the film is superb, with Nicholson stealing the show as Jack Torrance. Shelley Duvall plays his wife (Wendy Torrance) and she does a decent job. The child (Daniel Torrance) was also portrayed well. The draw in this horror movie is not petty jump-scares and generic villains (many modern films seem to forget this) but slowly building tension and creepy events in the hotel. But that doesn't mean this film won't terrify you, be ready for a thought provoking and atmospheric experience 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Horror Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Scary,Frightening,Terrifying,Unforgettable Horror Masterpiece From Stanley Kubrick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is one of the greatest Horror films ever made,a scary,terrifying,frightening and unforgettable Masterpiece of Horror and cinema in general. Filled with masterful direction,brilliant acting and haunting images,The Shining is one of the greatest films ever made and Kubrick at his best.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name,The Shining tells the story of Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson),a writer and former teacher who is also a recovering alcoholic who has been asked to be the caretaker of The Overlook Hotel in Colorado from the Winter until May the 1st. Bringing along his wife Wendy(Shelley Duvall)and his psychic son Danny(Danny Lloyd),the Torrance family discover that they are not alone in the hotel and are being stalked by ghosts who are making Jack go insane and possessing him to kill his family. Will Wendy and Danny make it out alive or face Jack and the hotel ghosts wrath? The Shining is without a doubt one of the greatest Horror films ever made that from the moment you watch it is an instant Masterpiece and Classic right from the opening credits. The Shining is not only a Masterpiece of modern Horror,but also a Masterpiece of timeless Horror. Kubrick has given viewers a big,bold and epic Horror film that right from the start of the film you watching a living nightmare that is scary and unsettling,dark and horrific,disturbing and unforgettable with haunting imagery that will unnerve viewers. One of the main reasons The Shining is scary and Horrific is the creepy atmosphere that the film conveys. The cold and snowy atmosphere gives the film a sense of dread and fear and makes not only the characters but the viewers feel alone,isolated and trapped and there is no way out. The snow and cold gives the film a unsettling feeling where you think that anything can happen at anytime. This film and John Carpenter's The Thing both use cold and snow atmosphere to great effect and will make viewers never stay alone in the snow and cold ever again. When Kubrick shows the inside of The Overlook Hotel,the Hotel is big and wide and given a lot of space feeling like The Hotel is a character in itself and as the film goes on the Hotel becomes more of a character and Jack,Wendy and Danny become claustrophobic and alone. The lighting and sound is what makes The Shining stand out from other ghost films because the lighting makes The Shining look beautiful and frightening in it's darkness. The use of sound in the film is effective whether it's the wood on the floor,music or the sound of doors. The sound effects throughout the film give viewers a sense of fear and terror and put you in a scary place. The imagery and visuals in the film are creepy and will stick with you because of it's power and intensity because what Kubrick is giving us is a visceral experience of trying frighten us not only physically but mentally as well. The Shining transcends the Ghost and Haunted house genre by making the film ambiguous because as you watch the film you wonder why are the ghosts there? Are the ghosts there because of the Hotel or are they there because of Jack going crazy or is it because Jack,Wendy and Danny have Cabin Fever? The movie makes you ask a lot of questions that are not answered and is one of the reasons The Shining is a great movie. With the characters Jack,Wendy and Danny we are sorry for them but also scared for them before anything really starts to happen because we as the viewers can tell that the Torrance family has problems but still love each other. When scary starts to happen you are with the Torrance family as if though you are experiencing the terror yourself and that is the power that this film has. As loved as The Shining is now,the film is still controversial among Kubrick fans and Stephen King fans. As a Kubrick film The Shining is seen as a brilliant masterpiece and one of his best,but as a King adaptation King fans hate the film and consider the film to be a bad version of the novel. As someone who is a fan of both Kubrick and King I think both the novel and film are both brilliant but on different levels. The ending of the film is masterful and will leave you with a lot of questions and will have you discussing what happened. A great ending.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Jack Nicholson is excellent,terrifying,funny and over the top as Jack Torrence,with Nicholson bringing intensity to the role. Shelley DuVall is brilliant as Wendy,Jack's wife,with Duvall bringing sympathy and depth to the role. Danny Lloyd(in his only film role)is wonderful as Danny,Jack and Wendy's son who has great psychic abilities. Scatman Crothers is great in his small role as Dick Hollorann,the hotel cook who knows about Danny's power. Phillip Stone is creepy and memorable as Delbert Grady,one of the ghosts Jack meets. Barry Nelson(Stuart Ullman),Joe Turkel(Lloyd The Bartender),Anne Jackson(Doctor),Tony Burton(Larry Durkin)and Barry Dennen(Bill Watson)give good performances as well.The direction by Stanley Kubrick is excellent and masterful,with Kubrick using tracking shots,over the head camera angles,zooms and close-ups giving a frightening and scary atmosphere. Powerful direction by Kubrick.The score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elind is brilliant,scary and terrifying and fits with the scary tone of the film. Great score. There is also a great use of the song Midnight,The Stars And You by Ray Noble Orchestra with Al Bowally.In final word,if you love Stanley Kubrick,Jack Nicholson,Horror Films,Ghost Films,Supernatural films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Shining,a brilliant Horror Masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made that you can watch again and again and belongs in every movie fans collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is true horror? a temporary shock delivered by a horrifying image of a split second? or a more menacing sense of claustrophobia and isolation? if to you it is the latter - then you will love this film.The Shining is a reminder that what is more frightening or dangerous is not a supernatural being trying to harm or scare someone for no apparent reason- but it is the menacing psyche of a deranged soul.In physical appearance this film does deal with the supernatural, but in depth it deals with themes far darker than that.Perhaps what is outstanding about this film is of course Jack Nicholson's performance, who as usual delivers something worthy to remember, and the unique cinematic style. A horror film that will give you the buzz of horror and a bit to ponder about...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A REAL HORROR FILM, better than all I have seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, what will I start with? Maybe the beautiful steadi-cam shots? Or the psychologically stirring pursuit scenes? Or maybe the chilling music?With 'The Shining' it is hard to put a finger on what makes the film so utterly disturbing and brilliant. I'm a teenage and I have never seen a scary horror film until this. Unlike modern horror films which use 'shock and gore' to promote fear this film uses and underlying sense of dread. Every shot tells you something is wrong and yet you never know what that 'wrong' is. The scenes where Wendy screams really get to you. They just make you feel afraid with her, not like "I will never sleep again" afraid but more of a trembly or shivery kind of afraid. The music adds to this. despite being like a 70's ELO track gone wry it really puts you on edge without ever telling you something is about to happen, a trait which all other horror films seem to have. Then there are the stunning camera shots. Steadi-cam was a brilliant invention and adds a kind of flow to the sense of fear. It lulls you into a sense of false security and then carefully delivers you into the hands of horror. Overall each shot builds the suspense.That is why I love this film. It SCARED me and didn't make me jump. I felt like I was amid the characters and yet I didn't leave the film fearing for my own life at night. It just made me realise how tangled and fragile the human psyche is. A superb film, 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste...very sub-par and well below expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a total waste of 3 hours of my life. OK, so Jack Nicholson did a good job in the lead. So what? The script was a disorganized mess that made WAY too much use of foreshadowing. You can't really use spoilers in reviewing this movie, because it spoils itself so much: much of the first half of the movie consists of clips of several scenes you see in the second half. The foreshadowing used absolutely destroyed any suspense/horror that would have existed for me (I can't be scared of it if I know it's coming).Next there's the music track: I'd like to say it consists of several great pieces of music that adequately set the tone for the scenes they accompany. Nothing could be further from the truth. Half of the instruments used I couldn't recognize and most of the musical effects seemed pointless.Finally there's the acting. As I mentioned above, Jack Nicholson's performance was superb. He's the only reason I don't give this movie a 1. The other characters? Except for the little boy, they were used as cardboard cutouts, and most of them acted that way. Even Scatman Crothers couldn't save the other acting performances: his considerable acting talent was underused.In short, not a classic. Just a gore-fest wanna-be dressed up as a masterpiece. Very avoidable and I will do so in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly I loved this movie, it was terrific and entertaining however it is considered to be a horror movie and at that it is considered to be one of the greatest horror movies, that made me think differently. First off I think that this movie had a great script, superb scenery, and near perfect acting; but there are also three things wrong that I see with this movie that could have been fixed: The musical score which is, nowadays, detrimental to a movie. The musical score in this film was horrendous, because of it every 'jump' scene in the movie was completely faked and the chase scene(s) lost value. The second thing is that the acting can sometimes be seen as overdone, yes I understand that shrieks of terror are supposed to have an impact but please don't over do it (cough cough, Shelly Duvall). And this is a minor thing but Jack Nicholson character wasn't very believable in the beginning, in my eyes he could ONLY be seen as crazy, other than that he was great. and the last thing is: loose ends. Yea there's a few things that should have been tied up such as the mystery behind room 213 and what the hell those two little girls where and why the boy 'suddenly' became possessed. I get that there's a certain amount of build up required for a movie but please don't put random crap in and then just not explain it. All in all, watch it. Its a good movie but keep in mind it does have some MAJOR flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creeping horror of the Overlook hotel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What in my opinion makes truly a great director is a person who can direct different movies in different genres and make them all equally work out as great ones. Stanley Kubrick was truly one of those directors. He did science-fiction, drama, comedy, war movies, documentaries and basically everything else in between. With "The Shining" he delivered his only horror production, which is among his best movies. But then again; is there really truly such a thing as a bad Kubrick movie in the first place? Yes, if you haven't noticed, I'm a real Kubrick fan. Looking back at his career, he probably was the greatest director that ever lived and he delivered masterpieces over the course of 5 decades. Not a whole lot of directors can say that. But even more remarkable is that he always sustained his own style. Each and ever of his movies have the same feeling and approach to it, which isn't necessarily following all of the 'Hollywood-rules'. He always continued doing his own thing, which makes all of his movies very consistent with each other, as well as unique and originals ones, due to its uncommon approach.Also this movie really isn't a very typical horror movie. It's very slow in its build up, which at the same time is also the movie its biggest strength. If you have to compare this movie to anything else it probably would be Robert Wise's "The Haunting", which features a sort of similar concept and build up and just like "The Shining", was an unique and unusual horror movie for its time.Its slow build up ensures that the movie has a constant feeling of tension and danger looming over it. You never know when a person is going to snap or when something creepy will happen. It makes "The Shining" a real unsettling movie to watch, which is one of the biggest compliments you could give any horror movie.The approach and build up of the movie also ensures that this movie is true beautiful one to look at. The hotel and the eeriness of its emptiness and remoteness gets captured really well on film. They really found the perfect locations for this movie. The movie features some real great cinematography in it, especially the steadicam work really contributes to the movie its many great moments.The movie probably also features Jack Nicholson's most definitive role in it. Yes, he has played some truly great and memorable roles and characters over the years but his performance as Jack Torrance is probably his most recognizable and best known one. But also the very young Danny Lloyd was real great. He acts very natural and acts like a true kid of his age, which is something not a whole lot of horror movies are able to get right. All of the characters in this movie feel and behave very natural and also interact that way with each other. All of their relations feel real, which is also one of the powerful aspects of this movie.In my opinion a movie everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has it's good points, but it is highly overrated. Not one of the best horror movies of all time. Not even close.Normally, those people telling you to read the book are either completely right, or just happy that they finally got around to reading a book that they had laying next to their bed for months at a time. This is definitely not one of those books that lays around waiting to be read. It read's itself.I'm not trying to advertize the book, just explain my reasoning for giving such a celebrated horror film just five stars.In the case of The Shining the book leaves you with a completely different feeling. And the emotional depth of Jack Torrence is actually explored... King's introduction at the beginning of the book is very informative. He explains how he and Kubrick had a disagreement over the presence of ghosts in the overlook. (Which I really don't know how the story works without the supernatural presence) But Kubrick heavily altered his screenplay and made an extremely successful horror movie out of it.I don't like it. - It does the same thing to the story that Kubrick did to A Clockwork Orange - He could have kept more of the characters development and internal conflicts if he cut out his famous scenes of atmospheric nothing... - I don't know who did the casting for this movie but... the wife, I mean c'mon. She's submissive and fits some of the character rolls but the acting on her part isn't believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grossly Overrated, But Not Without Interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To paraphrase Frank Rich's assessment of Stephen Sondheim musicals, to be a fan of Stanley Kubrick is to have one's heart continuously broken. Considered by many to be a masterpiece of eerie, psychic horror, I've always found this picture to be an ambitious, yet pretentious, bore, with a shamelessly overacted lead performance by Jack Nicholson, one of the best actors of the past half-century.While diverging substantially from the source material in the character department, Kubrick makes the fatal mistake of overindulging himself on his own concept -- the detachment from reality (or convergence with an alternate reality -- i.e, Jack merging into the "spirit" of the hotel) caused by isolation. For example, Kubrick repeatedly shows us shots of Danny (Danny Lloyd) riding his Big Wheel down the endless, cavernous hallways. What Kubrick confuses is the difference between conveying the tedium of the characters' lives with inducing tedium in the audience. The nearest parallel I can find comes in Henry Jaglom's "Broken Flowers", which derails substantially with the repeated (and seemingly endless) shots of Bill Murray's sideview mirror. This type of overindulgence reflects the inherent problem with a director like Kubrick, whose devotion to detail tends to overwhelm the need to keep the audience engaged.Yes, I know the fame of the "Here's Johnny" and "Wendy, I'm home" moments. Yet these are comedic relief, not terrifying -- and the film really has only a few truly terrifying moments, one of which (i.e., when Shelley Duvall reads Jack's "work") is nearly submarined by the overly dramatic music. In truth, the few redeeming factors to the film are an engaging supporting performance from Scatman Crothers, and being able to spot some of the ideas Kubrick had in mind before he beat them into submission. Nonetheless, a true disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crushing disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read Stephen King's "The Shining" once previously, in high school, before picking it up from the library last week and giving it another go. I didn't remember much about it, and oddly was more familiar with the film thanks to pop culture than I was with the book, having all but forgotten that I even read it. As over-written and even melodramatic as King's novel is, it is a genuinely intelligent, viscerally creepy (thanks to some stunningly effective psycho-sexual imagery, mainly), meditation on a family falling apart, a man's descent into madness and his battle with alcoholism, and it also develops the Overlook Hotel as a menacing entity all on its own, another character in the novel, if you will. By taking the time to develop genuine characters and a genuinely creepy setting, it ends up being a very rewarding experience. It's also written with real passion; Jack Torrance in the novel was autobiographical, as King was struggling to contain his alcohol addiction and angry outbursts at his family.However, I am not keen on faithfulness in adapting literature, not when it's done for the sake of being faithful anyway, so I was actually fairly excited to see what Stanley Kubrick, an artist who is better at his craft than King is at his (although I will always defend King as a genuinely talented author), would come up with, and excited to finally see a film I had heard so much about but never actually sat down and watched. Kubrick is a great artist and you have to respect his approach to most things because he makes them his own and usually makes them very worthwhile.Sadly, while I can't call "The Shining" a bad film, because it is quite entertaining (although at least 70% of the time for all the wrong reasons), and is an absolute marvel on a technical, visual level, and boasts a better finale (well, before the idiotic final shot anyway) than the novel's, it is disappointingly empty for a Kubrick film, and beyond just that doesn't even deliver on its own terms as a horror thriller. The phenomenal cinematography and camera work, as well as the typically (for a Kubrick film) excellent design make the film very atmospheric, but all the 'scary' bits, hyped by fans of the film as some of the finest moments in film history, are really absolutely nothing more than just more 'jump' moments, typical of most horror movies ever made. There's no psychology at work here, just cheap, boring, silly jump moments. The only jump moment in the film that actually is sort of effective is one which employs a bit of unsettling psycho-sexual imagery, but it's fleeting and uses a character who was used to far more disturbing effect in the novel. There is no need for workmanlike faithfulness when adapting a story for the screen, but if you have something that already provides unsettling imagery which is based on some very basic human fears and paranoias common to a lot of us, why on earth replace it with silly nonsense? The script is an absolute disaster, outside of some good dialogue. The characters are not used as effective archetypes, they are mere caricatures. Jack Torrance is, before he goes after everyone with an axe, just a damned prick. Wendy is one of the most annoying 'characters' in film history, characterized as a timid, whiny brat, although that also has a lot to do with Shelley Duvall's truly unbearable 'acting'. The kid, Danny, is just an obnoxious brat, and the actor they picked to play him is beyond abysmal. Moreover, there is the utterly retarded decision to have Tony live in his mouth (in his mouth!), and have the blasted kid go on and on in a silly voice, pointing at his mouth while doing so. Was him going on repeating 'redrum' supposed to be frightening? Egad! Nicholson is forced by the script to play a one-dimensional caricature even early in the film, and does a half-decent job, but when he does go nuts and starts chasing everybody it's a phenomenally mad, over-the-top performance and truly enjoyable and iconic, and immediately improves the film's entertainment value, if not its artistic value. The last half hour or so, bar the final shot, is startlingly effective following the unintentional hilarity of most of what had just passed.I'd love to at least say that "The Shining" was well-directed, but I'm afraid that even that praise can't extend beyond the visuals. I have immense respect for Stanley Kubrick, but he is partly responsible for Duvall's performance and for the kid's performance. His work as writer is what is truly disappointing however, as his additions and subtractions from the original work make no sense at all. You should go into a Kubrick film, specifically an adaptation of a literary work, expecting it to be quite different to the work being adapted. I really did expect something different to King's novel. I did, however, expect Kubrick to do something with the material that didn't ultimately amount to completely dumbing it down for the masses, especially not when the work he's adapting is populist enough as it is! The problem with this film isn't that it doesn't work as an adaptation (as many King fans say), but that it doesn't even work on its own terms. There's no tension here, no menace, because there's no development of anything at all. Jack's already mad when he arrives, 'the shining' itself is barely even mentioned, and the Overlook isn't developed or anything of the sort- it's just there, and it's only creepy because every so often Kubrick has the brilliant, never-before-thought-of idea to have something pop up and then disappear. A technically excellent film, but the script and performances ruin it. The hedge maze is lovely though, and the chase which occurs there is spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Movie, Horrible Adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been consistently over-rated. While it is, in and of itself, an okay movie, it is a TERRIBLE adaptation of the complex novel by Stephen King.I have to wonder how this film was ever made in the first place. Obviously Stanley Kubrick was given a half-page summary of the novel, and he went from there. When a director gets even the small details wrong, it's a sure bet that the important details are wrong, and thus the spirit of the novel is gone.This is, in no way, comparable to Mr. King's novel. A common problem with the film adaptations of his works is that the directors often, arrogantly, believe that they can make a better story with a few "artistic" changes. Kubrick is one of these arrogant directors, and rather than making the story come alive, he made it a parody of itself, thus ruining it.If you truly want to experience "The Shining", read the novel and skip the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the BEST scary movie of all time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so darned good and scary that I get goosebumps just thinking about it. I have read the Stephen King novel and seen the movie and in my opinion the movie is MUCH scarier. King supposedly didn't like the ample changes that Kubrick made but I think that they improve the whole thing greatly.Jack Nicholson is freaky as heck and he pretty much sets the gold standard for all "now-I'm-calm, now-I'm deranged" acting roles. (Robert DeNiro is also great at that kind of thing.) Shelly Duvall is fairly annoying, but in the novel Wendy was *supposed* to be kind of annoying. The hotel maze is a BIG improvement over the hedge-animals in the novel, and the twins are an incredible addition. (They weren't even in the novel at all.) The movie's ending is also MUCH better, scarier, and more satisfying than the novel's. (I love Stephen King but he often has a problem providing endings that match his novels' quality and scariness. See the novel "IT" for a case in point. Pet Sematary is an exception.) I have seen many, many horror movies in my time and "The Shining" sits atop my list. It's a masterpiece of suspense, creeping insanity, and things that go bump in the night. It's one of the very few films that I think merits a full 10 out of 10. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this short and simple. Stanley Kubricks The Shining delivers the most unique experience you can get from watching a film. Who could ever forget the suspense and horror of watching the out of his mind Jack Torrence choppin down the door to get to his house? REDRUM I've read Stephen Kings book and it is good. The movie is no different. Apart from some major changes. But compared to the remake in 1998 which follows every line, the original 1980 is far superior.Jack Nicholsen and the rest of the cast play there parts excellently. The scenes are well played and the pace is superb. Maybe the music could be a bit better.Anyway, from start to finish The Shining is worth watching. Even if its just to find out Wheres Johnny? -at the beginning credits look out for the helicopter shadow on the cliff side-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best horror films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The shining has to be one of the all time best horror films. And this is to be expected with Steven King as the original writer, Stanley Kubrick as the director and a cast including Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. This point is emphasised even more by its theatrical trailer which is simple in appearance, although it took 9 days just to set up, and manages to get away with this by capitalizing on the names of the people involved in the film. The story is about a man named Jack who takes his wife and son to a remote deserted hotel in order to look after it during the winter. This is the perfect setting for a film of the horror genre, as for a family of three this is an enormous hotel which coupled with the long winding corridors and the huge maze outside, is practically asking for horrifying things to happen. Also the character Jack is told that around 50 years ago a man murdered his wife and two children there, a blatant suggestion that they are not going to happily sit in the house for the winter! Moreover the fact that the film is based on a Steven King novel means that you expect that things will be uncertain and will jump out of nowhere when you are least expecting it.From the start there are clear signals things are a bit mysterious, especially with the young son Danny, and interestingly enough he gives an outstanding performance whilst not actually being aware he is in a horror film, as Kubrick managed to shoot the film without revealing this to him. Danny's famous scenes on his tricycle are filmed excellently and are somewhat unnerving as the silence heightens the sound of the clunking as he moves from rug to hardwood flooring. The film is made even more unnerving as all the characters seem to have something mysterious and unsettling about them. Another clever feature of the film is the visual portrayal of Jack's deterioration. Although he looks quite frightening even from the beginning, as the film progresses his appearance becomes more and more disturbing, and then when he is chasing his wife around the house it is utterly terrifying, not something to watch alone on a cold dark night. Furthermore the film in a clever as it does not bombard the audience with terribly horrifying, gruesome images, but instead uses the setting, outstanding acting, music and cinematography to its advantage. The film was and still is so influential that the catchphrase 'Heeers Johnny!' is known by people that have not even seen the film. Also the film manages to get away with not tying up all the loose ends and leaving a sense of mystery without disappointing the audience, a feat only accomplishable by a man of Kubrick's genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is Brilliance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is brilliance? Many will think Welles, Ford or Capra. We know the films and their honors. Are they truly brilliant achievements? To say that Stanley Kubrick is an odd director would be a gross understatement. He's known for his treatment of actors and his treatment of script. But we also know that the man gets results. Dislike him or revere him, he is one of the finest directors of the 20th century. This film is probably his biggest undertaking. It may be appropriate to say that this is his biggest commercial success or his only commercial film. "Clockwork' and "2001" did very well at the box offices, but they are hailed as critical and artistic pieces. This film is a horror film. No point in denying what it is. It falls into the category of the Jason's, the Michael Myers and the Freddy Kruger's. But...it also stands right next to the Damein's, the Exorcist's and the Serpent and the Rainbow's. It blends both styles of horror together and creates a feast of fear that one can sink their teeth into over and over again.I can watch Nicholson's over the top performance over and over again. It's one of the most challenging roles in his career. Many critics pose that the character's anger was poorly developed and motivated. I would disagree on that notion because going into the film we know from the meeting with Ullman that this guy is not right. I was not bothered by that. It's sort of a twist. It adds mystery . It poses the question: Who's really evil?...Jack?...or Danny? There were scenes that I actually felt myself rooting for his character, because he represents a hidden rage within all of his. We cannot deny it. To show that on film...that's brilliance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie trailer like The Shining 's leads you to expect an exploration of human depravity. Sure, it's horror, but it's a very unique subject latent with possibilities beyond torture and gore. But don't be deceived: you won't find anything of the kind in The Shining. For over an hour you will watch straight-up drama and everyday actions unrewarded by any of the goods the trailer promised you.Even if you like that kind of thing, just get some old Liz Taylor flicks, because this part of the movie is as inane as it is gratuitous. When you finally get to what you think is going to be the good stuff, you'll be disappointed to find a mere gross-out film, akin more to House of Wax than to Saw. But don't worry - it only lasts fifteen minutes. Seriously. The last twenty minutes of the movie consist of a quite suspenseless chase scene and a pointless revenge - both rife with inconsistencies. The combination of gratuitous sex, nudity and gore in The Shining, unrewarded by plot, character or theme, adds up to the worst movie I can remember seeing - and I've seen some serious trash....makes the Texas Chainsaw film seem like a masterpiece. The violence here is more pointless than Oldboy. However, not for children: low-brow humor, graphic nudity, and course language throughout.</fullReview>

The main character in the book was THE HOTEL and Kubrick did not see that, he turned it in to an ordinary story with ghosts. He gets Halloran all the way from Florida to Overlook just to kill him?

It has very scary scenes actually. But like I said before I didn't like it because there was nothing from the book.Overall, it's a good movie, you won't hate when you see it, but if you've read the book, you may be disappointed a little bit.P.S:I hated Shelley Duvall when I saw the movie.Her sound and her weird behaviours..There should have been a more "normal" person instead of Shelly Duvall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nasty, brutish and long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the best part of three hours long, The Shining simply flies past like an Andy Warhol triple bill: it's the very slowest commercial film I ever did see. Made by the world's most overrated director (who directed the world's most overrated film, 2001), with the world's second most charmless star (Jack Nicholson narrowly loses out to Marlon Brando in the Face You'd Never Tire of Kicking stakes), from a tuppenny-ha'penny shocker by arrested adolescent Stephen King, its reputation and popularity make a depressing comment on the decline of the movies.Depressing also describes the film itself: it's far too ponderous and literal ever to be pleasurably scary, settling instead for presenting a succession of predictably edited horrors that each go on for a sadistically long time. A handful of bravura visual touches only help draw attention to the miles of slow-motion stodge separating them. However, I will allow that connoisseurs of the thrills to be savoured from watching women and children being systematically terrorised are in for the treat of their lives.The Shining pretty much signalled the end of the intelligent and tasteful horror/spook film as a paying proposition, speeding the genre's descent into gore, grue and titillation. But it does improve one's appreciation of an earlier and less pretentious era of trash horror, typified by the films of William Castle and Roger Corman. Beside The Shining, drive-in teensploitation flicks like The Tingler and Fall of the House of Usher seem as scary as Don't Look Now, as funny as I Married a Witch, as poignant as Bride of Frankenstein, and - best of all - as short and fast as an episode of The Addams Family. Y'know what? They're just not making good rubbish like they used to ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got around to seeing "The Shining," and was looking forward to it with great anticipation.What a disappointment! All the wonderful power of the book thrown away for 2 hours of Jack Nicholson mugging and overacting for the camera. Everything is overlit like a 7-Eleven.The dialogue is wooden, the music intrusive, the direction straight out of a high school play....The cook makes the whole trip just to be killed in the hallway, instead of being the pivot point of the rescue and the key to the ending in the book. The maze is static and boring, and what happened to the malevolent topiary sculptures? The cellar is bright and clean and perky instead of the home of the heating plant from Hell that eventually destroys Jack and the hotel and releases the bound spirits. The whole history of the hotel is only referred to obliquely, and that was the heart of the story.Stephen King must have had a near coronary if he saw it, which I sincerely hope he never did.There is nothing worse than a purported horror movie that winds up boring and annoying. I watched it through to the end more out of disbelief than anything else. This is the same guy who made "2001"?Anybody for a remake?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read the book and been fascinated by Stephen King's portrayal of family issues, alcoholism, and the haunting nature of the Overlook Hotel, I figured I might as well watch the critically acclaimed film to go along with it. Man, was it horrible.To put it bluntly, it's as if Kubrick read the plot synopsis for the book, nodded his head, and made a movie. Almost none of the film reflects the events or atmosphere of King's original work. Not only that, but key components that are stressed over and over again by King are completely missing in this 2+ hour atrocity. Furthermore, no one but Scatman Crothers do a good job acting in this adaptation; even Nicholson somehow fails to deliver a decent performance. The camera angles were very well done, but the things they were showing made me face-palm at almost every scene, without fail. The music was excessive and eventually downright irritating. There wasn't a moment in the film when I was scared, mystified, or on the edge of my seat. Overall, surely a huge disappointment for anyone who's read the novel and expects anything at least remotely above mediocre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yawn.... Like, was this so-called "horror" movie really supposed to be scary? Was it!!?? Why does it seem to me that about every story that's ever been adapted for the screen from a frickin' Stephen King novel has somehow been destined to become a pathetic, little dud? Eh? Why? And, yeah, I know (all too well) that Stanley Kubrick was considered to be one of the absolute greatest Directors of his time, but, all the same, The Shining was an unquestionable misfire on his part.My opinion about The Shining's dud-factor comes from a clearly obvious flaw in Kubrick's directorial abilities. Yep. That's right. Put quite plainly, Kubrick did not, I repeat, did not understand the genre of Horror, at all.Had Kubrick comprehended the Horror genre to its fullest, then The Shining would've (most definitely) ranked right up there (in my books) with such brilliant horror classics as The Innocents (1961) and The Haunting (1963). But, unfortunately, Horror was not Kubrick's forte and this sadly showed, like a literal black-eye, in The Shining's final product.It didn't help matters much that actor Jack Nicholson was cast in the lead role. As the caretaker, Jack Torrance, Nicholson, like some amateur comic, went right off the wall at warp-speed and this preposterous transformation of his left us no bloody time to get involved in his plight.Yes. The Shining did deliver some mighty eerie moments throughout its rather lengthy story, but the overall effect of horror was, ultimately, a pretty dismal one. And being offered this sort of mediocrity just wasn't satisfactory enough for me to stay very interested, in the long run.To add insult to injury, I quickly found that I couldn't stand the kid who played Danny Torrance. Yeah. This irritating, little brat really got on my nerves, like you wouldn't believe. And, besides that - Well, let's face it - Danny's supposed ability to "shine" really ended up having very little to do with the story, anyways.All-in-all - When each one of these negative elements that I've described above were all thrown together and combined into The Shining's mix they clearly produced one of the dullest horror movies that I've ever seen.Yep. A very forgettable film, indeed.</fullReview>

I love to talk to supposed King fans who are totally oblivious to the fact that the film and the book have entirely different endings, not to mention the fact that huge chunks of the book has been omitted from the film.Anyway, to the film. The author Jack Torrence, his wife Wendy and son Danny all travel to the Overlook Hotel, where Jack has taken a job as the winter caretaker, a job which will allow him to earn money whilst he writes his latest book. Once there Jack becomes gradually withdrawn, becoming more and more agitated, developing writer's block, seeing visions of old guests and eventually losing his mind. Danny also begins to see people. He has been told by the hotel cook that he possesses a gift (the 'shining' of the title). What follows is Jack's descent into madness whilst Wendy and Danny come to the slow realisation that they must get out. But how will they escape with no telephone, no transport and a hotel that is snowed in?As a stand alone film it's good. But the continuous claim that it is the scariest film ever is ridiculous. This and The Exorcist should now bow out gracefully and allow the truly scary to take charge!</fullReview>

There´s nothing of his gradual mental downslide, which made the book so effective and full of suspense. Shelley Duvall´s acting consists mostly of wide starry eyes and stupid screaming. Only plusses of this mess are the production design, the camerawork and the music selection.

		<fullReview>I suppose that every classic movie has its detractors, and I'm afraid I'm one of these for The Shining. Didn't like it. First of all, I'll confess that Stanley Kubrick is not my favorite director, and the geriatric-snail pace of this movie reminded me of the time I rented 2001: Space Odyssey, another Kubrick film that didn't care whether it got my attention or not.Unlike other Stephen King stories that have been brought to film, this movie does a very poor job of defining the evil that our heroes/heroines must face. There are a few lines of dialogue at the beginning about caretaker Grady, but not much more then that before the weirdness starts. We don't know exactly why Jack goes insane, and it seems as though we're expected not to care.This screenplay is very light on heroes, too. Jack obviously is not one, and Wendy spends the entire film looking like she's missed several AA/drug rehab meetings. Even little Danny, the boy who has the gift of "Shining" began to get extremely annoying with his chanting "redrum" constantly towards the end of the film. The result of these bizarre, hysterical, annoying and unattractive tendencies meant that by the film's end, I didn't care whether or not any of the characters lived or died. There really was nobody for me to cheer for. The character of Dick Halloran was the closest thing to a hero, but like anyone who struts into a mayhem-infested house announcing his presence, he was just a little too dumb to survive this flick.Many accolades have been given to the film's music. I don't know why. It sounded as if the producers were really trying to save money, and hired a few kindergartners to bang on pots and pans for some key sequences.Jack Nicholson's acting was one of the two redeeming factors for me. His (unexplained) disintegration into a maniac is horrifying to watch, and it defines Nicholson's status as one of the best actors of the 20th century. However, I think he was misused in this film. The character always seemed to be slightly nasty, and by the end of the film I got the feeling that the character really wasn't going crazy, he was always this mean and just letting it show in it's entirety now time.The other enjoyable piece of this film was the camerawork, particularly the sequences that involved the camera chasing Danny's bike around.Didn't like the film, and I probably won't see it again. I'm just happy I can now recognize the classic scenes that came from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, if you do not agree with my header, I suggest you watch some of the dreadful adaptations of King by lesser directors. Also, watch the other attempts to follow after Kubrick, all giant failures. Stanley was famous for doing thousands of takes until he was happy with the scene. His photography here is without equal. The floor camera that follows Danny on his big wheel, shadowing behind him, listen for the sound of the wheels going over the carpet. The lighting always from below, like in DR STRANGELOVE, in the war room, here at the bar lighting up Joe Turkel's face making it look ghostly and unreal. The caretaker has always been there as we discover in the final shot of Jack at a party a century before. We get hints that he has been in there, dormant, with the attack on Danny. Like Leone, Kubrick was a visual storyteller, often showing images with only music as he did in 2001. Watch for the transformational scene where Jack stares catatonic out with creepy music in the background. We have parallel changes taking place; the hotel reverts to its demonic self as Jack changes commensurately existentially. By the end of the movie, there is little resemblance of either to their former selves. This is the central motif of Kubrick: existential contrast between our self image and our real nature. In CLOCKWORK ORANGE, we live in such a self delusion about the nature of our violent, dangerous society that we make Alex a helpless lamb and release him into the world we imagine to be a rational paragon of peacefulness, things do not go well. Here, Jack's surface personality conceals the murderous caretaker underneath. Once they move in the change takes place. Like Stephen Crane and Ernest Hemingway, Kubrick uses the blizzard as a naturalistic parallel to what is going on existentially inside of Jack. The cold comes out and takes over. Watch for the scene, where after Jack kills Crothers, he slowly rises with the hotel now completely awake and murmuring. Wendy now can see what only Jack and Danny saw from the beginning. The final chase with Danny in the snowy maze is one of the best shot scenes in any Kubrick film. What makes the film so terrifying is the master's use of sound, photography and lighting. Here, the maze appears ghostly with the footlights casting a foggy reflection around them. Turn your lights out, if you have never seen it before, get ready to get the crap scared out of you. When I saw this in a 550 seat auditorium, people were watching it with their hands barely allowing their eyes to see. I took one point away for Nicholson's overacting; I really like Jack, he is a great actor. From my view, he overacts and elicits unintentional comedy, mainly when he is ascending the stairs trying to get the bat from Wendy. Even allowing for this, it is a great movie. There is a reason Kubrick took three to five years to release a movie; what painstaking attention to making a perfect movie. I only wish he had lived longer; we are all much poorer without him.

I just rolled my eyes watching these z-grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky, incoherent movie.One place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get Mr Halloran up to the Overlook only to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes Halloran FOREVER to walk down. Really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film. Oh, and nice choice for Mr. Halloran's artwork Stanley! Black light afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Has there ever been a more "off," out-of-place shot in any movie ever made?I consider it a miracle that I was eventually able to bypass this turd, and agree that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important film, given the immense 'bad will' generated by both this stupid, stupid movie, and the cult of fawning but inarticulate Kubrick fan-boys, who couldn't describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the Library of Congress in front of them. Toss in the grotesque overacting of Jack Nicholson, the introduction of dumb one-liners at tense moments, and the Razzie nominated performance of Shelly Duvall and you have a very crappy movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be the most stupid film I have ever seen (spoilers ahead)! First of all, the plot is stupid. The little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it. We find that the kid has a gift, the "Shining". This gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool. Then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. He goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because... well, he feels like it. Why else would he do it? All of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub. The man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse, which is utterly disgusting. Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe. Then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies within minutes of hypothermia. Most movies aren't a complete waste of time, but this falls right into that category. The music is trashy, the characters are corny (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the storyline is slow, tedious, and boring. This movie is extremely overrated. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. I'm surprised it's gotten such a high rating on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick f*cked Stephen King's book big time!!! Casting was good, but the story got cut to shreds, and what was with that dumb @ss line "Here's Johnny"?. D@mn! Did he actually READ the book ? Heck he even knows his movie sucked because he forbade Stephen King from saying what he thought about Kubrick's adaptation (bastardization) in public ! Like I said, the casting WAS good, I'll give him that. Jack Nicholson played the part well. The actress that played Wendy was good too. Scatman Crouthers did well too. However, Kubrick put stuff in that wasn't in the book, and he ripped the ending of the book to shreds. Anyone who read the book knows the main character doesn't freeze to death in the story!! As far as I'm concerned, the only good movie Kubrick's made is "Full Metal Jacket". Don't waste your money on this movie, read the book instead! My review is REALLY " - 100 out of 10 " !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst horror film I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does no justice whatsoever to the novel written by Stephen King. The acting, by all three of the main characters (Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd) is sickening. I mean, Wendy is supposed to be good-looking, and they cast Shelley Duvall?!?! And Jack is supposed to be a nice guy - a good father and husband - at the beginning of the story, which makes for greater contrast when he goes ballistic at the end. But Nicholson looks and acts psycho from the get-go, making it is no surprise when he actually does go crazy. Considering King's novels are usually terrible (come on, a car that kills people named Christine?) "The Shining" was a haunting account of the hotel effects on the gradual demise of Jack's psyche. And what's with Tony morphing into this friend that "lives in Doc's mouth"? I suggest reading the actual book, or watching the 1997 mini series with Steven Weber and Rebecca De Mornay,which is true to the book and a much better movie. Because this version of The Shining is pure crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future. Signing a contract, Jack Torrance, a normal writer and former teacher agrees to take care of a hotel which has a long, violent past that puts everyone in the hotel in a nervous situation. While Jack slowly gets more violent and angry of his life, his son, Danny, tries to use a special talent, the "Shining", to inform the people outside about whatever that is going on in the hotel. Roger Ebert wrote "Stanley Kubrick's cold and frightening "The Shining" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? In the opening scene at a job interview, the characters seem reliable enough, although the dialogue has a formality that echoes the small talk on the space station in "2001." We meet Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a man who plans to live for the winter in solitude and isolation with his wife and son. He will be the caretaker of the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns that a former caretaker murdered his wife and two daughters, and committed suicide, but Jack reassures him: "You can rest assured, Mr. Ullman, that's not gonna happen with me. And as far as my wife is concerned, I'm sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it. She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict." The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see, this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall, her scene of finding Jack's rant All Work? is incredible, that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been called one of the best horrors of all time, I agree that it is rather good but I didn't find it as terrifying and gut wrenching as I had hoped. Although Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duval's acting may have been spectacular, this film may be a disappointment for the more book savvy movie goer since Kubric takes essentially is the name and "basic" plot lines everything else he changes entirely. In my opinion I think he should have stayed closer to the book.I remember being frightened by Steven king's version of the shining but found Kubric's somewhat dull with large plot holes; without such phenomenal acting it would have been difficult to watch. I was fairly disappointed not to hear my favorite line "Take you medicine" anywhere in the movie since that was such a key phrase, in my opinion. Overall it was worth watching but I probably won't see it twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i know that this movie is a classic horror. many sites put this as one of the scariest movie ever made. add that with jack nicholson and stanley kubrick reputation. i thought, this movie will be great. so, as a teenager born in the middle 90's without any film background, i watched it with such a curiosity and hope. i am excited at first, but then i always do in the beginning. the cinematography looks fantastic, especially when it was made in the 80's. jack nicholson acting is outstanding. a shout out to Gardy and Llyod (i hope it was the right names)actors , they scared me in a different ways than any other supernatural being in horror movies. and don't get me started with the soundtrack. it was more scary than the movie. i mean the soundtrack is literary the heart of it really, sometimes i found it was overuse and unnecessary though.beside the soundtrack, i found some other things that bothers me. first is the editing, maybe it's just a matter of preference, or generation, but how they cut off one scene to the other is off, the fading effect and the timing just not right, it really bothers me. second is, how it have scenes that should be cut off completely from the movie since i don't see how it has any significance in either plot story or cinematography like that scene where danny ride his tricycle,yeah, you could give the excuse that it showed part of the hotel, but honestly, that was unnecessary. three, there's some two cut off scene that for me better be made into one, like the first encounter between jack and his new boss. four, shelley duvall acting performance, i don't have to explain, just watch the movie. five, it's more of a psychological thriller than horror, yes, it has some supernatural aspects but it only holds like 1/3 of the story, less then 1/3 of the scenes in the whole movie. it's more focused on how Jack could change into the killer. so, it's not that scary for me who always associate horror with scary looking ghosts. maybe i should just give it more time to seep in though.the pacing is a little bit on a slow side, but it didn't feel like it. maybe because the whole story needs to be done a little bit slower. i don't mind though except that first tricycle scene.bottom line, it fall short to what i had expected. but, i have goosebumps now.... just by looking at jack nicholson face</fullReview>

Background information about how Jack. That is one thing that disappointed me. I mean I watched the film with someone who hadn't read the book and the amount of information I told them which wasn't included in the film felt like an awful lot.The edits were cut quite abruptly, one minute Danny was outside then next he was in the kitchen and there was no real sense of pass of time between the cuts.It was a good film but could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until I saw this movie, I used to hate all kind of horror movies. To me, they were boring and on most cases, they didn't have a strong argument or main problem. But when I saw this movie, the horror genre was born and die to me the same day. In just a few shots and images, Stanley Kubrick terrified me like I had never been in my whole life. Without being either grotesque or too "bloody", Kubrick scared the hell out of me just with zoom-in's and two or three recurring horrifying shots. The images, the colors and the perspective of the movie are one of a kind, and Stanley Kubrick managed to make a terror movie and still make it beautiful to the eyes! Jack Nicholson suffers from a magnificent transformation all along the movie, and he's so brilliant that it comes a point in the movie that you don't think he's an actor anymore. Danny (the little kid) made an excellent performance, he was only 6 years old! Since the day I saw my first Stanley Kubrick's film, I'm a huge, huge fan of him. But this movie blew my mind, and it became my favorite movie, even though I hated horror films. What does it say that about Stanley Kubrick's film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick's 'The Shining' was groundbreaking in its time. It's been the source of inspiration for numerous films hardly any of which were able to match up to the standard of it. Needless to say, it's got a solid story and some remarkable performances by Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Even young Danny Lloyd does a fine job.However, what's particularly notable and what makes 'The Shining' a unique experience is its atmosphere. The moving camera in the steadycam shots, the art direction (such as the psychedelic wallpapers, floor tiles etc), makeup and lighting are first rate.Yet, for me one of the most outstanding component of the film are the sound effects and sound design. The clever use of various tools to create this combination of sound that heighten the tension is done superbly. The visual effects are equally dazzling. Who could forget the flood of blood sequence? Several movies have 'used' this sequence to pay homage.Kubrick's film was a landmark that inspired many horror flicks but 'The Shining' itself delves much deeper into the human psyche (exploring themes of isolation and depravity) than the standard horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a work of art. I am not a big horror fan, so I generally stay away from them. But, I could not resist the great reviews, an excellent director, and Jack Nicholson. This movie blends the horror elements and a dramatic storyline together effectively and that is why this movie works.The Shining is about a guy named Jack Torrance who moves in with his family in the Overlook hotel since he will be working there as a caretaker. But little do they know that an evil awaits them in the hotel...Jack Nicholson is definitely at his best in this film. This could be is best role he ever played. He is effective and scary as Jack Torrance. However, I hated the character played by Shelley Duvall. I just found her to be annoying.Apparently, Stephen King was disappointed with this movie. I will admit that this movie does not follow the book closely and it's my favorite King book. But that aside, this is a very effective horror film and may be one of the best ever. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: Well this definitely is one of the most scariest movies i have ever seen in my life, this is exactly the kind of horror psychological thriller that scares me to the guts. I have seen it numerous times but as i decided to have a Halloween Marathon in October, i decided to watch it once again and yes it still had that same old nostalgia and creepiness that you might experience after the very first watch. So this psychological Horror movie is based on the novel by Stephen King, i have seen so many King's adaptation as i look back and he is a genius when it comes to suspense. Though i heard he wasn't too happy with this movie which really makes me think why? Anyways this movie is directed by the best Hollywood filmmaker Stanley Kubrick so yes you should not just expect the exact replica of what you have written i mean this man has his own way of doing movies. I have seen his movies like 2001, Dr. Strangelove and Clockworks orange and all three of them are the movies you would find in my Top 200 all time favorite movies list placed one after another. Now this movie to be honest i would not call it one of his very best work or a outstanding adaptation in a way it just doesn't come out so mind blowing like Clockworks Orange which again was based on a book but thanks to Kubrick and his style, this movie doesn't fall flat or average but in its own way it is just outstanding. I might have one or two complains but they aren't quite big, i still love this movie and i call it one of the scariest movie experiences i have ever had. This movie is the reason i still get scared of looking at Mr Jack Nicholson. Critics back then gave this movie some mixed reviews but now it is considered as one of the classic scariest movies. So somehow it got out of its own bad reputation and got what it really deserves, some praise.I don't know if anyone agrees with me but i think a Book and the movie adapted from it doesn't always have to be similar, one can use there own style and vision to create something different. But then this is not something everyone can handle, some filmmakers tries to do that and they create a mess but there are few who really has this ability to create classics from it and that is the exact case here. This movie The Shining is about a writer, Jack Torrance who takes a job of take care of a big hotel in the off season time with is son and wife. This hotel has some past which is still fully alive, his son has some psychic abilities or call it an accident but he is able to see weird things from Past and Future like ghosts. They are trapped by a snowstorm and Jack slowly becomes influenced by all of these supernatural presence that makes him totally mad and in this madness tries to kill his wife and son. Before taking this job as a winter caretaker, he have been told that this Hotel is built on Indian burial site and it becomes fully covered with snow and that a previous caretaker got cabin fever killing his family. His son already has this premonition about the hotel and you would see him from the start as a troubling kid talking to his imaginary friend, we are also being told that Jack had drinking problem from which he is now fully recovered as he one day hurt his son's arm. So some times passes but Jack still can't finish his writing project that he thought will complete in this isolated quite and peaceful environment and slowly kind of transcends into this violent and mentally unstable man. I don't think i should give away all the plot but will mention some of my favorite scenes, the problem with me is that i just don't like to synopsize a movie but rather give away the plot or basic points of the plot while avoiding the ending.There are some pretty terrifying moments in the movie and some really exciting scenes that are just a work of freaking genius. I just love that whole REDRUM scenes and that room 237 scenes. That long shots of the Gold room were a great idea. That final showdown in that maze or the typing of "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" in different styles on the endless papers by Jack. Or those infamous Axe scenes that took months to shoot. I mean there are so many scenes in this movie that will absolutely shock you and are so much fun. You might have seen all these and the other scenes being adapted in many other movies or videos nowadays and who can forget the parodies of them in various comedies. Well this movie has a really frightening atmosphere that slowly develops and Kubrick really makes sure it does. You really get scare by the every sight of the hotel and your heart pounds so fast at every scene. It has excellent cinematography being done, the camera moments are excellent and create a great sense of paranoia like we ourself are experiencing everything being shown.......

		<shortDescription>The Greatest American Horror Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining is a psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick.It stars Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd. The movie involves a writer, Jack Torrance,who takes a job as an off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel called Overlook Hotel.His young son,Danny possesses psychic abilities and is able to see things from the past and future,such as the ghosts who inhabit the hotel. Soon after settling in,the family is trapped in the hotel by a snowstorm, and Jack gradually becomes influenced by a supernatural presence as he descends into madness and attempts to murder his wife and son.The film was also written by Kubrick together with Diane Johnson and it was based on the novel of the same title written by Stephen King.Kubrick's eerie adaptation of King's horror novel starts when frustrated writer, Jack Torrance takes a job as the winter caretaker at the opulently ominous, mountain-locked Overlook Hotel so that he can write in peace with wife Wendy and son Danny in tow. Before the Overlook is vacated for the Torrances, the manager informs Jack that a previous caretaker went crazy and slaughtered his family. Jack thinks it's no problem, but Danny's "shining" hints otherwise. Settling into their routine, Danny cruises through the empty corridors on his Big Wheel and plays in the topiary maze with Wendy, while Jack sets up shop in a cavernous lounge with strict orders not to be disturbed. Danny's alter ego, "Tony," however, starts warning of "redrum" or murder spelled backwards as Danny is plagued by more blood-soaked visions of the past, and a blocked Jack starts visiting the hotel bar for a few visions of his own. Frightened by her husband's behavior and Danny's visit to the forbidding Room 237, Wendy soon discovers what Jack has really been doing in his study all day, and what the hotel has done to Jack.Kubrick's film is considered a horror film but it is more about madness especially when taking into consideration the character of Jack Torrance.Aside from madness,it also tackles psychic abilities that a person may have just like Jack's son,Danny.Also,it is definitely one of the best films ever made and DEFINITELY the GREATEST American HORROR FILM ever produced.Kubrick does put into the screen an engaging story and interesting adaptation that will put the viewer in the edge of their seats as the events transpire on screen.It was nominated for two Razzie back on the year it was released only later on to realize that the movie was simply ahead of its time. The performances of the cast are simply outstanding.Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is definitely over-the-top to a point that it elevates the movie to higher levels.While Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd provide great talent to match Nicholson's performance.Added to that,the soundtrack of the film especially those composed by Béla Bartók even raises the film into greater heights.Overall,The Shining ranks among the classics and the great films ever made of all-time.</fullReview>

Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. A lot of people complain that the casting of Nicholson makes Torrance appear insane before the hotel gets it's hold on him, but the full circle ending makes this perfect in my eyes. Kubrick creates a plethora of the most memorable horror sequences in film history, from a man in an animal suit giving fellatio to the infamous bloody sisters. There is a laundry list of images that sear into your brain and will stay there forever, giving you chills whenever you think of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start with the disclaimers: I am a Kubrick fan, total &amp; complete. I also dislike &amp; usually avoid the horror genre which is why it has taken me 26 years to get to The Shining. The latter also implies a distrust of Stephen King as an author.I enjoyed Stanleys work - the magical use of the camera in particular. I enjoyed Jack Nicholson doing his Jack Nicholson &amp; Shelley Duvallis always a favorite. The kid was damn good too. But there was a lot I didn't like. The dialog. It seemed so bad throughout the first half of the movie I kept wondering was Kubrick present for those scenes or did he contract them out to another? Or, was the sheer banality of the script &amp; acting actually a device purposely intended.I watched the whole thing but was left wondering where Jack's breakdown came from. He blamed it on Wendy but we didn't see any practical evidence of her restraining his career, lifestyle or aspirations. Okay he was a madman &amp; I guess we just have to believe that. Oh I suppose that the stereotypical teacher quitting work to write the Great American novel should be indicator enough of a mental crisis. But now Ithink I'm criticizing Mr King's contribution.I can only imagine how bad this movie would have been if it were undertaken by a standard director &amp; not Stanley Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made film that does not make any sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', judging by its cult reputation over the years, and its high rating on this website, has become a classic. It has gained a notorious reputation among film lovers. It was horror movie made by Stanley Kubrick, a director who arguably has had greater polarization than any other filmmaker in history. It has a legendary performance by the legendary Jack Nicholson. It has several scenes that have scared the crap out of people, most notably the 'river of blood' sequence. Does 'The Shining' deserve the reputation that it gets, or is it yet another confusing Kubrick film that is overrated?The story is loosely based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. It is about a family of three who have to take care of an expensive hotel for the winter. Jack Torrence (Nicholson) is a struggling writer who is the main caretaker. His wife and his son accompany him for the winter stay. What happens during their stay is a series of terrifying events that leads to a tragic conclusion. What is most interesting about 'The Shining' is that it horror film that not like most other horror films. It follows a formula of creating tension, rather that blood and gore. Although there is violence in the film, it is not as explicit or gory as other horror movies. This is a good thing and it is not surprising that Kubrick followed this formula. Kubrick, once again, shows his masterful craftsmanship for film-making. The lighting, editing, and overall technique is unparalleled. It can be argued that no other filmmaker could shoot a film as well as Kubrick did. But at the same time, this mastery is his greatest flaw. What he mastered in the technical side, he gave up in storytelling, character, and logic. 'The Shining' is often goofy and silly, rather than tense and frightening. It is very slow and many scenes and unnecessarily long. Two superstars exist in the film. One is Stanley Kubrick.The other is Jack Nicholson. Nicholson gives one of his most memorable performance as a writer who goes mad at his stay in the hotel. His acting is really over-the-top, but Nicholson is such a supreme actor, we do not care because it is Jack Nicholson. Actors do not get any larger than him. Near the end of the film, when he confronts his wife by his typewriter, is absolutely awesome film-making. Nicholson is at his most brilliant. The other people in the film are simply annoying. Shelly Duvall is so annoying playing his wife, it is no wonder Jack wants to "bash her brains in". Danny, Jack's son, is equally annoying. I believe child actors should play a very minimal role in adult films. Minimal meaning they should only say a few lines and take up no more than 10 minutes. I understand Danny is at the center of the film, but do most people really think children have the maturity and ability to be in films like these?Another thing that is annoying about 'The Shining' is its change of subject matter. A film that begins exploring themes of alcoholism and child abuse, slowly turns into yet another silly horror movie. Yet another typical horror movie with the madman with the ax and the screaming woman. One major thing does not make any sense. When Wendy discovers what Jack has been writing for months on end, it has a logical flaw. It suggests Jack has been crazy since the first day he stepped into the hotel, and that he did not go insane over time. Why on Earth would he be crazy from the beginning and why did his family not notice? Should we be asking these deep questions because it is yet another horror movie, or should be ask them because it is a Kubrick film? This is the frustration many people feel after they have finished watching a Kubrick film. It isn't that they don't "get it", they just don't get what all the fuss was about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In typical Kubrick fashion, here is a movie that is like flipping through a Time-Life "The Year in Pictures". The imagery is beautiful, but there is no story. And that's a real shame, because the story is wonderful. Don't get me wrong, I do like this movie, but I wish Kubrick had spent as much time developing the characters as he did working out beautiful steadicam shots. It exposes Kubrick for what he was, a photographer. Nothing more, nothing less.I think Jack Nicholson was great in the movie, but was probably not the best choice for the role since he looked crazy already. Shelly Duvall had the most difficult role, and I thought she did an admirable job.Kubrick took a great story and turned it into a disconnected, disjointed mess. Anyone who watches this film and thinks they have the slightest idea of whats going on is fooling themselves.Oh, and this movie is NOT scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson's greatest acomplishment. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE'S JOHNNY! These words have been drummed into our heads for the past twenty-five years, and with good reason. This is probably my second favourite film (next, of course, to 'The Exorcist), gives me shivers down the spine every time I watch it. Jack Nicholson gives a stellar performance as Jack Torrence, a caretaker gone crazy. His hysteric wife, Shelly Duvall, plays a wonderful role as Wendy Torrence, and portrays her exactly as how Stephen King's novel depicts.The music brings the film to an even greater level, using Hitchcock's technique of high notes at the suspenseful moments, and chills you to the bone. The heartbeats when Danny and Halleron 'shine' is brilliantly crafted, and 'Tony' reminds me all to well of 'The Exorcist'. And that's a good thing!Stanley Kubrick's use of camera angles and zoom-ins are a definite factor in the success of this film; as well as the mirrors (REDRUM).All in all, 'The Shining' is one of the world's greatest films, as well as my second favourite. *****/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Kubrick's "The Shining" an ode to "Lord of the Flies"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Striking similarities between Kubrick's "The Shining" (NOT STEPHEN KING'S BOOK!) and William Golding's masterpiece "The Lord of the Flies," a must read for anyone interested in the genius that is Stanley Kubrick.The opening shot of a solitary island (first image of the movie) and the presence of countless other symbols from Golding's book such as the conch, glasses, and individual characters: Simon, Ralph, Piggy and of course Jack, are striking evidence of Kubrick's willingness to stray from King's "Shining" (notice that the actual shining is not even a theme in the Kubrick's movie) and assume a much deeper themes like, the battle with one's inner demons, and what it means to be civilized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shining but not luminous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supernatural mysteries take many forms. Some are purely about the psychology of belief (for example, "The Blair Witch Project"); some present ghosts as banal facts of everyday life ("Truly, Madly, Deeply", and my own favourite, Kieslowski's "No End"); some depict literal terror ("The Exorcist") and some are just downright bizarre ("Twin Peaks"). The Shining is a highly peculiar but nonetheless effective amalgam of all these genres. Even at the end, the viewer has little more idea what is going on than the characters. I guess that's what makes its a mystery.The film is chiefly remembered for the collaboration of its legendary director and its equally legendary star. Stanley Kubrick's mark is certainly clear, especially in the beginning: he shoots every scene as if something terrible is going to happen; then cuts away abruptly, the threat unresolved. The scenes with the ghosts are shot so as to appear like bad cases of superimposition: the spirits are somehow in the same rooms at the living, and not, at the same time. The tense score is intrusive but successful.Jack Nicolson gives a good performance in the central role, but without the subtlety seen in his greatest films (see him in Five Easy Pieces for a truly great portrayal of a misanthropist). The other actors' performances are universally downright bad, in a possibly intentional parody of cheap horror films. The plot is likewise an assembly of corny, but beautifully executed, tricks.This is a seriously weird film, more imaginative than most in its genre but ultimately no less silly. Make of it what you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-conscious and in some ways cliched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much to recommend in Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining." Unfortunately, beautiful cinematography, clever editing and some good performances are subverted by a few awful cinematic horror cliches. A cobweb-covered dining table surrounded by skeletons? How many movies had we previously seen that in? I can name at least one -- 1972's "The Night Strangler." There must be many more. Was this supposed to be some sort of a joke on Kubrick's part? He didn't even add his own twist to it.And how many times does he repeat the identical shot of blood pouring from the elevator? At least three times do we see this. Did he really think it would continue to unnerve on its third replay (especially when we'd already seen the same shot months before in the trailer)? "Whoo, look at this -- gallons of BLOOD coming out of the elevator! Isn't that scary? Here, let's play it again. See? Whoo! One more time for the road!"Puzzling choices for a director as brilliant as Kubrick.And there is so much intentional humor in Jack Nicholson's performance that I don't find him frightening at all.</fullReview>

Having now seen it i can see why this scared the pants off millions of people in 1980 and even now is very scary although it does look a little dated. The acting is superb , especially from Jack Nicholson and from the young boy , Danny Lloyd. This big let down from the Shining is the end. Without giving anything away it has a Flat finish and is a bit of a cop out which , for me, spoilt the movie. Apparently Stephen king hated this adaptation of his book and refused to endorse the movie.Maybe the ending is the reason why. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another piece of trash in the IMDB top 250...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly after posting some comments about A Clockwork Orange, one of the few Kubrick films I can stand to watch, an enraged fan with in inflated idea of their own intelligence or strength began posting me abusive messages, so I thought I would start pointing out all the Kubrick films I have seen that do a half-hearted job of stealing someone else's creative work. Of course, The Shining is the most obvious example, being based on one of Stephen King's most popular novels, but what may not be obvious is just how bad the film is compared to the novel.I think my mother said it best when we discussed the film during a drive to the doctor's in order to get a minor skin cancer taken out of my face. She basically said that unless one had read the novel by Stephen King, you wouldn't have a clue what was supposed to be going on in the film. That's one point where the film falls down, but it is a minor one in comparison to others. Things like the unstable heating system in the hotel, the reason why Jack Torrance is out of work and needs the job in the hotel, and all the things the Torrances had gone through before the point where Jack is employed in the hotel, are the most important ones. These things play an extremely important part in the course of the rest of the story, explaining why Wendy suddenly turns on Jack, why Jack so easily falls under the spell of the spirits in the hotel, and so forth. Admittedly, it has been a while since I last read the novel, but this is just one juncture in a long pattern from Kubrick: a total display of disrespect for the author of the source material he was using to further his own career. Stephen King has also disowned this version of his novel, so it's not as though I am just making it up.Which is a shame, really. After the abusive messages I have been receiving from one insane Kubrick fan who obviously has no idea what the point of democratic society is, I have really lost every little piece of desire to see another Kubrick film. Never again will Stanley Kubrick's directorial work get the chance to prove to me that, contrary to the impression Eyes Wide Shut, Full Metal Jacket, The Shining (especially), A Clockwork Orange, and Dr. Strangelove give me, the man wasn't an overrated hack. I bet that jrockwell will be proud of themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not so much horror as annoyance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected quite a lot after my father said that this was "the creepiest film he had ever seen" but in fact it was annoying to watch.I have to add, that I did read that book which was definitely a mistake. When I read the book I was scared. No, not only scared. I was that freaked out that I was only able to read the last few pages with the lights on and the TV running - preferably commercials. So when I decided to watch the film I expected something equally terrifying, especially as I am a fan of Jack Nicholson. What I got was.....disappointing.I do not want to point out every flaw the film had (which were many) but only the two that annoyed me the most.1. Jack Nicholson. I really do like him BUT he tends to overdo it - which he did. Which he extremely did. There was no transition from loving husband to creepy guy he just was a creepy guy - which kind of destroyed the film. There was one grimace after another and that was NOT the point of the character.2. The annoying screaming woman. A sex-goddess and loving mother in the book she was turned into a not so sexy (to be nice) super incapable woman whose only purpose was obviously to annoy the audience. Ten minutes into the film (meaning 5 minute car drive and intro) my greatest desire was to see her die painfully, and the screaming hadn't even started.So, in conclusion: if you haven't read the book and feel a desire to get your eardrum ripped out: watch it. anyone else should definitely read the book.2 stars because of one good scene with the child and the age-bonus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Shining last year, and my first thoughts were pretty good, but not mind blowing, or anything. It was very entertaining, but moved a bit slow at the start. However, over time, this film really, really grew on me. Even without seeing the film more than once, whenever I thought of it, my thoughts would get better and better. Now, it has subconsciously worked up its way to my favorite movie ever!This is considered to be one of the best horror movies ever, if not the best. The horror in the film is excellent;very genuine. It isn't overly- shocking or filled with jump scares like many horror movies. It is genuinely creepy and creates an eerie atmosphere.The cinematography is outstanding; filled with very careful and clever shots. The music and lack of music certainly adds to the horror in some places.The acting is also a standout here, as Jack Nicholson delivers a fantastic performance as Jack Torrance, and Shelley Duvall as the frantic Wendy Torrance. Even Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers more than deliver on their acting.Overall, a very entertaining and authentic horror film that creates a wonderfully eerie atmosphere. Excellent acting to be seen as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining is one of the most monumental movies by Stanley Kubrick. Many people have issues with the fact that it didn't closely follow the original book, and contained themes outside of the original work's realm. Some conspiracy theories also surround the movie. The most popular of these, is that Stanley Kubrick hints that he filmed the moon landing and that he was apologizing for taking part in a huge government lie. Other theories include that the hotel they are staying in is hell, the film is about the Holocaust, the film is a metaphor for CIA mind control, the Illuminati killed Kubrick, and many others.Overall, this film is a classic, and the replay value of the movie is extensively increased with all the conspiracy theories that surround it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I never even heard of such names as Stanley Kubrick, Jack Nicholson or Stephen King before watching this film. In that case I would have probably found the film top-notch. I would have said something like "Wow, just look at THIS" whenever I came across the movie. Alas, not only had I "heard something" about the names, but also I had read the original novel prior to watching the film, so I had pretty high expectations about it. Nevertheless Kubrick almost managed to meet my expectations. Almost. For years I could not formulate my complaints about the film until I came across a phrase by Stephen King. Kubrick "thinks too much and feels too little" said Stephen. I deeply agree with him. It seems that "The Shining" is well thought over and re-thought in-and-out. It will give a lot of pleasure to your rational mind. However, the films really lacks on the side of the feelings. "Wow, this is so scary? or at least it looks so. Really, I should be scared here, because I am supposed to be" is what constantly reeled on my mind while watching the movie. But none of the strong feelings really touched my soul. So I find "The Shining" somewhat over-intellectualized, which is nonetheless not an excuse not to watch this classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember as a high schooler in the late 1970s our family passing The Shining paperback around like a sacred document, it was so treasured. It was our "I'm so scared to turn the page, but have to" book of our lifetimes.So, when I read the novel was going to be made into a quality movie and with...gulp...Stanley Kubrick directing, well, it was a dream come true. That was until a late night in 1980 as I left my local theater duplex feeling deflated and nearly angry.Spoilers AheadJack Nicholson: When announced, Jack Nicholson seemed like "the" choice to play Jack Torrance, a character whom battled alcoholism that that lead to injuring his son. Those remotely familiar with the book knew Torrance goes crazy within the grand hotel, and hell, Nicholson had won an Oscar flying over the cuckoos nest just a couple years earlier.For better or worse (mostly for the better), Nicholson as an actor who presents a natural on-screen quirkiness that can easily fall into an interpretation of instability. As we get to know Torrance during the job interview scene, we sense he's off kilter to begin with. so the character's spiraling from "Sober Jack" to "Crazy Jack" via ghost-encouraged drinking was minor. The lack of contrast between the two Jacks neuters the damaging and horrifying influence the hotel has on its winter caretakers.Maze vs. Topiary: The characters most people within my circle were excited to see realized on film where not human at all. They were the novel's killer topiaries. What a brilliant idea King had. Who, as a kid, has seen wild animal topiary and not fantasized that they would be like if they came to life. We never would find out. Someone wiser than King gave them the boot.That left us with an ivy maze substitute which became the setting for a rather anti-climatic ending to Torrance's life manufactured for the movie, sidestepping the novel's version. Sorry Stanley, your change was not equal in spirit to Spielberg's decision to change the wrap up of Jaws.The Premature Killing of Halloran: Heroic and beloved by novel readers worldwide, killing him off so soon seemed not only like a cheap stunt, but eliminated an potential adversary for Torrance and possibly saving the rest of the movie from being one long chase scene.The Framed Photos Panning Shot Conclusion: One of more discussed scenes in The Shining and ultimately the most shameful for Kubrick is the closing scene with a panning of framed vintage photos of one-time employees and guests who frequented the hotel. As we reach the last photo, who do we see partying it up with a group of others? Jack Torrance himself.Did the hotel absorb his soul? Was his image always in the photo, predicting his eventual visit and death? Who know and who cares! The exact same ending concept was filmed in the 1976 horror/suspense movie, Burnt Offerings, starring Oliver Reed and Karen Black. It was a total, nick, lift, rip-off by Kubrick.If the novel's plot points being massaged so greatly wasn't disappointing enough, those who are horror movie savvy surely were disgusted by the Burnt Offerings "homage".On the positive side, son Danny played by Danny Lloyd, was perfectly casted and Kubrick created a wonderful environment for the happenings to occur and expertly filmed it. Who will ever forget Danny rolling his trike around the halls of the Overlook?To be fair, opinions usually come from two camps: those who have not read the novel and look to it generally positively or mixed, and those who have read it and come away overall disappointed.I just walked away knowing the best King novel to date could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shining.The story revolves around a father who was a teacher, but decided to take a job as being a Caretaker for a 5 star Resort hotel, which would be shut down between November and May for winter. He would take this time to write a novel.He moves in with his wife and his boy Danny who has a very mysterious imaginary friend called Tony.Through out the stay in the hotel, Danny starts seeing things that weren't really there, IE two little twin sisters and an old lady in a tub.The father played by Jack Nicholson, was beginning to get a psychotic break down as the days went by. Finally he loses it and attacks his family.This movie is a classic. Probably one of my favorites of the horror genre. Of course it's silly now, but to its credit, it was made in 1980, which makes it a 32 year old film. The acting in this movie is surprisingly very good. Even for Shelley Duvall. The emotions put in this film is superb. I would agree though, when the kid does start having visions and it just cuts to his face being scared is more funny than anything, but for a 32 year old movie, they did it very good.The movie has no problems keeping the audience captivated with the whole psychological evolution that Jack goes through.It's no reason why so many other movies and TV shows have made reference to this movie. It's just so damn good.This movie has my applaud with a rating of 9/10!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the original Stephen King novel, I went into Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING with pretty high expectations. After all, this is THE quintessential scary movie, the film hailed as a masterpiece of horror, a brilliant and classic piece of cinematic awesome. And considering how much I loved the novel... ... You can guess where this is going, can't you? Despite the obvious skill of both director and cast (well, most of the cast) THE SHINING falls flat both as a film and as an adaptation, succeeding to disturb the viewer but failing to deliver on any of the pathos or depth of character that was present in the novel. The film, like the book, doesn't outright scare so much as it builds tension to breaking point, forcing the invested viewer to the edge of their seats without them even realizing. However, by electing to ignore the more human aspects of the story, the film forgoes many opportunities, primarily with the characters. Where the novel made you sympathize deeply with the characters (thus making everything that happens to them that much more terrifying), the film almost immediately distances you from them. I could go on for hours about how badly the individual characters were butchered, but let's keep it concise: - Novel!Wendy has a great deal of inner strength, is fiercely protective of her son, and though she tries to keep her family together she is not afraid to stand up to Jack when he goes too far. Movie!Wendy does nothing but shriek, cry, and lie back and take much of Jack's (early) verbal abuse with a quiet and terribly pathetic subservience. - Novel!Danny is a precocious and endearing child; intuitive, kind, strong, and very, VERY brave. Movie!Danny is irritating, dull, mumbles half his lines, and spends a great deal of the movie croaking "REDRUM!" like a particularly grating parrot. - Novel!Jack is a sympathetic (though deeply flawed) character who genuinely loves his wife and son and truly wants to fix their all-but broken life. This makes his eventual descent into madness both horrific and tragic. Movie!Jack is cold to his family from the get-go and seems ready to snap the moment he sets foot in the Overlook. Though the film is definitely chilling and enjoyable, it lacks the novel's essential humanity and suffers for it. Kubrick's creepy but emotionless vision of THE SHINING sucks the life and pathos out of a very human horror story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling Stephen King adaptation, with Kubrick trying to be different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very loosely based on the book, which is very chilling and shocking, this is a great film. Having seen The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and It and liking all three of them, I knew I should check out the Shining. I did feel that Jack Torrence's hallucinations, apparitions and time-warps were introduced a little too quickly and the build up to the ending was rushed too. But it is very stylishly filmed, making perfect use of an amazing set built at Elstree and a gliding Steadicam, and the music is atmospheric. The story is also effective, and there are really nice touches in the script. Kubrick here tries to be different, and I think he does a superb job at it. The Shining is more chilling rather than shocking, the blood flowing from the doors and the old woman in the bathtub made my hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and is constantly discomforting in an eerie sort of way. Jack Nicolson gives a barnstorming performance as Jack, a performance that is both hammy and disturbing, and Shelley Duvall does decently in a somewhat thankless role. Young Danny Lloyd is superb as Danny, his chanting of Redrum especially became increasingly hypnotic and distorted. The film concludes with a fairly suspenseful ending, and is overall a film with one or two problems and a very loose adaptation but it is a chilling adaptation with Kubrick succeeding at being different. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "SAW" of horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please bear with me, when I say that this is the "SAW" of the horror movie genre. It doesn't mean that "The Shining" has a lot of explicit violence (only some), but that it constantly attacks your nerves. There is almost no moment of peace in the entire two hour movie. Accordingly you leave the theatre exhausted or you just snap out of the story halfway through because it is just too much. At the showing that I just came home from a guy in the front row fell asleep and started snoring so loudly, the whole theatre could hear him. Two guys next to me left the cinema saying that they found the movie boring. I don't think it is boring. It's just relentless, never allowing the story to calm down now and then.Stephen King , the screenwriter, is a journalist who supposedly took a pretty neutral stance in his articles about the subject of horror. (This information was given to the audience by the guy who introduced the movie). Now, I find that a bit surprising, because "The Shining" isn't really that neutral in its outlook. Sure, it probably strives to be a realistic depiction of the constant physical and emotional pressure of being in a haunted hotel, but we only ever see the American side of things. The American caretakers, all of whom are the best of people with the best intentions - the lead character fulfilling the old John Wayne-cliché again (and having him "break down" once or twice doesn't change a thing about that). Whenever a spook shows up, he's imaginary or at least a threat. I am aware that this, too, is a reality for American caretakers, but STILL... for a depiction of reality, this movie relies too much on theatrical moments, some out-of-place one liners and clichés.Still, "The Shining" is properly unsettling. It makes you feel the constant paranoia of being in the war zone. The cast is good (especially Jeremy Nickols in the lead) and so is the score. Whereas the pictures and the pacing are "in your face" (quite literally actually, we mostly see the characters in extreme close-up, which adds to the tense atmosphere), the score is almost play-like. That makes for a nice contrast. If the action on screen is about the here and now, the apocalyptic score transmutes certain moments into scenes that show the eternal madness of man killing his own.Those are the moments when "The Shining" works best. However, it hurts the movie that we're only shown the American side of things. We only see the Americans who try their best, but are broken by fear. That may be one aspect of this horrible situation, but it's either blue-eyed or ignorant to make this the only point of your film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone should have told Kubrick that films don't have to run for nearly two and a half hours. Some films shouldn't be made at all. 'The Shining' belongs to that over-populated mass of things that subtract from rather than enhance life.The story makes no sense. The acting is embarrassing. Scene after scene drags. The excessive running time destroys any suspense and gives the viewer too much time to think about the stupidity of the plot.Presumably Kubrick, bloated with self-esteem, thought he'd redefined the horror genre with this nonsense. 'The Shining' is as bad as 'Lolita', quite an achievement.If this was a directorial joke, it was an expensive one without a punchline. If Kubrick thought he'd done a good job, he was sadly mistaken.

		<shortDescription>Most overrated movie of the past 30 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's the big attraction of this film? Have the folks who rate this movie so highly ever even READ the Stephen King novel upon which it's supposedly based? Kubrick made so many crucial changes that you can't claim this movie was a true adaptation. I'm not saying it was a bad movie, or that it didn't have some good moments, but as an adaptation of one of the great horror novels it was most disappointing. Kubrick deserved every "brickbat" that King has thrown his way, and more -- one can only imagine the horror King must have felt upon seeing his book so thoroughly mangled. Yes, Kubrick was good on such efforts as "2001" "Dr Strangelove" and "Paths of Glory", but he simply had no feel for a movie about the supernatural. We'll never know just what kind of classic a director like Robert "The Haunting" Wise would have done with this material.How does this movie fail? Let us count the ways: 1) Kubrick seemed to go out of his way to shoot "against type" for a scary movie. There's no feel of a 100 year old hotel; his Overlook is as pedestian as a Holiday Inn in Phoenix. He harshly over-lights many scenes, which dissipates the scariness, and is down-right ANNOYING. An old hotel up in the mountains during winter SHOULD be dark and foreboding! 2) Shelley Duvall is totally miscast. She was fine for cartoon-come-to-life Olive Oil, but is clearly out of her depth in this one; she can't register any emotion convincingly, and seems to be reading her lines off cue cards. Some of her acting is so bad it's laughable, such as the scene where Jack menacingly backs her across the lobby to the stairwell; Nicholson's good acting only serves to make her performance all the more embarrassing and excruciating. You're practically rooting for Jack to grab that bat and beat her brains in. Add to her miserable performance a frumpy, clown-like wardrobe &amp; stringy hair that hangs in her face, and you get a pathetic caricature of King's Wendy. 3) Bad casting of Stuart Ullman and Dick Halloran. In the novel, Ullman was a bastard and there was a mutual dislike between him and Jack. In the movie, he's played by Barry Nelson, and comes off as affable as Ozzie Nelson! Why Kubrick cut this tension out of the script is a mystery. And Scatman Crothers as Halloran? Just didn't work. Reading the book I got a mental image of Ossie Davis or James Earl Jones, both accomplished actors who could've brought some meat to this part. Scatman's Halloran is so inconsequential that we hardly miss him when Kubrick decides to add alittle gore and has him axed to death (another unfortunate departure from the book). 4) Unknown Danny Lloyd as Danny was a very poor casting decision. Not only couldn't this kid act, but he brought none of the crucial sympathy to what was undoubtedly the book's central character. King's Danny was such a likable, charming little boy that King actually changed the ending of the book from what he'd originally intended -- to have Jack kill Danny. But the screen Danny is so colorless that he becomes a zombie, and like Wendy, you don't care if he lives or dies. Instead of true para-psychological abilities, you feel he's simply a weirdo who likes to growl while moving his fingers. (Again, another unfortunate departure from the book...couldn't Kubrick of had "Tony" manifest himself in visions, as King had? Can you blame them for not taking this silly hand-puppet act seriously?). 5) Kubrick downplays the supernatural aspect of the Overlook, instead concentrating on Jack's decent into madness. This change of focus, more than anything, show's Kubrick's lack of feel for a supernatural thriller. Instead of being a weak and flawed man who becomes the helpless pawn of the evil hotel, Jack's behavior could be ascribed to destructive psychological tendencies which are accentuated by "cabin fever". 6) Too many plot changes from the book to mention, but the substitution of an inert hedge-maze for moving (and menacing) topiary animals is a big one. True, the level of special effects in 1980 would have posed a problem, but I believe an imaginative director and crew could have pulled it off. Changing the climax from the Jack-Danny confrontation up on the 3rd floor to the characters running around the maze -- and most incredibly, Jack never actually CATCHES UP with Danny -- was a cheat, pure and simple. It robbed the movie of the necessary emotional climax, as well as the profound point to which everything in the book was moving towards. Since Kubrick rewrote the ending so heavily, including omitting the attack on Wendy, he could think of nothing better for her to do at this time then to have her wander about the Overlook, stumbling upon one silly spook-show after another. This device was certainly pointless and a cheap trick. The only reason I give "The Shining" even a "5" rating is for the admittedly bravura performance of Jack Nicholson. While his performance during the first half of the movie is stilted, he does make up for it during the second half. In fact, without his contribution, this movie would have been a long-forgotten flop. Stephen King's miniseries "The Shining", while not without it's problems, did fix a lot of what Kubrick botched. The miniseries certainly deserves the praise that's been mistakenly lavished on Kubrick's version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is a quite terrifying movie. the simple one made of go to live a season in a hotel of that species during certain time and with so much solitude (besides their ghastly companies) they already make it terrifying. Stanley Kubrick (RIP) it was one of the best directors in movies of the last times, and "The Shining" it marks the rule.in spite of everything that said previously, I should say that I had left the movie big, and I have to notice that it should be more terrifying in its time, since right now they leave movies so or more terrifying than this, although I admit that that time 1950-1990 were top for movies of this type. My vote 8/10.</fullReview>

If they did, they would realize how banal this film is. There are some nice 'Kubrickian' touches, but the director himself later called this his worst movie, which it is. Those that were scared by it, would probably be scared of Mr. Rogers on valium. If you REALLY want to have the bejesus scared out of you, trust me, read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a horror masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is nothing short of a creepy masterpiece which is an ingenious adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name. The movie stars Jack Nicholson in his best performance as Jack Torrance a former school-teacher, turned writer, and now is applying for a hotel job for the entire winter and takes his wife Wendy (played by Shelley Duvall) and their only son Danny (played by Danny Lloyd) to this beautiful looking hotel called the Overlook , and then Torrance starts to get really insane trying to kill his wife and son because from what I believe is because he didn't get to spend time with them or maybe he was writing for too much time. This spellbinding horror film is arguably Kubrick's greatest achievement along with 2001: a Space Odyssey (1968), Spartacus (1960), and Dr. Strangelove (1964). This movie just made me not keep my eyes away from the screen because of how masterful this movie really is. One thing I am really disappointed with is that when my parents compare this film to The Omen (1976) I don't get how they think that that film was better than this movie when it actually wasn't because it had more suspense, and more creeps for which The Omen didn't, And by the way if you are one of those people who think that The Omen is better than The Shining I really do recommend that you watch them both again and you will know when you change your mind.</fullReview>

Sleeping would've been better than watching this s*itty movie. Advice; this is NOT a 'Horror' movie at all. Don't waste your time watching this boring movie. I'm a fan of Jack Nicholson's great acting, and he does act amazingly in this. But the story is boring, total waste of time. Do NOT watch! I've never written a review on IMDb before.

		<fullReview>I haven't read the Stephen King novel, which was supposed to be much better. But it's easy to see why he would have objected to this movie production.For one thing, the caretaker is supposed to be a normal human being who slowly becomes mad as he stays at the hotel. But Jack Nicholson's character seems sinister from the beginning. Instead of slowly going mad, he seems to have been that way from the beginning with nobody else noticing. Yet the movie implies that the ghosts of past residents are for real, as one was able to physically free Jack from the pantry. Did they drive him mad, as they presumably did to the previous caretaker? And what would be their motive? Nothing is hinted at.Also, there are elements such as the child talking to his finger, a blood-filled elevator, and two ghostly twin girls who appear sporadically, none of which (according to other reviewers) appear in the novel. What purpose do they serve, since they don't advance the story in any way? The "shining" is presumably how the boy telegraphs his sense of danger to the man in Florida, summoning him, but why he has it is never covered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over appreciated film and director butchers the world's most brilliant modern day writer's tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't dislike The Shining. I just feel, as did King, that Kubrick's The Shining butchered his story and it does exactly that. I guess supposedly The Shining's artistic value is huge being that Kubrick is such a brilliant director but I don't see anything to the film that makes it such a Kubrick masterpiece. The core ideas are still in tact from the film but it seems as though Kubrick rushes everything through and in the process leaves all the meat and potatoes of the characters and the story in the dust. The characters in the film have virtually no depth, they are very shallow characters and the casting for the important roles couldn't have been more wrong. That being said Kubrick's The Shining makes a great horror story and is downright disturbing in numerous scenes. It gets a lot of it's "classic" status from many of it's more disturbing scenes including the blood in the elevator, REDRUM, the disturbing portrayal of Danny, and of course Nicholson's infamous portrayal of the madman but the problem with all of this is the story around it is so weak. You don't see Nicholson's decent into madness, it practically happens on a dime, and you don't get a sense of the evil hotel, everything just lumps together quickly, and the ending of the film makes such little sense that it leaves you frustrated and scratching your head.Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance. Nicholson is a master actor, even nearly thirty years ago he was brilliant on screen and although his performance and character doesn't really match that of the novel he is still a decent choice for Torrance. The problem is Kubrick doesn't give Nicholson any depth to his character at all. So he gets to show sane, and then completely insane with nothing in the middle. Still it's easy to see why Nicholson's performance is so memorable because he is terrific. Shelley Duvall might be one of the worst actresses I've ever seen and casting her in this role might be one of the worst decisions I've ever seen. She is god-awful in this role and not to be mean but MAN is she ugly...holy crap. She was nominated for a Razzie for this role and I usually hate the Razzie's but they were dead on for this performance. She doesn't come close to fulfilling King's novel version of Wendy and she's just terrible in the role. Her facial expressions and downright hilarious acting makes her performance really, really awful. In his one and only performance on the big screen Danny Lloyd plays young Danny Torrance with a certain mundaneness. I mean I give him enormous credit for the scenes where he's "talking to Tony" and his belting out "REDRUM" which still gives me nightmares but apparently Kubrick shielded him even knowing he was in a horror movie (which surprises me and I gain a little respect for Kubrick for doing that.) Still Lloyd's performance is just adequate, nothing really huge about it. Finally veteran actor Scatman Crothers plays Dick Hallorann in a small role that isn't even really a "supporting role" but that's what they consider it. He does alright but doesn't even come close to the terrific role played by Melvin Van Peebles in the King Mini series version. But then his role is very small and like with the other characters, Kubrick gives them nothing to work with.Apparently I'm not a Kubrick fan because if I could pin point one thing wrong with The Shining, it would sum up into Stanley Kubrick who wrote the script and directed the film. I mean the man was rumored to be a monster on set forcing hundreds of re-shoots and yet manages to get no depth to these amazing characters? He focused far too much on the horror aspect of The Shining and missed all of the key elements that makes it brilliant. The film is okay and mostly okay because of Nicholson's performance once he becomes the maniac, and the hedge maze idea is cool but NO substitution for the Hedge animals from the novel and the later mini series. Some people passionately love Kubrick's The Shining but I think it's a matter of feeling like they have to because if you really watch it from a King fan perspective you'll realize there is so much missing and you'll understand why King himself didn't like this version. Still it is a classic and very watchable (except for Duvall's horrendous performance) so definitely see it but read the book and watch King's version of the mini series as well because that will give you a true look into The Shining. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a disjointed, "Kubrickized" adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" several years ago, and my overall impression was that it was a decent, yet unspectacular horror film with a few creative touches. Following this, I read Stephen King's flawed yet commendable novel and had a chance to view the miniseries, which was a much better interpretation than Kubrick's version (the acting and production values were abnormally strong for a made-for-TV effort). This was back in 1997. After a five-year wait, the much-anticipated (by me, at least) official video release of the miniseries prompted me to put both versions up to scrutiny.I popped in Kubrick's hailed and derided film, cleared my mind to be as impartial as possible, and wound up disappointed in how much the film had deteriorated in value. While "The Shining" had never been a masterpiece, I was shocked at how little was under its polished surface. Even if you disregard (or are just ignorant to) the merits of King's work, "The Shining" can barely stand on its own as an individualistic, one-of-a-kind horror film. Kubrick's narrative is filled with the cinematic equivalent of foam peanuts en lieu of emotional content and characterization, not to mention general coherence. King's book cleverly explored the parallels between the possessive effects of alcoholism with the possession of a man by ghosts--this film is about endless tracking shots of a kid on a bigwheel, blood cascading out of an elevator, and Jack Nicholson chewing the scenery as he limps around with an ax.Point by point, here are my problems with this adaptation (my comparisons/contrasts were made after viewing):1.) The cast. Nicholson (who is completely inappropriate for the role of Jack Torrance)'s pointy eyebrows and trademark grin paint him as a psycho from the get-go, yet I never found myself fully convinced of his possession, and his excessive tongue-waggling and eye-rolling made the performance all the more laughable (to see a charismatic actor leashed, with successful results, check out Robin Williams in "One Hour Photo"). Shelley Duvall's "aw-shucks" personality seems out of place, and she looks absolutely ridiculous running around with a knife (she and Nicholson are one of the most unconvincing couples to grace a movie screen). And, that shrill "redrum" chant aside, Danny Lloyd gives a robotic, lifeless performance. One of the reasons for "The Shining"'s failure is that this group of offbeat performers just doesn't gel, even as a faux family. Which leads me to...2.) the screenplay, by Kubrick and Diane Johnson. Even if it hadn't been culled from a previously published story, it still would have fallen flat. But since it was, it seems necessary to bring up some contrasts with the novel that have a huge bearing on the events which conspire. I never criticize a film for not being a word-for-word adaptation (anyone who sets their expectations that high is just asking for a disappointment) as long as the fundamental points are covered. Story elements that would have been easy to incorporate, such as the boiler (a heavy-haned symbol, granted, but it works), Jack's escalating, obsessive commitment to the hotel (here, Nicholson spends most of his time in a hungover state while DUVALL tends to the hotel...sheesh), the 'shining' itself (limited to a few scenes, and are mostly throwaways, used to--in desperation--heighten dramatic intensity), and the sordid details of Jack's unemployment (beating up a student) are just a few details that are either truncated to insignificance or ignored completely. As a result, the characterization is frustratingly one-dimensional (so the blame can't be pinned solely on the cast), and the plot--as it's stretched out for 144 minutes--is appallingly shallow, with motivations and actions that seemingly come out of nowhere.3.) The previous problems do nothing to help the lethargic pace of "The Shining." Kubrick, who is notorious for his overlong "epics," has made a film where little of interest happens (could that bathroom scene be just a LITTLE longer??), but that doesn't stop him from dragging that nothing out to damn near two-and-a-HALF self-indulgent hours. (Some actually seem to use this as a gauge to measure the quality of the film, though--the more minutes, the more brilliant "art," indeed!) I find it ironic that King's miniseries runs 2 hours longer than this, yet has a far better sense of pacing.4.) And, a major annoyance I have with "The Shining" is the death of Hallorann, which doesn't get mentioned much (in positive reviews, at least). It's not that Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) is a memorable character here, but the fact that his death took the final straw in the overworked yet lazy script. It was as if Kubrick and Johnson, completely out of ideas, connected the dots to this inevitable conclusion where, in order to justify the "horror" tag, Hallorann travels a couple thousand miles, only to get an ax in the chest AND provide Duvall and Lloyd with a means of escape. Talk about shallow writing--the unsatisfactory conclusion that follows leaves much to be desired.I did like a few (very few) things about this "Shining," though. I found the opening aerial shots to be absolutely breathtaking, and the occasionally creepy score was effective (even if it set a mood that was never fully realized); the scene in which Nicholson meets with the hotel manager for an interview is very well-handled--observe the self-conscious body language, the hospitable smile, and his use of "please" and "thank you". For a few minutes, Nicholson is an average-Joe applicant with a friendly tone, both authentic and convincing. It's a shame it's the only time in the film where anybody--in front of or behind the camera--exercises any restraint.In the end, my favor lies with the 1997 miniseries. Kubrick's "Shining" plays out like a pretentious slasher film for those who deem slasher films beneath them.3/10</fullReview>

Everything about The Shining said "expensive", but nothing about it said "scary".It truly baffles me that such an impressive director as Stanley Kubrick would ever consider tackling the mess of a typical Stephen King horror novel and try to adapt it to the screen.All-in-all - The Shining was a dud. There was only one murder in it, which, in my opinion, was a completely unforgivable body-count when it comes to any horror film.Two of the biggest strikes against this film were the casting of that goofus, Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance and having that pudding-faced kid, Danny Lloyd, as Torrance's brat son, Danny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Horror From Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Shining for Kubrick is about the mystery of places and people. The people staying at the Overlook, the Torrances, but also the Overlook and the sense of ghosts who perhaps know all too well their accursed fate. It's also a work of mad genius, cribbing King's book (which was scary and moody on its own if heavy on exposition) for the sake of giving a viewer a sense of total and unnerving dread. It's perhaps also a really great 'ordinary people are not what they seem' saga. And about writing and Jack Nicholson.With Nicholson's performance, by the way, it's meant to be such a GIANT performance, and it either gets to you or it doesn't. This is a BIG performance that ranks with the likes of a Noh theater production, as if Nicholson had a touch of Mifune in Throne of Blood surrounded by those ghosts of Macbeth. We only gets hints about this man's sanity early on, then his growing boredom, and then a sense of, really, what the hell is going on with this guy. In the book it's made much more explicit: the hotel's gotten to him, it's in fact taken him over, in order to get to the boy. In the movie you can't be sure of it, because Kubrick and Nicholson keep you guessing, even as what you see is what you think you got.Also, Shelley Duvall is underrated here; it's a performance that's perhaps not as great as Nicholson's, but that's because she's Wendy isn't the one the hotel gets to, at least in the same way it does for Jack Torrance. It's an exagerration of what one would expect a normal everyday mother- who also happens to live with and brush aside domestic abuse and alcoholism, or try to bear with is as she can- to react in this environment. It was said Kubrick pushed Duvall quite hard during the production, and it shows for all the best effect. In fact the Shining film wouldn't be so great if it weren't for pushing hard against what is possible. It taps into the soul of the book but translates for a medium that needs spatial sense, the thread of ambiguity (which can be a no-no for some filmmakers but for Kubrick is nothing short of mandatory) while presenting us with really disturbing things.It's not particularly a film to show to a nine year old, but I saw it when I was nine anyway, and was moved, confused, running-out-of-the-house freaked-out (woman in bathtub, seriously), and knowing deep down I was experiencing some visceral thing here. The camera, the little girls, the music, the "all work and no play", the hedge maze, Nicholson, all of it comes together in one of those ultimate tales that makes perfect sense and no sense at all. It also gives the chance to ask questions, which the book, as amazing as it is, didn't let you do. Film as a medium gets a brooding kick in the nuts by the Shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With benefit of hindsight and a clear perspective, the film is obviously a disappointment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick takes an arguably weak Stephen King literary tomb and possibly reads more into the material than what King had originally cooked up. Jack Nicholson interviews to be the winter caretaker of a mammoth, isolated Colorado hotel and immediately feels at home in the lonely vastness of its eerie expanse; his jittery wife and muted, psychic young son aren't so sure about the surroundings, especially after Dad starts exhibiting uncontrolled behavior. Once again, Kubrick displays his fabulous grasp of film-technique, resulting in some sensational scenes (particularly the opening drive up the mountain, the child's first meeting with the psychic cook, the overhead shot of the maze, and a funny/scary bit with Shelley Duvall fending off crazy Jack with a baseball bat). Unfortunately, the plot is all gummed up; it takes in past and present incidents, characters as mind demons, and a boy's fear of his father and fails to make all the elements cohere. Worse, the pieces don't make this much of a scary puzzle--it's too confounding to be truly terrifying--and the finale (filled with lots of freaky goings-on) releases all the tension Kubrick has worked so hard to build up. Some may see the confusing debauchery and the blood-filled elevator as Kubrick's comment on the horror genre, his imperviousness to the usual scare-movie tactics--he's above clichés--though what he DOES give us doesn't add up. A great deal of screen-time is spent getting help to the woman and her son (in the form of the cook) and also in locking up Nicholson when he becomes too violent--and both chapters end ridiculously. Was Kubrick gleeful at cutting such corners? If so, he shouldn't have been. "The Shining" feels like a cheat in so many ways that frustration ultimately mitigates the suspense. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kubrick massacred what I believe to be the scariest King novel. It is well known that King was not happy with the results of the work, but seldom does he say so...nowadays he just says that he can't talk about the film out of respect for the dead. A hedge maze in lieu of the topiary? Bad casting with Shelley Duvall (and the kid who played Danny sucked as well). Hell, the movie doesn't even end the right way. The only thing this movie had in common with the book was the title, character names, and the fact that it takes place in a hotel. The rest is hilarious bunk.I am also of the opinion that much of King's work does not translate well onto the big screen. There are exceptions; Green Mile, Shawshank, Stand by Me, and ones that focused on his short stories, like Cat's Eye, and Creepshow. Maybe it's coincidence that he worked with the directors for these. I must admit, the made for TV version of The Shining was far superior. Although, there were a few things that were left out, the truly great parts of the book are there. The woman in the shower scene was great! It was far more in depth simply because it was made for TV; it had plenty of time to tell the story and develop the characters. There was an actual Tony, instead of a finger (that was such a dumb concept).------------------------------SPOILER----------------------------And then there was Jack (Steven Webber), who took the long, hard descent into insanity, rather than going from 0-10 in the first 15 minutes of the original. He actually died the right way as well, screw freezing outside in a hedge maze, lol. I don't know, maybe I'm too loyal a King fan (although he too, has written some crap, but I like most of it), but I think that Kubrick made the worst adaptation of a King work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Horror Film, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not saying that The Shining is a bad movie, far from it. What I don't understand is how it currently has an 8.5/10 rating when it really isn't all that original. What I think earned it the rating it has is the acting, nostalgia and that it's a Stephen King movie. The acting was very good, as was the soundtrack, it's the plot itself that is lacking.Right away one of the big clichés of horror comes up: the child who has a disturbing imaginary friend. I've seen this in countless other books and movies, from the book 'No Place for Eco-Sinners' to the movie 'Hide &amp; Seek'. Granted The Shining was made before these two were made, but still, it's been used as far back as the 1950's in media and it's a little old after a while. The second cliché is the stigma of mental illness; the husband in the movie (Jack Nicholson), has a mental breakdown in the hotel and causes him to go on a murder rampage.The Shining, more than anything else, is a ghost story. A man gets a job during the winter looking after a hotel and brings his wife and little boy with him. He is a recovered alcoholic and injured his son previously. He has a mental breakdown while working there, induced by what is either ghosts or figments of his insane mind, and they convince him to try and kill his family.It's a basic horror plot, not very original, if you combined Magic (1977) with Poltergeist, you'd end up with The Shining. I didn't hate it, it was pretty good actually. But I don't think it deserves an 8.5 rating, that's just my opinion. My favorite movie, low-budget as it is, will always be My Bloody Valentine (1981, not the 2009 remake). The Shining has it's moments but has its flaws, as well.For the record, there was one very brief scene I'll never understand: Wendy, the wife, is screaming and trying to escape the hotel, then sees in one of the rooms, the hotel owner having sex with a man in a Winnie the Pooh costume. She screams and runs away. I've read the book and it still never explains what on earth was going on there, and frankly I think I'm better off not knowing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most terrifying film I have ever witnessed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The twin girls that haunt little Danny's visions in the corridors of the Overlook are not ghostly spectres that waft through walls or dissipate into thin air. They are not glimpsed running away, suggested by muffled giggling, or implied though distant sing-song voices. Like many other unsettling images in The Shining, they stand out starkly in garish colours against the equally bright and lurid background of the Overlook's interior. As with the twins, the symmetry of the Overlook's design and decor is where much of the dread in The Shining resides. The layout of the rooms, the uniformity of the corridors, the control of colour and light all contain a pattern of fear that unravels as Kubrick's camera passes through.The genius of this interior is that it is at odds with the hotel's snowbound and castle-like exterior. The Overlook's insides are pristine, not in a state of Gothic decay and in fact, are protected from the elements by Jack Torrance and the caretakers that have gone before him. The horror within is therefore also preserved. It remains fresh and powerful. Such is its power, that the ghosts of the Overlook will be ultimately seen by all. Not just Torrance (who is mad) or Danny (who is psychic) but also by Wendy who is neither. The viewer is no more spared and is exposed to several types of terror; from the creeping insidiousness of the surroundings, to the raw violence and the awesome displays of fear conveyed on the faces of Danny and Wendy.Accompanied by a demented score, The Shining spirals downwards with visceral acceleration towards a living nightmare where the corridors literally overflow with blood. It is as if the Overlook has ruptured at the knowledge of its own evil. Truly frightening in its starkness, there is no escape as we are pursued with Danny though the labyrinthine hotel towards inevitable horrific punctuations; Grady's sentinel daughters, the red elevator doors, room 237 and finally (and fittingly) the Overlook Maze.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been 30 years since THE SHINING first premiered, and it continues to spark debate among cineasts to this day. What CANNOT be disputed is it's lasting impact on a legion of Kubrick devotees. His only foray into the horror genre, though at times thematically uneven, is nonetheless thought-provoking and a strangely unsettling viewing experience. Say what you want about the screenplay or performances, THE SHINING is certainly the best LOOKING horror film of all time. Kubrick's matchless eye for detail and his use of long, winding roller-coaster-like steadicam shots gives the film a unique, otherworldly look. Everyone always comments on Jack Nicholson's scenery chewing and hamminess, but his pivotal scene in the restroom with Grady the caretaker is nicely underplayed and one of film horror's finest moments. I do however agree that the film's denouement is oddly anti-climactic and disappointing. I think Kubrick just ran out of steam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest One-Man Show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson is brilliant.In the script, on the page, he has little to say (his best lines are improvised) and hackneyed B-Movie actions to perform. Same for every other character in this mediocre script, except "Delbert Grady" (Philip Stone), whose few simple lines belie a monstrous context (which his deadly performance makes even more sinister and threatening).One-Man show? Yes. Nicholson's.Stanley Kubrick, perhaps the coldest director of all time, structures this second-rate story and script with his usual arresting visuals and watchwork precision.Kubrick may have had a heart, but it only shows once on film. His most successful film, "2001: A Space Odyssey," is a triumph of technology over humanity. Ironically, Kubrick's obsession with technology and his near-total erasure of individual human character (the humans in "2001" exist solely to service technology) results in Kubrick's most profoundly heartfelt human film.Otherwise, Kubrick's ouevre is relentlessly heartless and calculated. Actors either brought dimensions to their roles, or they didn't. Kubrick certainly was incapable (or uninterested) of bringing depths from mediocre actors. If you didn't bring it to the set, he didn't know how to elicit it.Hence we have the annoyingly mannered and minimally talented Shelley Duvall, so magnificently used by Robert Altman three years earlier in "3 Women," unbelievable in even her simplest line-readings and laughably bug-eyed over-the-top in her "terrorized" sequences.Danny Lloyd, who plays Jack's and Shelley's little son, let's just say he's no Haley Joel Osment. He is, in fact, terrible. More open-mouthed bug-eyed "terror." Just like Shelley. One note.Scatman Crothers? Simply can't act. Period. Can't make a simple, "Hello?" on the phone sound real. Nice guy, presumably. Pathetic "actor." Which again goes back to Kubrick. Who, exactly, HIRED these weak performers in the first place?Then, there's Jack Nicholson. Given little to say or do, beyond "horror movie" clichés, by the script or the director -- Nicholson the Pro takes his character and skins it alive for us, on camera. One of the most astonishing male performances in cinema history.And it's all his.It's not in the writing, not in the direction. Some of it's in John Alcott's magnificent cinematography.But essentially this is an actor of true genius turning crap into gold.Nicholson, and Nicholson alone, is what elevates this descent into psychosis a worthy, unforgettable, piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have a vision, a shining of a successful King novel to film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every project Kubrick touches, turns to Gold. The guy was a legend, a directing god of cinema. What he's done here, transforming this Stephen King novel to film can is magic. A very little few King books, (I mean a very little few) make successful transitions to film, literally falling flat on their faces, forgettable pics, or ones that really stink, not how the novel intended. The Shining stands alone from all the other King books to film. Kubrick uses wide and low shots, making hallways seem mammoth as well as a hedged maze. Of course Nicholson, the stealer of the show is another reason to see it, less attractive in his hey day, but sells his role beautifully. We we never forget that connected corridor shot, two elevator in the background, where a violent wave or torrent of blood fills it up to capacity, where the screen quickly becomes one of full venesection. I really don't want to give away the story to this, as this is where the intrigue and fun of it is. After a cautious word, involving the original caretaker, O Grady responsible for the multiple slaying of his family, Jack starts changing for the much worse (talk about writer's block). Also he's having visions. Are they real or not? He is met by the notorious O Grady, and what's up with Jack's son, who has a sixth sense, and has been warned about Room 237. We know what curiosity did? Redrum = Murder. It's easy to work out the real answer when you think about it, which you will the full picture with the story here. I enjoy watching this film every time, the opening music score and wide shot of credits, as we track Jack's Vee dub, along a cliff top road is breathtaking, and watching Nicholson lose it, every time, is a pleasure much appreciated. The chalet itself used in the film is grand inside, as is the establishing shot too. The well acted movie has a lot of wonderful qualities. I mean if not for this movie, we wouldn't have that killer line, "Here's Johnny".</fullReview>

You will also need to think a little about the history and what the director wants to tell you. Don't forget that it's a Stanley Kubrick's movie.I would define this movie as a "journey into madness", don't expect the ghost story of the Stephen King's novel. In that aspect, the movie is a largely failure. On the other hand, you will be captured and hypnotized by the psychological horror, even feeling claustrophobia at times.It's worth to mention that Jack Nicholson's acting is flawless and deeply scary.And one last thing: "Here's Jooohnny".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest horror films of all time: The Shining, is masterfully directed by Stanley Kubrick, and fantastically acted as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever left the movie theater, late at night, and had a feeling caused by the movie you'd just seen? I'm sure many of us have. My definition of an excellent movie is leaving the theater with a feeling of fulfillment, total satisfaction, and being thoroughly entertained.I've seen many movies through the years, and horror films should not make you feel this way. They are not fulfilling movies; many of them leave the story quite open-ended; wondering what happened next. But most of all, they should leave you with a feeling of unease: trepidation towards the sheer outline of the movie, and The Shining is one of the very few movies that will cause this.Stanly Kubrick masterfully recreates Stephen King's original novel of the same name into a downward spiral of fear, which continually builds upon itself until the entire system of intricately frightening scenes haltingly concludes in the last moments of the film.If you have not seen this film, I would highly recommend it, whether it be for the psychological terror you wish to experience, or an amazingly shot screenplay of one man's sick and twisted attempts to murder his dearly loved family. For this movie will, indeed, leave you with the cold feeling of unease that only the greatest horror films can achieve.I would personally recommend you watch it during the wintertime, preferably during snow-season if you live in a cold climate. And of course, turn the lights out, grab some popcorn, and kick back to be systematically terrified by this excellent work of film.P.S. It's definitely not for children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leaving any debate about the book versus the movie aside, in all honesty, I only purchased and watch this movie because it makes me laugh. I'd like to point out that I saw the movie before I ever read the book, so I didn't go into the film looking for something more only to be disappointed, it disappoints me all on its own.While I think the themes and the subject matter of the plot are definitely interesting and even terrifying, I think it was handled very, very poorly in this film. Unfortunately for me, it is without a doubt the actors, or rather their acting that just drags this film downhill. When the actors are delivering their lines so poorly that it makes me laugh, I lose sight of the plot and its little nuances. If I can't believe the actors' portrayals of the characters, I'm not going to take the story seriously.Jack Nicholson gets me to laugh so much in this film when I should be scared that it's disgusting. Between his facial expressions, vocal tones and his pointed eyebrows, I find Jack Torrence comedic. Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence has me desiring more. I don't believe a single word that comes out of her mouth; it all sounds like an act to me and a bad one at that. And those are just two of the characters. The rest are equally as bad, if not worse.I don't think the music helps all that much either. Often too loud and just not quite seeming to fit, it adds to the hilarity as it emphasizes a point that should be horrific but only transforms it into something ridiculous. Or this excessively loud music contributes to my holding the remote on my lap so that I can turn the movie down when they decide to raise it to unnecessary ear-splitting levels.These aspects hamper the tone of the film and I really don't feel the fear or anything else the film has to offer. It could have been a fabulously horrific film, but instead it only ends up a comedic disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Building Without its Foundation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick probably wasn't the director who should have taken the helms of translating Stephen King's classic of modern horror into the big screen. For that reason, neither was Mick Garris, who would go on to direct the miniseries and throw everything but the kitchen sink and re-define the concept that doing a faithful, literal rendition of a complex novel can be like being the holder of a whip and full permission to flog a dead horse into even more submission, but that's another story.However, Kubrick chose this among the heap of novels he was reading at the time and he decided to make his own vision -- which should have surprised no one, least of all King, although maybe he did not know Kubrick was known for making a story his in every respect of the word. In a lot of ways, THE SHINING succeeds, and is more unsettling than outright scary. The dark ambient music and the squealing violins bring a textured madness within the picture, a sense that things are bad from the get-go and will only get worse as the story proceeds. As a matter of fact, one of the best uses of sound that accentuate the concept of the "pounding" that makes its appearance in the nightmarish passages of the book is the one scene when Hallorann is trying to reach through to the Overlook Hotel and senses a growing trepidation that something horrible is about to take place. That implacable heartbeat insinuates itself with deadly accuracy until I, as a viewer, could literally feel the impending disaster (knowing the novel well).However, THE SHINING is packed with missteps that detract from its punch. One of the movie's glaring flaws is the casting of Jack Nicholson. True, he's come to define the psycho with the tongue sticking out and those devilish eyebrows as his silky voice promises more mayhem and he yells his trademark "Here's Johnny!" to the camera. However, where in the novel Jack Torrance was a deeply flawed man, one who had an enormous baggage stemming from his broken home, his drunken, often abusive father (one scene in particular pops up several times in flashbacks, as the senior Torrance pummeled his wife with his cane over dinner while little Jack and his brothers watched in horror as their mother actually did nothing to defend herself or accuse him later on to the authorities), a man who was trying to do what he could to pull through with his family, whom he himself had hurt in similar ways.The movie's Jack is nuts from the start. That's not a spoiler, it's practically the movie's premise. It was a rather novel concept, making the hero crazy from the beginning, but not making it clear until the moment Wendy discovers how long his mental instability has been going on.Another big problem is having the character of Danny turned into little more than a talking moron. The Danny in the book is articulate and smart as a whip while still being a child at heart; this one is a step away from being idiotic. Wendy in the book was stronger, less of a simp... here she's drowning in her simpering mousiness and turning it into an art form worthy of the Smithsonian Institute. Again, an issue of miscasting -- Shelley Duvall was simply not right for this role.If anything, THE SHINING holds the essence of the destruction of the American family intact in both the book and the movie version. While neither Jack nor Wendy are given back stories that might shed light into their current state of affairs, they're not a happy marriage and it's only time before irrevocable problems will arise and cause a dent within their fabric. I think that in eliminating these elements from their characters, Kubrick did want to indicate that it didn't matter; disintegration was disintegration whether one came from a broken home or Stepford. Here, it happens rather quickly; Kubrick just doesn't show it until late in the movie when Jack lets his inner crazy out and his "Honey, I'm home" is so drenched in irony that it almost brings the message full circle: violence starts at home.So Kubrick's vision, indeed.... excellent for 2001, A SPACE ODYSSEY, but middle-of-the-road for this type of movie, especially when using the oldest fright-gags the book that will cause laughter than actual discomfort. Stick with the book, it's perfect, and hope someone will come and re-make it the way it deserves to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a lesson in graceful film-making, it's a must. As an effective horror movie, it's a disaster. Stanley Kubrick shows his technical flair with the newly available steady-cam, but you have to keep asking, "How is this making the film scary?" For a much better example of how to create suspense, see "Halloween" made with a fraction of the budget and ten times the imagination. John Carpenter's camera stalks the characters like an extra character in the film. Kubrick's camera floats. It's pretty. But it's not scary.Jack Nicholson gives a bravura performance, unfortunately it belongs in a different film. He's supposed to be a man having a breakdown, but he looks deranged from frame 1. Perhaps he thought he was still in Cuckoo's Nest.The film has moments of course, you'd expect nothing less from a director of this calibre, but they are few and far between in a ridiculously self-important and overlong film.</fullReview>

Not so in this case. His Morison of The Shining pales in comparison to the novel. While most films aren't as good as the novels that inspired them (some are better - see 'Jaws')this goes beyond failing to live up to. There is little character in the film. I didn't care for these people the way I did when I read the book. Their history was striped to the bare essentials losing all of the richness that could have been there. In all of this Kubrick manages to lose the one thing many film adaptations struggle not to which his the novel's central theme. On the page it is ones dealing with loving the parent that also beats you. On the screen I don't know what it is. Kubrick was a great director (see just about any other film he did to see this) but here is the dropped ball of his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>S10 Review's The Shining (1980)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a down-on-his-luck writer trying hard to rebound back. Jack applies for and gets a position as a winter overseer of an old Colorado hotel named the Overlook. With the hotel shut down for the winter Jack will be solely responsible for maintaining it while it lay silent and unoccupied for the winter. A perfect time for a near last ditch effort to revive his career and save his strained relations with his wife (Duvall) and son (Lloyd). But a sinister side to the lovely hotel slowly exposes his family (particularly himself and his son) to supernatural goings on that threatens to make them yet another chapter in the hotels creepy past.Kubrick who revolutionized SciFi cinema with '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) turns to horror with this his adaptation (with Diane Johnson) of Stephen King's best-selling novel. Being a hardcore King fan I've had a beef in the past with how Kubrick had changed certain aspects of the source store. In particular much of the family frisson of the novel seems to be lost in the film. The new ending in the maze is a bit of a let-down next to the topiary from the novel but in the end I understand the change even though you'd have thought that the visual pioneer behind 2001 would have found an interesting workaround. However, petty gripes aside 'The Shining' is a wonderfully photographed and at times can be creepy and unsettling. Nicholson steals the show as he always does when his character destabilizes emotionally and heads toward perfectly maniacal and classic Jack territory. Duvall seems a bit out of place but if the old production stories hold true about how Kubrick terrorizes the performance out of her then maybe it's not entirely her own doing.In short 'The Shining' is a very effective and at times stunningly attractive film that has a rock-solid air of menace that piles up by the conclusion. Fans of the book may develop issues but Nicholson and Kubrick fans will eat this one up.</fullReview>

The music is horrible and very repetitive. The acting was worse, except from Jack Nicholson...He performs a very good role portaited as an insane man. In my honest opinion, this movie is more annoying then scary. I even turned down my sound, because the music is very high pitched and long and basically gives away what is going to happen.Also the movie is two and a half hours long with basically nothing happening until the very end. And even then, nothing horrific about it.I realize it's made in 1980, but think of the Exorcist. That movie is pure horror, this is not! The techniques are there, the skill is not. Overall a bad movie and not worth seeing...Horror fans, keep reading Stephen King books and watch pure horror movies. Don't watch movies that ruin the books or the horror genre!</fullReview>

My eyes were bleeding and not in a good way.It's unbelievable for me that this movie is rated so high. Okay, the story was original and good, so I will give that some credit in my rating. But the movie just took soooo long to really get going, that I just couldn't set trough it.Can someone please explain to me why this movie is so high rated, even if you think the script and story was good, you cant ignore the terrible music and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Considering there are already a bazillion reviews of this film on IMDb, why not add one more?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is currently the 48th highest rated movie on IMDb and there are something like a bazillion reviews for it already on this site, so it's not like my review is going to matter very much. Still, I decided to finally see this film for the first time and thought I'd toss my impressions into the HUGE pool of information.Jack Nicholson, like the story's author Stephen King, is a school teacher who has quit in order to become a writer. He arranges an unusual job that will give him LOTS of spare time--he and his wife and son will move to a resort in the mountains and be the caretakers during the off-season. This is problematic for several reasons. First, they are all alone and the snow will keep them alone for months on end. So, if there are any problems, they are screwed. Second, Nicholson plays an alcoholic in recovery--and there's no booze in the place. Third, and probably the biggest one of all, is that the place is evil and begins screwing with the family--particularly their weirdo kid and the father. For the most part, the wife (Shelley Duvall) is there to look scared and be preyed upon! I could tell you more about the film....but won't. I don't want to spoil the suspense.I should also note that this is a very adult film. I am not talking about the violence--though it is violent and scary. But the language and very explicit nude scenes make it something you might want to think about before you watch it or let your kids see it.So what did I like about the film? Well the music was great--and REALLY pulled off the scare-factor!! And, the film is quite tense and exciting. I also liked the cinematography. It's odd, though, that the opening scenes shot by helicopter were GORGEOUS but the VERY Obsessive-Compulsive Kubrick (who was known to make a bazillion retakes of scenes) didn't catch or care that you can actually see a shadow of the 'copter in the opening. Look carefully at the bottom right of the screen and you'll see it.My complaints about the film are few. But, I do think that Nicholson's characterization is something you'll either love or hate. I thought he seriously over-acted and agreed with King's assertion that he ALREADY seemed crazed when the film began. King's notion of the problem being related to alcohol are pretty much minimized in the Kubrick treatment---it's much more a film about insanity and evil spirits.I understand that Stephen King hated this particular adaptation of his novel and later he produced his own mini-series more in line with his vision for the film. But, considering he was not yet a big-name author and the god-like Stanley Kubrick was at the helm (and NO ONE tells him how to make a movie), it was a losing battle from the start. Kubrick helped write the screenplay, produced and directed the film. And, whatever King thought of it, the film WAS immensely successful--at least today when you ask people what they thought about the movie. I'll have to make it a point to see the mini-series as well---even if it currently has a mediocre score of 6.0.So, considering my score of 9, I liked it. Sure, there was some overacting but the basic story is very, very tense and I am sure a lot of viewers were scared half to death watching it. I am not a huge fan of horror films but can sure respect what was accomplished here.By the way, it's interesting that this film is an awful lot like King's later film "1408"--an awful lot. In "The Shining" you have an evil resort and in "1408" you have an evil hotel room--both which screw with people and cause death and mayhem--at least in the film versions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Miss for Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always deeply enjoyed "Dr. Strangelove" and "2001"-- in fact, both movies are on my Top 25 list. I gave up on "Spartacus" twice, but the third time, I watched it all the way through (the 196-minute version) and I found it another masterpiece. So I know Kubrick has real merits as a filmmaker, not just a director.That being said, "A Clockwork Orange" is an horrific assault on the senses and "The Shining" is dull, derivative, and in general, almost unwatchable.I have never read Stephen King's novel, but I know that a lot of people claim the movie is much worse. I'll leave that point alone. And in terms of technical innovations (the whole Steadicam thing comes to mind), they worked. But when you actually have to watch it as a movie (and I don't know how else to watch a film), it doesn't add up to anything enjoyable.Shelley Duvall-- as always-- gives a terrible performance. She's the most blatantly awful aspect of the movie. Then, of course, you have the sheer feel of the film. It's very ethereal, too ethereal, in fact. The much-lauded tracking shots (which the DVD summary praises as "dreamlike") are nothing more than visual lullabies, the music is more obnoxious than "Clockwork Orange," and parts of the film even feel like rip-offs of "The Exorcist"-- i.e., the questioning of the little kid about his imaginary friend is suspiciously similar to the Captain Howdy plot point in "Exorcist."Most of the time, the cast fails. Jack Nicholson is tolerable, but he isn't enough to salvage the film. And Kubrick's normally-perfectly-capable direction is laughable and over-the-top.Stay away from "The Shining." It's redrum for your brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is terrible and overrated because it's "Kubrick!"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a running argument about "The Shining" with a friend who has a varied and keen appreciation of film. He does not, however, see many "horror" films (if that's what "The Shining" is), and does not like or read Stephen King. Which brings us to the point: I think "The Shining" is a great novel, a truly scary entry in it's genre. Like many King novels, it is about wasted people who become vessels of or for evil. That may sound silly, but try comparing "Dolores Claiborne" (also an excellent film) with "'Salem's Lot" or "The Dead Zone" or "Gerald's Game", and you'll find there's more there than just sharp teeth or things that go bump in the night. "The Shining" is, in its simplest form, the study of a man who is a failure at everything he does, including becoming an alcoholic. This is not a paean to King, however, or to suggest that he's a misunderstood Shakespeare. There is more to his novels than a serious reader or filmgoer would suspect, and Kubrick leaves most of the meat of this story out of the film.My friend and I also disagree about how one reviews a film based on previously published material, and whether the original source must be invoked in comparison. Regardless of one's bias to that particular issue, Kubrick fails on both fronts here. (I believe it is a valid comparison to review both film and original source.) I found "The Shining" to be miscast (Shelley Duval????), poorly acted (Duval and Nicholson, who is just over the top), and poorly adapted for the screen. The Scatman Crothers character is made superficial (all that way JUST for an ax in the chest), the development and attempts at denial of Torrance's encroaching madness are barely sketched, the heroic and suffering role of Wendy is replaced by Duval's whining, the hilarity of Danny talking to his finger (the now famous croak "REDRUM!") still amuses me, and the subtle horror of the novel is replaced by the ridiculous "Elevators of Blood" scene. I've seen much better psychological horror films ("The Haunting", "Daughter of the Mind") and better raw horror films ("Night of the Living Dead", "Halloween", "Prince of Darkness"), and this film is just BAD.I believe "The Shining" receives good reviews because "Kubrick!" directed it and "Jack!" plays a loony in the lead, but it just doesn't cut it. It is well-filmed and has some good scenes and lines. But, if it's not a horror film, then what the hell type of film is it? I'm also a big Kubrick fan, and although his career peaked with "A Clockwork Orange", his later efforts (excluding this one) still have merit. If you disagree with what I've written, then read the novel and see the much better TV film adapted by King (even though he wrote in a hokey ending).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. Its really not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No other then that it got pretty stupid. And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the ending. I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently. And, the over all movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright as a movie, awful along with the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After just finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what was supposed to happen. I had high expectations of the movie, because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. I have a couple main points for not liking this movie.********** SPOILERS **********1. The casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits into Jack Torrence's character. Also, I would have NEVER picked Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I pictured Wendy much differently. I can see why they picked Jack Nicholson though, the grin, the pointy eyebrows, but he's not supposed to really look 'evil'. He's supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. Also, they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was alright, he needed more life though. He acted way to droney.2. The screenplay. They cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours!! I was extremely irritated.3. The Ending. The ending was changed completly, Halorann died, Jack froze to death, Wendy never got hurt...The Overlook didn't blow up. The Ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, I was apalled. Hallorann was never supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least have Jack use a roque mallet. You never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.There are other things that I didn't like about the movie, but there are things that were all right. The camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book, to try to be scared at all. I reccomend reading the book, before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis Stanley Kubrik any more. I would never have done that, I would have taken all the rights I could get to yell at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has the hedge animals.Rating: 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Worth Your Time, or The Film it was Made On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Lots of brain dead Kubrick-heads will try to tell you that this is the best Horror Movie ever simply because Kubrick made it. This is a FALSEHOOD.First off, it's not a Horror Movie. You have to at least try to be scary to be a Horror Movie. This film never even makes an effort in that regard.Second off, it's not good. Even if you try to watch it as just a "suspense movie" and forget about all this Horror which you are supposed to be exposed thru all throughout this movie, it's still just not a good movie. There is no plot to speak of. The Wife and Son, and the Hotel for that matter, who should ALL be treated as equal characters to Jack (and in the case of Danny and the Hotel, MORE important) are all pushed to the side so that we can constantly be treated to scene after scene of Jack Nicholson completely botching every aspect of his character. How the man ever had a career, much less a successful one, after this travesty is beyond me.Do yourself a favor and try to catch the ABC TV Miniseries version. Stephen King actually oversaw that one to make sure it came out right. And it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Severely Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening aerial shots of this movie are brilliant focusing on a small car driving on a bendy road with tense music playing spoilt only by the noise of the helicopter where the camera was obviously positioned (Some say this is Kuberick's mark I simply don't see the point). Jack Nicholson's performance is terrific but the script has severe holes in it for one what is the reason for his characters dramatic switch between sane and insane nothing happens to him to justify it. The man with the shining powers comes back to the hotel in the end only to be killed immediately what was the point. The flood of blood is never explained or is it a simplistic metaphor for the violence that is about to take place or that has taken place. The young boy putting on that voice was really annoying and there was no need for it although the voice is probably supposed to symbolize a invisible friend whom helps him make sense of his powers it simply doesn't work. What about that for an ending a silly looking Jack Nicholson frozen (whom was not all that difficult to defeat) then the camera zooms in to a picture of him on the wall which makes little sense before the film ends. What was the meeting with the ghost barman all about its just never explained and there is absolutely no content given so that the viewers can read between the lines. A final problem with the movie is it gets extremely boring half way through and this boredom lasts until near the end Kuberick tries to make the film to tense thus when the final does come it has little punch. However I do realise the film was well made, there was the possibility of a good storyline, Nicholson's performance was good and the music terrific but I simply feel that this does not save this movie and how it ever made number 82 on the poll I'll never know when the great masterpiece THE SEARCHERS is well below it. I give the shining a 3/10.</fullReview>

Kubrick and Nicholson butcher his book without any shame at all. Everyone says he gave a "spooky" performance but the really camped this movie to death. "Here's Johnny" has gotta be one of the worst lines (barring anything with the words "I love you" of course) in cinematic history. Critics bash most King adaptations saying that they "don't follow the book" yet the praise this piece of garbage. Go figure. Kubrick probably burns in Stephen King's version of Hell for what he did to his classic novel.</fullReview>

It was his combination of King's ideas and his own foolish changes that make this the worst Stephen King adaption I have seen to this day.

		<fullReview>I was hugely disappointed by this film, especially as it frequently ranks as no.1 on any list of horror films. Watching it reminded me of the first time I saw Scarface and the underwhelming reaction it provoked. It strikes me as being a film people profess to be great because of its cult image and because the older kids at school said it was good when it came out. It's not. Jack Nicholson is a terrible actor completely lacking in subtlety, although having said that at least his performance provokes some feeling, I really didn't care by the end of the film if the little kid and his wife died or not. It is a shame because about half way through the film I thought it was about to get going and then it just whimpers. Such was my upset at how poor the film was that I set up this account to post my feelings, if you are looking to watch a scary psychological film and are being recommended the Shining don't waste your time.

		<fullReview>There is two versions of this movie: One by Stanley Kubrick and another by non other than Stephen King himself.Honestly, no one can portray Stephens' books any better than what he would be able to. He wrote them and know exactly how it should look like, what it should feel like, how it should make you feel and how it should influence you.I think that the only one whom can put Stephens' thoughts and his mind into living action, would be himself. This version of the movie, is not the one you wish to see or even own for that matter. The one you want, is the one Stephen produced himself in 1997.There is a sure lack of story and enthusiasm in the 1980 version of The Shining. Where as in the 1997 version by Stephen King, you are literally at the edge of your seat. There is never a dull moment and when you find Danny screaming, you feel like screaming your head off with him.Here's the IMDb link to Stephen King's The Shining (1997): http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118460/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be the most overrated movie, This movie bored me to death every time I watch it.The summary of movie is about A novelist - Jack Torrance take a job interview as winter caretaker of the isolated, old, huge and beautiful Overlook Hotel. In the interview, Jack is told by the manager himself, that the previous caretaker - Grady, chopped his family and later killed himself with a shotgun. Ignoring the story, Jack brings his wife - Wendy and his son Danny . It happens that Danny, has a mysterious power known as "The Shining" that shows him things from the past and future. Some of the visions come from Tony - "the little boy who lives in Danny's mouth". Danny meets Hallorann - the hotel cook in their first day arriving at the Overlook, who also has this "Shining" and he warns him about the hotel and the sinister Room 237. As the days go by, Danny has visions of previous guests and employees who died at the hotel years before, meanwhile Jack starts driving into insanity, turning more and more aggressive, at the point that Danny and Wendy gets convinced that Jack might try to do the same thing.I have seen this movie 4/5 every time I watch it, I always seem to fall sleep after the only one good scary scene with the naked women in the bathtub, that is the only worth checking scene as nothing else in this movie scared me or creep ed me out.I have really tired to like this movie the more I watch (Or even here about ) it more I hate it!1st)) I didn't like ? Why? I was disappointed as it bored me.2nd) Wendy screaming did my head in for a least 2 day, I was wishing that Jack would chop her head off with the Axe, at least wouldn't have been boring.3rd) well fell sleep 10 seconds after hot naked women in bathtub.4th) I Just fast forward to the part with naked Ghost and then turn it offThis is not good adaptation at all and I think it one of worst Stephen kings adaptations it better to read book again and again and again and again.I Wish I could see what everyone else sees's in this movie.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nearly unmitigated disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film has a very vocal and loyal following that explains the overwhelmingly positive nature of the IMDb comments, but speaking as a huge fan of both the King novel and Kubrick the director, this film is a butcher job. The countless changes, both trivial and consequential, that Kubrick and Johnson made to King's story were timid, superficial attempts to add "zing" to a story that needs nothing if handled by a subtle, canny genre movie-maker.Consider the change from roque mallet to axe as Jack's weapon of choice. Ostensibly the axe might be more viscerally frightening with a higher damage-per-swing ratio, but the mallet offers a much slower, more measured punishment, a more appropriate dosing out of Jack's "medicine". Or the pivotal scene in which first Danny and then Jack confront the long-dead menace in Rm. 217 (237 in the movie). This is the key scene in the novel, when the hotel's power crosses the threshold from merely unnerving to physically threatening, and Jack's psychological separation from his wife and son becomes complete. However with Kubrick's calculated disconnection of any and all overtly supernatural elements in the story, the vignette merely becomes another ambiguous manifestation of the shared psychosis between Jack and Danny. Or does it? Kubrick spends the entire movie seemingly wanting to have his cake and eat it too, almost entirely eliminating the power of the hotel's supernatural consciousness, but never quite crossing the line that would have made the story entirely about Jack's mental breakdown. This might have been a more credible and coherent story, but instead we are left with scenes such as Wendy's witness to the ghostly sexual encounter or the elevator full of blood, scenes that make no sense unless there is something happening in the hotel outside of the three living people inside it.Of course the story is not the only problem with the film. The acting is uniformly awful, with the woodenness of Duvall and Lloyd in no way compensated for by Jack Nicholson's wildly over-the-top (and utterly wrong-headed) characterization of Jack Torrance. I suspect Nicholson sensed early on the awkward, lethargic dynamic he was going to get from his co-stars and director and believed that flaming out was going to be the best thing for the picture, and to his credit, his performance is the most interesting thing about a mostly dull experience, but give me Steven Weber's Jack 24/7/365, thank you very much. There are any examples of Kubrick's legendary inability to elicit warm, involving performances from even the most accomplished acting talent, but this is one of the few examples where such performances were absolutely needed to tell the story correctly.Kubrick did not comprehend what made the King novel a subtle masterpiece. He only understood that it was a hot commodity at the time, and in his zeal to add a horror movie to his oeuvre, he grabbed for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this movie supposed to be for kids? Not once during the whole movie was I scared. Is this supposed to be a horror movie? It looked more like a marriage drama. The whole time I was hoping for someone to get killed, because that's what usually happens in horror movies. I had to wait until the last 15 minutes of the movie for this to happen. And only one person got killed, what a disappointment! All the time I was rooting for Johnny to kill his wife and kid. She seemed like a crazy woman from hell. Without any reason she started to beat on him with a baseball bat. Okay, he had some mental problems, but he hadn't hurt anyone. She was acting like a lunatic, and should be locked up. Or better, she should have been killed, because she practically killed him by knocking him down the stairs. Shelley Duvall's acting performance as the wife was dreadful, by the way. The boy also seemed to be suffering from autism or something, because at no time he was acting like a normal kid. He seemed like a mental patient escaped from an institution. No wonder Johnny got a little insane, with a wife and kid like that, I would be going crazy also. It is never explained why Johnny became a little unstable in the first place, but I guess that must be the reason. It only seems normal, any guy would do the same. Jack Nicholson was the only saving factor that stopped me from totally tearing this movie to pieces. He was a delight to watch and is truly a fine actor. Unfortunately he can only do so much, and he saves the movie from being a total flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Weakness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had such high production values and the director had such a penchant for perfection that one must wonder why this movie falls into the basic guidelines of a horror movie. How disappointing...The suspense is rather lax because many of the characters wind up as caricatures that we can't sympathize with...not to mention the ending makes no sense in context with the rest of the story. Kubrick's prior masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, relied on the enigma of space to project a story without explaining everything to the audience. Here, the movie only tells us half the story then leaves us on the wayside to make it up as we go, thereby making no sense.I wanted to like this movie. Sadly, I popped John Carpentar's The Fog in after this and was shocked as to how much superior of horror quality was present.In conclusion, this movie has only it's powerful cinematography and performance by Jack Nicholson going for it. Everything else passes off as inferior, cliche, and mood-destroying. See any other Kubrick movie for a better experience. Overall, 2 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate this movie! It was NOTHING like the book, and just thinking about it makes me mad. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yeah, it's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The ending for example! So in the book it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze... yeah, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that made me angry was that jack just kills Mr. Halloran! what the heck, he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn't important. Overall, it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off.</fullReview>

" Heeeere's Eddie!" "Heere's Chris!" " Heeeere's Brian!" This goes on and on and on.I expect more from Stanley Koldbricks. The person who wrote the story for this should be scolded. It's just so monotonous. " Heeeere's Simon!" " Heeere's Quentin!"

		<shortDescription>Good film! But?is it really worth the status of `Horror Classic'??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's the Shining is a powerful cinema experience and a fine adaptation of Stephen King's novel, but I think the high status it enjoys is rather questionable. Too easily this film is labeled as the `scariest' horror film ever and many of the sequences are a bit overblown, if you ask me. Recently some website published the hundred scariest movie moments and multiple parts of the Shining positioned high in this list. True, legendary sequences like Jack Nicholson screaming `Heeeeeeeeere's Johnny!' and the little boy approaching room 237 on his tricycle look impressive when seen separate, but when you watch this film as a wholesome (like the way it was intended, naturally) it loses some of its power. I think Stanley Kubrick himself is to blame for this. Often during the Shining, he undercuts the tension himself by showing repetitive images and underdeveloped ideas. The cause of Jack Torrance's madness isn't explained like it should be and comes a bit sudden (in case you're not familiar with the plot: Jack Nicholson's character suffers from a writer's block and accepted a job as caretaker in a famous Colorado hotel, during the dead-of-winter. Along with his wife and son, he spends the winter up there while the isolation and impact of previous drama's that took place there slowly cause Jack to go insane and threat his family with an axe). Not a bad word about Stanley Kubrick and his (almost) flawless career, but I feel he's to blame for the partially missed opportunity that is The Shining. All the other necessary elements to create a horror milestone are there. The setting is uniquely isolated and perfect for the story. The cinematography (by John Alcott, who previously worked with Kubrick for Barry Lyndon and A clockwork Orange) simply is outstanding and the acting is GREAT! That surely has to be said: Jack Nicholson gives one of his most amazing performances of his already brilliant career. Really, Jack's facial expressions often make you wonder whether he isn't the reincarnation of the devil himself! Especially in The Shining, he's the kind of guy you don't want to mess with! Good film and certainly recommended but?think twice before ranking it as `essential'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was a disappointment for me as memorable scenes and insights into the characters(except 'Possessed-by-Overlook' Jack) of Stephen King's novel were entirely scrapped from the scenario.For example, the ending sucked; if they couldn't blow the set, couldn't they at least make it less abrupt? Frozen Jack means nothing, at least that's what I think.Characters changed too; Wendy changes from 'resourceful(novel)' to pathetic; Danny just becomes a creepy boy; Hallorann gets killed, with no mention of his affection towards the boy.Jack is relatively well managed by the director, but he is crazy from the start(with no mention of his past and his feelings towards his family).

		<fullReview>"The Shining" is one of those films that looks like a sure-thing, but never does jell. Jack Nicholson stars as a struggling writer who agrees to become the caretaker of a summer resort hotel during the winter season. The longer he stays, the crazier he becomes. Now his wife and young son are in grave danger. Stanley Kubrick's screenplay is prodding, dull, and ultimately unsuccessful. However, I do not know of anyone who could have adapted Stephen King's unspectacular novel successfully. Nicholson tries hard, but he has no help and he almost makes the film succeed all by himself. Overly long and only average at best, "The Shining" is one of the biggest disappointments in the history of the cinema. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those scared by Sesame Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The age old question: Is Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel a terrifying film experience? The answer: no. Working from the modern classic, this tale of a man's descent into madness during a prolonged stay at a haunted hotel is about as scary as your average episode of Sesame Street. Now don't get me wrong here. Kubrick is a master at his craft. His camera is always right where it should be. The scenes shot with steadicam are divine. The problem is that Kubrick is a cold filmmaker. Do we care about the Torrance's and their plight? Nope. Are any of the shocking scenes of horror really that shocking? Not unless you've never seen any horror movie before, and I mean none. I'm sorry but every scare is telegraphed from a mile away and is just so lame that only a child would find them truly frightening.Much has been ballyhooed about Nicholson's bravura performance. Hold on. Did anyone actually read the book? It's about a man's descent into madness. Jack looks loco before he even gets to the hotel and his actions are worse. How could anyone possibly believe that he's getting loony? The whole point is that Jack Torrance is an everyman who snaps under the psychological pressures of his surroundings. Give me a break. And Shelley Duvall as Wendy is so horribly miscast that she can only flounder in her role. Kudos to the casting of the twin girls, though, they were uber-creepy. While King's own miniseries is far from a classic of the genre, it is as it stands a far better adaptation of the book than Kubrick's vision. With a better cast and more skilled director the miniseries could have been what this movie is hyped as but never actually attains.</fullReview>

The story is weird. Jack Nicholson's dumb "I'm-as-nuts-as-a-moron-and-kill-'em-all" glance, which is presented for ages without a cut, is so cheap and just disgusting. The reason why I give it a 1 is because I cannot stand Jack Nicholson in here, and because the entire movie is just a huge waste of good time you could spend doing something that has substance, something this movie thoroughly lacks.</fullReview>

It isn't scary and it is boring sometimes, but that's the way it had to be for those times. A lot of movies that were made after this one (till these days) are much better, but we have to keep in mind that those times were different than nowadays. People had a different manner of thinking; the conception, the ideology and especially the prejudice were different... were much stronger than today. So that's why horror-thriller movies like Hitchcock's or Stephen king's are considered somehow masterpieces. Because those movies gave the start (and many ideas) for the following of this genre. Those movies were somehow "pioneers" for the genre (especially for psychological horror-thriller genre). So... "The Shining" is a good movie. Watch it if you like the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who all is insane?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since everyone knows the story, I'll go straight into the analysis. There is no doubt that Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has gone insane, but what about Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and Danny (Danny Lloyd)? All what happens in the hotel does not make much sense, BUT THEY ALL SEE IT. Specifically, after Wendy locks Jack in the pantry, Grady lets him out. We never see Grady in that scene, but the door didn't just open itself. By the end, we are not sure whether the Overlook is haunted, or whether everyone is having a group hallucination.What about some of the other aspects? When Lloyd serves Jack a bourbon, Jack tells Lloyd "White man's burden". What does he mean? Maybe it has something to do with the hotel's history: we heard about how they built it on an Indian burial ground, and Grady calls African-American cook Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) "the (N-word) cook". These two points bring up something interesting: we expect the Indians to take revenge on the white people, but that never happens; also it sort of shocks us when Grady uses the N-word, because we don't really expect an upper-class Englishman to use that kind of word, regardless of his opinion of black people. And the final scene? In a book about Stanley Kubrick, I read that it poses the question "How independent are we of the forces that govern us?" Ironically, it happens on Independence Day.As for camera angle, the scene where Jack first (?) meets Lloyd, he's lit from beneath, which illuminates his already ominous features. When Wendy finds "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy", she is positioned right in the center of the scene and it's red right behind her (Kubrick always makes interesting use of red). Then, what appears to be a POV shot moves towards the chamber, but it turns out not to be; Jack moves into the scene.The point is, "The Shining" makes us ask what exactly is up with the Overlook Hotel. We cannot be totally sure. Just a personal note, my parents saw this movie when it first came out. My dad didn't have any problems with it, but it unnerved my mom: Danny looked like my cousin. Creepier and creepier still. This may be the greatest horror film of all time.</fullReview>

I had read the book a few years prior, and although I was not expecting the film to stay absolutely true to the book (they never do), I was absolutely DYING to see the topiary animals come to life and scare the wits out of not only young Danny in the film, but yours truly as well......I mean, how could one leave THAT frightening scene out of the movie???? Well, Kubrick saw fit to do just that........leave it out.

		<shortDescription>The Shining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Stanley Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket), this is probably the best known and most admired adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Basically, the Torrance family: novelist husband/father Jack (Jack Nicholson), wife/mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd) are heading for the Overlook Hotel in the secluded Colorado mountains, built over an ancient Indian burial ground, and where the previous caretaker murdered his family with an axe, and shot himself. In the hotel, one by one they experience the hotel's past with a series of apparitions, hallucinations and time-warps. These include Danny, confirmed to have "The Shining" (telepathic ability) by hotel cook Dick Hallorann (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's Scatman Crothers), seeing the ghosts and bodies of the murdered twin girls, oh, and a tidal wave of blood. Jack meanwhile has his mentality deteriorating having writer's block, nightmares when he does sleep, going into room 237 (mentioned by Danny) and encountered by a naked woman from the bath - who turns into a hideous old woman, and meeting Lloyd the Bartender (Joe Turkel), and butler Delbert Grady (Philip Stone) who convinces Jack he should "correct" his family. Wendy (last to realise) one day looks at Jack's manuscript and knows he is insane seeing that he has written the same sentence over and over again, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". He threatens her, and she bashes him on the head with the baseball bat she had, he tumbles down the stairs, injuring his ankle, and gets locked in the pantry. When he gets out, Danny is in a trance repeating and writing the word "REDRUM", in reverse thats "MURDER, and then Jack is chopping through the door with an axe. Danny escapes through the bathroom window, while Wendy is trapped, until Jack goes to kill Dick, and then chasing after Danny through the snowy maze, he loses him and freezes to death, and the film ends with a photo on the wall of the 1921 dinner party, with Jack in it! While this film is not very shocking, it is very chilling and disturbing, especially with the help of a fantastic performance from Nicholson, who is both fun and hammy as the disturbingly unhinged husband/father driven to madness. His finest moment is of course chopping through the door, stopping to deliver the iconic (and ad libbed) line, the introduction for Johnny Carson on "The Tonight Show", and number 68 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, "Here's Johnny!" Duvall is also quite effective as the emotionally distraught (after finding out Jack is insane) wife/mother. All shot with gliding Steadicam, making the never-ending hotel corridors very claustrophobic, with very good opening aerial scenes, and assisted with very screechy music by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind, this is a brilliantly disturbing horror film. Somehow the film was nominated the Razzies for Worst Actress and Worst Director, what the hell for?! Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor, Jack Torrance was number 25 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lousy adaptation of Stephen King's great novel. It's about a family watching over a huge hotel (the Overlook) which is located in the mountains in Colorado during the winter. They're basically isolated out there--miles and miles away from anyone. Also seems the hotel is haunted and starts to take possession of the father (Jack Nicholson). Then the snowstorms hit--they're completely snowed in and the mother (Shelley Duvall) and little son (Danny Lloyd) are at the mercy of the axe-wielding father...The novel was VERY scary and well-done--Kubrick single-handedly trashes the entire book. Kubrick WAS a great director but he just didn't know how to do a straight-forward horror film. He acts like this is an important film--he takes it WAY too seriously. He makes very ill-conceived changes from the book (one character is brutally killed, but he was alive and well at the end of the book, and where are the hedge animals?) and has Nicholson's character act so weird from the get go that we don't really notice any change when he goes crazy. Nicholson IS good however but Duvall is annoying and Lloyd was basically not accomplished enough to pull off his role (but he WAS a young kid). Scatman Crothers is good but he's not in the film enough to really help. Also the film isn't scary ONCE. Kubrick shows all his purported "shocking" moments with loud, annoying music--problem is nothing he shows us is scary. Also the ending is REALLY stupid and throws in a reincarnation angle that comes out of NOWHERE (and isn't in the book).My main issues with this is that it isn't scary, is WAY too long and way too serious. Even King himself hated this. But there are some people who think everything Kubrick did was fantastic and even defend this. I hated it in 1980...I still hate it now. I give it a 1.</fullReview>
