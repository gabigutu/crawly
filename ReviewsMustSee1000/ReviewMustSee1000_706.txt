		<shortDescription>The work of a genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bunuel is arguably the greatest of all filmmakers. With the possible exceptions of Hitchcock and Fassbinder, I can think of no other director who so completely understood the potential of the medium to transcend the traditional conventions of narrative, or exploited this potential with such élan. And he doesn't rely on special effects: we enter the surreal realm so seamlessly that it at times seems banal. This is especially the case in 'Le charme': banal people have banal sub-consciousnesses.In order to begin to appreciate Bunuel I had to immerse myself in his milieu, so foreign was his sensibility to the usual expectations I had brought with me into a movie theater.It took me several viewings to get the 'jokes' if 'Le charme'. The Ambassador from some obscure Latin American country ('Miranda', or 'wonder', a nod to Shakespeare), supports this little microcosm of comfortable Parisian bourgeois respectability with cocaine smuggled in diplomatic pouches. Guests arrive for a dinner party on the wrong evening, and interrupt the hosts having sex. A wake is being held in the back room of the restaurant they are planning to dine at. Ice cubes for martinis must be 'exactly zero degrees'. Elegant ladies sit down for a fashionable afternoon tea, only to be told by their waiter that the restaurant has run out of water (?!!). A soldier then comes to their table and relates his parricidal dream, while the polite ladies listen to him unfazed. One of the ladies discreetly slips away for an assignation with another one's husband. Only Bunuel! Doubtless the inspiration for this film comes from the Latin Bunuel's lifetime of experience observing the French in situ. Much of its fun comes from simply watching the French be so . . . French. And there is no bourgeois like a French bourgeois! Much of 'Le Charme' takes place in the nightmares of its characters: you are sitting down for a dinner being hosted by a general, only to realize that you are on stage (with a prompter giving a cue from Don Juan: 'Invite the commander's ghost for dinner!'); your elegant dinner party is broken up by a gang of thugs looking to kill you. However, you are so wedded to the ceremony of the dinner party that you get caught stealing a piece of meat from the table under which you are hiding (and end up dying like a dog!) I could see this movie a hundred times and always find something new. I would never be bored by it.Bunuel is very funny, but he is also dense and difficult. One doesn't realize the true complexity of his films because they all seem so effortless. Nothing great comes easily. He's like great Bordeaux: you can't quaff it -- it demands to be sipped.Bunuel is famous for having the lowest shoot to take ratio of any filmmaker, less than 2:1. Second takes were rare (compare with the reams that end up on the cutting room floor for the typical Spielberg film.) He knew exactly what he wanted to see before he shot. Hitchcock, a director who resembles Bunuel in many ways, famously referred to actors as 'cattle'. For Bunuel, they were probably more like toy soldiers. This isn't to say that he didn't get brilliant performances out of them, especially from his screen alter-ego, the wonderful Fernando Rey.Henry Miller dubbed his good friend Luis Bunuel "The Last Heretic". I can't think of a higher compliment. Bunuel's memoirs, 'My Last Sigh', are a must read for anyone who wants to have an appreciation of Paris in the 20s, the of art in the last century, and martinis, made as they should be, with gin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner Is Served</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Luis Bunuel is often described as a surrealist, but the word misapplied in reference to his later works, where the the term absurdism is much more appropriate. Such is the case with the Academy Award-winning THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, which begins with four friends who arrive at their hosts' home only to discover they have arrived on the wrong night--a plausible situation. But before the film has run its course, Bunuel unravels his tale of a meal that never quite happens in the most unexpected ways imaginable.The film works on several levels, mocking social conventions, the church, and eventually spilling its action into a series of overlapping nightmares in which various attempts to dine are frustrated by everything from the corpse of a restaurant manager in a nearby room to military maneuvers. On one memorable occasion, the friends are invited to dine and are seated around an elegant table--when a curtain suddenly rises behind them and reveals them to be seated on a stage before a hostile audience! The cast (which features Fernando Rey, Delphine Seyrig, Paul Frankeur, Bulle Ogier, Stephane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel as the constantly frustrated diners) plays with considerable aplomb, performing the most irrational scenes with a magnificent realism. When combined with Bunuel's absurdist story, the result is a disquieting yet often very funny discourse on frustrated appetites both real and imagined, and with many layers of incidental meaning along the way.A word of caution to the uninitiated: Bunuel is not for those who seek a tidy plot line with clear-cut meanings. But if you come to it with an open mind, you'll find plenty of food for thought!Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal dreams running into an absurd reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title is certainly intriguing, suggesting something ultra sophisticated, and we can guess that 'discreet' will be exposed as 'hypocritical,' and the charm will be superficial. In this we are not disappointed. I should also say this reminds me of the theater of the absurd that had its heyday in the postwar period in Europe and the US with Rhinoceros, Six Characters in Search of an Author, Waiting For Godot, The Birthday Party, etc., and then more or less disappeared, Roberto Benigni's recent cinematic venture, La Vita e Bella (1997) notwithstanding. Most critics however would refer to this work as an example of surrealism, an aesthetic movement in art, theater, cinema, etc. that grew out of Dadaism in the twenties. But the theater of the absurd is later, taking its rationale from the existential work of Camus--see especially his collection of essays, The Myth of Sisyphus (1942)--and Sartre, while getting its name from a book entitled, The Theatre of the Absurd (1960) by Martin Esslin. Regardless of how we tag this, Spanish/French director Luis Bu?uel's treatment is indeed charming and funny.Fernando Rey stars as a diplomat from the country of 'Miranda' who, along with his five constant friends, cannot seem to ever finish a meal. They are the bourgeoisie who are discreet in their sexual activities and their illegalities (Rey's character apparently smuggles cocaine) while maintaining a sort of absurd decorum in which good manners are paramount. A café runs out of tea, well, they will content themselves with coffee. No coffee, well, water will be fine. Guests arrive a day ahead of time, well, we'll go out instead, won't you join us. When a company of soldiers on maneuvers shows up at the house just as they are sitting down to dinner, they are invited to join them, and when the police come to arrest Rey, they all politely intercede only to follow him to jail. When the one finds that his wife is in his friend's bedroom, he is too polite to object.Bu?uel's technique runs realistic scenes into dream sequences without warning. When a soldier sits down to tea to tell his story of horror, all listen politely. When, for the umpteenth time they are ? la table, a curtain parts and they find themselves on stage in front of an audience, they discreetly excuse themselves, saying they have forgotten their lines.Of course Bu?uel must have his little satire of the church, and here he uses a monseigneur who becomes a gardener who hears a last rites confession that reveals that the confessor murdered his, the monseigneur's, parents many years ago. The monseigneur politely and without being ruffled, allows that Jesus forgives him and leaves him in a state of grace, which soothes his conscience as he then picks up a shotgun....So seamlessly does Bu?uel weave his tapestry, that it's sometimes hard to tell when reality ends and the dreams begin, but that is perhaps the point. Our dreams are absurd of course, but then again so is our reality.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>A satire on everyone who's too big for their boots (or secretly wants 2 B), because they will not achieve the aims they pursuit and are ultimately doomed to be separated from their privileges when they wake up to reality. The story may also come across as remote parody on The Last Supper, but from the bourgeois point of view (who never really get their supper), in contrast with 'Viridiana' (1961, Bu?uel), where the poor and disabled DO get their Last Supper. But I don't know much about the bible, so I'm probably wrong about that. It proves though that you don't have to be pious to appreciate Bu?uel's films; in fact, you'd better NOT be.The 'adventure' of the protagonists is a proverbial sinking ship, because they seem to know what they want, but never reach their goal, which is quite simple and basic (to eat), because they're so caught up in supposed etiquette. They have all kinds of knowledge about manners and gestures, but they cannot sit down and eat. That is actually a fairly clear message: 'look before you leap' or 'behold the priorities of life'.What's more indiscrete: drinking a martini the wrong way, or selling cocaine abusing your position as an ambassador and fooling around in the garden while you're having friends over for diner? And are you ultimately discrete simply because nobody discovers your subversive or criminal actions? These guys just can't control their carnal and financial lust, while complaining: 'No system can give the masses the proper social graces. But you know me, I'm not a reactionary.' Blah.Cinematographer Edmond Richard (Le Proc?s (1963, Welles), Fantôme de la liberté, Cet obscur objet du désir) exhibits his excellent collaboration with Bu?uel's visions. Bu?uel tried before to make it easier for audiences to understand the imagery by incorporating it in a dream sequence (e.g. Tristana, 1970), but he returns here (as in Belle de Jour, 1967) to the early days (1930) where the dream sequences were just put forward as if they were reality. You'll never know what is a dream and what is real. As always, there is no music here to guide you, apart from the ringing church bells. Just open up your ears and clean out your eyes and you'll not be disappointed.One last remark: the cover of the video is definitely one of the most applicable and distinctive covers (Ferracci) ever made, as is the cover of 'Fantôme de la liberté' (an odd-faced statue of liberty with a limp torch) by Jean-Paul Commandeur and the cover of 'Cet obscur objet du désir'. Bu?uel didn't worry about the surrealism in his own life. He seemed to live in harmony with all his contradictions and hypocrisy.10 points out of 10 :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incisive satire on social mores and class hypocracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie", a leisurely paced, incisive satire on social mores and class hypocrisy, opens with a group of friends arriving on the wrong day of a dinner engagement. this is only the begining of a succession of unexpected and unusual events to follow. The dinner party is the movie's main setting and it is there that reality and illusion often times blend imperceptibly together. The film is structured as a series of surreal sequences, which prompted esteemed film critic Pauline Kael to opine 'His(Director Louis Bunuel) indifference to dramatic logic is complete.' And how. Bunuel's narrative plays an elaborate game with the viewer through it's subconscious imagery and audacious use of time. His tendency to experiment with technique and form often times led to discovery and innovation. The cinema of Louis Bunuel invariably deals with the discrepancy between appearance and reality; decorum and desire. His world view was subversive and anarchistic. He was a cheerful pessimist, skeptical but not susceptible to Bergmanian despair. His skepticism extended to all of those he found playing too neat a social game. The filmmaker's career was one sustained assault on authoritarianism. Witness an indiscreet character in the film who claims: 'No one system can help the masses acquire refinement.' He believed man was, unconsciously, a slave to custom and aimed to shock viewers out of their unthinking acceptance of established values. "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"(An Academy Award winner in 1972 for Best Foreign Film) is a boldly inventive picture. Dozens of frames are filled with clever filmic devices: environmental noises increase inordinately during routine conversations; an ambiguous procession is inserted freely within the text. These cinematic ploys add intrigue to the already peculiar goings-on. The walk by the main group of characters along a country roadside is mysterious and compelling. The players are noticeably silent and contemplative. Is this an anxious dream? The afterlife? An insignificant flashback? Whichever, the recurring sequence underscores the obliqueness and cool obscurity of the film. One might not identify closely with the disenchanted Bunuelian sensibility or the unsentimental stance he takes, however one knows immediately and unmistakably that they are in the gifted hands of a film technician like a Godard or Kurosawa. A director in complete control of his medium. A highly personal filmmaker frequently referred as 'a poet of hallucination who follows the caprices of his fantastical imagination.' Someone whose fanciful paths of creation were invariably led by the irrational. "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie", with it's arresting mixture of calculation and carelessness, remains a unique and influential movie. The acerbic films of Robert Altman and the perverse mischievousness of the Coen brothers films, to mention but a few, pay a large debt to the strange universe and unconventional perspective of Louis Bunuel. Film lovers uninitiated in surrealist cinema will find "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" an alluring and beguiling crash course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leave it to Luis Bunuel to hit the head of the nail like he did here. The style and mood created by this movie is immaculate. It is a satirical look at complete bedlam through the eyes of our meticulous &amp; pedantic champions. His camera, dialog, settings - everything stays true to his bourgeois focal point. And nowhere do you ever see them or the camera frame lose their cool - even with the world in shambles at every turn. They simply walk through this movie the way blind persons would a construction site.I've heard it said many times that Bunuel made the bourgeois class enemy number one throughout his lifetime - that, and the catholic church, who also receives a fair share of ridicule in the picture. While this movie is more like a dark comedy there is also, I believe, a strong spiritual/philosophical/&amp; moral whatever statement here: That the world and all its unanswerable/unknowable/ &amp; unwatchable chaos can not be simply pushed aside. You can not brush off the dirt and consider yourself above or separate from it. You are part of the whole, and you are most likely viewed as an ass by 95% of the rest of us to consider yourself otherwise. That IS something to laugh at. Bunuel's life and work was a heroic statement against such an unlikely target. It's Bunuel's arsenal of genius versus the impenetrable ignorance of this giant. Bunuel begrudgingly makes them the protagonists, but betrays them ever so slyly. I love it - a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Empty, Hypocrite and Pointless Existence of the Bourgeoisie Class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Paris, the ambassador Don Rafael Acosta (Fernando Rey) of the South American country Miranda, who is also an smuggler of cocaine, comes to a dinner part in the house of Henri (Jean-Pierre Cassel) and Alice Sénéchal (Stephane Audran) with their common friends M. Thevenot (Paul Frankeur), his wife Simone Thévenot (Delphine Seyrig) and her sister Florence (Bulle Ogier) but on the day before the scheduled. Henri is not at home and they invite Alice to go with them to a restaurant close to her house, but an incident does not allow them to have meal together in the place. They reschedule another meal together many times, but problems occur in every occasion and they do not succeed in their intent."Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie" is one of the funniest movies of the master of the surrealism Luis Bu?uel. This intellectual director was a great critic of the values of the Bourgeoisie Class and this movie is a witty joke, blurring the fears this class with reality and nightmare, and open to the most different interpretations. The empty, hypocrite and pointless existence of the Bourgeoisie Class is highlighted by the shallow interest of the characters in meal, sex, etiquette and money and their final journey to nowhere; or the behavior of the disloyal ambassador that betrays his friend having a love affair with his wife; smuggles cocaine using his diplomatic immunity; or shoots the toy of a terrorist in front of the Embassy of Miranda. Further, in 1972, the countries of South America lived under military dictatorship with many exiled people living in Paris, and the arrogant Don Rafael Acosta is hilarious denying the truth about his country. Bu?uel does not spare the church in his satire, with the funny Monsignor Dufour trying to interfere in every subject without the appropriate knowledge. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Discreto Charme da Burguesia" ("The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel's towering achievement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bunuel's career was one of the most sensational you could dream of.At least ten of his movies are among my favorites and ten others are not far behind.Once he said :" when I was young and I was watching the sky and saying :"it's beautiful up there and there's nothing;now,I simply say :"it's beautiful"Atheism had turned into agnosticism.Perhaps so,but Bunuel's favorite targets are still here.The bishop and the army are here to stay;they already were in "l'âge d'or" (1930)"DIscreet charm" is a comprehensive work :it includes almost everything that made Bunuel the genius every cine buff loves ;his permanent features are all included: these bourgeois walking on an endless road are the same who were locked up in the house in "el angel exterminador";Rabal trying to catch one more peace of meat is like the men who were fighting for water in "el angel" .THe selfishness of the bourgeoisie is given a stunning treatment:the impossibility to get a good meal .Bunuel explodes certitudes and he explodes different genres.One of them is the light comedy with its adulteries,its mistaken identities and its contretemps.and if the message is not clear enough,one of the scenes shows the characters on a stage!Another one is the horror and fantasy film : the young boy's mother asking him to kill his father (who is actually not his parent);and most of all the soldier's dream which could provide the substance for at least a whole movie.Dreamlike sequences are Bunuel's forte .He has sometimes been equaled (André Delvaux:"un soir un train" ) but never surpassed: just think of Pablo's dream in "los olvidados" ;the Christ on the electric wires in "cela s'appelle l'aurore" ;Séverine's fantasies in "Belle de Jour" ;Rey's head as a bell clapper in "Tristana".But in "discreet charm" Bunuel seems to connect all the links of the chain and his film becomes a tapestry of Bayeux where dreams and reality follow naturally. "I dreamed ,Thevenot says,that Senechal dreamed that he was on a stage and ..." It' s "Jacob's ladder" twenty years before that later movie appears.It's also a political movie,but not a work for highbrows .What he did not fully achieved with the spotty "la fi?vre monte ? El Pao" ,and the more interesting "death in the garden" ,Bunuel pulls it off with gusto here.The republic (sic) of Miranda whose ambassador is none other than Rey is ,even if we never see it , depicted in minute lavish detail .Unlike highbrows like Godard who deals out his lecture on Mao in "la chinoise" ,Luis Bunuel remains accessible to everybody:we laugh and we laugh a lot when we discover the harsh realities of Miranda Land which has no pyramids ,but has Nazis and poverty.Actually it's not that much funny.A word about the cast;it's perfect:Rey is wonderful as a drug trafficker ambassador who is always afraid to be slain ;Stephane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel had teamed up two years before in another attack against bourgeoisie ,Chabrol's "la rupture" ;Bulle Ogier,for once,forgets her usual parts who give the non-intellectual terrible headaches and manages to stay very natural;Claude Piéplu and his inimitable voice (make sure you hear his voice:nobody can dub him successfully) portrays a colorful colonel who tells the ambassador home truth and literally invades Audran's house with his staff and has lunch with the guests (a meal where the bourgeois,the Church and the Army eat together is something to watch).But for me the stand-out is feminist Delphine Seyrig,with her beaming face,her preciosity and her sweet stupidity.To say that "discreet charm" is a masterpiece is to state the obvious.Maybe Bunuel's tour de force lies in the fact that even in reality,strange things happen and the characters do not seem to be surprised and shocked.... as long as their privileges are not called into question.If you should only see one Bunuel film,you had to choose this one.But if you like it,treasures are waiting for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not many artists who could tell the same joke over and over again and get away with it creating the film as brilliant, funny, absurd, witty, and clever as Bu?uel's "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie", 1972. The story of six friends who try to arrange and have a nice dinner together but cannot complete (or even start) their meal does not sound very exiting but wait until you watch this comedy. I've always known how interesting surrealism is but I never thought how funny it could be. I've seen the film four or five times - it only gets better with each viewing.

The dinner party is always broken up and they never get a chance to eat. They never go a chance to feed their desires in life be it food or sex. This is used a symbol to show that people are always starving inside and they are always searching (hence the last shot of the film!)

		<fullReview>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is not about something in particular . It doesn't have a plot and doesn't really need one. It is about the constant interruptions that ruin the dinners of some french bourgeoisie friends, interruptions mostly surreal and absurd. The movie is not as shocking and acid as Bunuel's earlier work but it is more chiseled and as weird and witty as those . Also, the dream sequences are made exceptionally.The film satirizes french bourgeoisie but as I said it is not really an acid satire but a surreal comedy/drama that doesn't really have to make sense. Dream in dream sequences are often used to express the character's unrests and troubles. The movie is somehow similar to The Exterminating Angel where the characters, after they eat cannot leave the room even though there is nothing stopping them. Here, different situations interrupt the characters from eating. These situations are absurd and illogic, just like the ones in The Exterminating Angel.The situations are absolutely amazing and Bunuel once again makes a statement. The bourgeoisie characters are shown as false and hypocritical as they are funny to the viewers. The movie is complex and unusual and different from anything you've ever seen.Watch it! It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because Luis Bu?uel is a "genius" that doesn't excuse the quasi-intellectuals that credit this film as a work of art. It is a pathetic attempt to make an artistic social statement. Obvious statements in ridiculous and absurd scenarios that any second rate film student could have done a better job. Critics proclaim this film to be great and inspiring but they are just indulging themselves, each other, their egos and their false intellect. The emperor has no clothes. Don't waste your time on this one. So, yet another indulgent requirement. Apparently commentaries must exceed a minimum length. Just like the movie, we must inflate the value of our opinions with self indulgent drivel. As if we haven't the ability to be succinct in our critique.</fullReview>

And the 3 dull bourgeois chicks are bangable. I have literally nothing else to write after seeing this. Maybe this could be a precursor to Monty Python... but Python existed for a few years before this! Jesus the film still hasn't finished. I will soooo forget it, that in 10 years I will probably try to see it again, remembering half way that I already did. It could have been called "Dull people are dull", or "When do we eat?". Or "Boring people try to eat together". But it could be turned into a decent porn movie... END RANT Thank God, the end credits started rolling.

		<fullReview>Not only are the lives of the bourgeoisie characters in the film pointless and irrelevant, but the film itself is pointless and irrelevant. To have people astounded by the "brilliance" of the film and the "genius" of Bunuel is to me astounding in itself. While someone like Fellini can entrance, Bunuel might have well produced a film based on alcoholic, drug-addicted ne'er-do-wells that said nothing worthwhile or did nothing worthwhile. A disjointed, badly acted, phony presentation of a group of individuals that are worth nothing yet somehow cunning enough (in the film) to elevate themselves to positions of importance. I found myself asking "What is the point of this film?" and the answer kept coming up "There is no point and the whole production is absurd." Contrived and unrelated dream sequences that go nowhere. Actions by the actors that mean nothing and make no sense in any context. Perhaps because the majority of viewers are in the same category as the actors in the film, they can relate to it. I cannot. There is nothing worthwhile to be taken from this film. If one derives intellectual meaning from such as this, I feel sorry for them.My inner self insisted on adding the following: A knock came on the door of my subconscious. I opened it, and it was a vacuum cleaner salesman who pushed past me and sat down on my couch."Did you have an unhappy childhood?" he asked, and continued without pause: "I did. I used to have a recurring dream where I was walking down a road. Did you eat lunch? It is curious that it is not raining out, is it not?" He then proceeded to begin a one-sided conversation of mechanical engineering from a feminist perspective. Without stopping after he had finished his discourse, he began to relate the mystical aspects of flatulence. Midway through this conversation, he stopped to say "I'm sorry, I have to leave now. I have another appointment. Thank you for your order." And left, leaving the door open.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm just experiencing Bunuel for the first time. I am captivated. Having seen the darker Exterminating Angel first, I had a sense of what he is about. This is another surreal effort that puts upper class people in a situation where they seem to have free will, yet are at the whim of some outside force. Of course, there is always the possibility that the problems lie in their minds. Is it Freudian or Jungian or what? In this a group of wealthy people attempt to eat several meals and are cut off at the pass by several forces, not allowing a conclusion. They are also interesting characters. The women are snobbish and sensual, cold and calculating; one is a drunk. The men are involved in illegal activities and seem to pay a great price. Or do they? That's the issue. They seem to be saddled with guilt. Every so often, a non-sequitir comes along, stops whatever plot has developed, and another dinner is served. A young lieutenant tells the tale of a double murder of his parents and his vengeance. Soldiers appear at dinner. Police arrest them. They are unscathed. I can not tell you any more about what this means because I'm not even sure Bunuel can. It is a striking piece of work, full of humor, disease, and class warfare. Interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Water and soup--and restless dreams--for the cultivated classes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French-Italian-Spanish co-production under the helm of director Luis Bu?uel concerning an odd-duck group of upper-class friends and acquaintances in Paris who meet often for meals and conversation, only to rarely savor their cuisine due to a peculiar series of interruptions. Bu?uel, who also co-authored the screenplay with Jean-Claude Carri?re, at times gently skewers the hungry wealthy; his characters are not decadent nor lazy, perhaps just comically fettered; the filmmaker doesn't score points against their lives as much as he prods the folly of their ways. The lapses of reality into a satirical daisy-chain of dreams is surprising at first but finally monotonous, especially as Bu?uel becomes less sly here and more mean-spirited (I could have done without the police interrogation and the piano torture). Still, there are some marvelous visual touches (such as the dinner table on-stage) accompanied by a subtle yet vivid use of color, and the cast is uniformly excellent. Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Film. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an untidy mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am aware many think its a classic but the film is pretentious and actually quite stupid. The symbolism is heavy handed. I know that many think this is a masterpiece but its a confusing mess. There are some parts that are forgotten and never explained. A woman comes on denying Christ but we never find out why. The sets look beautiful and to be fair there is a certain glamor to the film. The cast do what they can and the fault is not with he actors but with the director who seems to have an over blown ego. This was made at a time when some directors were trying to be very arty, esoteric and too clever by half. Today its a shambles. Some of the interior locations look fine but the dream sequences are just ridiculous. This sadly is almost embarrassing to watch today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six upper middle class jerks attempt to meet for dinner on a number of occasions and find themselves caught up in many a farce. In "The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie", the everyday becomes entangled with dream at every turn. The reality of the drug running foreign ambassador comes into direct conflict with the guerrilla forces his domestic policies engender, the gardener monseigneur of the church ends up taking confession from his parents' murderer while the culprit is on his deathbed, the cocktail party hosted by a general breaks down into a small battle in his dining room, a sexually frustrated couple are forced to elude their company and couple out in the garden, an afternoon luncheon is turned into an audit of fratricidal confession from a young army lieutenant. At every crossroads, the pretentious "civility" of professional society finds itself disrupted by the casual violence and mayhem that underscores their class privilege. Bunuel's use of the nightmare tells the audience what the bourgeoisie knows very well: they know what a bunch of casual gangsters they actually are, and sleep will not let them hide from themselves. And none of the charm of the bourgeoisie will be enough to break them away from their ongoing isolation from themselves and nature, expressed very cleanly by Bunuel's repeated image of the six professionals, in semi-formal dress, walking down a country road in the middle of nowhere. And it's all very funny, in an unfunny sort of way.Bunuel's masterpiece holds up well, almost forty years after its release. Here's a farce that demonstrates just how far a "satirist" like Sasha Baron Cohen ("Borat") really has to go before he has anything substantial to say with farce or film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dinner At...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere within the miles of celluloid, Luis Bunuel could be heard snickering to himself as he put these hapless socialites through the most absurd situations as he made them, in a parallel world, walk through fields of green down a road that seems to lead to somewhere but proves to be a road to nowhere.Isn't it an overwhelming experience to meet a director's work just at the moment he's at his peak form? The exhilaration of letting his vision come through to you, invade your senses, and make the exact connections, has to be of the most intimate kind -- mind to heart. If and when that happens, you can safely say you are in the hands of a master of visual storytelling.Luis Bunuel was seventy-two when he directed his Oscar-winning film LE CHARME DISCRET DE LA BOURGEOISIE. This is the age period when many directors tend to lose their touch and favor some excess baggage or poor storytelling in lieu of sharp execution. Virtually every director who has reached this late period in life and is still working has the tendency to suffer at the encroaching shadow of death. Just look at the work of Sidney Lumet, Woody Allen (who since MATCH POINT is on his way back to form), Kubrick's last movie EYES WIDE SHUT, to name a few.Not Bunuel. Right up untl his last movie -- CET OBSCUR OBJET DU DESIR -- he was razor-sharp, keen, and as subtle as a bulldozer, and that's why this film is one of his best and a fascinating work of art. The story of six socialites who can never seem to consummate a simple social act -- in this case, dining -- due to the most implausible of things is in one way a version of his 1962 film EL ANGEL EXTERMINADOR, but where in that film there was no way out of a house, here all of the characters are in constant freedom. That is, until Bunuel reveals his fangs and decides he's gotten tired of playing cat and mouse with this horrendously vapid, vicious people.Hearkening back to L'AGE D'OR, Bunuel revisits the themes he introduced in that film: couples needing to make love in their own garden, causing an uproar, or upright citizens committing crimes against defenseless people (in this case, a member of the clergy who gets reunited with the man who killed his parents and who pretends to absolve the dying man before shooting him in the head, a hysterical high point). One could argue that there seems to be no point in going around in circles... but then again, aren't the lives of these "rich and famous" equally pointless? Aren't these the kind of people who would look down at anyone who wasn't a part of their social circle? Aren't these the same people who, despite living a life of complacency, also have their own dabbling in the underbelly of society -- drug trade -- and have become the inevitable targets of terrorists who would rather eradicate them from the face of this Earth? Ironically, the Surrealist elements of the movie are less to be remembered due to the fact that they're not meant to shock as much as to be a part of the "plot", itself as absurd as a pie in the sky or a Magritte painting. A man is tortured with some odd device inside a piano as the camera pans away to show cockroaches pouring out from inside it, a slight nod to the odd piano sequence from UN CHIEN ANDALOU. The jailer is shown bleeding, at death's door, freeing the six socialites -- a nod to the bleeding man in L'AGE D'OR. A soldier tells his own story of discovering his father wasn't his father via his dead mother who appears in a way similar to the way ghosts tend to manifest themselves in Asian horror films. And of course, whenever there needs to be an logical explanation of things, Bunuel incorporates big, booming sounds, essentially telling us that he could care less of the machinations of things. Because after all, this is a man who was never at ease explaining films, and who made them because this was his way of expressing himself. And in making movies for himself, he made movies for the masses who could get his warped but irreverent view of humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>surreal yes, but not all that interesting or funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an odd little film about some people who never do get to sit down to the meal they plan on having. A lot of weird and unexpected stuff intervenes--during which you learn a little more about the characters (particularly how unlikeable some of them are). The problem I had with the movie is this--it just wasn't very interesting and I repeatedly felt like turning it off because I found it more boring than compelling. Now this is not because of the surreal nature of the film--I have a relatively high tolerance for the strange and unconventional (just look at my glowing review for the VERY surreal Happiness of Katakuris). It's just that strange as it was, it just wasn't too interesting nor was it weird enough to make that great an impression. I know it puts me in a very small minority, but most of the Luis Bu?uel films I have seen were not that compelling--odd yes, but not particularly interesting. About the only one I really liked was the sad film "Tristan".UPDATE: I've seen most of the director's films since I wrote this review. I did find several (other than "Tristan") that I really did like. However, I still think he had about as many hits as misses and feel he was a bit overrated. But, films like "Robinson Crusoe" and "The Young One" are indeed exceptional films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the Road to Nowhere {Luis Bunuel}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie forms a trilogy with the earlier "Exterminating Angel" and the later "Phantom of Liberty". They are all concerned with that stereotypically "modern man" termed the "bourgeoisie". How does Bunuel characterize this social phenomenon in this movie? Surprisingly, not as harshly as he does in the other two movies of the trilogy.The Discreet Charm does not have a prologue {as in the other two in this trilogy} but opens up with the two couples arriving in a chauffeur driven limousine. The VIP whose vehicle it is , is the ambassador for the fictional Latin American state of "Miranda" {in Spanish this name denotes "admirable" and here Bunuel's cynicism is clear}. The ambassador is corrupt, and like many Colombian diplomats of the time, was using his supposed "diplomatic immunity" to smuggle cocaine into France. The other two French citizens are his accomplices. They do not use the drug themselves but instead liberally dose themselves with the legally acceptable bourgeois drug "alcohol"In a series of humorous and teasingly droll sketches, Bunuel illustrates how these corrupt men and their colluding female partners act out their empty lives of hypocrisy and deceit.. There class snobbery is clearly demonstrated,when the Bishop dressed as a gardener is evicted from the house, but on reentering in his official clerical costume, he is immediately embraced. The bourgeois, always insecure about their own position in society, are always making presumptuous judgments about the social positions of other people, making their lack of substance obvious. Throughout the movie, the continual lack of social concern in their relationships, as emotionally connected human beings, is made clear. The metaphor of "breaking bread together", one of the most intimate of human experiences, is continually subverted by rampant egotism and selfish desires.The scene when Bunuel has the dining table become a stage with a prompter giving them their lines, {as in Shakespeare's As You Like It "All the worlds a stage, and all the men and women merely players'}, is a brilliant confirmation of the emptiness of the bourgeois existence - simply stunning in its honesty {and so opposed to their inherent dishonesty}.Other facets of the devious nature, of the bourgeois personality, pursued by Bunuel in this movie, are the paranoid dream and thought constructions, used to resolve problems {a pernicious form of dishonesty} and the recurrent theme of the six bourgeois characters walking on the open road - "The Road to Nowhere".Bunuel devoted three whole movies to unmasking this scourge of human greed and existential poverty. The Surrealist program saw a revolution in human society as a prerequisite of a better world for all. Bunuel remained true to this creed throughout his artistic life. This movie is funny and entertaining. I can think of no greater compliment to give it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a master satirist, showing no mercy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The aristocracy met its match in Luis Bu?uel, who throughout his career delighted in kicking the legs out from under the hypocrisies and pretensions of the rich and powerful. One of the late director's last and most effective satires was this typically mannered but nonetheless savage attack on society's ultimate villains: the church, the military and, most of all, the idle upper class, seen here frustrated while attempting to indulge in their favorite social ritual: dining out. The film is loosely organized into an elliptical series of surreal (and sometimes unrelated) episodes, in which every chance for a group of wealthy friends to share a simple meal is frustrated by, among other distractions: a funeral, a military training exercise, and finally by a band of terrorists who gun them all down in (appropriately) cold blood. Bu?uel's signature wit and dream symbolism is in ample evidence throughout, and his eye for social absurdity was rarely so critical or keen. But maybe the best joke of all in the film is that its intended targets are also the ideal audience for such highbrow humor, laughing alongside Bu?uel without even recognizing themselves as the butt of his subtle mockery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>un chien discreet charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years after directing the surrealist movie "Un chien andalou", Luis Bu?uel made "Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie" about a group of upper-class people whose attempts to have a nice dinner get repeatedly interrupted. The movie is simultaneously a bizarre comedy and a mockery of the bourgeoisie's materialistic attitude towards life, and a really good one at that. To crown everything, the characters accept the events, no matter how weird things get! Fernando Rey, hot off playing one of the villains in "The French Connection", plays a diplomat from the fictional Latin American country of Miranda*. People address him about the gap between rich and poor, and about his government's use of excessive force against protesters, and meanwhile a terrorist (revolutionary?) follows him everywhere. He comes across as a slimy guy, but you can't help but admire him.The scene where everyone walks towards an unspecified location seems to reflect the lives that this bunch of people leads in general. Their wealth deprives them of any purpose in life, and so they are left wandering, metaphorically speaking.All in all, I definitely recommend this one. Also starring Paul Frankeur, Delphine Seyrig, Bulle Ogier, Stéphane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel.*While there is no country called Miranda, there is a Mirandese language spoken in northeast Portugal. Just a side note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny surrealism that strikes conventions and fashions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The systematic analysis of this film would be in my opinion a gigantic task, since there are so many topics, stories and references intermingled in the chaotic way the surrealists are so fond of. I think the two main topics -sometimes in surrealism there is not even one- are dreams and transgression of social norms and traditions. The film is articulated on linked-up situations: five gatherings of a group of bourgeois friends and four stories, four dreams which are dreamt by different characters. The suppers are more common in the first part of the film, and the dreams on a second part, but they alternate with each other and with other episodes, like that of the terrorist girl. At the beginning things seem not to turn out good: right the first thing we see is the perplexity of the guests to M. Senechal house when they are told the supper was planned for the next day. 'But that is impossible', says Acosta, 'I couldn't have accepted, tomorrow I'm busy'. Contradiction with no explanation, right the same way as things happens in a dream, where we accept the reality of what we dream without explanations, even if it is impossible or contradictory with something else -dreams are the core of surrealism and of this film. This baffling beginning really impressed me. There is contradiction and kind of a difficulty to do things in every single detail in the next sequence: Mme and M Senechal are invited to dine out, but she has to change. The restaurant 'n'a pas l'air gai', and the door is locked. They knock and they are invited in. The owners have changed. There is no people and the prices are cheap. Everything is suspicious. And then the first punch of the story: the manager died that afternoon and the wake has been set in the dining room since the undertaker has not yet arrived. Of course, the bourgeois leave. This is the first reference to death, a constant theme either in surrealism, in dreams and in this film. It seems as if the whole film was a dream. Within the context things are logical and normal -or seem logical and normal- to the characters, and their reactions are 'contextually' logical too, but from the outside the stories in the film are as odd as any dream we can have. E.g., when Acosta shoots the terrorist girl from his window, or when the army appeared at M. Senechal's house, or even when the bishop tells M Senechal that he wants to be the family gardener. They are baffled, but they accept the things that happen, as we are baffled by or dreams but accept their logic when we are dreaming. Social transgression is based on a subtle but scorning parody of the bourgeois class and their customs and beliefs. The bourgeois are classy, and conceited: they show off their vain culinary knowledge every time they host a supper. M. Thevenot boasts that 'discreet charm' of the bourgeois when he subtly makes fun of the chauffeur: he does not know how to drink a Martini. Later on, Acosta cheats on Thevenot when he tells him that he has to show his wife the 'sursiks'. Thevenot does not know what that is, but he is an hypocrite not to say it. The bourgeois are also extremely fond of the lowest vices and they enjoy them gaily -I do not think, on the other side, that Bu?uel is condemning them, but the hypocritical attitude of the bourgeoisie. Drug trafficking and consumption, lust, alcohol. The commentaries about the younger girl vomiting and dirty nails and her ignorance (the complex of Euclides, she says at some point) point out -and laugh at- the hypocrisy in the values of the middle-high classes. Also the Church and the Army are criticized. The Bishop, a main head of the Church, is humble -a extremely acid irony- but will mercilessly kill a poor man that will die anyway -that adds to the cruelty. The Bishop is also ignorant: he does not know where the Republic of Miranda is. The soldiers and officers smoke marihuana and praise it, they even are connoisseurs! -'Mexico or Congo?', the general asks, referring to the origins of the product.. The dreams come over mainly in the second part of the film. Both the two first of them are dreamt by soldiers. I really enjoyed them. In the first one I see a little bit of a reference of the life in Spain on the times when Bu?uel was a kid -I do not know Bu?uel's early life in Spain, but I presume there could be some autobiography. The looks of the parents of the young soldier, their clothes and the strict, militarist attitude of the father made me think of the Spanish family life in the turn of the century XIX to XX. I also liked the second dream. The dark and blurry street and house and the background noise make a great dreamy scene. In this dream, the soldier meets a dead friend. Then another friend comes over, and makes him realize that it is impossible. Sometimes in real dreams this happens too. Something happens and then, with no explanation, we realize that is impossible. It also should be pointed out that these two dreams share two primal human topics: motherly feelings and fear to death. The topic of death is present in some other dreams: the general's, in which Acosta shoots him dead; or the dream about the ghost of the sergeant. Another primal fear is dealt with in Senechal's dream: shame. They are caught in a theater stage while they are having dinner -this is a recurrent dream that sometimes takes other forms: being naked in the middle of the street or lying on your bed wearing you pajamas in your classroom. I also found humor all over the film: funny situations such as the bishop offering himself as a gardener, or the straws in M. and Mme. Senechal hair. Acosta playing tricks on Thevenot, or the soldiers happily smoking joints and listening to a 'sympa' dream. But I do not know if Bu?uel is trying to be funny or only to transgress. And that transgression is hilarious because it reveals the hypocrisy of society.</fullReview>

They try and try but it never works. The guests comes a day before(then the people just say like: Well, join us instead). A Cafe has no tee, then they try with coffee but the Cafe does not have any coffee either. When a couple of soldiers comes to their home they polite ask them to join them.In the film the line between dreams and the absurd reality is impossible to see. The characters in the film are discreet when they are having sex and also one of the people in the film: Ray, he smuggles cocaine! A film that shows that our dreams are crazy but so is our reality to.Also the cinematography is some of the best I have seen in a long time.A highly recommended film were you(now I am saying it again=)never know what is dream and what is real. Right now I am giving this 9/10, maybe 10/10 I am not sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Odd Film, But Maybe Not Odd Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A surreal, virtually plot less series of dreams centered around six middle-class people and their consistently interrupted attempts to have a meal together.The analysis of this film seems to be about drawing parallels to Sartre's "No Exit" and the Greek myth of Tantalus. I see the latter, while the former sounds like a stretch. The most obvious analysis appears to me to be what the film is on the face of it: a scathing look at the rich.Bu?uel later said that he was disappointed with the analysis that most film critics made of the film. He also disliked the film's promotional poster, depicting a pair of lips with legs and a derby hat. Which analyses he disliked I do not know, and what message we all missed is unclear.My biggest disappointment was how strange the film was not, especially after such classic works like "Un Chien Andalou". While essentially plot less, this film is still quite linear and sensical in its own way. I could have used more oddity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurd and surreal masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant way to end your career, Bunuel's last 3 movies were this, Phantom of Liberty and That Obscure Object of Desire, 3 complete masterpieces. The Discreet Charm is my personal favorite out of those 3 films, Phantom of Liberty being my "least" favorite, love that movie, but not as good as this nor That Obscure Object of Desire. Let me start by saying, the greatest title to any movie ever. A bit too long, but very clever and unique. This is one of my favorite Bunuel movies, very surreal, great idea, funny and satirical points. This is maybe Bunuel's most direct attack on the Bourgeois lifestyle and their manors. The Exterminating Angel (my favorite Bunuel movie) is more subtle on it's attack, but this isn't suppose to be all that subtle. It is a straight attack on them. Showing how superficial they are and how pretentious they are. And it's pretty funny to see them cheating on each other and leaving a dinner just to sex in the bushes. The premise is wonderful, 6 friends try to dine together but always get interrupted. Actually that's the first half, the second half is the dream part, where we see the dreams of certain characters and their fears and desires. In those dream we see how barbaric they really are and in the first half we see how superficial these people are. Bunuel said that the cockroaches were the most likable characters in this movie and yeah, I guess I wouldn't disagree with him. All the bourgeois are as*holes. They judge people on how they dress and dinner isn't about eating to them, it's about their social statues. Just how grotesque their dining is. I love how he directs this, how he's so in control of whats happening. Bunuel interrupts them so many times that he makes the audiences to want to see these people eat together. And the interruptions are so absurd and weird. Like most of his movies, there is no logic in Bunuel's world. The people accept these incredibly weird things and just move on. One interesting question I have is, did they eat at home or didn't they eat until they could eat together? It would be pretty funny if they wouldn't eat until they could eat together. But what ever.. Characters are like puppets in his this movie. The first half it's them trying to eat together, but can't, the second half is about the dreams. Bunuel plays it so well, because you don't know when is it a dream and when is it. When the next dream comes, you forgot that all these are dreams and accept it as reality. Then he shows the characters waking up and you realize. You can see how much he hated the bourgeois lifestyle and how absurd he thought it was. Even how they treat each other is pretty rude.The attack on bourgeois lifestyle is pretty direct, not really subtle at all. Bunuel shows just how superficial bourgeois and they act that they are better than everybody else, but still psychologically they are completely similar. Only difference of being a bourgeois and a peasant is how you dress. When the priest comes, dressed as a gardener, they treat him horribly, when he comes back dressed as a priest, they treat him with great respect. The priest, dressed as a peasant, is saying that he's a priest, but they don't believe him. Through out the film they act like how they are not "barbaric" and act sophisticated, but when we see their dreams, they have barbaric dreams. In a way, the movie is about the bourgeois lifestyle.Absurd is a key word in a review of a Bunuel movie. This movie, while totally surreal, is most importantly, absurd to the point it's surreal. There is a fine of line of surrealism and absurdness. Some of the things are so out of the left field you just have to laugh. And this movie is a comedy after all, a comedy without jokes. He literally makes fun of bourgeois problems, how they can't eat together. The premise of the movie is so absurd that you can't help to laugh. One thing I don't understand is the "trip to the country" scenes. I don't understand that at all, was it a dream or did they went to the country or what? I guess there's always questions when it come to Bunuel's movies. Again Bunuel wants to shock the viewer and I think he does an excellent job on that. The priest killing the man, the ambassador shooting that man, couple having sex in the bushes and that torture scene were all pretty shocking. Also the dream that shocked me the most was, when the terrorists comes to the house and shoots all of them. I forgot that that was a dream, so naturally I was shocked. Also so many techniques were and still are quite unique, dream within a a dream, completely random scenes (trip to the country), use of the "white noise" and sudden surreal flashbacks are all unique and really goes well with the movie. Absolutely brilliant movie, Bunuel's second funniest movie, right behind The Phantom of Liberty. Satirical, attacking, funny, beautiful and unique all at the same time. If you haven't seen this by now, I urge you to, it's definitely worth of your time. When ever I have to go to a dinner I'm always worried that this will happen to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another entry from Luis Bunuel, Discreet Charm is an overlapping story of a group of rich people trying to get together for dinner. The first attempt is made at a house where the owners explain that the party was scheduled for the next night, and so they travel to a restaurant, and are told by the staff that the manager has died, and they are waiting for the coroner, while they hold a vigil over the corpse; not to worry it gets stranger, as two days later one of the couples takes off to have sex in a garden. Next up, some of the women check out a tea house which has run out of all beverages, except for water. A bishop shows up wearing gardeners clothes and is thrown out. When he returns in his vestments, they kiss his ass, revealing their hypocrisy. The good man of the cloth tells his flock that his parents were poisoned, and the murderer never caught. He later visits a dying man, administering the Last Rites. Before shuffling off this mortal coil, the near dead guy reveals a terrible secret to the bishop, which leads to a shocking conclusion, unlike anything you have ever seen. Bunuel was a visionary filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating film from Luis Bunuel about "six characters in search of a meal." Six characters, led by the always charming Rey, as an ambassador, plan dinner engagements that are either mixed up or ignored by some members of the group. With every scene, they get closer to eating something, but there's always something to complicate things. Bunuel constantly finds ways of ridding the possibility of eating, drinking or even getting comfortable in their seats at a dinner party or restauraunt. From dead bodies in the parlor of a restauraunt to a curtain opening and the lucky six being thrown to an angry audience, Bunuel is always finding ways to put the laugh on us perhaps. The use of the "dream" in this film is also quite interesting. Bunuel's characters dream what every individual is capable of or what other characters are capable of doing to them; murder, the past and their own death. (Wonderful sequence with 5 of the group gunned down by a machine gun and Rey sitting under the dinner table, only to reach his hand out to grab some meat...so he can finally eat something.) Won the Oscar for the Best Foreign Language Film of 1972, this is in intriguing film that also features excellent use of the camera and a series of "travel shots," as I like to call it, as we see our group of friends walk aimlessly in search of a place to eat.</fullReview>

Ionesco,Monty Python,the poets of the absurd,never did reach the heights of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie;this film is unmatched.Its aesthetics is wonderful,because everything in this film is necessary and well-marked and thoroughgoing;Le Charme Discret ...'s thoroughness is amazing.I must confess I love The Discreet Charm the most.Its conception is wild and chilling,and,most of all,deep and gruesome,while the execution shows sobriety and an unmatched precision and control over the artistic means.It belongs to a class of amazing masterpieces:the highest class.It is also obviously rich in thought,in reflection,the product of Luis Bu?uel's lifetime thought life.Nothing here is arbitrary.It is not at all a surrealistic joke ,a playful improvisation,a series of gags (that might be valuable as lowbrow fun),but the product of very mature thought and discernment.On the other hand,no slasher movie ever was so chilling.The director is not at all playful,but sardonic and brutal.The sarcasm is striking.Its scope is vast,larger than that of Tristana (1970) or of Belle De Jour (1967).A work of sulfurous sarcasm,of mordant and sarcastic ampleness,of anticlerical scandal,of neatness,of precision,it goes farther than any other film.It breathes pure air.No concession is made.It attains a level of real universality.Not a few good and humane people are saddened by Luis Bu?uel's masterpiece.Stéphane Audran is a very interesting presence,and an amazing physical actress,in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title proverb seems to be attributed to Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), not to an ancient philosopher of old Greece or the Roman Empire, as it might seem the obvious...It is quite fit to the English people character, if there is such thing. The English area a practical people, they adapt their ways of thinking to the current needs of life.Sorry for this introduction, I am not English. Neither was Bunuel.This movie "The discreet charm of the bourgeoisie" illustrates the proverb.. The characters spend their time attempting to have a decent meal, "haute cuisine", gastronomically speaking.. Such pleasure is always denied and postponed by the most incredible events... Bunuel amuses us and himself with those detours...Which mean nothing..But, in the end, that dinner is ready to be eaten. However, a bunch of gangsters or policemen murder everyone but Don Rafael the main character in the plot, and I believe this film has a very simple short plot. He manages to hide under the table, make a sandwich (invented by the English Earl of Sandwich) of "gigot" (lamb's leg) and survives eating it...So, you are warned. In order to survive and live long, don't take to diets...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked this movie out randomly because all I knew was that Iwanted to watch a Bunuel, and I totally loved it. I loved the humor,the absurdity, and the blur between the real and the unreal. Thereis also an underlying tension throughout the movie that I find,reaches its height when the characters find themselves onstageand the camera zooms in on Sénéchal who says something alongthe lines of "I don't know my text". There is such a feeling ofanguish at this point and this so well illustrates our fear of beingcaught unaware and exposed for the world to laugh at us. For some reason I was also thinking that the bishop was anundercover cop or something sketchy. I thought this would beconfirmed when Madame Sénéchal said that she made the soupout of the garden herbs and the bishop wasn't there. At this point Ithought that his whole point in wanting to take over the gardeningwas to poison the herbs. This may sound a little silly now, but thisis exactly what this movie does, it makes all possibilities plausibleand acceptable. Despite the fact that this was made over 30 years ago, I think itretains all its charm is a wonderful (and sympathetic) satire of theFrench bourgeoisie, who is obsessed with eating caviar but endsup eating an omelet with ham. I thought it really cool when peoplepopped in and told their dreams, and then just left. If people trulyacted the way the characters in this movie do, the world would be amuch better place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genius work of art unfortunately incomplete version for US audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant film, Bunuel chose a very surrealistic film language to tell this story about a small group of people who meet for dinner/lunch and never seem to get to eat. Many different levels of storytelling add up to to wonderful composition of little scenes that, each standing for itself, could be a little movie. A must for any filmmaker and lover of art and culture, and a feast for any consumer. - For those who are interested: Long time ago it was worth a scandal at its US premiere at 1972 ! Surprising that the US DVD Version is still amputated for a harmless and tastefully shot scene, where the characters sit on the table, with half naked bottoms. Less to see than in any teen-wet T-shirt -contest-comedy. My recommendation: Get a European copy! This film evidently is part of film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeois is an abstract and gleefully cynical attack on the upper classes. A group of middle-class people trying to have dinner keep getting interrupted in bizarre ways. There isn't much of a plot here and it often makes little sense. Essentially, it's just a collection of symbols and metaphors, but done in the best possible way with humour, brilliant style and enormous intelligence. It's an insane, wildly entertaining and endlessly smart oddball of a movie, with a fine script and Luis Bunuel's superb direction allowing the film to get better and better as it goes from one beautifully bizarre scene to another. It's a film which you'd never see now, and as an expression of art and innovation, it's a true delight to watch. This is enormously recommended for fans of Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch as well as fans of the avant-garde in general. It's a really fascinating film and critiques of society don't get much cooler than this. Highly recommended and well-worth seeing. Just don't expect a plot, a hint of logic or sense or a single dull moment. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This came in the outstanding 10-DVD boxed set 'Rialto Pictures: 10 Years', one of the finest things I've bought from The Criterion Collection (and a great deal too, one I'd heartily endorse).I had to wait an entire day, after watching the dreadful 'Disaster Movie', to get the acrid taste out of my mouth to watch this one, by my fourth favourite director ever ('Viridiana' is still probably my favourite of his, though). Luckily it had three of my favourite French actors from the period, in Bulle Ogier (just check out 'Maitresse' if you don't understand why), Delphine Seyrig and Fernando Rey (for the two 'French Connection' films alone)--even though for a director of Bunuel's strength, any actors could have sufficed. It's the ideas that stand out most triumphantly.It's most known for being Bunuel's Oscar-winner for Best Foreign Language Film, but its OTHER nomination is what's almost neglected when people talk about him. Yes, they talk about Bunuel the director, or (from David Thomson) Bunuel the photographer, but people never realize his two nominations for the Calanda, Spain-native were never for director, but for writing (with another nod for his swan song, 'The Obscure Object of Desire').</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Academy Award-winner The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a largely surreal comedy film, following a few characters, including a corrupt ambassador from a fictional Latin American country, Miranda. As the title suggests, to a degree it's about uncovering the true, and not necessarily clean, life of the bourgeoisie. It has some success, and also as the title suggests, charm there. I laughed at the couple sneaking out to have sex, coming back to greet their guests with grass in their hair. Some of the characters are involved in drugs. Some resort to violence. There are other absurd things that made me laugh- the man shooting a toy is one.Some things also stood out, not necessarily for comic value. The childhood memory the lieutenant had of his mother's ghost convincing him to kill his evil guardian isn't funny, but is an interesting twist to an already-abstract film. Later, the priest finding himself having to bless the man who killed his parents is another twist, and it's interesting to see how the priest will react to the situation.That said, I found myself enjoying the first half more so than the rest of the film. As we delve deeper into the dreams within dreams, the film loses its structure, and I found myself wanting more plot. Even with the beginning, the laughs weren't coming as fast and furiously as I would have liked. Ultimately, this is a film catered to a certain taste that won't work with everybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This French film from BAFTA nominated director Luis Bu?uel (Un Chien Andalou, Land Without Bread, Belle De Jour) has a very iconic poster, the big pair of lips with legs wearing stockings and a bowler hat, and being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I was hoping the film itself would be as good as the poster. Basically the film consists of guests gathering for a dinner together, and this is intertwined with the individual characters having dreams about weird things happening at the dinner, making the latter of the film complex and virtual. The guests attending the dinner are Ambassador Don Rafael Acosta (Fernando Rey), Madame Simone Thévenot (Delphine Seyrig), M. Thevenot (Paul Frankeur) and Florence (Bulle Ogier), with the evening hosted by Alice Sénéchal (BAFTA nominated Stéphane Audran) and her husband Henri (Jean-Pierre Cassel). You are not sure of all the scenes, apart from the obvious things, whether they are part of a dream or reality, as every time the upper-middle class people try to have their dinner something interrupts them. Events in the dinner attempts include dropped turkeys/chickens, the table appearing on a theatre stage in front of a live audience, dead characters walking around as blood-covered zombies, and heavily armed men storming in and killing everyone with machine guns. Also starring Julien Bertheau as Bishop Dufour, Claude Piéplu as Colonel and Michel Piccoli as Home Secretary. Despite not knowing where to go and what was real in this film, I did find it an interesting watch, especially with the interruptions and bizarre scenarios, like the theatre and gun scenes, and the editing is certainly inventive, so I would say it is a worthwhile surreal comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced, and it won the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film.

		<fullReview>At this point, Luis Bunuel has become so masterful he'll lead you to believe in it through everything, even when it's a dream.Six bourgeois friends. Many attempts at meals. Very few successes. Well, in fact, let's be honest: NO successes. Social commentary and iconoclasm throughout. Think YOU can turn that into a movie? This movie is a little bit more dated-feeling in its references than The Phantom of Liberty, but the two really do share a close structural connection. Discreet Charm is slightly more "narrative" in the fact that the same characters keep returning, but otherwise the two movies might as well be edited together and flow into one. Apparently--and I haven't gotten around to watching it yet--Milky Way is the same. If that's the case, I'm on board.Seriously, Bunuel stands out in the world of cinema as a remarkable auteur, a serious artist with huge social engagement, and is quite admired, but there is nothing but good that can be learned from paying attention to how he uses his camera to direct your eye and how he blocks scenes. The guy has consummate control of space that usually only Hitchcock gets praise for. Few filmmakers really achieve this level of direct eye--Antonioni and Tarkovsky could be included in this list. Kim Ki Duk is aiming to get there. But in his 70s French cinema, Bunuel is the bullseye.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colourful satire about warped middle-class values and perspectives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily standing alongside other great films such as The Phantom of Liberty (1974) and The Obscure Object of Desire (1977), The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) is a film about the mirroring of fantasy and reality, realism and surrealism, masks and role playing; the façade we show to the world and the face we keep hidden to ourselves. As with most of the work of director Luis Bu?uel it is vicious satire, but dressed up as a comedy of errors; with the characters presented more as archetypes, best viewed as caricatures consistent with the characteristics that the director believes are synonymous with those of the bourgeoisie.Throughout the film we meet a number of characters designed to convey the spirit of conformity; the seemingly polite face of the comfortable - supposedly respected - modern society. So, we have the husband, the businessman, the politician, the housewife, the working girl, the new woman, the priest and the sergeant. The way in which Bu?uel goes on to subvert these - in his mind - highly trivial characters, is to continually play with their established sensibilities in order to tease them out of their safe and secure sense of reality; to tear away the façade and show the audience just how corrupt and underhanded these bourgeoisie abstractions really are, and just what lengths they are willing go to when stripped of their safe, luxurious lifestyle. Bu?uel also uses the film's intelligent and anarchic framing devise to further belittle his characters, by having the switches from day to dream - and all kinds of implied fantasies and desires - happen suddenly, and seemingly without warning. One minute we think we're viewing the film as it exists in reality, only to then find out that is some kind of drab, monstrous daydream of the terminally inane.Though perhaps a touch too dry for some sensibilities, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie has a number of amazing sequences of incredibly colourful satire and a continuing joke about narrative expectations. It is also incredibly well directed, mixing elements of high camp, soap opera melodrama and that typically European flair, all of which seem to further strengthen the director's bold, socio-political attack. For me, it's one of the great films by Bu?uel from the period in which he was creating his most interesting and accessible work.</fullReview>

However, considering every episode they encounter, they never finish one meal. This film utilizes common surrealist resources; absurdity, shock value, and repetition which Bunuel has mastered.

		<shortDescription>Not Bunuel's best, but possibly his most accessible surrealist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" is possibly the most popular surrealist film from Luis Bunuel and its pretty easy to see why. Its more consistently amusing and accessible than his other efforts. Still, I wouldn't call it his best by any means. The humor is a bit too slight and the satire doesn't cut as deep as it does in his other work. Plus, unlike "Belle de jour" (his masterpiece), there isn't a single interesting character here.Fortunately, despite the lack of emotional resonance, "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" is very entertaining and often quite funny. The humor is absurdest stuff and its pretty obvious that Monty Python are big fans of Bunuel. The humor is often subtle, resulting in surreal sequences that the viewer often wonders if they're being played for laughs or not. As usual with Bunuel, there are memorable dream sequences, and towards the end of the film it becomes impossible to see where these dreams begin and the characters' "reality" ends.The acting from the cast is generally good across the board. Fernando Rey (who'll probably be most recognizable by American audiences for his role in the classic "The French Connection") stands out as he typically does in Bunuel films, playing a sophisticated yet slimy member of the upper class. Also, the women here are quite beautiful in the classic European sense. Ultimately, this isn't Bunuel's best work, but its enjoyable and probably the best starting place for the man's bourgeoisie-baiting work. Just don't stop here. (8/10)</fullReview>

There is no sense as he directs characters in a fantasy. The most interesting thing about the film, and I understand this to be a Brunel trademark, is that people are always sitting down to eat, but the rarely do. Weird, huh?

One of the guests suggests going to eat at a local inn he knows. They arrive there to find the inn's owner has died, and his body is in a room. And so begins the constantly frustrating quest to eat, for this group of six bourgeois friends. They are distracted and prevented by the army, the police, poor restaurants, and surreal occurrences. Like one where a red curtain unveils an audience watching them eat on a stage. The most prominent character is Raphael, played superbly by Fernando Rey. He is the ambassador of the Republic of Miranda. He is also a drug smuggler, and is stalked by a terrorist woman. There is also a priest who enters the house of one of the group, and gets the job of being their gardener. He later visits an old dying gardener to give him absolution, and it transpires the dying man requests forgiveness for killing the priest's parents. The priest tells God to forgive him, then promptly shoots him with a shotgun. The ambassador Raphael continually has his country insulted. A soldier keeps insulting Miranda, so Raphael shoots him. Just when you think the group will never get to dine, they begin and are interrupted by a gun toting group of villains. There is then a memorable shot of Raphael cowering under the table finally eating a piece of meat. But is it all a dream? And is the end sequence (which is shown several times throughout the film) a dream? One will never know. A majestic and brilliantly acted masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising, rather cool surrealistic satire from Bunuel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel, and his occasional collaborator Jean-Claude Carriere, present us with six core characters in France, including Spaniard diplomat Don Raphael Acosta (Bunuel regular Fernando Rey, in a performance that can be certainly said fits perfectly with his character traits), the Thevenots (Paul Frankeur and Delphine Seyrig), the Senechals (Stephane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel), and Florence (Bulle Ogier), along with several supporting/side characters like a bishop who decides to be a gardener for the Senechals, a colonel, a cavalry lieutenant, a "bloody" sergeant, and a cute girl handing out mechanical dogs. The six core characters, we soon figure out, aren't going to give us any important information about their pasts (excepting minor notes of interest in brilliantly appropriate banal dialog), and beneath their elegance within their class of life are like us, sexual beings, hungry for food, and have the sort-of side jobs going that keep the money coming in (i.e. the cocaine). The main characters, if displayed in their daily routines for the course of the film, wouldn't hold the audience's attention long enough, and while Bunuel is famous for poking fun at the upper class, he knows even if he tried for a basic, true view of these people it would get boring, perhaps unbearable to the wrong viewer. However, he counter-acts this in the best he can, the way he knows how- he uses a technique in which the characters are often getting interrupted, in their meetings for dinner or other minor daily routines, by odd, obscure, mysterious, yet certainly human personalities that bring the viewer into the realm of intrigue and poetic artistry. Therefore, because Bunuel happens to have something of a fascinating with a Freudian approach to movie-making that can never pander to the audience (unless they're an overtly dense or stupid audience), after a while these characters walks of life become truly Bunuel-esque vignettes. Whether they're dream or reality becomes secondary, though not irrelevant, to the effect of our immersion is to the material, the images. Such images, like the ones in successful surrealist-student works like Eraserhead, Week-End, Natural Born Killers, and even Freddy Got Fingered, stay with us for days after the credits fade to black. The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is the second feature I have seen from the legendary surrealist writer, artist, sound man, and director Bunuel (the first was Un Chien Andalou, practically a pre-requisite in order to get into the catalog of his career), and I can tell right away that when I begin delving into his other works I'll have a lot to look for. Indeed, from my perspective, this is a hard act to follow, and it could be the quintessential Bunuel picture (in other words, a most recommended choice) unless I see something else of his that gives me greater respect. I'm sure in a couple of months or so I'll have my foot in my mouth over that sentence considering his works Belle De Jour and Nazarin are as equally acclaimed and revered. One thing I can't deny, this is an assured (European) masterpiece that will keep audience members either begging for more, or disgusted to the point of burning the video or DVD (even if they rented it from the store!)- and since that facet is one of the basic foundations of the surrealism movement, which many say never took off as it should have, this film is like a time capsule of the finest caliber of the remains of the movement. Let me put it this way: I believe this may get on my list of all-time favorites (1-50) soon enough. A++</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bourgeoisie - the class that, in contrast to the proletariat or wage-earning class, is primarily concerned with property values.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" is a satire of the aristocratic (or bourgeoisie) class told in a series of (occasionally) surreal vignettes. The main takeaway of this film is that, despite the luxurious surface and their obsession with the proper etiquette, the members of the bourgeoisie class are just as bad as the people they chastise.The characters in this film think of people in terms of rich and poor, and, in their eyes, the poor are thieves and the rich are noble. For instance in the introduction of the priest character, he comes to the characters mansion to apply for a gardening job, and he just goes right out to the gardening she'd and gets in gardening clothes, so when he comes back and they see him, they immediately kick him out because he seems like a poor man. But when he walks back in soon after wearing his priest robes, they start kissing his hands.The characters themselves in the film are drug dealers, yet when it is brought up that some of the soldiers smoke marijuana, they begin to talk about how much they hate drug addicts. One of the characters is the ambassador of Miranda and in one scene murders an army general for accusing Miranda of having many murders. Later he also sympathizes with a Nazi simply because he was from Miranda and the ambassador had met him. The film is filled with moments like these, for instance: A woman complains about a meal not being expensive enough; the priest goes against all his values of forgiveness and kills a man, practically for no reason considering he was dieing anyway; a man tries to have sex with a woman who tried to kill him, and then arranges her kidnapping because she doesn't, proving himself just as bad, if not worse, than her, etc...But perhaps the most genius example of this (and the most well known) is the moment where the group of rich characters finds themselves on a stale in front of an audience. There is a man feeding them lines. One character almost gets out one line, and then nervously walks backstage, and the rest of the characters follow. Well, all but one, who starts sweating and says "I forgot my lines...". Then he wakes up. This scene exposes them for what they are. The big house, the fancy furniture, and the etiquette are all just for show. They are just an act, a disguise, to hide the kind of people that they really are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One does not know to what extent is the French film 'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie' influenced by famous psychologist Sigmund Freud and his groundbreaking book "The Interpretation of Dreams". This film presents some absolutely weird dreams disguised as real events. They throw light on different protagonists and their miserable lives. It is due to this innovation that director Luis Bu?uel is able to create a very thin line between dreams and reality. Bourgeois hypocrisy in France is also depicted in order to reveal weaknesses which can be found in any country or any civilization. Some elements of this film would get repeated in later films directed by Bu?uel. One can cite the issue of terrorism as the best example which is shown in "Cet Obscur Objet Du Désir". From a screenwriter's perspective, 'The discreet charm of the bourgeoisie' is an easy work for creative people. They would just have to create some unlimited situations for limited characters. This would enable everybody to watch this film without any preconceived notions.</fullReview>

I enjoyed the thread on this website about the characters walking down the desolate road. It is a recurring scene, that unlike all the other scenes, is not really integrated into the story. The comments people made about this scene were very helpful. I need to see more of Bunuel's films now. What a fascinating director! Has anyone seen the films he made during his Mexico period? I'm particularly interested in Los Olvidados.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will six examples of wealth and manners ever be able to friggin' eat?! Off of this idea alone, Luis Bu?uel has a field day exposing and exploiting these characters in various ways while also having them awake from nightmarish situations which open them up like wounds. Such as how the three males of the group deal in drugs or how Don Rafael(Fernando Rey), the one character poked at the most, sleeps with his pal's wife, or how the "always-hosting" couple escape from their window while the others await them downstairs to have a tussle in the bushes.But, Bu?uel can not resist throwing the entire narrative off course by having certain people, out of left field, enter the film telling of dreams they had such as the soldier who interrupts the ladies at a restaurant with a tale about his ghostly mother commands in poisoning the man who claims to be his father but who actually is an impostor. Another even wilder scene consists of a soldier who is asked by his fellow officers to tell a dream to the six main characters(..whose meal is yet again interrupted by Military practicing maneuvers)about meeting certain dead people he knew from the past.But, my two favorite scenes poke fun at Rafael. His country is a violent, barbaric society yet it's representative, Rafael, is in this country living a life of prestige and privilege. When confronted by the Military head regarding how uncivilized his country is, Rafael pulls a gun and shoots him! Another scene has the six finally on their way to eating a cooked lamb only to being stopped by men who break in with machine guns. Rafael hides under the table, yet gets caught when he reaches up into his plate for the sliced lamb that was to be eaten! And, the "Bloody Sargeant" gag is a doozy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This playful and surrealist film from Luis Bunuel is a gem from 1970s foreign language cinema.A group of well-to-dos gather for a dinner that never quite seems to take place, since each time they sit down to dine, some sort of bizarre, dreamlike occurrence prevents them from doing so. The film is difficult to describe; it's like a fever dream visualized -- or like stepping into a Salvador Dali painting.The charms of the middle class depicted here are discreet indeed, nearly to the point of being nonexistent.

		<fullReview>La Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie is a celebrated film by a well-regarded surrealist auteur. Given that, and given my taste for such things, I went in with high hopes. But I rarely found it more than mildly amusing.It's undeniably clever. Bunuel's dry humor sparkles, and his gentle social critique hits its marks more often than not. The penultimate shot of Fernando Rey with a slice of ham stuffed in his mouth is one of the funniest and most memorable cinematic images I've encountered in quite a while. And Delphine Seyrig breezes through her scenes with hilariously blithe detachment. But the parts don't quite add up to a greater whole.The film reaches its peak about halfway through, once a pattern has been established (dinner parties will be attended, but dining will be teasingly withheld) and the central narrative has begun to digress and fragment. As the surreal intrudes upon the quotidian, a delicious sort of suspense sets in. Pity, then, that the last forty-five minutes squander this tension, retreating to tepid farce and a rather obvious critique of upper-crust social mores.Someone on the film's board once quoted the director as saying, "the bourgeois moral is the immoral thing for me, that which should be combated; the moral founded in our unjust social institutions as the religion, the homeland, the family, the culture, in short, the so-called pillars of the society." Thematically, the film consists of variations on this familiar counter-cultural conceit, and such thinking was certainly voguish in the late 60s and early 70s. It's an interesting and potentially valid argument, but I found the film's handling of the idea superficial, even clichéd.The same could be said, I suppose, of El Topo or Sweet Movie, but those films transcend glib adherence to fashionable ideologies and period style. I don't think La Charme Discret does that. Of course, it's more an urbane, low-key comedy of manners than a flaming art-bomb thrown through the window of middlebrow complacency, so perhaps the comparison is unfair. As a comedy, it is appealing, in a mild sort of way.Finally, I was disappointed by the film's look. I understand that the bland stage-set dining rooms are a device, and a successful one. But surreal detours aside, there isn't much to look at. The camera placements and movements are almost ploddingly ordinary, and while they capture the events adequately, they don't do anything interesting with them.I'm being unkind, of course, and terribly unfair. By stressing these complaints, I'm giving short shrift the wonderful performances and amusingly understated comic dialog. I'm overlooking the fabulously eerie dream sequences and Bunuel's masterful control of tone. I gave La Charme Discret a 7/10 because it IS charming, funny and somewhat intellectually intriguing. But I still came out of the experience feeling a bit let down...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am surprised that nobody recognized what the author wanted to say with this movie. The whole movie (except the last few minutes) is a dream of one ordinary man. He probably went to sleep without having dinner, and in his dream he pass through various situations where he and his friends intend to eat. But, they were interrupted every time, and he did not manage to have his meal at all. The reasons are every time stranger and stranger. Finally he woke up, goes to the kitchen and took from his refrigerator everything he find's. In one sentence, this movie is about our lust for eating. Simple, but extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, The (1972) *** (out of 4) Extremely surreal film from Luis Bunuel about six people who keep trying to have dinner together but dreams keep getting in their way. I'd say this is the most surreal film I've seen from Bunuel and it actually took away most of the film's charm for me. I found the story itself to be quite boring and not too interesting so all the dreams and more dreams just didn't do much for me. The director's touch is wonderful throughout and he manages to get some nice laughs. The performances are also grand and the real reason to check this one out. Of the various dreams scattered throughout the film, I'd say my favorite was the one from the first segment. A good film but not in my top five from the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plenty of (intended) non sequiturs and arrivals at nothing, with some good French sauce. Sure, it is surreal, but don't think clever-clever bakerlite phone with a lobster handset, more amusing sketches which taken singly are absorbing vignettes.There is plenty of cinema that is terrified of being understood too easily and resorts to weirdness as a proxy for intellectualising, but this does not do that. It leads you somewhere articulately and clearly, it's just that that place is in the middle of nowhere.If you want to claim it's a masterpiece or a comment on our time, do so if you must, but it's a fun watch without any of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bunuel plays on very real fears about which no one ever thinks, except, perhaps, in dreams. Who, in their waking hours would imagine sitting down to dinner and never being able to leave (Exterminating Angel) or who would think of sitting down to a meal only to have it continuously interrupted (Discreet Charm of the Bougeoisie)? The conceit in Exterminating Angel is arguably more frightening, but that of Discreet Charm is, I think, more brilliant. Yes, there's something frightening about not being able to leave a table but imagine the consequences of not being able to finish a meal. Discreet Charm is also an incredibly amusing film with razor sharp satire of the upper-classes (everyone's favorite punching bags, nowadays). It's use of surrealism and dream sequences is unparalleled, I think, and probably makes the best case for surrealism's place in the cinematic arts. Bunuel was a great director and this is his greatest work (at least his greatest work that I've seen). It's intelligent, funny, and biting. It also looks terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the risk of sounding anti-intellectual, I have to admit that I fail to see the greatness, as well as the point, of this movie. It's a mild piece of surrealism and an even milder, totally unshocking satire (wealthy, respected men can also be cocaine dealers....big deal). Bunuel's direction is clear but flat: there are no peaks and valleys in this movie, it moves at the exact same pace from beginning to end. There are some startling moments here and there, but quite frankly some of Bunuel's miscalculations (no we DON'T want to hear the story of your tragic childhood, mr. unknown soldier) make this an irritating film.

		<shortDescription>Until The Surreal Thing Comes Along</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally got around to this in time for its fortieth anniversary and my initial reaction is this charm is a tad subtle so much so that it tends to elude me. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, after all, Bulle Ogier, Fernando Rey, what's not to like. Perhaps it's the sloppiness in the writing that doesn't sit too well with me; whenever there's a situation in search of resolving we just Fade To Black then cut to one of the principals who's dreaming it. Not too much wrong with that - if you're an amateur and this is your first movie but not when you have a track record going back forty years and change. True, there are some nice digs at the Catholic church which I'll drink to any time but it takes more than a handful of harpoons no matter how unerring the aim to make a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Bunuel's most accessible movies, but a bit too slight for my taste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie' is one of Luis Bunuel's most popular and accessible movies. While I always enjoy watching it, I am also left with a slight feeling of disappointment afterwards. To me it doesn't have the powerful resonance of his best work like 'Belle De Jour'. It's clever and amusing to watch at the time, but nothing about it lingers with you afterwards. There is nothing disturbing or particularly thought provoking about it. More episodic than most of his previous movies, this film could even have cross-over appeal to Monty Python fans. It features a similar stream of consciousness and playful surrealism as the best episodes of that classic Brit comedy series. Of course Cleese, Palin, Gilliam and company were no doubt already Bunuel fans to a man, so the comparison is not much of a stretch. The movie features Bunuel's usual targets - religion, middle class hypocrisy, fetishes of various kinds - but the satire isn't all that particularly biting. Even so, the movie is entertaining enough for what it is, the cast are all terrific, especially the legendary Fernando Rey, who is always a joy to watch. A good place to start for Bunuel novices, but by no means his best work. While I have some reservations I still recommend 'The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie' for all fans of the weird and wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I chanced upon this film when I was reading about Dinner with Andre. Like most of my mistakes, I jumped into this one without doing a background check. A wet sock of a story gets flung around for an hour and a half, long after our brains have switched off. To be honest, this film does seem like a whale of an influence to future filmmakers. However, it is definitely not something regular film-goers can enjoy. I will say that critics, film students, and completionists will enjoy this.Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is an absurdist, surrealist film, which is almost a film school experiment. It is a series of events that befalls a group of families as they try to have dinner together. I am not kidding - they sit to have dinner and something unexpected interrupts them. There are some really bizarre incidents that happen throughout, which will leave you confounded till you realize that none of them are meant to be taken seriously. Some of the mini-stories will make a wry smile cross your face, and frankly, some of the movie is actually enjoyable. It's only that such tricks have almost no repeat value. Fool me once shame on me, fool me seven times and you are really pushing your luck, buddy! The surrealist elements of the film don't crop up till quite some time. It is not immediately apparent that many of the situations are stand-ins, either satires or surrealist fantasies. The film begins as a weak attempt at mocking the shallow lives of socialites. Their posturing, assumed statures, and adherence to arbitrary customs are easy targets that the film tries to satire. Somewhere down the line it takes a turn into the bizarre with meandering story lines, inconsequential characters, and unexpected U-turns. Some of it did bowl me over as I really didn't expect anything like it. But after a time when no pattern or method was discernible, I could do no better than appreciate the creators for their ideas without enjoying any of it.Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a highly experimental film that needs to be applauded for its audacity, especially considering the time when it was made. I am sure it has had massive impact on a lot of filmmakers. Influences for the pointless conversations of Pulp Fiction and the red herrings of David Lynch films can be clearly seen here. However, that doesn't make the 100 minutes of the movie sitting any less excruciating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The proletariat, ironically, don't watch this kind of pap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When even pompous and pretentious movie critics such as the food-lover Roger Ebert says that this movie isn't about anything, then we REALLY know it's about nothing. (As if we need the likes of him telling us that, of course.) Naturally, that didn't prevent him from liking it (or at least he claims he does), because, after all, the GREAT WIZARD OF European CINEMA Bunuel HIMSELF made this glorious masterpiece. How can it not be terrific??? Or is that "a master piece of crap"?...TDCOTB is a self-indulgent collection of scenes, which bored me to the most part. Bunuel's left-wing anti-Americanism/anti-Capitalism was pathetic, as was the very bland and ugly look of the movie. (No doubt some pro-Bunuelists would say now that this was done on purpose because the main characters are so bland and ugly as well, or some such unconvincing malarkey?) Bunuel hates Nazis, but adores mass-killers like Mao. He portrays terrorists as young, good-looking idealists, and not the psychopathic degenerates that they really are.Bunuel's contempt for the "Bourgeoisie" i.e. his tender love and caring for the "proletariat" is truly touching, I had so many handkerchiefs ready so as not to drown in my own pool of tears. The greatest irony, of course, is that this "proletariat" COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT HIS MOVIES. They are not the ones who watch his movies, but UPPER AND MIDDLE-CLASS ART STUDENTS. Isn't that a wonderful irony, almost like poetic justice, so fitting for this senile old hypocrite.Anyone who condones large-scale Marxist violence i.e. mass-murder in gulags, while passionately advocating revolution against fascist regimes (or what he considers to be such) lacks any kind of moral foundation to preach to ANYONE ? let alone me.But let's forget the blatant and embarrassingly na?ve left-wing politics that lurk in every other scene of this mediocre non-feast. The movie is mostly dull. The soldier's dream, for example: what was the point of that? If I ever had such a dull dream I wouldn't even tell it to my most bored friends ? let alone put it in a movie for millions to watch! Or how about that lieutenant's story? Why did he approach the three women? Just to tell them about how he poisoned his step-father? That sequence doesn't fit into the movie at all; Bunuel seems to have literally SHOVED IT into the plot, by sheer force. "Let's see, I have this nice little pointless childhood revenge-poison story that I wrote in 3 minutes? Where shall I put it? Oh well, nevermind, I can put it anywhere. After all, the film will have no flow, so who cares where I stick it?" The endless series of "it-was-just-a-dream" twists get rather tiresome after a while ? not to mention predictable. The movie is repetitious. What about that supposedly very clever "they-never-get-to-eat" theme/running-gag? I would laugh at it if only I didn't know beforehand what real humour was. If I want to watch absurdist humour on a high level I'll put in a Monty Python disk. Bunuel's movies aren't funny. And often they aren't even clever.The only scene that was both original and interesting was when the 6 characters find themselves eating on a stage. (Or TRYING TO EAT ? ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. So so very funny, them not getting to eat because they keep getting interrupted? Hilarious? Oh, I nearly wet myself?) No wonder this movie won the Best Foreign Picture Oscar!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I am attracted to intelligent films, especially films about the nature of reality and representation as convention. In particular, I am partial to narrative folding as in `Sarragosa.' Moreover, I am one or the rare enthusiasts of Jarry, a Frenchman who noodled with surrealism in theater, a trickier notion than in easel painting. So on encountering this film, I had high expectations that have been thoroughly dashed -- dashed and trampled.It comes down to film as art, and what one thinks art is. I'm not particular about this -- art has to either move me in some way (including intellectually), or it can be a `statement' that I find intriguing or clever or even profound. This film comes close to neither. No more explanation needed there, though I suppose some would argue that true surrealism is supposed to be so intellectually anarchistic the point is the lack of point.But that's not what this filmmaker tries. There's real satire attempted here. There's an attempt at folding, and some of the mirroring of images one finds elsewhere. There's some self-reference. There's some `explanation.' There're the `The Tempest' references. But none of this is fresh or clever or edgy or even impressively relaxed. None of it is even new. All of it smacks of nonchalant dilettantism.My friends tell me that this is not the place to start with Bunuel, that I need to work my way up from his early films which were original and sadistically anarchistic. They say that his art must be seen a whole. But then we are into a life as art, and unless the person is truly interesting, why bother?Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>
