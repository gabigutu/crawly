		<shortDescription>Not a classic, but I've been repeating its lines for 25 years . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics slammed this movie when it came out, as I recall. Exceedingly lofty expectations for Jack the director or something, I don't know. I just know that 25 years has made this movie better. I liked it from the start, and it seems that the rest of the world is coming around.There are slow sections of this film, to be sure. But the great lines! "I wouldn't take you to a dog fight if you was the defendin' champion!" "We were just sayin' how much we needed a figurine." "Good mornin', ladies! I SHORE ENJOYED them CANNED APRICOTS LAST NIGHT!!!"It bears up well to repeated watchings. What higher rating can a movie have?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you realize that a movie critique represents an INDIVIDUAL'S opinion which may be very different from your own, you probably also don't take these comments too seriously. But - for what it's worth - here's mine re: Goin' South: I found it very entertaining (and I'm probably fussier than most when it comes to movies). That's what I value most in a film: entertainment. Any negative comments about this flick come from the more erudite crowd which knows or looks deeper for such things. I was even able to get past Nicholson's character's need for a good nose-blowin', which usually really bothers me, but, in this case, I found it utterly hilarious. We're gonna leave out recapping the plot - THAT'S pretty well taken care of not too far from here. But I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to write something good about this picture because I think that it richly deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserved more praise than it got.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it when it first came out in the 1970's and thought it deserved more praise than it got. It is mostly an entertainment comedy with such lines as "You weren't that hard to find. You were standing in the middle of town with a rope around your neck." I read someplace where Mary Steenburgen had been working as a waitress in an Arizona dinner and Nicholson stopped in and thought she would be perfect for the part. I think there is some very touching scenes between Nicholson and Steenburgen that are well written and acted. Except for Christopher Lloyd the rest of the cast is wasted. I think the only reason John Belushi is in the movie is because Nicholson wanted to meet him. At that time Saturday Night Live was considered radical chic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the fascination with the city of Motherly Love?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My late father and I always referred to this as the movie we "accidentally" watched on HBO late one night. We were hooked when the posse rode right across the Rio Grande into Mexico and "Ol' Speed" fainted! For the rest of his life he always greeted me in the morning with "Good mornin' Spot!" In much the same vein as another of his favorites (Evil Roy Slade), it is difficult to find two lines together from this movie that can be taken seriously ("Please wipe your feet." . . "I always do!")("I'll be outside running a reference test." . . "Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?"). I have watched my home-recorded VHS upwards of 25-30 times and now that the DVD has been released, I look forward to adding it to my collection once again because . . . . "I can do this all day long! I'm talking about . . All Day Long!" Give it a spin and give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly mediocre comedy western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going' South is probably most famous as being a film directed by Jack Nicholson. It's a western about an outlaw called Henry Moon who is saved from execution by a sexually repressed woman who owns a gold mine. To his chagrin she immediately sets him to work there, needless to say they don't get along at first but then they do later on.This is essentially an odd couple film. It plays things consistently for laughs but like the majority of comedy westerns it really isn't too funny. Nicholson may be a great actor but he isn't a very good director. The pacing lags badly in the second half but the story isn't terribly engaging overall. It also stars a host of actors who would go on to become stars in the 80's such as Danny Devito, John Belushi and Christopher Lloyd. But despite the potential that this cast suggests, most have very under-developed roles and it feels suspiciously like Nicholson invited them along just so that he could have a laugh on set. The western itself was in decline by the late 70's in any case and Going' South didn't bring anything new to the table to help change that. It's a film that seems to have a minor cult reputation but I didn't think it was too good and it's certainly one of Nicholson's lesser film outings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Western comedy about an outlaw gunslinger saved from the gallows by a spinster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Moon (Jack Nicholson) is captured for a capital offense by a posse when his horse quits while trying to escape to Mexico . Henry saving himself from lynching by marrying a spinster (Mary Steenburgen , though Meryl Streep and Jessica Lange considered the role) . Moon/Nicholson saved from the hangman , for a fate worse than death . There , then appears his refreshingly offbeat Old Gang (Veronica Cartwright , Tracey Walter , Jeff Morris and Danny DeVito)This Western comedy contains laughters , action , shootouts , brawls and amusement . Lots of attempts at comedy but it falls flat . Entertaining and funny Western , not for all tastes , with touches of humor here and there . Overacting by Jack Nicholson at an outlandish character attempting to like , including jokes and silly laughs , but only a few work . Feature film debut for Mary Steenburgen , whose role Jane Fonda and Anne Bancroft turned down ; furthermore , a small role for John Belushi as a gunfighter Deputy . Very good support cast such as Christopher Lloyd as Deputy Towfield , Veronica Cartwright as Hermine , Richard Bradford as Sheriff Andrew , Jeff Morris as Abe, Moon's Old Gang , Danny DeVito as Hog , Ed Begley Jr as Haber , Anne Ramsey as Spinster , Tracey Walter as Coogan and Luana Anders as Lorette Anderson. Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by the great Spanish cameraman Nestor Almendros . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Jack Nicholson , though the studio originally intended for Elliott Gould and Candice Bergen to star in the film, with Mike Nichols directing . However , Nicholson didn't want to star in the film , he insisted the movie was logistically too ambitious for him to divide his attention between acting and directing . Nicholson had previously directed his first film in 1971 titled ¨Drive he said¨ played by his friends Bruce Dern and Karen Black ; he subsequently co-produced and semi-directed with Monte Hellman two strange Westerns titled ¨The shooting ¨and ¨Ride in the whirlwind¨ ; after that , he played ¨Missouri¨ another Western directed by Arthur Penn with Marlon Brando . Nicholson's final filmmaking was ¨The two Jakes¨ .¨Goin' South" rating : Mediocre but entertaining . The picture will appeal to Jack Nicholson hardcore fans .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre film, amazing Nicholson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Goin' South" is a watchable comedy directed by and starring Jack Nicholson. Filmed cheaply with a local crew down in Mexico, the film wasn't received well upon release. "Star Wars" had rendered westerns obsolete and screwball comedies were long out of date.Still, "Goin' South" holds up pretty well. Nichsolson's performance is amazing and cinematographer Néstor Almendros equals his work on Terrence Malick's "Days of Heaven".The film works more as a bizarre insight into Jack Nicholson, than a comedy. He turns what should be light slapstick, into a pretty nasty and mean spirited R rated comedy-drama. Watching his filmography from end to end, I'm surprised how consistently wicked and misogynistic his characters are. Here he players an outlaw who's hired by a sexually repressed woman to work in her gold mines. After tying her to a bed and giving her the hump of her life, she renounces her repressed ways and gradually begins to appreciate his animalistic masculinity.The Jack Nicholson persona seems to constantly be seeking to dominate women. If he can't have his way, he breaks down. "Goin South" is like a happy version of his "Carnal Knowledge", only here he finally gets a girl who submits to his primal charm.In terms of comedy, the film is similar in tone to the Coen Brothers' "O Brother Where Art Thou?" It's not as visually stylish, but the emphasis on wacky accents is the same. The cast includes Danny Devito, John Belushi and Christopher Lloyd, and many other comic faces pop up.But it's Jack Nicholson's face that keeps us watching. He's manic, cartoonish, sadistic and riveting. Take a look at the IMDb photo of this film (the DVD cover). The guy looks like a bearded Saddam Hussein, laughing at his hang man's noose like a psychopath. Nicholson's face is a work of art. His eyebrows are constantly twitching, his eyes constantly mischievous, his teeth lighting up his face. Whether you enjoy the film will depend on whether you love his scenery chewing. He puts so much energy and skill into his performance here that he transcends everything else about this film.6/10- Worth one viewing. I recommend fast forwarding all the exposition and simply watching Jack act. The guy's a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare Movie That Deserves Seeing Again and Again !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely see the same movie more than once. Although I love movies, repeated viewings tend to be tedious and boring. Not so this wonderful picture which was Jack Nicholson's directing debut. I watch Going' South over and over and find something new each time. I believe that is one mark of a well-made and well-written movie.From the opening scenes with Moon's horse keeling over as he dances celebrating his "get away" to the tender moments between Moon and Julia after they divide up the gold, I find this movie gives and keeps on giving.Henry Moon's lines are hilarious and delivered only as Jack can do. Mary Steenburgen delivers a performance as good as any first time to the screen and the other characters are played wonderfully by current and soon-to-be stars of TV and cinema.I love turning people on to this movie. I never get tired of watching it-I bet you won't either!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Treasure Chest Of Movie Quotes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies nobody has seen. I am constantly astounded when I talk to movie lovers, and even Nicholson fans and they've never heard of this movie. Two of the funniest scenes I've ever seen are both in this movie. The first in the opening scene while Moon is celebrating his escape into "Me-Hee-Ko" The second is his impending doom at the gallows, salvation, then return to doom. Also, some of the most outrageous, hilarious quotes you'd ever want to hear make this film worth watching over and over. And the supporting cast is unbelievable. John Belushi, Mary Steenburgen, Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Ed Begley Jr. My favorite movie line of all time comes from Moon. When Big Abe, Hermine, and Hog show up uninvited at Moon's new home, Big Abe says "I'm so hungry I could eat a froze dog." Abe's face falls when Moon says "Well, I'll go out to the kitchen and see if we got one already froze." I would recommend this movie to anyone. You don't have to be a Nicholson fan, a Western fan, or a comedy fan. I've never met anyone, few though they may be, who watched this film and didn't love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nicholson Ego-Trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many folks think Nicholson can do no wrong. But in my book, this mess has to be the nadir of his often outstanding career. When he's got a strong guiding hand, as in 5 Easy Pieces (1970) or Chinatown (1974), he can deliver aces. Here, however, he's directing himself, and the result is a leering, eye-rolling, slice of buffoonery, perhaps an ego-trip of some misguided sort. The movie itself collapses into near incoherence, lacking both narrative sense and timing. Events follow in no particular order, while scenes too often appear to indulge the actor instead of playing to others or advancing the story. Actually, the movie reminds me perversely of a kids Saturday matinée, where the baddie schemes to grab the good girl's land and Gabby Hayes or Smiley Burnette supplies comic relief. Except here, there's only the buffoon, the land- grabber, and the good girl. I do, however, feel sorry for Mary Steenburgen whose affecting performance gets lost amid the eye-rolling antics. Now, I don't know if Nicholson went on a coke binge while shooting in Mexico, as did his buddy Dennis Hopper when he made the disastrous The Last Movie (1971) in Peru. But it would explain a lot. Anyway, the 100+ minutes remains an obscure mess, even 40-years later, and is not so much rollicking as just plain idiotic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from the power it should have had</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some very good ideas in this western. Some extremely good situations. Some good suspended situations too. And yet we regret Nicholson is directing himself. He can't see himself when he is acting and that shows tremendously in the film. It explains some slow and long sequences that should have been packed in the acting itself. That explains why the actor Jack Nicholson is too often using some faces and attitudes and gestures that we have already seen in The Shining, in The Witches of Eastwood, or in many other films. He cannot see himself and thus he cannot direct himself properly. And there were and are some extremely potential situations. There could have been, and there should have been.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. A cocaine-fueled disaster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can't help but notice how Nicholson eventually gave up on concealing his hilariously obvious coke nose (to the untrained ear it just sounds like "allergies"- this is the usual excuse given, of course....). Over the counter allergy medicine can help with allergy symptoms. Nothing helps cocaine-blasted sinuses. Not even Scorsese could direct while coked up. Nicholson's attempt is considerably more disastrous. Take a second look at the cast (see Belushi) and it isn't hard to deduce what happened to this movie.Note that it gets steadily worse as the film progresses.I wasn't expecting a "great" movie being that this was Nicholson's only directing effort. I was just curious. I didn't expect something this bad. Yikes.</fullReview>

He plays a wonderful,funny part in this movie as an outlaw that is saved from the gallows from a very pretty woman named Julia, she and him don't get along at first, they have nothing in common then they learn how to get along by a strange coincidence.

		<fullReview>Until I saw "Goin' South' the other night, I didn't think Jack Nicholson ever acted any crazier than he did in "The Shining". But he's got that performance topped here as the career outlaw turned anxious husband Henry Lloyd Moon. And if you didn't know any better you might even consider this picture a comedy, some of the dialog and situations are outrageously funny. I had to wonder whether Mel Brooks might have gotten the idea for the hanging horse in "Blazing Saddles" from an opening scene; after that it's just one crazed situation after another. With fellow cast members from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" like Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito, the Western town of Longhorn is set on it's ear when Miss Julia Tate (Mary Steenburgen) saves Moon from a severe case of rope burn and attempts to tame her new husband into some semblance of humanity. It just ain't gonna work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interrupted Flight To Mexico</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about Going' South is the fact that Jack Nicholson gives us the force of his full blown personality in the lead role. And it's completely in character with the role he's enacting. Which is natural enough since the project was created for Jack Nicholson and directed by Jack Nicholson.He's a rogue of an outlaw and sad to say that he gets caught when he least expects by a posse in hot pursuit to Mexico. They've got Jack for horse stealing and back in those days that was a capital crime in the old west. Sheriff Richard Bradford and Deputy Christopher Lloyd, the latter who has a special grudge against Jack are ready to hang him legal and proper when a special law is invoked. It seems as though the aftermath of the Civil War left a shortage of men. So unless you've committed murder, if any widow wants to claim you for whatever reason, you can be married.He's in luck when young Mary Steenburgen claims him, but she's far more interested in getting him to work a gold mine on her property. But she's a widow with other needs and even Jack the rogue has a charming way about him, if a direct one at times.Going' South was Mary Steenburgen's first feature film and she matches Nicholson in her own way guile for guile. The Civil War left her a bride nearly intact shall we say, but she does accomplish her objectives with Jack.Two really great gags that I liked was the posse's flagrant disregard for international law to bring Jack in. Second was an unfortunate encounter Christopher Lloyd had at an outhouse with some equine waste product, courtesy of Nicholson.Going' South is a nice rollicking comedy where Jack Nicholson goes full blast with his quirky personality. For some reason it didn't catch on, but I think Nicholson fans and others will really like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Western Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First half of the movie was really funny, enjoyable and fast but only negative thing about the movie is second half was some slow. It is easy to predict the end of the movie maybe this one also makes you get bored before the movie's end is coming.Most of the movie watchers accept that Jack Nickholson's acting is great but especially I surprised in this movie that he is also very good at comedy acting. He acted in some dark and not funny characters at the past but he could choose comedy acting more. Other actors were also very good in the movie.Finally this movie is worth watching, enjoyable but also predictable. This is a western comedy but it includes also lots of romance. If you like to watch romantic-comedies, give this movie a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marriage not made in heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Moon is yanked back from Mexico after crossing the Rio Grande to hang for stealing horses. With the hangman's noose around his neck he learns that if there is a woman willing to marry him, he will be saved from certain death. An old widow decides to claim him. "Let me see my BRIDE!" he exclaims and as he hugs his soon to be bride, she dies in his arms from all of the excitement. Back to the gallows he goes again. Julia Tate saves him, not for love but to put him to work in a gold mine. There are some hilarious scenes in this movie; "canning apricots", having a snort of whiskey with the deputy...and his horse, philosophizing with his fellow outlaws, suffering the attentions of the peeping tom, the farmers disgusted with the land because there's too much bubbling crude. The distrust between Julia and Henry remain throughout the movie but Henry finds his wife the woman he always needed to cool his outlaw ways. The humor is similar to that found in the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou. I've enjoyed watching this movie over the years. You can easily watch it more than one time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy and slapstick style western. Yet a watch for any fan of the man and that's legendary Jack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that going in and watching "Goin' South" that it wouldn't be anything great or special and it certainly is not one of Nicholson's better works even though he directed. Clearly the western genre is not Jack's trademark type of film and his character is out of place at least appearance wise. It just looked so uncommon seeing Nicholson looking rugged with a hairy beard and listening to him talk in a slang country western drawl sounded so out of place. Anyway this little western try which was directed by Nicholson himself has himself as outlaw Henry Moon set in the 1860's. Moon is about to be hanged only to be saved by a lovely young gal who promises to marry him and take charge. Her name is Julia Tate(Mary Steenburgen)who's headstrong and smart yet her character is very sheltered and plain as a Southern virgin. Yet Julia's smart plan is to make Moon work the apparent gold mine that supposedly exist on her property. Really this film is nothing great, it's just so out of place for a genre of Jack's and the film is paced as a slapstick style comedy making it a very amusing western with no drama found that's so common in western films. Still it has it's good points to watch mainly the growing and transformation of the Steenburgen character into a molding lady of experience and her screen chemistry with Jack was good. Also appearances from John Belushi, Ed Begley Jr., and Christopher Lyold are worth mention, and any film with Jack in it especially if your a fan is worth a watch at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going' South is directed by Jack Nicholson who also stars. It's co-written by John Herman Schneider, Al Ramrus, Charles Shyer and Alan Mandel. Co-starring with Nicholson is Mary Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd. Music is by Perry Botkin Junior and cinematography by Nestor Almendros. 1866, Longhorn, Texas and plot finds Nicholson as Henry Lloyd Moon, a small time outlaw who is captured and sentenced to hang. But a strange ordinance from Civil War days allows a condemned man to escape the gallows if an unmarried lady of the town is prepared to take him as a husband. Enter Julie Tate (Steenburgen), a virginal lady who is poles apart from the crude and scruffy Moon, who takes him in purely to help her work in the mine on her land that she insists contains gold. Could these two opposites actually develop a relationship? Can there be trust there? Will Moon survive the wrath of vengeful deputy Towfield (Lloyd) who believes Moon stole his gal?Barely noticed upon release, where few critics of the day were prepared to give it some credit, Jack Nicholson's second film as a director found a firm fan base down in the cult basement. The advent of DVD has seen it get more exposure to film fans and critics and its stock has risen. Yes! It's still a bit too off-beat for some, the quirky comedy Western has always struggled to get mainstream praise anyway, but viewing these days it plays out as enjoyable fare whilst simultaneously giving us early glimpses of future stars of film. In truth the film's comedic high points come in the first quarter and Nicholson strains to reach those heights again. Once the odd couple retreat to the genteel out of the way matrimonial home, the simple premise takes over and the couple engage in a battle of wills between horny beast and angelic being. On the edges of the frame popping in to view from time to time are hostile railroad officials putting the squeeze on Julia as they want her land, deputy Towfield and his cronies and Moon's old gang, the latter of which provides the catalyst for chaos. Sometimes crude, sometimes silly, the film does retain amusing worth throughout, with some zippy lines that remain quotable. Nicholson and Steenburgen are perfect foil for each other, so it's well performed and it also looks nice thanks to Almendros' photography.The likes of John Belushi, Danny DeVito, Veronica Cartwright and Tracey Walter are in the support slots, none of whom get time enough to really impact upon the proceedings as their fans would like. It's interesting to see Lloyd and Steenburgen working together in the genre this early, because they would reteam in the Western themed third part of the Back to the Future trilogy 12 years later. While further continuation novelty sees Lloyd, DeVito and Nicholson back together after working on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 75. DeVito would swap chairs with Nicholson and direct the star in Hoffa in 1992.More a amiable smile inducer than a side splitter, Going' South is worth seeking out if you have a kink for off-beat Oaters. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson's most purely comedic role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Going South is funny. And it is entertaining. So just enjoy the movie and stop analyzing it.This is a bit surprising, given Jack Nicholson's corpus. Look at the list of movies he made, and you will see this is his first comedy; not until Witches of Eastwich, 9 years later, do we see him starring in another comedy. There are comic elements in other movies of his, of course, such as the earlier One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and the bizarre Mars Attacks! But in no other movie does Nicholson play such a purely comedic role, where the movie is dependent on his comedic acting. If you look at his first 10 years of starring roles, from 1969 to 1978, you see an actor demonstrating the ability to handle a wide range of serious roles, who wants to avoid being typecast. Yet he is in some slight danger of typecasting, of playing post-60s hipsters and rather serious characters. Going South broadened his acting palette, and while he did not do much more straight comedy, he employed comic twists to lighten many of his roles, especially in "As Good As It Gets."One of the keys to good comedy that stands the test of time is not going overboard. Nicholson pushes his character to extremes, but avoids crossing the line into shallowness, in part because he gives his character such depth through his fine acting. There is a lot of shallow contemporary comedy out there now, and current actors and directors could learn a lot from watching this movie. Nicholson immersed himself so fully in this role that some viewers seem to assume naively that Nicholson was really like Henry Lloyd Moon, at least at the time. He's an actor! (See The Passenger - 1975.)I'm a bit puzzled by some of the off the mark reviews, which seem to be due in part to judging the 1978 Nicholson by 2008 Nicholson. One "Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine," quite bizarrely complained that in Going South, Nicholson was reusing "faces and attitudes and gestures that we have already seen" ... in later films!Speaking of time travel, Going South is almost a prequel to Back to the Future, Part III, which starred the loony Christopher Lloyd and the lovely Mary Steenburgen in the wild West. Yet Going South was Steenburgen's first movie! Steenburgen delivered her role to perfection. This is interesting given her serious expression opposite Nicholson's antics. I wonder if she had a hard time keeping a straight face? But one of the things that makes this movie work is seeing Nicholson draw Steenburgen in his direction, including sexually and even to taking a drink, and Steenburgen drawing Nicholson toward taking life more seriously. You know this is coming, and in the beginning of the movie you are skeptical, and yet it is done credibly, and with a romantic touch.The scene with the brass bed is one of the most memorable of the movie. Sorry if it offended some women, but there's a lot of truth to that scene, and humor. There's no indication it was done with in a mean spirit or cruelty, which is never appropriate in romance, in or out of marriage. Thankfully, the rest of the scene is all left to the imagination, unlike some of the gratuitous, garbage sex scenes in more recent movies, like Titanic and Cold Mountain. When I watched Rooster Cogburn, I wished John Wayne had tied the eternally chattering Katherine Hepburn to a brass bed, or at least gagged her! Nicholson did a fantastic job of selecting his cast. There are several actors who are still early in their careers, including John Belushi, Danny DeVito, Veronica Cartwright (not so early, given her experience as a child actress) and Ed Begley Jr. The weakness of Going South is that it did not given more of an opportunity for Belushi and DeVito to show their stuff, but this is easily said in hindsight. Lloyd's is the only other major comic role as Nicholson's nemesis. Some rare comedies work every time you see them, and some only work once. Going South is somewhere in between; it works if you watch it every few years, but it is best the first time. It works because of the comedic tension between the key characters, because it doesn't push the comedy too far, and because there is enough serious dramatic acting underlying the performances by Nicholson and Steenburgen. Another reason it works is that not everyone in the movie is a Lloyd or Belushi; there are some normal people, like the sheriff. When everyone in a comedy is a goofball, you've got a problem. I think you need some normal people as a reference point, even in screwball comedies.Going South might have been a little better had there been more amusing lines for some of the secondary characters like DeVito and Belushi. But it is a fun movie to watch, and you get the feeling that Nicholson, Steenburgen and cast had a lot of fun making it. You might want to watch some of the other movies Nicholson made in this 10 year period before seeing Going South to get a perspective on his early work. What you will see is a great actor who has demonstrated versatility throughout his career. Perhaps the one element these performances have in common is the ability of Nicholson to project intense personal energy through the character onto the screen. We see this certainly in later films, but there are few roles where Nicholson invests more energy into his character than in Going South.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better with Tequila</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I stumbled on to this movie while we were dating - after a few strong margaritas. It was the funniest movie we had ever seen (dating about 4 months at this point) however we viewed it later sober and it's just not quite the same. So now it's a tradition = tequila + GS. Give it a try! You will love it. And you will find yourself speaking in GS lingo before too long. My favorite line is when Abe (Henry's aged gang member friend) loses his tooth in Henry's home during a big party - he stumbles around shouting, "Anybody seen my god-damn molar?" The other favorite line from that same party was spoken by Moon to Julia - "C'mon Honey! Act foolish!" - while kicking up his heels in a unique Henry Moon Dance. My wife loves the line Moon speaks at his hanging (while still hooded) when an older woman first first chooses him as her husband - "Mrs Henry Moon! Let me look at you!" She then collapses and dies from the excitement. I think this film set the mood for JN's later works and is worth the time. I am still looking for the DVD - have nearly worn out the VHS tape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goofy Rip-Roaring Western With Mad Jack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Moon, a horse-thief in the old west, is saved from the gallows by a spinster who uses a local ordinance law to claim him as her husband. Moon is overjoyed at this turn in his fortunes until his bride sets him to hard labour in her abandoned gold mine ...This is a lovable, bumbling, aw-shucks romantic comedy western with a gallery of great actor buddies of Nicholson's chewing the scenery. Particularly fine are Lloyd as the glaring, set-jawed deputy, Cartwright as the delicious, naughty cowgirl, Belushi as a cod-Mexican hombre and Walter as his usual quiet, impenetrable stranger. But of course this is wacky Jack's movie all the way and he revs it up to an irresistible level with his good-natured face-pulling, lopsided grinning and hoofing. He also does a damn fine job as a director, timing the gags beautifully and using the gorgeous sagebrush Durango State locations in Mexico to tremendous effect. Nestor Almendros' photography is wonderfully polarised - the exteriors are ridiculously bright and the interiors are ludicrously dark - and there is a great country music score by Van Dyke Parks, Perry Botkin and Ry Cooder. Whilst there may be other westerns with more substance than this, there are few that are as enjoyable and feature such a lovable bunch of outlaws. Yeehaw !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never seen this classic (or haven't seen it in a long time), not only will you laugh- you'll be surprised at all the familiar faces and how many of them have come to be matched in other movies through the years. Nicholson directs himself in this western comedy. He is the perfect dolt, saved from the gallows by a squeak. His future "wife" (Mary Steenburgen) is the "straight-man" amid a host of wonderfully comic actors. It's a hilarious formula that works!The connections are: Nicholson, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd were all in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". DeVito directed Nicholson in "Hoffa". Tracy Walter was Bob, one of Nicholson's henchmen in "Batman", was Tyrone Otley with Nicholson in "The Two Jakes", and was Ezra with Lucy Lee Flippen (Diane Haber in "Goin' South") in the Amazing Stories episode "Mummy Daddy". Jeff Morris was the owner of "Bob's Country Bunker", where the Blues Brothers (hence, John Belushi) performed behind chicken wire for a bar full of rowdy rednecks. Christopher Lloyd was with Mary Steenburgen in Back to the Future III. Veronica Cartwright was Felicia Alden in "The Witches of Eastwick" with Nicholson.I'm sure I missed some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When people ask me what is my favorite movie of all time....there are several answers. One that was a box office hit? Or, my favorite movie no one has ever heard about? This is my favorite film no one knows about. Why, well Jack Nicolson is worth the price of the rental to begin with. His humorous scowl and raise eyebrows which are the trademarks for impressionists one might believe came from this film. Second, the supporting cast is not without merit: Mary Steenburgen, John Belushi, Danny Devito, Christopher Lloyd, Veronica Cartwright, Ed Begley Jr. with the added adventure of the film being Directed by none other than Jack himself. There are several memorable scenes. One:being the opening where Jack, we discover, is being chased on horseback-great camera work here. Jack in the mines chanting he could do this "all night long" as a double entrende. His interaction with Mary who is the uptight spinster. I love it!!! Worth being a Nicolsonite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From back when spousal rape wasn't a crime...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie basically uses spousal rape as one of its main comedic devices. Now I turned it off at the point when he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her, but I cannot really imagine how that was eventually turned around into something endearing and funny. This movie not only squandered a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny, it actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic. How so many people seem to find it a sweet family flick is beyond me. "I sure enjoyed canning those apricots last night" is not a funny joke when you know it refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hopes she will eventually learn to like it. Watching a peeping tom jerk off is not family fun. I honestly feel worse off for having watched half of this creepy "comedy" and am totally baffled by these positive reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a scruffy Jack Nicholson looking completely mad on the poster, this movie offers to few laughs to be considered to be a good comedy western. But in the other hand I'm not sure what to think of it, or how to label it. It got kind of a subtle and odd humor, very low key and not producing too many laughs but enough to keep interest.Nicholson plays Henry Moon. A criminal convicted to hang, but at the last moment he is saved by a young woman, Julia, due to a local ordnance that any land owning woman can claim the criminal as a husband (since the town lost too many men in the war). Moon of course accepts, but might have reconsidered after he met Julia. She on the other hand just wants him to dig for gold on her farm. In Texas. And not making things easier is Moon's old gang that hangs about? It is rather slow, but some gems show up. Just the cast is one of them. Besides Nicholson you can see Mary Steenburgen in her first role, Christopher Lloyd, John Belushi, Jeff Morris, Ed Begley Jr and Danny DeVito. Just to see DeVito in a gunfight, jumping to fire over a shed is worth to watch the entire movie.So while I didn't think too much of it, it was entertaining enough not to be a waste of time.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Jack Worry?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see it in his eyes. When Jack Nicholson signed up to direct this movie, you can tell that he had his ideas set on who he wanted where, in casting and in the film. The movie's setting is a man who's captured for a capital offence, and just before being hanged, a woman offers her hand in marriage to save him from death. This is the story of the two of them, striking gold, and relationships. And though it seemed very long in some parts (especially the scenes with Nicholson/Steenburgen), the basis of the story and how it worked was decent, especially on some of the camera-work (cinematography). It was the kind of movie, I felt, that you'd see in the afternoon on A&amp;E and get enthralled by it for the time being, but you'd otherwise not go out to rent it if you knew any better, kind of like watching Columbo when you start in the middle of the episode. Fun, but not too hard on the brain kind of thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just a great movie! Jack Nicholson and Mary Steenbergen are an odd pair, but there is chemistry between their characters that is very nuanced. Nicholson's acting is so effortless and natural that you marvel at his technique. He adds a hint of buffonery to the roguish character he plays. The controlled lunacy of the character is so infective that one can't help but root for the feller!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that I subscribe to the HBO service. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favorite actors but not even he could rescue this part. Not that he tried. Jack plays his usual Wiitches of Eastwick type character. Unfortunately it doesn't transfer over to the American southwest. He is about as believable a cowboy desperado as Pee Wee Herman. There is no edge to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails. He is almost to goofy. The remainder of the cast was worse. Timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not perfected as of 1978 and the others appeared to be just happy to be there. My recommendation to those of you interested in seeing this movie is that you save your valuable time for something like watching paint dry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>100% Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some mysterious reason, this film failed to delight both critics and the public when it was first released in 1978, probably because it did not match the celluloid and writing quality of Nicholson's previous multi-million dollar funded blockbusters, "Chinatown", and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". I first watched "Goin' South" on video back in 1987 when I was 26. I watched it with six other people, and we all laughed hysterically throughout this delightfully funny film (and we don't drink or take drugs). The critics, and sadly, Nicholsen's fans, completely missed the point of this great movie. It was Jack taking a break from the 'biz' to explore his directing gifts (though no Spielberg, he is capable) and due to the low budget, he makes up in performance what the Hollywood trimmings and glitz cannot provide. His co-stars, especially John Belushi in his first major film role, is absolutely hilarious. Every one of his films pale compared to his toothless, Mexican loser of a bandit impersonation. When I watch this movie every now and then, I can see why the critics were so hard on this film. Mary Steenburgen (in her first film role too) was not the right person to play the part of the prissy, virginal, and headstrong maiden who saves Jack from the gallows (some old Civil War law where a woman can save a condemned man by marrying him). She's just too bitchy, and none of us want to see the misguided, but lovable Jack treated this way. You kind of feel sorry for the guy, and this unintentionally brings the viewer down a little here and there (but not much!). Even though things change for the better, by that point in the film, you just don't care. If the film had a larger budget, they would have been able to afford an actress of the caliber of Julie Christie, Sally Fields, or even Goldie Hawn. There are times when Steenburgen just sort of sucks the life out of the scene, and if it weren't for Jack's over-the-top acting, even I might get annoyed. This being said, the film is still one of the best 90 minutes I can spend in front of the boob tube. I love it, and I think you will too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Nicholson: The Good &amp; Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is typical Jack Nicholson of the 1970s, which means good news and bad news, at least for me. I usually find the characters he plays interesting and with a decided edge, but along with that comes a profane mouth with a penchant for using the Lord's name in vain. Here, he blasphemes three times in the first five minutes. (Where is nurse Rathet when you need her?)That's the case here, too, in this offbeat western in which co-stars with the pretty and soft- spoken Mary Steenburgen. Nicholson also directed this film.The movie is more interesting that the description of it. If language, as mentioned above, doesn't bother you then I would recommend this as a "sleeper" film, one that isn't well- known but will surprise you with the entertainment. It has a deep cast, too, of veteran actors and newcomers who became well-known.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson May Have It in Front of the Camera, But Not Behind It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Goin' South" is an unspectacular movie about an old-West criminal (Jack Nicholson) who is saved from the gallows by Mary Steenburgen, but now he must marry her and work on her farm. Needless to say Nicholson is not the marrying type and he is not real big on working either. The typical inane comedy follows and there is also a predictable finale. Nicholson does fair work here, but the film never does take off. One reason is because of Nicholson's shortcomings as a director. The screenplay is not impressive either. Not a very good movie when all is said and done. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For fans of A NEW LEAF (1971) with Elaine May and Walter Matthau left wanting a bit more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS **This film is very much a comedy. Deputies shoot bank robbers at point-blank range and nobody dies. Ore mines collapse and no one is injured. Men marry women and no one has sex. BUT IT'S OK. This is A NEW LEAF transplanted from New York City to "a post Civil War small town," somewhere near the Mexican border.WAIT A MINUTE. Don't send me angry letters. A NEW LEAF is to die for. This film is not. But as I watched it, I began to feel I had "been there before." Even before I realized what the story was about, my heart began to tell me it was "deja vu all over again."Nicholson is uneven. There are several times in the film where I felt, "no one else could have done that bit as well." Other times when the old director-actor bugaboo showed through. Mary Steenburgen, in her debut, seemed to "loosen up" as an actress even as the plot gave her a chance to loosen up. This is NOT the same as Elaine May who is loose as a goose from one end of A NEW LEAF to the other.The film tries to capture the classic old-Disney, Doris Day, semi-tomboy, I'm-too-busy-to-think-about-sex female, cast adrift in a man's world. It even succeeds in selling us on an old silent film cliché: the bad guy is the RAILROAD COMPANY which is going to take the land her pappy left her. But somehow, Steenburgen's character doesn't quite carry that off. It is to her personal credit that she creates a new heroine even as the film fails to place her squarely in the traditional place.In fact, I tend to think that this is her film, rather than Nicholson's. That is only because he is so talented, so polished, that we take for granted the huge talent that is "underneath" what we see. We are always slightly aware of the hidden part of Jack's talent, of the iceberg UNDERWATER. And I say this even if he's not superior in this film.Kudos to Christopher Lloyd and John Belushi for portraying corrupt deputy sheriffs. I doubt that anyone could write or act the part that Belushi had in 1978. Times have changed. His absolute restraint made him all the funnier. He was a stereotype but he never gave way to the clichés of that stereotype. Well, almost never.A fresh young Danny DeVito didn't have enough screen time to give us anything to comment on. DeVito was actually more visible in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975). Veronica Cartwright (TV's L.A. Law) has a thankless part as "the other woman".The middle part sags a good bit--another reason that the film is no NEW LEAF. There are extra scenes we don't need, and minor action sequences poorly filmed. I sort of wish someone other than Nicholson had directed this.BUT IF YOU ARE LIKE ME, and have a now 31-year old chasm that has never properly been filled, since Henry Graham wooed Henrietta Lowell so that he could get the carbon off the valves and return his red playboy's Ferrari to the streets of NYC, then this film is for you.</fullReview>
