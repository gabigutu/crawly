		<shortDescription>Great but not without its flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from a screening in Vancouver~ Thanks to Clint Eastwood, it was almost free (only one dollar per ticket) I will try to keep my review spoiler-free~Personally, I thought it was a great film. Not exceptional in anyway, but still great. The tone reminds me a bit of Changeling. Makes sense since the stories are from the same period. I have to say, with Eastwood, Leonardo DiCaprio and Dustin Lance Black all on board, I was kind of expecting something a bit more than this.I thought the weakest link was the script. It was interesting, but flawed. Also, the story was not very intriguing. Having watched Milk (also written by Black) and really liked how the story unfolded, I was expecting a great story about how J. Edgar Hoover rose to power and how he gradually transformed into the monster he became in the end. But instead, the story was told by shifting back and forth in time countless times, which at some point made me feel emotionally detached from the story and the characters. The bad bad makeup (I guess we can all agree on that~) was also very distracting. The elderly characters looked like wax figures to me.That said, I really LOVED Eastwood's score. It was moving and really fit the mood of the film. His direction and camera-work were masterful as always. Leo was very convincing as J. Edgar, although I keep on seeing bits and pieces of Howard Hughes in his performance. Judi Dench and Naomi Watts were both great, however the same thing can not be said about Armie Hammer. I thought he was much better in The Social Network. There were a few good moments between him and Leo, but his performance as the elderly Clyde Tolson was darn right awful. I blame the horrible makeup.As for the Oscars, this film will get a few nominations, but I doubt that it would become a strong contender. Though Leo's performance was not without its flaws, I thought it was more than enough to secure his leading actor nomination. Nods for best art direction, best cinematography and best score are also quite possible. This film had the potential to become a masterpiece, but fell short of my expectations mainly due to the uneven script. While far from being one of his best, it is nevertheless a welcome addition to Eastwood's portfolio.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why are there are these horrible reviews? I just saw this movie yesterday and it was utterly fantastic. I'm not the only one that thinks so. The theater was packed with people, mainly from adult to elderly but it was packed non the less. Everyone was clapping at the end of the movie. "J. Edger" tells the story of how the man J. Edger Hoover came to power, and goes into his personal life. Clint Eastwood did a wonderful job at bring this amazing story to life, and his so score was beautiful too. Leonardo DiCabrio was unbelievable. I couldn't believe how fantastic he was. It was one of the best performances I personally have ever seen. If he dose not win an Oscar for this, it would be just terrible. Everyone else was great too, everyone. And guess what people, the makeup was FANTASTIC! Why people are bashing this movie so much is beyond me. It's not for everyone I'll admit. It's for people with a brain who want to see a piece of art instead of some stupid film like the Immortals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Clint Eastwood's latest biopic J. Edgar, we delve into the personal life of one of the most powerful and enigmatic figures of the 20th century. We are shown pieces of a man who was scared, confused, and extremely intelligent. He knew how to cater to the media, but his personal life was shrouded in secrecy. It could be argued that J. Edgar himself wasn't quite sure of who he was.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hoover. We see him evolve from a young upstart in the US Justice Department to the head of the FBI. DiCaprio portrays a man of man faults, though not entirely through his own doing. He overcame a speech impediment, grew up virtually without a father, and had difficulty expressing himself socially and sexually. Through DiCaprio's performance, we see just that, a man with a head on his shoulders, only confiding in those few people he trusted.In his inner circle was Helen Gandy (Naoimi Watts), his personal secretary and keeper of Hoover's private files. Her commitment to Hoover knew no bounds. His right hand man, Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), was, on paper, not the right person to become Hoover's 2nd in command, but Hoover saw something in Tolson that made him feel comfortable. From what we see on film, Tolson was more than a friend, more than a partner. He had no title for Hoover. He was invaluable.The center of Hoover's world, however, was his mother Annie (Judi Dench). A stern yet loving woman, she knew what Hoover needed to be successful. Her approval meant so much to him, and the thought of letting her down was unfathomable. That would wreak havoc on his private life throughout his life.Hoover's appointment as head of the FBI would last for nearly half a decade. In that time he saw our country through several wars, the "red scare," gangsters, and a presidential assassination. To compile his ever major decision would make for a great documentary series, but to compress it all into a movie under 2 1/2 hours, Eastwood utilizes recent Oscar winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black (Milk) to pen the script. What Black does is paint a picture of Hoover not as the head of the FBI, but as a man whose image was so out of whack that he himself had trouble distinguishing fact from fiction.The film constructed in a way that we are told the story of Hoover's life through Hoover's own words, not from a general point of view. What makes this so effective is that we aren't sure of how certain events actually transpired, making the story, and in effect history, somewhat clouded, much like the image of Hoover himself.This image of Hoover has been dissected and speculated for years. Was he a homosexual? What secrets did he take to the grave? Was he involved in any conspiracies? These questions are touched upon, but never fully answered. What we are left with is a portrait of a man left unfinished, much like the painting of Washington we see several times throughout the film. Like the painting, Hoover is a man incomplete. That painting is a reminder to him that even though he is incomplete he can still make a difference.Some of the strengths of the film are also its weaknesses. The story itself if fascinating, but it tends to drag on. It reminded me of The Good Shepherd. A really good story with great characters based on true events, just nothing extraordinary. The acting too is well done but, for me at least, I had a hard time not seeing Leonardo DiCaprio as Hoover, especially with the makeup. Part of it, especially with DiCaprio, is his voice. He has such a unique way of speaking and he has trouble disguising it. His character also reminded me of his performance in The Aviator.The acting on the whole, especially Hammer and Dench (I expect nods for both and DiCaprio as well), is well above average. Eastwood always manages to extract prime performances from his actors, including when he is acting. Eastwood also continues his work behind the scenes by composing the score, his seventh feature length scoring composition. Like his other composition, there's a heavy, moody, jazzy undertone. He doesn't overpower us with large orchestral compositions. Instead he utilizes strings, piano, and a few horns to accent the images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is Truth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The infamous words spoken by Pilate to Jesus of Nazareth come to mind when one ponders the life of John Edgar Hoover. Was he a genius or a tyrant? A patriot or a dictator? A cross dresser or an uptight man with no sex life? Nobody knows for certain, and director Clint Eastwood does not offer a definitive answer to any of these questions, which is exactly as it should be. Life is rarely cut-and-dried, but moviegoers seem to have forgotten that fact in the face of media that state speculation as fact on a regular basis.I find it not only surprising, but distressing, that a major criticism from those critics who panned the film is the lack of closure on Hoover's private life. Unless they are truly obtuse, they must realize that no film could possibly do such a thing, since his files were destroyed at his own bidding. All is speculation, and a fine speculation it is. Leonardo DiCaprio is superb (as usual) in the title role, never revealing more cards then he chooses to at any given moment. He receives fine support from Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson, Hoover's Second in Command/Rumored Lover, and Naomi Watts as his endlessly loyal private secretary Helen Gandy. At a time when "red fever" ran high, Hoover's relentlessly tightening control on government investigations is shown in flashbacks that only underscore how supreme power can corrupt even the noblest of intentions.In the end, the film answers none of the questions that seem so important to the very critics that disliked it, but in my humble opinion, a well made film is one that inspires debate or discussion rather than simply hand down a definitive 'this is the way it was' with an imperious gavel. With "J Edgar", Eastwood and his cast have succeeded well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never imagined I would see a Clint Eastwood film where I would look at my watch before the first hour was even up, but alas the day has come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It can happen to the best of us. Spielberg, Scorsese, Hitchcock, and even Clint Eastwood himself are capable of making an instantly-dismissible picture. Sometimes, it seems, a director will find himself in a project without much of a passion for it and looking at the final product, it's kind of hard to see his signature on the screen. That is the case with Mr. Eastwood's biopic on the life of J. Edgar Hoover. The movie, "J. Edgar", is everything I did not expect from Mr. Eastwood considering the deep, thought-provocative and artistic power of his last movie "Hereafter" as well as the many films that he made beforehand. Slow, pretentious, and middling.Many actors have played the infamous FBI founder over the years (once by Hoover himself, in the 1959 James Stewart movie "The FBI Story"). This time, the role goes to Leonardo DiCaprio. Unfortunately, it seems, his feelings about the movie seemed to be identical to Mr. Eastwood's, as he merely ham-acts throughout the entirety of the movie. The only thing differentiating his performance from scene-to-scene depends on how much phony make-up has been slapped on his face. It's sort of like a "Citizen Kane" portrait of a real-life figure, starting around the time of the man's death and whisking back and forth between the past and the present. Except whereas that great Orson Welles film from seventy years ago did it with precision and aesthetic greatness, the narrative of "J. Edgar" takes such vast leaps that it frequently falls flat on its face.The screenplay was written by Dustin Lance Black, who won the Oscar for Best Screenplay for "Milk." Once again, he more or less writes this story more as a vessel for a homosexual romance and rights message. And it is here that he strikes his intended gold. Hoover's lover, his right-hand man Clyde Tolson, is played with immense passion by Armie Hammer. And it is the scenes between Mr. Hammer and Mr. DiCaprio that work. A particularly great scene involves the two secret lovers sharing a dinner table with some flirtatious Hollywood starlets and nervously trying to shake off the ladies' sexual advances without giving themselves away. Also fascinating and frightful is a confrontation about homosexuality between Mr. DiCaprio and Judi Dench as Hoover's mother.So it is in this soulful subplot that Mr. Black's screenplay works, but when he tries to form a narrative arc about the lifetime of J. Edgar Hoover and bounce across decades in a coherent manner, it starts to struggle. Furthermore, apart from the love subplot, there is no chemistry between the characters. Naomi Watts, as Hoover's secretary, is given such insignificant things to do that she may as well have been an extra.Earlier I mentioned that a passionless project even by a great director, will appear to lose its creators' signature and that is no more evident than in here. Mr. Eastwood's directing, though hardly bad, is rather dull with too many long shots and ponderous slow zooms. And while Leonardo DiCaprio was an inspired choice to play J. Edgar Hoover, he does it almost playfully, without much soul or conviction. Most embarrassing of all is the forced accent with which he enunciates the dialogue. Capped with some truly horrific make-up, when playing the elderly Hoover, the actor appears to be giving a comic stand-up performance at a nightclub. Reputedly, Mr. DiCaprio spent five hours every morning having the prosthetics applied to his face when playing the older version of the character. All I can say is that they should have spent at least six, for the make-up looks like exactly what it is. And the stuff put on Mr. Hammer for his old-guy moments makes him look like he belongs in a 30s Universal horror film.Just as frightful as the makeup is the hack-job cinematography by Tom Stern. Yes, the same Tom Stern who has lit beautiful images for many of Clint Eastwood's earlier films, including "Changeling" for which he deservedly earned an Academy Award nomination. Mr. Stern's specialty seems to be in low-key lighting. Last year, he did a fabulous job catching the mood of "Hereafter" with clever use of shadows and silhouetting lights. But here, he goes overboard. The shadows in "J. Edgar" are so amateurish and monstrous that (I kid you not) the actors sometime disappear in them. If there is a symbolic purpose behind this, I cannot think of it. And other times, the lights are too soft. Close-ups of characters make them appear to be covered with flour and worst of all is when the camera tracks into a dark room and auto-adjusts to the new light...much like a home-video camera.I never imagined I would see a Clint Eastwood film where I would look at my watch impatiently before the first hour was even up, but alas the day has come. "J. Edgar" is a dimwitted, passionless project that brings almost nothing to our previous knowledge about the formation of the FBI and the men who made it all possible. Only a couple of sharp, provocative moments from Dustin Lance Black's screenplay really stand out. Now Clint Eastwood has made five or six masterpieces during his forty-year career as a director and about twice as many great films, so despite my disappointment, I am prepared to allow this one to fade from my memory.Not that that would be very hard. If J. Edgar Hoover had a file cabinet labeled 'Instantly Forgettable,' that is where this film would have gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The best place to start with this one is by saying what it isn't. It is not a documentary. It is not a very detailed history lesson. It is not the best biography of the man. It is not a behind-the-scenes of the FBI. What it is ... another piece of quality filmmaking from Clint Eastwood. It's an overview of J. Edgar Hoover and his nearly 50 years of civil service under 8 U.S. Presidents.The screenplay is from Dustin Lance Black, who also wrote the script for Milk, based on the story of Harvey Milk (played by Sean Penn). Clearly, Eastwood and Black had no interest in setting forth an historical drama that couldn't possibly be told within a two hour film structure. No, this is more of a fat-free character study that hits only a few of the highlights from an enigmatic man's fascinating career. With so few available details about Hoover's personal life, some speculation is required ... but Eastwood walks a tightrope so as to make neither a statement nor mockery.Therein lies the only problem with the film. While hypnotic to watch, we are left with an empty feeling when it's over. How can that be? This man built the foundation of the FBI. He instigated the fingerprint system. He armed the secret police. His agency tracked down notorious gangsters. He led an anti-communist movement. He was in the middle of the investigation for the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. He supposedly kept secret files on most politicians and celebrities. He viewed the security of Americans as his responsibility. He was smack dab in the middle of almost 50 years of American history ... all while being a power-hungry, paranoid mama's boy who may have been, in her words, a daffodil.An elderly Hoover's own words tell his story as he dictates his memoirs. We are told that his memories of these stories are blurred and he takes a few liberties to say the least. He longed to be the comic book hero like his own G-Men. He longed to be recognized for his contributions, even to the point of desiring a level of celebrity. In his mind, he was the face of national security and the hero cuffing many outlaws. In reality, he was also the black-mailing schemer who so frightened Presidents with his secret files, that all 8 of them backed off firing him. He could be viewed as the ultimate survivor in a town where few careers last so long and cross party lines.The film picks up in 1919 when Hoover is a youngster making a name for himself as an all-work, no play type. That reputation stuck with him until the end. When he was first promoted, he hired Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts)to be his secretary. In one of the most remarkable hires of all time, she sticks with him until his death in 1972. Staunchly loyal to Hoover and totally dedicated to her job, Ms. Gandy helped Hoover with decisions and processes throughout. The other member of his inner circle was Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). Tolson was Hoover's right-hand man at the bureau, his trusted adviser, his daily lunch partner, and speculation never ceased on their personal ties.Judi Dench plays Annie Hoover, J Edgar's controlling mother, who he lived with until her death. She was also his adviser, supporter and probably a factor in his stunted social skills. We also get glimpses of how he dealt with Robert Kennedy (Jeffrey Donovan) and his overall lack of respect for John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Richard Nixon. The Lindbergh case plays a key role because Hoover used it to gain more power for his bureau and increase funding for weapons, forensic labs and resources.As for Leonardo DiCaprio, it's difficult to explain just how outstanding his performance is. It could have been a caricature, but instead he affords Hoover the respect his place in history demands. The 50 years of aging through make-up can be startling, especially since the time lines are mixed up throughout. His speech pattern mimics Hoover's, as does the growing waist line. There are some Citizen Kane elements at work in how the story is told and how it's filmed, but Eastwood wouldn't shy away from such comparisons.If you want real details on Hoover, there are some very in-depth biographies out there. The number of documentaries and history books for this era are limitless. What Eastwood delivers here is an introduction to J Edgar Hoover. It is interesting enough to watch, and Leonardo's performance is a must-see, but the film lacks the depth warranted by the full story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a look, but the wrong medium for this story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie Clint Eastwood makes is certainly worth a look, and Leonardo DiCaprio is entertaining in anything he does. But this version of J. Edgar Hoover's story seems superficial, and lacking meat on its bones.That has more to do with its form ? a theatrical film only two hours and 17 minutes long - relative to the length of the biography at its core. Hoover was such a complex man, and his career was so long, with so many chapters, that his story is probably better suited to a 4-to 6 hour HBO mini-series, where more of the details of his life, that this film with its short running time can only hint at, can be more completely told.Dustin Lance Black, who wrote this film's screenplay (as well as that of Milk), is walking a very fine line here regarding Hoover's complex personality; it seems that he had a much more intricate story he wanted to tell, were it not for the confines of the feature film format. Here, broad brush strokes take the place of long chapters on Hoover's involvement with the Red Scares of the '20's and '50's, political blackmail, gambling, organized crime, and of course, homosexuality.But if it had been made as a mini-series, it probably wouldn't have attracted Eastwood and DiCaprio, and consequently wouldn't have the high profile that this film does. That version of his story will have to wait for another time.Eastwood chose to shoot this story in a washed-out color palette. The story jumps back in forth in time, and the closer the events of the film are to the end of Hoover's life, the more color Eastwood imbues into the scenes; the earliest moments in the time line are shown in a color scheme barely above monochrome. It's a subtle effect, but it helps the viewer keep track of where the scenes exist in Hoover's life.That long time line necessitates that DiCaprio must be seen in various makeup schemes to convey the age of his character at any point in the story. His makeup is uniformly good; but the two other principal actors in the film, Armie Hammer as Hoover's longtime companion Clyde Tolson, and Naomi Watts as Hoover's secretary Helen Gandy, don't fare so well as their characters age. Obviously, the lion's share of the film's makeup budget was allotted to the star. Hammer, it must be said, gives a fine performance under all those old-age prosthetics. Christopher Shyer, who plays Richard Nixon in a brief scene, has the least-effective verisimilitude of anyone who has played the man in a motion picture.But makeup alone does not a performance make. Di Caprio's ability to remain in character and "age" with him is remarkable, and transcends the work of his makeup artist. As he did with his portrayal of Howard Hughes in The Aviator, his skillful use of voice and body to stay true to his characterization of Hoover through the years is evident throughout.One gets the feeling that much of this film was shot in front of a green screen, no surprise given the various eras of Washington that it depicts; but to a longtime moviegoer, there's a certain sadness that imparts to seeing that technique, once the province of the large-scale action film, used in serious dramas. There was probably no other way to do it in this day and age, but it just calls attention to itself in a way that gets in the way of one's immersion into the subject matter. Admittedly, that's my problem, not the film's.So, is it worth a look? Sure. Best Picture nominee? In a field of ten, probably. Will Leo finally win an Oscar this time out? Well, look at it this way: Paul Newman gave his best performance in The Verdict, but the Academy finally honored him for The Color of Money. Leo probably should have won for playing Howard Hughes, but maybe he'll win for playing J. Edgar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Most Under-appreciated Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's boldness and creativity paid off in this excellent portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover's life. A project like that is not pulled off by just anyone, and the fact that a film like that was even made shows the importance of Clint Eastwood. His direction was marvelous, by the way, showing without fear the dark side of the FBI director, but also showing all the good aspects of this very interesting subject. Leonardo DiCaprio is another great reason to watch the film, in one of the most moving performances in his career. His portrayal of a Hoover both ruthless and emotionally vulnerable was superb, and he has excelled once again in studying the character. The make up must also be praised for allowing DiCaprio to portrayal Hoover in many different stages of his life. J. Edgar, if not Clint's best work, is a very interesting and moving film, and the fact that it is so under-appreciated is a mystery to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American actor, producer, composer and director Clint Eastwood's thirty-third feature film is an American production which was written by screenwriter Dustin Lance Black. It tells the story about J. Edgar Hoover (1895-1972), who grew up with his two elder siblings in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood of Washington. In 1917, after receiving his Master of Laws degree at the George Washington University, he was hired as a clerk by the Justice Departement where he meet Helen W. Gandy (1897-1988) who would become his personal secretary. J. Edgar Hoover was a very private, secretive and ambitious man who was totally dedicated to his job. He lived with his mother Anne Marie and didn't have much of a social life, but in 1924, J. Edgar Hoover became the first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and during this period he meet a confidential secretary for the Secretary of War named Clyde Tolson (1900-1975), whom he hired as his vice director. This biographical period film depicts J. Edgar Hoover's participation in the extensive investigation of the kidnapping of the one-year-old son of aviators Charles Lindbergh (1902-1974) and Anne Morrow Lindbergh (1906-2001), which took place in 1932, his ongoing fight against crime and communism, his private search for information which he could use to blackmail senator Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968) and his unjustified attempts at undermining the reputation of American activist and civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr (1929-1968). Precisely and engagingly directed and with a tightly structured narrative, this detailed and descriptive portrayal of a multifaceted man with some very bright and some very dark attributes draws an intriguing study of character with poignant depictions of the main character's relationship with his encouraging mother Anne Marie Scheitlin Hoover (1860-1938), his relationship with his loyal secretary Helen W. Gandy and a poignant though ambiguous depiction of his relationship with his devoted friend Clyde Tolson.This fast-paced and dialog-driven drama is notable for its austere atmosphere which is reinforced by the prominent use of light and Clint Eastwood's tangible score, and the reverent acting performances by English actress Naomi Watts, English actress Judi Dench, American actor Armie Hammer and especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who delivers a variable and emphatic acting performance in an atypical role where he is transformed by the make-up. A dark and gripping mystery and crime story which is complimented by a low-keyed love story.</fullReview>

This is an almost perfect movie: excellent performances by the cast, traditional discrete direction by Mr. Eastwood (also his ever fantastic music score), emotions, well written script... You name it. Let's clear out one thing: This is NOT primarily a biographic movie but a story of love and devotion. And that's why Mr. Eastwood excels again. If you want a biopic, you can give it to anyone, but if you want an emotional story perfectly told, you give it to Mr. Eastwood. He is an artist par excellence.Highly recommended to anyone who, after the abundance of Hollywood movie junk, wants to see finally a very very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never has a movie's trailer been so deceiving, teasing an epic biographical drama about the rise and fall of a powerful man with secrets that ruined him. But there's no rise to be any fall? or much of anything else for that matter. Leonardo DiCaprio, playing J. Edgar Hoover, bounces from boring one scene (and/or time period) to the next? displaying no qualities of a person who, although flawed and now considered a joke, did make an impact. His innovations in fingerprinting, and the climb from a snoopy young agent to the head of the F.B.I., are treated as importantly as a midnight snack. And the only revelations are that he loved his mother and was a closeted homosexual, but even these stories play out like bad soaps. While segments following taut historical situations, like the Lindbergh kidnapping, build no suspense whatsoever ? leading only to Hoover screwing up the situation: time and time again. Most of the side-characters, from biographers to politicians to fellow agents to his closest friends, are used merely as counterpoint-mouthpieces: questioning everything Hoover says just in case the audience can't figure out each lie on their own. DiCaprio is far better here than THE AVIATOR, where he was completely miscast playing a grownup. With his narrowed eyes fervently seeking purpose, he tries very hard, even in the fake looking old man makeup? but with a script so lacking of any personal or historical significance, it feels like he's treading water. But the worst crime, exceeding the fact most of the dialog occurs between two people who'd never (later on) revealed the conversations, is it's downright boring. Director Clint Eastwood should either retire or go back to making action movies, because this clunker had no pulse whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Disappointment - I'll Keep It Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one was more important to the evolution of law enforcement in the United States in the first half of the 20th Century than J. Edgar Hoover. The history and politics of the era, the power Hoover held over presidents and senators, and the intensity with which he built the FBI from scratch - all of this would make a great movie. Instead Eastwood chose to make a film about a tortured closet homosexual with a strange mommy fixation. I guess he figured the American public would respond more to a soap opera than an intelligent historical drama. The scene in which Hoover and Tolson have their hotel-room lovers' spat is completely laughable. The death of Hoover's mother is pathetic. And the makeup and acting is so over-the-top through the majority of this film, that I had a hard time keeping my eyes from rolling out of my head.Certainly not worth paying to see in a theater. Not worth the cost of a rental later on either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoover's mother's dress may be Eastwood's 'Rosebud'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, Clint Eastwood was a right-wing Republican who churned out revenge fantasies about vigilantes who breathlessly enjoyed taking the law into their own hands. In these 'ancient' times, J. Edgar Hoover may have been one of Eastwood's heroes. As Hollywood has changed quite a bit since then, Eastwood instinctively realized that if he didn't change with the times, he could barely survive in a new politically correct world. Given the new exigencies, Eastwood could no longer ignore all of Hoover's bad behavior, including the iconic FBI director's paranoia and abject pettiness. Fortunately for Mr. Eastwood, he found the perfect politically correct screenwriter in Dustin Lance Black, who could mitigate Hoover's bad points by not only focusing on his private life as a closeted, repressed homosexual but also turning him into a tragic figure who was scarred by a manipulative and overbearing mother.Mr. Black does far worse in depicting Hoover's public persona than his private one. In Citizen Kane-like fashion, narration and a series of flashbacks are utilized to tell Hoover's story. But unlike Kane, which is told from multiple points of view, Hoover's story comes from Hoover himself, who is seen dictating his memoirs in his office to various FBI agents during the 60s and early 70s. The flashbacks for the early period begin in the early 20s when Hoover recounts his stint as a young lawyer in the Justice Department and how he became involved in that Department's crusade against so-called radicals and subversives, initiated by Attorney General Palmer in 1919 (whose home is shown dramatically firebombed in the beginning of the film).Black has great difficulty in dramatizing the Director's early career and we see one dubious scene of Hoover participating in a raid where radicals are eventually deported. More interesting is Hoover's obsession with details in the scene where he reveals his new card catalog system at the Library of Congress to his secretary-to-be, Helen Gandy. Black addresses Hoover's pettiness in taking all the credit for the G-men's heroics including his most egregious conduct in that regard, the demotion of Agent Purvis, responsible for the take down of John Dillinger. Black alludes to all of this but we never see the conflict with Purvis successfully dramatized. So desperate for drama, Black spends a good deal of time dissecting the Lindbergh kidnapping, which Hoover was only tangentially involved in. But even the Lindbergh scene fails to flow as Black interrupts the action by cutting back to events from the 60s. Josh Lucas is totally wrong as Lindbergh, as not only doesn't he look like him, but has no dialogue that conveys the famed aviator's dynamism.Jeffrey Donovan looks a lot more like Robert Kennedy and manages to get the accent right but Hoover's whole conflict with the Kennedy's is reduced to Bobby telling J. Edgar in essence, "times have changed". Even more sketchy is Hoover's treatment of Martin Luther King. Because we see everything from Hoover's point of view and never meet any of the Civil Rights era characters he opposes, his egregious conduct seems muted. Eastwood must resort to cheap shots such as having Hoover listen to a salacious tape (presumably of a MLK tryst), and receiving a phone call at the same time, right after JFK is shot.Eastwood and Black are on more solid ground in attempting to humanize Hoover by providing insight into his private life. Since little is known of what went on behind 'closed doors', a screenwriter is obligated to take dramatic license and speculate as to the events that could have unfolded. Eastwood does well in not showing Hoover as sexually aggressive and actually not initiating a sexual encounter with his long term confidante, Clyde Tolson, who he appointed his associate director at the FBI. In Dustin Lance Black's view, it was Tolson who was the sexual aggressor, and fashions a scene where Hoover rebuffs Tolson after he kisses him following Hoover's revelation that he might have had a sexual encounter with the screen actress, Dorothy Lamour. For a good part of the film, Black depicts Tolson as a toady, picking out his wardrobe at expensive clothing stores and indulging Hoover in his forays at the racetrack. Only after Tolson falls victim to a stroke does he seem to muster the courage to confront Hoover, criticizing him for his selfish behavior and paranoid outlook (Tolson's critique is illustrated in the 'correct' flashback where Hoover no longer receives credit for arresting all those criminals he claimed to have taken down personally). Tolson here is really Black's conscience speaking, and whether Tolson would have turned on Hoover in that way, I have no idea. What's missing is any sense of Tolson's intellectual life and ultimately he's little more than an entertaining stereotype of a closeted gay man.DiCaprio does a decent job depicting a control freak Hoover minus the Kane-like gyrations at the end. Armie Hammer's Tolson is entertaining (sans the bad makeup job as the elderly Tolson) but Naomi Watts has little to do as the secretary. Judi Dench is excellent as the demented mom.Like Orson Welles, Eastwood falters in attempting to turn Hoover into a tragic figure who didn't really like himself. Welles unfairly criticized William Randolph Hearst by speciously linking 'Rosebud' (Kane's childhood keepsake, a sled) to a miserable childhood. Hoover's mother's dress (the one he puts on after she dies) is perhaps Eastwood's 'Rosebud'--the dress also symbolizes Hoover's inability to escape his attachment to his mother and her disparagement of his sexuality which he must suppress (the mother's 'daffodil' comment is the last straw!).But perhaps Eastwood and Black's interpretation is all wrong. Perhaps Hoover actually did like himself and didn't have an inferiority complex due to his overbearing mother. If that's the case, Hoover should be seen as far more maniacal than Eastwood lets on here. All the harm that Hoover was responsible for, can no longer be chalked up to a "bad childhood."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Had the Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonardo DiCaprio has proved himself a masterful actor, but his performance in Clint Eastwood's "J. Edgar" is sure to put him on the same shelf as Sean Penn, Meryl Streep, Viggo Mortensen, Johnny Depp, and Christian Bale ? actors who inhabit their roles so convincingly that the real person essentially disappears. As J. Edgar Hoover, who became the head of the FBI in 1924 and remained so until his death in 1972, DiCaprio thoroughly captures the look, the mannerisms, the voice, and the personality. We see a man who took his public image as seriously as his job, as made abundantly clear by a scene late in the film, in which key events in his life are disputed. It's actually rather cleverly handled. It's a matter of perception; what others see in you may not be as interesting as how you see yourself.The film is structured as a meandering narrative, freely shifting back and forth between Hoover's early days at the FBI and the final years of his life, at which point various typists transcribe an autobiography he's dictating. He recounts the major cases he personally oversaw, including the Palmer Raids, the kidnapping and death of Charles Lindbergh's baby boy, and the gangster wars of the early 1930s. To say he "personally oversaw" is not to suggest he acted alone or was even physically present. That didn't stop him from taking most of the credit. When Melvin Purvis, one of the most effective and respected agents of his time, became a media sensation after successfully tracking down criminals such as Baby Face Nelson and John Dillinger, Hoover's response was to demote him. He would, in fact, frequently fire or reassign agents he considered objectionable.I suspect most audiences will go into this movie with preconceived notions about Hoover's personal life, most notably that he may have been a transvestite and a closeted homosexual. Both are unsubstantiated rumors, although there is strong evidence supporting the latter, not the least of which is his lifelong friendship with FBI associate director Clyde Tolson. Apart from their professional relationship, they would often dine together, attend social events, and go vacationing. Tolson would go on to inherit Hoover's estate, receive the American flag draped over his coffin, and ultimately be buried in the same cemetery only a few yards away. It cannot be denied that Eastwood and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black are making a case for this aspect of Hoover's life. But this is not a message film about forbidden love; it's a portrait of a man who defined himself solely by his reputation.True enough, it was built and maintained in large part by gathering secret files on the alleged sex lives of prominent public figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt. It's widely speculated that he did this only for the purposes of blackmail, which would explain how he was able to stay in power for nearly fifty years (and why FBI directors have since been limited to ten-year terms). Publicly, he was so militantly anti-gay that he went as far as to track down and threaten anyone who questioned his sexuality. There's no telling how he felt privately, although the film makes some compelling arguments. Consider a scene in which he's alone in a hotel room with Tolson (Armie Hammer) and broaches the subject of proposing to actress Dorothy Lamour (who in real life was reported to have had an affair with Hoover). How does this fit with the image of a lifelong bachelor who surrounded himself with good-looking people, had an eye for fashion, and lived with his mother until the day she died?His mother, Annie (Judi Dench), matronly and domineering, says that she would rather her son be dead than a "daffodil," like one of Hoover's old schoolmates. We inevitably have this scene in mind after her death, at which point Hoover tearfully tries on one of her dresses. By my understanding of this scene, he was not trying to emulate the opposite sex; rather, it was an emotional last-ditch effort to recapture his closeness with his mother. This isn't creepy so much as it is sad and desperate. In that moment, we pity him.The other woman in his life was Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts), who, after a few unconventional dates and an awkward marriage proposal, would go on to become his permanent personal secretary. He entrusted her with his secret files, the contents of which remain largely unknown. No real effort is made to speculate on all the information he gathered, which is fine because this isn't really what "J. Edgar" is about. It's a well-researched period drama, complete with accurate costumes, convincing sets, and appropriately nostalgic lighting and color schemes. Above all else, it's a superbly acted character study about a man once considered the second most powerful in America ? although he could have easily been the first, considering the control he had over elected officials.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoover was a fascinating character who was involved in some very dubious power play and whose legacy lasts in American life even today. The man behind the public image - closet homosexual, cross dresser, megalomaniac - makes a perfect biopic subject. Sadly 'J. Edgar' fails to capitalise on this. DiCaprio, who is a very talented actor, was unwisely cast in the lead. Not only does he look nothing like the man he's playing but he also fails to bring sufficient charisma or menace to the role. Dame Dench supplies the best acting as Hoover's stiflingly overbearing mother. Armie Hammer's part as Hoover's love interest is underplayed and under-used. The screenplay and direction deliberately try to portray Hoover as uncontroversially as possible; giving him the benefit of the doubt and trying to make out his actions were merely dictated by his insecurities. Under it all he was just confused lonely man looking for love. Methinks (and history shows) the truth was a lot darker. His part in and impact on the political scene is skimmed over, we never get a true sense of what he accomplished; for good or ill. All we're left with is the fuzzy picture of a bland old man that doesn't do Hoover or the audience any justice. Swamping DiCaprio and Hammer in ridiculous prosthetics to portray their character's ageing was another big mistake.</fullReview>

A psychotic, paranoid schizophrenic, as I see it, head of the most powerful Federal Bureau Of Investigation, corrupted by his own power and his obsession with secrecy is a character worthy of Peter Lorre but in this new outing of the prolific Clint Eastwood, J Edgar Hoover is Leonardo DiCaprio! I love both DiCaprio and Eastwood but not in this. I love DiCaprio for Gilbert Grape and Eastwood for The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven. Here they are both out of their depths. Long, boring film with terrible aging make-up and no real center. The most unexpected aspect was the time dedicated to the romance between J Edgar and Clyde Tolson. It humanized the man without revealing him. That's almost cheating.</fullReview>

The writing was awful, the acting was awful, occasionally rising to OK, and the directing was awful. I can't say that the editing was awful as it appears that they didn't edit it. Incredibly long scenes of nothingness seemed to linger - making the 2 hour plus movie feel more like 5 hours.The movie didn't shed light on anything new and it didn't tell the story particularly well.And a word about the make-up. Wow. I have never seen a big budget movie with such horrendous makeup. The makeup was so bad that it was distracting. Literally every scene in which Clyde Tolson appeared as an older man was painful to watch. He appeared to be a badly burned man who may have actually been still melting at the time of filming.Do yourself a favor and wait until this comes out on Netflix.

In fact, the whole movie centered around Hoover's relationship with his right hand man Tolson. Not to mention the movie has the cheesiest ending. If you want to see kissing foreheads, holding hands, and only accepting a position if "we have lunch together every day" (a condition Tolson requests to except his job) then by all means go ahead.

		<shortDescription>A real dreamlike prodigy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be short on this film because it probably is one of the best by Clint Eastwood.First the actors. They have to cover a whole life and it starts in their early twenties and ends in their late seventies with diseases and death. It is not only a question of special makeup effects but it is a question of deportment, behaviour, rhythm, flexibility, credibility at any age in their facial expressions and their language. It takes time, a lot of training and great talent to do that. If it were easy they would all do it. Very few actually can.Second the institutional subject. The creation of the FBI. Its transformation from a semi-clandestine agency to a scientific, well trained and very effective and diligent institution. The film is clear how difficult it was to get laws passed and finances granted by Congress. Some of the arguments were opportunistic and some were logical, but they all had only one aim: to get what it needs to become the best. J. Edgar Hoover was in a way irritating in his way to serialize the action of the FBI for the nascent mass-media that the radio and the cinema were becoming. He was extremely disturbing in his umbilical ego-centeredness or ego-centricity. But that was him and the actor is able to render this cold, calculated and very tense character who had a problem with public elocution and had managed to overcome it with an extremely strict discipline.That leads to his action and his vision of the FBI. He was extremely authoritative and manipulative. He never took no for an answer and for him one no was always a disguised and hidden yes. He accumulated information on all the people he could one day depend on, politicians, congressmen and justices or judges, to blackmail them if necessary. He generally had his way and one of his major failures was with Martin Luther King that he could not blackmail into refusing the Nobel Peace Prize. The film is at times on the very verge of being embarrassing, though it only speaks of dead figures because it is dealing with rumors on Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Richard Nixon and a few others. I am not even sure some of the information is not frankly false.But Clint Eastwood is a patriot and he shows the patriotic side of the character with insistence and weight, to the point of reaching bigotry at times, for example on the subject of racism. He built the FBI in the fight against the anarchist and communist movement in the 20s and 30s, against the gangsters of the 20s and Prohibition, against the Germans in the 30s too, without specifying the political innuendo of the national reference in 1934 among Americans questioned by the FBI about someone who had a German accent. No nuance. Clint Eastwood gives his matter raw and uncooked at all.But Clint Eastwood reaches beyond these elements to capture the real personal and intimate dimension of his character. And here he is not using innuendo and allusions. J. Edgar Hoover's relation with his direct deputy is seen as a sentimental relation on the side of the deputy and an emotional relation on the side of J. Edgar Hoover himself. The tremendous condemnation of any gay orientation by his mother creates in him a tremendous struggle due to his attachment to his mother. The truth will come at the very end with a friendly even paternal kiss to his deputy on the night before dying. He will explain how he recruited him because he needed someone and he knew that young man needed a strong paternal figure that he accepted to be.Of course the revelation of the love of that young man for his boss is dramatized by Clint Eastwood, and maybe even too much because that was the intimate and private life of two men who did not reveal anything in public, far from it. But it is done with such delicacy, tenderness. J. Edgar Hoover appears in the film as having compensated the absence of a father figure and the presence of a strong authoritarian mother figure on his side, by playing that father figure with his direct deputy who needed such a father figure. The compensated lack of J. Edgar Hoover became the satisfaction of the need of his deputy. So much alike and yet so different.That personal touch in this film makes the film a lot more fascinating because it speaks of something that may happen to anyone: love is the only thing that survives in life and is stronger than even hatred as J. Edgar Hoover explains as he is climbing the stairs to his bedroom for the very last time in his life.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

They purposely didn't focus on a central plot but rather they show you little bits of major events that J. Edgar was a part of, but sometimes even the outcome of the event was unclear when they had already moved on the next one. The problem (at least in my opinion) is that they tried to squeeze a 60 year life of a notorious man in 2 hours and it was largely unsuccessful. I did not learn much about the character and almost nothing about the creation of the FBI. The way the character was portrayed made him very unlikable...uptight guy, strict rules, and BORING. I don't know what the real J. Edgar was like or the beginnings of the FBI.. but what is the point of focusing the movie on character that is (at least portrayed as) uninteresting.</fullReview>

It happens at such a pace you can't tell when is the "present day" and when is the past. The script is rather tepid and poorly delivered. The set design is drab, and the consistent poor lighting is also a distraction.One of the main sticking issues is..does Eastwood want to paint Hoover as a hero? Does he want to paint him as a gay man trying to lead a secret public life? Do we Pity J.Edgar? Should we despise him? When the film drags on and on, not really going anywhere, you find yourself not caring at all about one of the most controversial figures in modern American Times. And when the time comes for J.Edgar to pass away, the film treats it with a "hey look, he's dead" attitude.I enjoy bi-op films, but this just really dragged on, like the dentist appointment from hell. Even if you are a die-hard fan of anyone in this movie, or of Eastwood's films, avoid this one as if it didn't exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sorry distortion of history - so ridiculously anti-Hoover it may bring sympathy he doesn't deserve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a History/Political Science major in undergraduate school who grew up just south of the District of Columbia during the last years of J. Edgar Hoover's extended miss-rule of the FBI, and after as the stories about his abuses - from the vendetta against Dr. King to the protection of his "friend" Clyde Tolson were coming out - I was strongly of the impression that this Hoover (as opposed to the under-rated former president) was one of the great over-praised personifications of evil the country has ever produced. If President Nixon despised him as the film implies, it was most likely because the two were virtually the same person, only a generation apart.It came as something of a shock therefore to find myself thinking only a little way into this hodgepodge that it was grossly UNFAIR to its subject. Director Eastwood's concept apparently was to have Hoover, rankling under scrutiny from a press which had initially lionized him but cooled under the excesses of the McCarthy/Witch-hunt years, setting out to write his memoirs - memoirs which would give his own warped perspective of the nation's history from the indefensible Palmer Raids (which Hoover defends on the basis of fictitious multiple co-ordinated anarchist bombings) through his death in the early 70's.Eastwood leaves until the final five minutes of the film - in the two genuinely sensitive scenes in the film (a final dinner between Tolson and Hoover and the following day when Tolson is called when Hoover has died) for Tolson, who had BEEN there, to point out to his semi-lover to whom he has been consistently supportive and faithful, how much of his "memoir" is patently false! It's patently TOO LATE for a movie audience who is expected to take the preceding 130 minutes SERIOUSLY. We learn from our popular entertainment and 90% of this film is historic garbage.The film doesn't offer many palatable psychological bonbons either. I'm not overly concerned that Eastwood doesn't resolve the Hoover/Tolson sexual relationship beyond one laughable, semi-violent cross between FATAL ATTRACTION's "I won't be ignored" speech and the initial coupling in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (anyone married for more than a decade knows that sex alone is not necessarily the core of a relationship), but making poor Dame Judi Dench turn in another ten minute performance, this time as a gorgon of a repressive mother (there won't be another Oscar in this cameo) is too much a dated straight man's lame justification for Hoover's sexual identity and insulting not only to Hoover and his mother but any gays in or out of the audience.Scenically, Eastwood makes his imagined history look good while never giving Hoover the credit he actually deserves for reorganizing the FBI and countering the Depression Era crime wave (just because he claimed more credit than he deserved didn't mean he didn't deserve a lot!), but Leonardo DiCaprio is buried under so many layers of makeup to try and make him resemble a young Hoover (and even more WORSE makeup in his older scenes) that I'd have thought it was Matt Damon if I hadn't seen the posters.Over all, a very bad movie-bio of a remarkably bad man - made to look SO bad by a film maker out of his historical depth, that an audience who knows ANY of the history being portrayed runs the real danger of finding excuses for the inexcusable because the filmmaker is so over the top in his advocacy. A film about Joseph Stalin or Adolph Hitler might just BARELY get away with this sort of demonizing - with another American who was *supposed* to be on our side, it's less seemly.With considerable regret - one has come to respect Mr. Eastwood's direction enough that one hoped for a first class effort from him on his very problematic subject, but this film is to political history films as THE BLACK SWAN was to real ballet films - horribly distorted, not remotely recommended to any knowledgeable audience and even less to anyone who expects to LEARN anything about the putative subject matter - in this case, Hoover and the eight administrations he "served."

		<fullReview>How Clint Eastwood ever let himself get involved with this piece of garbage I will never understand. And once involved how was he able to stomach the day to day horribleness of the filming process?While it may comfort some to think of ole JEdgar as a wonderfully patriotic Mommy's Boy who somehow got lost in the closet and thus occasionally was given to bouts of meanness I fear that he was a bit more sinister of a character than that. Just ask any one of the hundreds of folks whose lives he destroyed. Don't, by the way, look for any contact info allowing you to locate them in this script. Sadly, there are few concrete examples of folks attacked by JEdgar in this movie. And, of course, the 3 referred to are long ago safely dead and thus no longer a source of possible threat to the studio.This is not to say, however, that the Kennedy and King family will not be quite put out by this movie. What is it exactly that ole JEdgar caught JFK and Martin Luther doing that merited his vicious attempts at character assassination? Oh there are a few veiled hints provided by this cardboard thin piece of Hollywood trash but no facts whatever to support the allegations.I won't waste time on a blow by blow of just how poor the acting and cinematography was. This is not a movie of any subtly and the poor quality of both is so glaringly evident no one needs me to point it out.Suffice it to say that JEdgar is little more than a repeat of DiCaprio's also cardboard thin Titanic which also somehow managed to trivialize its subject matter despite the fact that there was more than sufficient material there to have supported a great story line and cast.</fullReview>

DiCaprio's convincing acting and appearance, supported by Naomi Watts, as his secretary and other good actors held my attention throughout. Make-up artists in this film deserve high praise. Watching this biopic is an easy way to be informed and be entertained at the same time.Screenwriters and directors characterize Hoover's unusual personality, complex sexuality and close relationship to his mother (Judy Dench) and his lover Clyde Tolson. This males a compelling, and I believe accurate, on-screen interpretation of this unusual man who had a strong affect on this country for almost fifty years.Leonardo DiCaprio's superb acting makes this biopic believable. I know something about Hoover and this time in our history. This movie adds to my understanding. The tragic Lindberg child murder case was one of the most highly publicized crimes of the 20th century. This and the other segments make J Edgar several movies in one.May 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The person behind the man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie about one of the most renowned personalities of America's 20th century directed by one of its most respected directors made it one very highly on my 'to see' list.The film does not waste much time in giving us a sight of what a powerful even notorious personality the homonymous character is, including his very strong anti-communist sentiments. As far as his character goes he appears as swift to respond, highly intelligent but also highly paranoid, a predator, a hawk, always switched on, always on the edge, without any peace who did not appreciate having any limitations to his authority or power. During a very poignant dialogue towards the end, between Hoover and his assistant Tolson, it becomes very clear how Hoover did not appreciate criticism and were unable to handle the truth expecting others to simply accept his version of the truth.As we are treated to a more intimate view in his life the closeness to his mother does not go undetected and neither it should as with all personality deficiencies (in men at least) the relationship with their mother is one to closely watch. It was because of her influence in Edgar that left him with a pervasive sense of threat as well as a hunger for power, an influence that amongst other things caused him to be socially limited. Even towards the end of the film where our main character has grown much older (frail physically but not emotionally), his ways have not been altered in any way and one could even presume that his megalomania and paranoia are grown even more.Despite the aspects of Edgar's character the audience might not come to like, Clint Eastwood does a superb job in making sure that Hoover's gifts are also highlighted which include: impressive energy levels, vigorous memory, capacity to detect patterns and an ability to receiver, process, comprehend &amp; communicate information extremely effectively.Though not a dark film, this biopic has dark undertones suited perhaps to the personality it portrays. There are very few outdoor scenes, little light in general, and it would also seem that J Edgar was the workaholic type who did not have much of a social or private life. Regarding his social life, he appears outgoing but not very sociable and in connection to his private life we are led to assume that he was a homosexual, which was a cause for him to suffer, perhaps loathe himself, due to the religiously incited anti-gay sentiment preached by his over controlling mother. His inability to fully accept who he was must have, beyond question, caused him plenty of frustration. On this matter, there's a poignant scene in the movie where his mother said (paraphrased): I'd rather have a dead son than a gay son.With the above in mind, one question that must be therefore raised is whether his quest for power and authority was driven by his ideas/values for a better society or because it provided him with a sense of self worth? Why wasn't' he ever satisfied or willing to give up power? There is also some resemblance, albeit small, of 'The Aviator' another biopic with DiCaprio in the leading role.DiCaprio gives a forceful performance and carries the film, which is part biopic &amp; part political drama, compellingly. If there is a criticism about this movie it would have to be that it is rather slow and often made me wonder as to where it is heading with the constant interaction between Hoover's youth and later years.This is an accomplished biographical drama/character study that although it might not be to everyone's taste, nonetheless to those with a keen interest in politics or US history in the 20th century or simply those interested in finding out more about the enigmatic J. Edgar Hoover, this is the film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there a J Edgar inside of all of us?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that a Leonardo DiCaprio film is a must watch, different and interesting. Here comes a real life character for him to play, that of J Egar Hoover- in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Great performances by Leo and especially Armie Hammer and possibly an Oscar winner for Leo. Director Clint Eastwood doesn't fail to give his special dark background touch more like a sinister soul haunting the room. But is it possible that there is a J Edgar in each one of us? The awakening comes not when he proposes, outsmarts his peers, makes a super filing system or brings in a scientific touch to the forensics department; but when his mother played by Judi Dench says "I would rather have a dead son than a daffodil!" How many times in your life have you arrived at a dead end and be put down. Sure he had his quirkiness but in the end he made a difference in a system, country and the people connected from President to Investigator. How many people in life leave such f?tes? How many even bother to attempt? No we stop, we question and we fail because we lack courage to make hard choices, personal sacrifice and be true to ourself. A good piece from Hollywood, and a nice chapter to think about in your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Life &amp; Times of J. Edgar Hoover . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"J. Edgar", Rated "R" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Violence &amp; Mild Gore. Running Time: 2hrs.&amp;17mn.My Take: ***1/2 (Out of ****)"J.Edgar" is Clint Eastwood's biopic chronicling the complex life of J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Hoover, believed to have been the second most powerful man in the U.S. at times during his 1924 to 1972 tenure, was well-known as being extraordinarily meticulous. He implemented many basic procedures of the agency, including its centralized fingerprint file system and the use of forensic laboratories to aid in solving crimes. Though commonplace today, these methods were considered revolutionary in that time.It was only in Hoover's later years and after his death that he became more of a controversial figure. Rumors persisted that he abused his power as FBI director with his exaggerations of events, reports and supposedly overextended the authority of the FBI for his personal gain. If that weren't enough, rumors persist Hoover was a crossdresser.Director Clint Eastwood showcases the man for all his strengths and with his faults. He shows Hoover as the consummate professional capable of such brilliance, yet lacked so many social graces, especially with members of the opposite sex. He's presented as a man with a fierce determination to be right at almost any costs, all the way to executing the alleged Lindbergh kidnapper and murderer Bruno Hauptmann. Though many still believe there was enough circumstantial evidence to the contrary, there was no doubt in Hoover's mind Hauptmann was guilty of the "Crime of the Century." In fact, Hoover is depicted in "J. Edgar" as being jealous of the media's attention to special agent Jack Purvis after Purvis took down the gangster John Dillinger in Chicago. Supposedly, Hoover saw to it that Purvis's reward for his societal good deed was to be slowly removed from the FBI. Leonardo DiCaprio does a superb job of conveying Hoover's thoughts and emotions throughout the picture. He is a man molded by his mother (Judi Dench, "Quantum of Solace") to be a problem-solver and to excel at what he does. Often, to maintain this reputation, Hoover hides behind facts to project an image of confidence and superiority. Eastwood's film is more interested in the psychology of the famed FBI director than his actual achievements. As the film progresses, Hoover endures turmoil over his sexuality. When he confides in his mother that he doesn't care for dancing with women, she asserts that "I'd rather my son be dead than have a daffodil for a son." This definitely hampers his budding relationship and attraction to his FBI number two man Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer, "The Social Network"). The sexual tension between the two men is kept in check, despite always taking daily lunches, weekends and vacations together. Historically, Hoover and Tolson were often seen in public holding hands. DiCaprio does a nice job of showing a broken man who didn't know how to exist personally and professionally. He would never have his mother's consent, nor in the public's eye, to engage in an open relationship with Tolson. Perhaps that helped the man bury himself so much into his work.Obviously Tolson loves Hoover deeply, yet that love can never be fully reciprocated. Tolson is loyal to Hoover to his detriment. Hoover's faithful secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts, "Eastern Promises") stayed in his service for over 54 years. Clint Eastwood creates a stirring drama on the man the public thought Hoover was, and of the fears and anxieties of someone at odds with himself. Was he in denial? Did Hoover really experiment with crossdressing as a way to cope with a personal loss? These concepts are explored and the feelings on the screen are compellingly real. You genuinely want to see what happens to this man and see what lengths he'll go for the FBI and himself. "He's a mystery man," director Eastwood said of Hoover. "I still don't have all the answers on him.""J. Edgar" features some of the best age makeup I've ever seen in modern cinema. Hoover and Gandy's aging look absolutely authentic as the film progresses over 50 years. Still, it's the actors who really sell us on who these characters are at different stages of their lives, and DiCaprio and Watts pull it off nicely. Hammer is excellent as the aging Tolson, but looks like the bedridden old man in astronaut Dave Bowman's hallucination in "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968). It's mildly distracting, but Hammer's talent is the saving grace. Visually successful, the film conveys the shifting time periods very well. There isn't an overabundance of special effects to recreate the past. The naturalistic appearance of the clothes, sets and props are welcome and feel genuine. "J. Edgar" is a well-made, thought-provoking film. It handles the public image of Hoover while giving us insight into his soul. The film takes us through many decades at the different junctures of Hoover's life. He left quite a legacy, but it's hard to say exactly who he really was. Right or wrong, Clint Eastwood's film does a fine job of putting the pieces of the puzzle known as J. Edgar Hoover together to try to make sense of the FBI icon. I'm sure there are a few pieces missing, but are we not all flawed in some way? "J. Edgar" tells it like it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and slow... literally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting film for me, mostly because I take interest in both history and forensic investigation (i.e. CSI). I'm also a fan of DiCaprio's more recent films, and I had high hopes in this one. However, the actor who stole the show was, surprisingly, Armie Hammer. DiCaprio's fake accent and old makeup weren't believable at all to me, which was distracting... and I ended up feeling that he's DiCaprio instead of J. Edgar. Hammer on the other hand, was magnificent. It was mostly his scenes that saved this film for me - his scenes were the only ones that made me FEEL something.The rest of the film was just there - it just went on, telling one story after another, as flat as DiCaprio's narration tone. And most of the time, I found myself wondering: why is this film so freaking dark? Why do the characters do everything in unnaturally dark environment? I understand that maybe it's some kind of symbolism, but whose office is ever that poorly-lit during working hours? What family eats their dinner in the dark - even with unlit candles on the table? I found myself thinking, why won't you guys just light up those candles already?It was Armie Hammer who managed to bring some soul amidst this history-book-ish storytelling. It was shocking to see his emotions in the hotel scene - I felt truly touched by his performance. It felt like a burst of colours in a monochromatic film. Even in other scenes, he manages to tell a huge part of Tolson's stories, feelings and emotions merely through his eyes. I understood more from his eyes than from the long train of heavy words in DiCaprio's fake-accented narration.In the end, it did keep my attention although it might be because I have a higher tolerance for historical documentaries than most people (as evident by how my friends were already rolling around doing other things a few minutes into the film). And it IS a good story, even though it's being told slowly, heavily, and in darkness... literally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such great starting material and DiCaprio, too...but it's dry choppy and dull!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar (2011)This is a particular kind of movie--the based on fact biopic--done with great attention to period accuracy. If that's what's important, getting a bit of American history into a vivid big screen format, then this works pretty well. On top of that, Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent, very professional.But "J. Edgar" not a terrific movie. If a movie is meant to be gripping and moving and beautiful and fun and all those things, this is none of those. It isn't boring or tepid or clumsy or insulting--but not being those things isn't exactly a compliment. And the reasons for this are clear. Mainly there's the format. Between Dustin Black and Clint Eastwood a decision was made to "tell" the story by means of the character, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, literally telling the story to a typist. This is a dry and painful way of any kind of drama. It's even a boring way to teach a class, and sometimes you get the feeling we're being "taught" things about our history we need to know. Be careful, if you watch only half the movie, you'll be filled with misconceptions that the movie itself corrects, in the last few moments during a final important conversation. That problem of course is a new kind of "unreliable narrator," since the story is being told by the protagonist himself. And no one is very honest, truly, in an autobiography. In a way that makes the movie the most interesting it can be. I'm also not sure what the director and writer really feel about Hoover's sexual orientation, at least as it applied to his doing his job.There are some familiar Eastwood slants on content that might irk a few of you familiar with his politics. For example, he makes very public his appreciation for civil rights and equality, but in a way that's so showy you begin to suspect the motivation (that he believes what he preaches but he also wants you to like him for it). But then he also has little to say about the heavy handed FBI (and pre-FBI) days when lots of innocent people got followed and railroaded and jailed and worse. The mood is set that in those old days things were different and we really needed a megalomaniac at the FBI to keep this darned country safe from the Commies. Something like that.As a drama, which is maybe the secondary consideration, the plot moves between a present day 1960s crisis (between the Kennedy and Nixon years) and the early days. It flips back and forth a lot (too much for me) and keeps DiCaprio's narration flowing right through a lot of it in part to hold it together. The result is fragmented as a story, and stilted as a dramatic flow.Just a heads up on the format and the flow. Again, if it's content you want, and you can enjoy the way it gets cobbled together, there's a lot of stuff here to sort out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Failed Attempt At Presenting A Challenging Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J.Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) ran the Federal Bureau of Investigation for almost fifty years presiding over the modernization of federal crime fighting in the United States in many cases for the better.This unelected civil servant also overstepped his bounds extorting presidents and congressmen for greater funding and special powers with damaging files he held over their heads whilst maintaining a personal life well outside what was socially acceptable in his time.Hoover created a public persona for professional benefit to consolidate greater power which he would continually abuse. He was helped by a number of loyalists including his lover Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer).It is a pretty daunting challenge to take J.Edgar Hoover, one of the biggest weasels in American history and attempt to make him appear vaguely human. But this late in his career and indeed in his life, director Clint Eastwood in all probability sees little worth doing unless it presents a challenge.But he selected a nearly impossible task in trying to portray a vile blackmailer, serial slanderer and mentally-warped political thug as anything other than subhuman. How many stories have you read where the villain was the protagonist? If so can you remember how many of them you found appealing? The challenge became greater when Leonardo DiCaprio was badly miscast as Hoover. The role was well beyond DiCaprio's limited reach. I guess his passable performance in the Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator got him consideration. But he seldom looks convincing portraying Hoover at any age in the man's life in this production.The plot-points featuring Hoover's transvestism and closeted romance with longtime companion Clyde Tolson is hardly something you might trust a director like Clint Eastwood to portray believably. Attempting to do so with heterosexual actors isn't helpful either.The film never believably squares the paradox of Hoover's life - a man who blackmailed others about their sex-lives when exposure of his own would have opened him up for greater scorn and derision. No sense of being an outsider was enough to allow Hoover to feel proper empathy for people he was persecuting.Fiction is unlike fact in that people tend to look to fiction to make some kind of sense. It is a challenge both Eastwood and DiCaprio failed to rise to. As a result good performances by Naomi Watts as Hoover's trusted secretary and Armie Hammer's as Tolson are rendered nonsensical.Neither gives us a sense of how a treacherous individual like Hoover (a nightmare of a work colleague and friend I should think) should command such loyalty. But neither is given enough screen-time to be able to deliver that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither a cohesive nor an illuminating portrait of Hoover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood makes a commendable effort to try and humanize FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in his film J. Edgar, but it is a losing proposition. Eastwood makes all the right moves, but never really succeeds in eliciting sympathy for an unsympathetic man. Appointed by Calvin Coolidge in 1924, J. Edgar Hoover was head of the FBI for 48 years and was dedicated to law enforcement, but became notorious for his harassment of liberals and intellectuals, and his use of threats and blackmail against political leaders including Presidents and other notable political and social figures. As the film opens, Hoover is an old man who wants to make sure that future generations do not think harshly of him and is seen dictating his memoirs to his private secretary Helen Grandy (Naomi Watts). The story is not told in a linear fashion but is episodic in nature, as if it were a "Best of Hoover" compilation. It begins in the 1920's with Hoover's response to eight bombs launched by anarchists directed against prominent individuals in banking and politics. In the ensuing raids, which became known as the Palmer Raids, 10,000 people who had not committed any crime were arrested and many were deported. This singular event began Hoover's reputation for being a "Bolshevik fighter", one that he encouraged and promoted throughout his career, reaching its height in his cooperation with Joe McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee during the anti-Communist crusades of the 1950s. Much of the early part of the film, however, concentrates on Hoover's role in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping in 1932 and the subsequent arrest of Gerhard Hauptmann three years after the event. It was here that the FBI developed modern investigative techniques such as the first national fingerprint registry and a forensics laboratory at the bureau which became models for other law enforcement agencies. Hoover's role as a crime fighter received a boost with the arrest and conviction of some of the more prominent crime figures of the 1930s including John Dillinger. Everyone knew who the G-Men were and Hoover was not averse to self promotion. The screenplay by Dustin Lance Black gives prominence to Hoover's sexuality, though in fact much of it is rumor and speculation. A good part of the film is taken up by Hoover's relationship with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), a man with little qualifications who was appointed as his second in command at the bureau. Tolson became his closest and possibly his only friend and close companion during his lifetime, and the film strongly suggests that they were lovers, though it never states it explicitly.Also prominent in the film is Hoover's relationship with his domineering mother (Judi Dench). Early in the film, his mother tells him that he will become one of the most important men in America and the implication is that he devoted his life to making his mother right, whether or not there were dead bodies strewn along the way. Though some of Hoover's most provocative actions such as his attempt to blackmail Robert Kennedy and his wiretapping and harassment of Martin Luther King are dramatized, his role in COINTELPRO, a covert operation against liberal activists, anti-war groups, and civil rights organizations is not mentioned.Though any role Hoover may have played in the assassination or cover-up of JFK is speculative, the HSCA discovered in 1979 that the FBI had recorded conversations in 1962 and 1963 between various Mafia leaders and their subordinates in which threats to kill JFK and wishes to see him murdered were expressed. Incredibly, Hoover never reported these threats to the Secret Service. Even more disturbingly, he did not mention them to President Kennedy, nor to Robert Kennedy, who was the Attorney General (and Hoover's boss) at the time.Though Eastwood is one of my favorite directors, and I give credit to him for his sensitive handling of the relationship between Hoover and Tolson (except for one melodramatic outburst towards the end), the cumulative effect of the film is neither a cohesive or an illuminating portrait of Hoover, nor is it a compelling source of insight or information about him. While there are some good performances, particularly those by Judi Dench and Armie Hammer, I found Leonardo DiCaprio performance as J. Edgar to be wooden, almost as if he was modeling bitterness while auditioning for acting school.While J. Edgar does show Hoover to be an embittered man who made rigid demands on his staff including spur of the moment firings and embarrassment of employees, it never really takes a stand on his political actions or shows the effects of his bullying and intimidation on the lives of those he viewed as a threat. As a fellow human being, I can relate to Hoover's loneliness and paranoia, but frankly, I have as little interest in Hoover's psychological aberrations as I have in whether Mussolini loved children. What is more important is their impact on the society in which they lived and the legacy they left behind.</fullReview>

His average and below average films, somehow, manage to garner awards and accolades.This film is bad beyond belief. With the sappy and solemn, Heavenly music pulling at your heartstrings, J. Edgar Hoover is portrayed as some sort of Saint worthy of our deepest emotional concern. Hogwash. He was a selfish tyrant that had no redeeming qualities. A hypocrite and a destroyer of lives. To whitewash this monster and turn him into some sort of sympathetic patriot is unforgivable.But even so, given that is your purpose in making a slanted Bio, the film stands alone as an unenlightening failed whatever it is. It fails as a Bio, it fails as an historical retrospective of the forming of a ground-breaking governmental institution, it fails with bad makeup, bad composition, pacing and it just fails completely on all levels of mega-budget movie making.Nothing to recommend, except the next time you see that a movie is directed by Clint Eastwood it may make your day to stay away, or at least approach it with some sort of low expectations and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The memoirs of a repressed homosexual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I applaud that Hollywood has done a movie on J. Edgar. He is such a character in history in that we know his legacy, yet little about the man. Clint Eastwood's "J. Edgar" focuses on both of these aspects. Though both concepts seem to make a promising feature, it does anything but that. The movie jumps around from three different stories/timelines. One is an aging J. Edgar formulating his memoirs. The second is the historic events that a youthful J. Edgar takes part in. The third is both the old and young J. Edgar dealing with the people in his life. These include his mother (Judi Dench), who does not want her son to be a "daffodil," his quiet, loyal secretary (Naomi Watts), and his long time best friend Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). I do not mind that a film is out of order per se, but there is a tendency in this movie that when one event becomes interesting, another one is thrown into my face. The previous scene may not pop back up until an hour later. It is almost as if the screenwriter had too many ideas at once and did not know what to keep, more or less when to get back to an earlier subplot. There is no sense of consistency. As a result, this makes the movie feel slower than faster. Another downer is that some historical events that J. Edgar partook was left out, such as his war against the gangsters, McCarthyism, and his issues with the Kennedy's dirty little secrets. Instead, the plot's focus is thrown on the rumor that J. Edgar was a repressed homosexual. Sure, he lived with a guy for 40 years, but that does not immediately make a man gay. This should be hardly surprising for me since the screenwriter who wrote this also wrote "Milk." Then again, maybe J. Edgar was gay. I don't know. This movie is not terrible though. Leo does not steal the show, for there is a very good supporting cast. Armie Hammer might be looking at a nomination, as could Judi Dench. Leo was decent, but much of his performance reminded me of his earlier work for Scorsese's "The Aviator." His character is very eccentric, particular to detail, paranoid, and even at one-point looks at mirror while saying the same line over and over again. The line though isn't "The way of the future." The makeup design for this film is phenomenal. Whoever is part of that department should win the Oscar. Tom Stern's cinematography is another high point, for like "Changeling," he uses muted colors and dim lighting to capture the lonely, dejecting atmosphere that surrounds the plot. Clint Eastwood's limited music is nice icing added to the cake.Overall though, Clint Eastwood's "J. Edgar" is not so much about the ruthless, power hungry, governmental figure that history has built him up as, but rather a lonesome, determined, repressed homosexual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Life Historical Figure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best that can be said for this film is that it got made. The subject matter, about the life of a dreadfully dull and stodgy old bureaucrat from a bygone era, is not in line with Hollywood's usual mass-produced action films aimed at brash young boys. I credit Director Eastwood and lead actor Leonardo Di Caprio with enough star power to convince the money-men to fund this project. And it turned a profit.But there are plenty of problems with "J. Edgar", not the least of which is a script that flips back and forth too much between the 1960s and earlier decades in Hoover's life. A lot of time is wasted on the gangster era of the 1920 and 30s, possibly because Di Caprio is so youthful looking, he fits a younger image of Hoover, in contrast to an aging old man in the 60s. Almost nothing is included about the JFK assassination and follow-up investigation despite the fact that Hoover played a central role in marketing the "lone-gunman" theory.Throughout, Hoover comes across as bureaucratic, rigid, moralistic, self-righteous, incapable of changing with the times, dishonest, and a hypocrite. Absent from the film are any virtuous qualities he may have had.As Hoover, Leonardo Di Caprio gives a better performance than I would have predicted. But the script does Di Caprio no favors. The dialogue for Hoover consists largely of platitudes and pronouncements. Hoover doesn't talk with people so much as make little speeches to them. And Di Caprio's monotone voice exaggerates this talking down to others effect.Hoover demanded loyalty from his staff. As his private secretary, Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) is an interesting study in forced loyalty. Ditto Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), as Hoover's sidekick.Cinematography is quite dark. Colors are heavily muted, almost monochromatic. Costumes and prod design are convincing across five decades. But makeup for an older Clyde Tolson is horrid; his face looks like a wax figure that's about to melt."J. Edgar" could have been much better, had the script focused more on the sixties and shown Hoover's working relationship to the Kennedy's and Lyndon Johnson. And though I appreciate Di Caprio's efforts to get the film made, a different actor might have been more convincing in the role of Hoover. Still, the film is a reasonably good effort. It's worth watching once, if for no other reason than because it's a true story about a real-life historical figure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was GRAN TORINO the very last film with the legendary Clint Eastwood acting? Yes. Is GRAN TORINO going to be the very last Eastwood film that I get on Blu-Ray/DVD to watch it *again*? Well, maybe. I have yet to see his HEREAFTER (which doesn't have the best reviews out there, by the way), but INVICTUS and now J. EDGAR (both biographical films) left me disappointed and with no desires to add them as soon as possible to my personal collection. It's been almost two years since I watched the film about Nelson Mandela and I haven't felt any need to do it again. I'm sure it will happen the very same with this one, the film about the first director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. However there is a huge difference here, since I did find some truly great things in J. EDGAR. Hell, I LOVED some of them. It is an interesting case, and is almost sad to say that in the end (as a whole) it didn't work for me. First, I will write quickly about Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, since everybody has been talking a lot about it (I think it's a surprise that he wasn't nominated for the Oscar). He is quite fantastic and even tough that he is doing great things should not be news anymore, his interpretation of J. Edgar Hoover as both a young and elderly man is really something to write and talk about. And certainly is also kind of sad that a performance of this caliber is not part of a great picture. So why this isn't something I already want to watch again? There is some criticism towards the choice of showing the personal side of J. Edgar, and not going a bit deeper with FBI issues. I understand that, as indeed J. Edgar *was* the chief of the FBI for more than 30 years so there should be plenty of strong and kind of powerful stories. However, I can't say the film went wrong because of this. For me is more like saying "OK, so you want to show J. Edgar's sentimental side and make of his apparent homosexuality a huge deal. That's great, BUT you better do it right". Actually of all this was a surprise for me. I didn't know a damn thing about J. Edgar nor that the writer of the film was Dustin Lance Black (of MILK fame). The narrative is fine: we see the elderly J. Edgar reviving some of his old stories for the guys who are helping him to do a memoir or something like that, so we move back and forward. So, and again, what went wrong? Simply the execution of some things, as you can tell. Some scenes feel as the parody of the real thing, if that makes sense. And you know what, the makeup went also very f****** wrong! I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I saw that Armie Hammer was here, since I'm a big fan of THE SOCIAL NETWORK. He plays Hoover's right hand Clyde Tolson. And he, together with Naomi Watt's (who goes pretty much without any glory nor bad critics) character Helen Gandy (a highly reliable secretary), grows old together with Hoover. Musician John Mayer said it right (when discussing autotune): "the only time you can ever talk about plastic surgery is akin to the only time you can ever talk about autotune, which is during bad examples of it". Hammer's makeup -unlike DiCaprio's, which makes the case stranger- is akin to a bad plastic surgery! We should not be talking about bad makeup in a Clint Eastwood film! But believe me, this time there is some and frankly it makes some scenes even laughable (like for instance seeing elderly Hoover and Tolson together). But like I said, I did love some things about J. EDGAR. Actually some of it is simply a masterpiece of a damn good and entertaining crime picture. We have the classic story, the classic rise of the genius and visionary man (in this case a man who knew intelligence and science were key factors to deal with crime). Is all very noirish (the "crime of the century" - the kidnap and murdered of Charles Lindbergh's son- is shown), and there's stuff about cinema (how criminals were sort of glorified in movies with, for instance James Cagney. And how Hoover wanted the same glorification for him ? and you have to see what happens when someone say that Hoover didn't kill Dillinger!). So in a way, and for a fan of crime pictures like myself, with all of this there's nothing much to ask for; there's even a really interesting turn of events by the end. It is really clever. Maybe all of this L.A. NOIRE-kind of thing makes me revisit at some point this strange case for Mr. Eastwood. *Watched it on the big screen on January 17, 2012</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dull film so dark could hardly see it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is with this current trend by some directors of filming like they think they are inventing chiaroscuro? This all-in-darkness, rather than being chic, is instead incredibly and disruptively frustrating -- and overdone. You want to see what they are giving you in the picture but you can't, physically can't. Details lost. Got "brightness" controls turned up as high as they will go but could only visually see probably about 50-60% of the movie (maybe I'm exaggerating, but it feels like that).So guess I need to rate it as a radio show. As such, it's pretty dismal. No really decent dialogue, and Edgar's odd speech accent was very inconsistent. And there was really not much of a screenplay. Took a couple agency cases, and some Edgar comments to show how the agency was his development and how much he embellished. And sure, we get an injection of alleged quirky Edgar highlights or what Eastwood might imagine them to be. But even this was done shallowly, woodenly (and what was that with his secretary early on, for example? Like a totally different character.) And the whole back and forth in time thing failed in part because it wasn't always clear in the darkness of the film which Edgar we were looking at (young or old).In short, it took me more than one try to make it through this movie which was a dark, dry, unenlightened muddle. Three stars because, hey, it's better than Killer Tomatoes on the Moon type movies, from what I could see of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Gem From Eastwood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting ridicule, vilification, or even justification, this would be the wrong movie to watch on J. Edgar Hoover.Eastwood delivers a dark brooding, and rather objective look at one of the most controversial and polarizing figures in America. While the story itself may not be overly compelling, it does offer explanations behind some of the motivations that made up the man, John Edgar Hoover. The cinematography was a ...crucial element in creating and maintaining throughout a sense of secrecy, brooding, alienation, as well as distance. The chronology is disparate and effective: at times we see Hoover dictating his memoirs to an array of journalists and then we are taken back to the time in question, all the while framed in this overcast mood that fits the film and its subject matter perfectly. As a matter of fact, the manner in which this was filmed constitutes, to me, the biggest indication of Eastwood's opinion one way or the other - Hoover was a dark man with some even darker secrets.J.Edgar's homosexuality as well as his proclivity for cross-dressing are only suggested and are handled with the utmost sensitivity. There is one scene which strongly implies his helplessness with his desires to cross-dress that was simply quite touching. And the relationship between Hoover and Tolson was beautifully written. No, I did not come away feeling empathy/sympathy for Hoover at all; neither were any of my perceptions surrounding him challenged in the least. I did leave the film however with surely a more heightened sense of his humanity.This could NOT have been accomplished however, were it not for the positively riveting performance by Di Caprio. This guy can just ACT, okay? The other supporting players were equally excellent, most notably, Judi Dench who played his overbearing mother, Naomi Watts as his faithful secretary, Helen Gandy, and Armie Hammer, as Hoover's lifelong companion, Clyde Tolson. Some of the movie's most compelling scenes involved these three and all three gave powerhouse supporting performances to match Di Caprio.I highly recommend as yet another excellent outing from a very good director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'J. Edgar' is a flawed film to be sure but despite it's flaws the film is a success at creating an engaging character study. The real J. Edgar Hoover is by far one of the most controversial American figure of the last century. It is the opinion of this reviewer and I am sure a lot of people going into the film that he was as dangerous as the constant Bolshevik menace he devoted a career trying to "protect" us from. I don't know what I wanted going into the film but I had a tremendous fear that Eastwood would be too sympathetic Hoover. What is interesting is that Eastwood has created a very matter of fact film about Hoover. We see a deeply flawed man with a lot of demons but also with a fiery passion. It is an immensely interesting portrayal if not anything else. If Hoover is portrayed as heroic in the film it is through his own eyes and this was entirely satisfying as a viewer. What Eastwood and DiCaprio do exceptionally well is explore why J. Edgar needed to be seen as this American hero. DiCaprio has emerged as a true talent. I've always admired DiCaprio to a certain extent but I've never really truly thought he challenged himself as an actor. I think Scorcese played into his comfort areas as he constructs roles for him and he is good to be sure but I question how compelling he is other than say a performance like 'The Aviator'. With films like 'Inception' and now even more so in 'J.Edgar' DiCaprio has earned the right in my eye to be considered one of the Hollywood greats. This is a very complex and worthy performance which brings DiCaprio to his utmost vulnerability as an actor. This is his strength and I wish to see more from him. He has been given a great character objective to play, to show strength to the point of hiding a man who is completely insecure and this man has violent power at his disposal. The film's greatest flaw is it's inconsistent script. Which feels choppy and doesn't know really where to begin or end. The entire film feels very episodic without a consistent whole. I don't necessarily mind this as some of the episodes are very very interesting but the film can't really have a central narrative or thematic message with this script. The script has a very hard time defining what J.Edgar stood for. Dustin Lance Black wrote the brilliant 'Milk' which has a very clear dynamic character with a very clear defined goal who places life or death stakes in his message. J.Edgar is not a dynamic character but wears the false trappings of being dynamic. He is goal is to use his secret police force to rule the country as he sees fit with a very broad and ever changing bold definition of Americanism and Anti-Communism and yet we have the ever fascinating sex life he hid in the shadows. Black has a lot to balance and he drops the ball a few times. The transitions feel awkward and choppy and we spend more time on the Lindbergh kidnapping than necessary. He uses Edgar's mother as a convenient and lazy plot device to explain too many of his motives and insecurities. Despite this however the individual scenes are interesting and compelling even though they often do not have a unifying arch behind them.J.Edgar's deeply closeted homosexuality is the major theme of this film and what it wants to explore. It is handled quite well. The fact is we do not know the extent of what might or might not have gone on between Colson and Hoover. Black and Eastwood had full freedom to explore the character as freely as they wanted and yet we get a very restrained look. It would be far too easy for the film to show Hoover cross dressing in gay orgies and then hating himself afterwards. What we get is a real and often very tragic love story. In Colson Hoover has a partner with deep love that can never be physically consummated because of Hoover's insecurities and because Hoover despises the act of sex. History is not always fair and we want to believe that Hoover whose G-Men and wires spied on the bedrooms of great mean and women hated himself for a social taboo and for not acting on his great love. This is an immensely satisfying approach to the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leo DiCaprio does a fine job as the famous Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. The film isn't the usual left-wing bias against Hoover, although it isn't flattering either.Overall, I think it paints the picture pretty well and is a good period of the 1930s, although we often go forward to the Sixties, too. It goes back-and-forth and features the man's fight to get the FBI improved and fitted properly, his ego and relationship with best-friend Clyde Tolson. Those expecting to see Hoover portrayed as gay will be disappointed. It is Tolson, not Hoover, who is gay.To me, the main attraction of this film was the acting. Arnie Hammer as "Tolson" was terrific and I didn't even recognize Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy. That's how convincing she (and the makeup department) was in her role. Between those two, DiCarprio, and other characters it made for a realistic-sounding and looking film. Don't look for a lot of shoot-em-up FBI action scenes; those aren't here but this dialog-driven film is interesting start-to-finish. It's a well-made film, particularly if you don't go into it with any agenda of your own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hope this is was one of those movies that Clint Eastwood makes just to pay for his "Great" movies like "Gran Torino," or "Million Dollar Baby," because if not, he is going in a horrible direction.J. Edgar Hoover lived an extraordinary life and wielded power, and secrets very few have ever held. It should follow that a man like this would create a biopic's dream. With Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role and Clint Eastwood calling the Sots one would think this would be an epic masterpiece. Instead we get this, an epic fail!DiCaprio gives a career killing piece of overacting, a horribly fake accent, over speaking, and too much dialog that we have only seen from a few has been actors such as Nicholas Cage and Val Kilmer ( 2 other people that have overacted their way into a new B-list career). You would think that after "Inception," and "The Departed," 2 very good films, that Dicaprio could do know wrong, but evidently he can. If he was the best choice for the lead than I guess the studio was counting on his star power to dupe people into the theater for this pile of junk. With any luck, Eastwood will take the pile of cash made off this movie and parlay it into something watchable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History vs. Hollywood...BEWARE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to go on the record saying that this is NOT a documentary. There are MANY parts of this movie that are not documented or backed as fact. Please do NOT go to this movie to learn history. This is Hollywood and don't forget it! That being said, I can comfortably give you a review. John Edgar Hoover was depicted as a ruthless, unfeeling, cold-hearted Napoleon. Had he have had the ability, he would have been a dictator. However, he did bring the FBI into existence and raised the level of expectations and performance to the highest level possible. Unfortunately, this was not done without suspect measures. J. Edgar compiled information about many powerful public figures, including presidents, in order to gain more power himself. As a side note, but a major focus of the movie, as J. Edgar led the FBI in fights against Communism and corruption such as The Mob, he struggled with his own apparent homosexuality. Leonardo DiCaprio was shown as the young J. Edgar and aged with a significant amount of make up. At first, this was unsettling, but you quickly stopped paying attention to it until Armie Hammer aged in the movie. Armie played Clyde Tolson, J. Edgar's implied significant other. J. Edgar constantly kept Tolson at arm's length, which appeared to be a continuous struggle for him. Back to the make-up...Hammer's make-up consisted of so much putty that he could barely move his mouth, eyes, or forehead (no, I don't think he's had Botox yet!). Given this, he can't act! (Remember Cher from BURLESQUE?) It's truly impossible. The saving grace of this movie was Judy Dench. She was wonderful! Such power and strength in this character! Apparently, J. Edgar was a mama's boy and with the overbearing mother Judy Dench played, it's no wonder J. Edgar struggled with who he was and who he wanted to be.This was a LONG movie! 137 minutes! Tack on 20 minutes of previews (which I'm usually late for!) and now you're at 2 hours 17 minutes. Too long. I was frequently bored. I found myself looking at the set design and make-up, for goodness sake! And then there was Robert Kennedy played by Jeffrey Donovan. I grew up on the East Coast and I have NO idea what that accent was that he tried to do! I think with the amount of acting I saw, a cardboard cut out could have saved the budget of J. EDGAR a lot! I'm being harsh, I know. But the most interesting thing about this movie were the aspects that were factual: J. Edgar began using forensics to prove guilt; he began finger-printing; he started the FBI; and he was feared by many.I expected so much more from Clint Eastwood given that one of my favorite movies was Gran Torino. WHAT HAPPENED??? I've also come to the conclusion that most of the movies that Leonardo DiCaprio is in have the following effects on me: 1. drowsiness 2. confusion 3. anticipation of death. (Please read as "I can't wait for him to die in the movie.") (Revolutionary Road, The Aviator, Inception, Titanic, and now J. Edgar)I'd skip this one. If you're a fan of J. Edgar Hoover, love and KNOW history (so that you can discriminate between fact and fiction), then wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

Edgar. Presenting Leonardo DiCaprio in one of his weakest portrayals yet is a hard venture for such a talented actor. While DiCaprio nails the mannerisms and in some ways, captures the pain stricken tortured soul persona of Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, he cannot elevate the limp and uncertain material written by Academy Award winning writer Dustin Lance Black. Armie Hammer as the close "friend" Clyde, delivers a best-in-show performance while maintaining a calm and believable work at all times. Even the great Judi Dench as the overbearing mother is a casualty to Eastwood's repetitive and sluggish direction and Black's flimsy words. Naomi Watts remains on the outskirts of the film feeling unnatural and unneeded. Solid art direction and costumes are not enough to save the film from its inevitable demise. J. Edgar remains and will be remembered by many as the most disappointing delivery by a veteran director from 2011.(**)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the adult life of J Edgar Hoover, the founder and head of the Federal bureau of Investigation.I was unfamiliar with the life of J Edgar Hoover before watching this film. hence, this biopic would require more than usual to keep me interested. Fortunately, Leonardo DiCaprio's superb acting has engaged me throughout. Aspects of Hoover's personality is enacted in a convincing manner. The most memorable scene for me is his anxiety around women when he was asked to dance. His subsequent conversation with his mother is also memorable, as bravery to embrace himself takes hold of him. Even though he is negated by his mother, it is satisfactory to see that Hoover continues to thrive in his professional life and come to terms with his personal life.Clint Eastwood has a gift for making powerful and touching films. "J Edgar" touches the viewers especially the parts regarding his personal life towards the end of the film. Though this film may not be as touching or poignant as Eastwood's other recent efforts that I have seen, "J Edgar" is still a touching biopic about a remarkable man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly Underrated Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films that came out in 2011, it seems like no one has seen or talks about the latest Clint Eastwood picture, J. Edgar. This film, which is based off the life of FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover, is a really good film which people don't give credit for. The film is well-acted, well-directed, and strikes some emotional notes. The only thing I really didn't like is how the makeup was done. I thought it was pretty bad, especially on Leo.Clint Eastwood's film is a depiction of the controversial life of J. Edgar Hoover. The movie explores how he got his fame as the first FBI Director. The movie also explores his relationships with his mother and Clyde Tolson, his assistant director at the FBI.Over the years, Leonardo DiCaprio has matured into a very fine actor. Who would of thought the guy who played the fresh-faced Jack in Titanic would play J.Edgar Hoover fourteen years later. He really played a gutsy performance here. Armie Hammer is a rising young name and he is a guy to watch out for. Judi Dench is really good as usual as Hoover's mother.Overall, this is another great Eastwood film to boast about. However, it seems many people do not agree with me. I disliked the makeup as it really made the actors look quite ugly. But the acting, subtle direction, and a great musical score by Eastwood makes this a great film to watch. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie last night on cable. I never made it to the theatre to see it, but that's par for the course these days. I've read a few of the reviews here and skimmed over a few more and it's apparent that the feelings are pretty well split. Is it a GREAT movie, no, but it's a GOOD movie.Someone said it could have been a better movie if it had concentrated on all the FBI became under Hoover. Well, the movie isn't the story of the FBI, it's the story of HOOVER. There are countless films, documentaries and shorts about the FBI so if you want to know it's origins and how it evolved, the resources are there. This was a movie about J. Edgar Hoover, the MAN who built the FBI and although the Bureau is a significant part of the story, it's not THE story, he is.Poetic license has to be taken at times and as someone else pointed out, this guy ran the FBI for a hell of a long time and lived a bit longer than that. To get EVERYTHING in would have been a very long movie or a miniseries that might never have been made. It touched nicely on highlights and though at times the jumping back and forth was a tad tedious, it moved the story along and did present the entire story as a 'look back'.I don't think the film had an agenda as pro and anti gay. It showed a man struggling with his identity and as someone else pointed out, not really sure who he was, aside from DIRECTOR of the FBI. He was solid in that identity for sure. He had his flaws and his drawbacks and was socially awkward unless talking about his beloved Bureau. He achieved great things despite all his flaws but he sometimes allowed his strengths to get the better of him (secret files for example). We would not have the FBI we have today if not for him and I believe Clint Eastwood shows proper respect to this guy, for all his flaws.DiCaprio was brilliant. Hammed his way through this? HOW? How else would someone have played J. Edgar without becoming a charactiture? The rest of the cast did a fine job as well and Eastwood's direction was fine. I can't see how it could have been done better and still present the subject as well.I liked the movie and recognize that not all films were meant to be extravaganzas, blockbusters, art-house or indy films nor do they have to present a messege. Just tell a story, tell it well and entertain us. This film did just that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I could sit through a biographical film, but this film was a special exception. I found Clint Eastwood's dramatization of the life of the founder of the FBI to be tastefully done with an intriguing cast of characters. Leonardo DiCaprio, one of my favorite actors, plays the title role of J. Edgar Hoover who was the revered and feared founder and leader of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. DiCaprio's performance is quite riveting and thrilling to watch as he takes on making the character of the man who was trying to hide his secrets from the rest of the world with such power and dignity as only DiCaprio can give. Armie Hammer who plays Hoover's faithful right-hand man, Clyde Tolson, is a welcome presence in a cast of known actors. He is a soothing presence to DiCaprio's at times raging Hoover (Tolson himself stayed a faithful companion to Hoover till Hoover died in 1972). Both men light up the screen in their scenes together as both past and present versions of themselves (both wore prosthetic makeup to have an elderly appearance). It's a fascinating biography of Hoover's life and is a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but falls short of great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was J. Edgar Hoover gay? Was he a patriot, a Fascist, a tyrant, a hero, or all of the above? These are all popular questions. But one that I really like to ask, hypothetical it may be, is what would he have done if he had today's information technology at his disposal. That is one question, unfortunately, to which there will be no answer.Not a few critics suggest that Clint Eastwood has been too sympathetic to Hoover in "J. Edgar". Some take a less critical view that what Eastwood has done is only depicting Hoover as a person, with no intention of condoning his action. As a matter of fact, Eastwood hasn't even dwelled to much on the actions that, over the several decades and eight presidencies, earning Hoover his dubious reputation. Rather, he examines Hoover in an intimate scale, in his relationship with the people surrounding him: domineering mother Judi Dench), life-long deputy and generally alleged lover Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), life-long (again!) personal secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) being the three most prominent ones. His work in moulding the modern-day FBI is underlined first and foremost in his determined belief in scientific forensic investigation techniques.I cannot move on to discuss the cast without first mentioning the makeup crew ? they are artists and magicians, both. If you consider how the movie moves briskly back and forth 4 decades, you'll appreciate the excellence of their work. In particular, one is moved to say a silent prayer that in real life, Watts will age as gracefully as she appears on screen in this movie.Of the three key supports mentioned above, Dench has the simplest (it seems insulting to use the word "easiest") job, in portraying a mother that, in one critic's words, "Normal Bates would recognize". Watt's role is sometimes undermined by critics. Indeed, Helen Gandy has been true to her words right from the beginning, to the effect that all she is interested in is her work (as opposed to romance). But in addition to being a loyal personal secretary, Gandy to an extent also serves as Hoover's conscience, an impossible and thankless job. While Watt's screen time is disappointingly short, her performance is inspiring, particularly the scene when Gandy promised Hoover that he need not worry about his secret files when he dies. Of the three Hammer is the best due partly of course to the fact that he has been given the opportunities to shine. And shine he did. This actor who played a double role as the twins in "The Social Network" brings out just the right amount of charm in the dashingly handsome and jovial young recruit without overdoing, and then excels in portraying Tolson in old age carrying four decades of complex relationship with Hoover.DiCarprio did a good job with Hoover but stop short of excellence, due to a large measure to the fact that actor DiCarprio has not been completely successful in losing himself in character Hoover. Make a comparison with Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Capote" (2005) and this is only too obvious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film about a hate figure portrayed favourably.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonardo DiCaprio has evolved as an actor beyond any expectation. His portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover was convincing in both his youth and old age. The film explores the private life of J.Edgar and controversially shows him in a rather sympathetic light. Although he is flawed and comes across as an awkward technocrat with delusions of granduear, he still manages to excel in his career and maintain personal relationships with the ones he cares for. The supporting cast does a great job playing their characters in both their younger and older versions, also the costumes and sets look beautiful without distracting. Unfortunately the make-up isn't always brilliant when a younger actor is made to look older, particularly the character Clyde suffers from a severe case of cake-face when he's shown as an older man. A beautiful film directed by Clint Eastwood, yet many will feel uncomfortable seeing a hate figure like J.Edgar Hoover portrayed so favourably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Eastwood crafts a very revealing biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was irritated and aggravated by J Edgar Hoover's character before the first reel was over, and wondered what Mr Eastwood was going to reveal until one scene, involving Helen Gandy, demonstrated how an artistic director like him does his work. In a few short seconds he had said much more to me than a script of a thousand words ever could.And so it was with the rest of this very worthy work, which, coupled with some steady if not inspired acting, does what it says on the tin. We are not force fed, or even, by the end, asked to believe everything we see, another inspirational piece of writing and directing.I'll admit to being a fan of Mr Eastwood, and his ability to unpick characters before our very eyes as in many of his previous films, especially the brilliantly made "Million Dollar Baby". From Rowdy Yates through spaghetti, Dirty Harry, and his very diverse output since, he has a knack of getting one line messages across, or ten seconds of vital information in a carefully choreographed scene. His soundtracks have also gone from strength to strength. I'll not discredit him by calling him a genius, but refer to him as a master of his artistic craft.In J Edgar he interfaces important detail with much that is required to make the film move forwards. It is fitting that in a film about the founder and head of the FBI should contain such forensic detail and information about the character who made it possible. Eastwood knows a lonely man with self destruct capability probably because he knows how close he has been to it at times in his life. He also knows weakness and the bully in many, if not all, of us. He expresses vulnerability so simply and easily it is very hard not to pick up the messages he sends and for that I believe he should be both praised and admired.Not quite the perfect film but very close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J Edgar Is A Very Ambitious Film But It Does Not Stand In The Best Biopics Maybe Because I Don't Want To Hear About Hoover's Life From Hoover Himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot:-NO-SPACE-FOR-IT!It is quite a challenge remembering J Edgar's plot, and in spite of watching the film twice, when I began mentally recapitulating the film, closing my eyes, from scene one (a practice I generally adopt before writing my review), I took quite a while to put down the narrative in my head and I'm still not completely sure of the sequence. I guess the abundance of low key lighting that roughly 50-60% of the visibility may be one reason for this (one usually retains more of an image in the presence of light), but there are other possibilities. History is thick in matter and can be a challenge to remember, and J Edgar has quite some information, combined with flashbacks and flash-forwards to make it slightly harder to keep track of. Another factor may be the distractions and diversions of insignificant importance like two separate scenes at a cinema hall showing the public perception of cops and criminals, Hoover's encounter with Shirley Temple, Hoover's mother Annie shedding a tear watching news of baby Lindbergh's kidnapping etc. Sound cues have been used, sometimes very subtly to shift, back and forth in time and so I at least wasn't confused while watching the film, though I do have to say I was thrown off-balance when the movie's direction began immediately with the first frame itself (staying true to Hoover's nickname and approach towards work: speedy). Additionally, the lack of sufficient build-up in any of the separate subplots makes it difficult in remembering the connecting events. The subplot involving Roosevelt and Hoover suffers the worst, proving the least interesting and effective of all. It is hard to shed tears over the death of a man like J Edgar Hoover; he was too arrogant, dictatorial and Machiavellian to gain anybody's sincere sympathy. Dustin Lance Black, the writer of J Edgar, had no option but to direct the spotlight on FBI director Hoover's soft side: his alleged homosexual liaisons with Associate Director of FBI Clyde Tolson. In doing so, Black had to fictionalize encounters between the two men behind closed doors, just as writer Peter Morgan did for the royal family in his 2006 film The Queen. As a result, our flagellation of Hoover's outer personality is offset to an extent by pity for the man's highly repressed and hollow personal life. Tears still do not well up in our eyes when Tolson finds his lover lifeless on the bedroom floor, yet at that moment we do not hold any condemnation towards Hoover for his past deeds. I would have actually shed a tear or two, but I so wished Armie Hammer's (who played Tolson) tough-as-concrete makeup cracked to reveal a more prominent expression of sadness; sadly, the makeup remained tight as ever and I was kept tearless both the times I watched the film.While Leonardo's transformation into elderly Hoover succeeds, it is Hammer's and Gandy's faces which are problematic, especially Hammer's. While the young actor does some usual tricks to show aging effect for his character, his makeup reduces his handsome face to that of Frankenstein's. Naomi Watts' character Gandy is dry and doughy and so is her makeup, and it's a bit surprising the hugely talented (just go watch Mulholland Drive) actress took the part, considering how one-note the entire role is. Washing the make-up off, if Leonardo's and Armie's performances are solely considered, then it's a completely different matter. Leonardo is not repeating an act done in his previous films (as some detractors have accused him of taking similar roles) but bringing out similar qualities at varying degrees through different personalities; it is inevitable that 'pride' and 'ambition' are certain qualities consistent for most leading male characters, but depending on the character and his personality, the degree to which the qualities are visible differs. So Leo in Revolutionary Road and Hoover in J Edgar may show anger, but I do see the difference among the two roles because the actor is versatile enough to play both characters with conviction. So there is no need for him to 'break his habits' as long as Leo brings his unique screen presence and satisfyingly portrays his character. And though not fully realized as say Streep's Margaret Thatcher in Iron Lady, Leo's presence and conviction do a wonderful job in bringing Hoover's personality on screen. Also, I can say that very few actors bring passion on screen as well as Di Caprio; I thought it was just with Kate, then after watching Inception I realized it was with any lady, but after seeing J Edgar I say he can also romance men keeping the same amount of passion. And though Armie Hammer's act as elderly Tolson fails mainly because of his makeup, he effortlessly brings sexual tension on screen with subtle expressions as the young Tolson. J Edgar is without a doubt a very, very ambitious film that uses a lot of information, narrative camera sound and lighting techniques but I would not count it in the best biographical films. As I have not seen many biopics, I will not cite with certainty why I feel this way and again put forth the different probabilities. One reason, and a major one is that in films like J Edgar and Iron Lady, we see and hear about the lives mostly from the viewpoint of the characters on whom the biopic is based while some of the best biopics (at least in my opinion) such as The Queen, The King's Speech, The Social Network, Jodha Akbar keep the narrative more unrestricted. In fact, the Queen is pretty straightforward yet extremely memorable because we see the lead character actively respond to a situation and in the process showing endurance and discovering something about herself. This maybe the reason why I would not place J Edgar in the best biographical films: I may not want to see or hear about J Edgar from the man's own account of his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mysterious Man and Even More Mysterious Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this film for quite some time, seeing as it would detail the life of one of history's most prolific and infamous figures. The film has been lambasted somewhat for a number of reasons. One complaint is the make-up, and I honestly don't see what the big deal was. Looked more or less as good as any other Hollywood film. DiCaprio's performance is pretty damn good, giving our title character a powerful appearance but also subtle touches of weakness. Naomi Watts is pretty good in the film, and Armie Hammer isn't bad at all. The acting was class act material.To my dismay some even critique the trademark Eastwood lighting. You kidding me, he's been lighting his films like this for a while now (and arguably used in some of his best works) and all of a sudden now people are up and complaining. I don't understand it. See as the film dips into some of America's darkest moments, its fitting that shade be used. Plus it adds mystique and adds a vintage feel to the images.I suppose a lot of the criticism is aimed at Dustin Lance Black's writing for the homosexual underpinnings within the film. History does give evidence to this, but Eastwood doesn't make it flamboyant or a joke, he mires it in subtlety. One point I do agree on is that the film does shift focus uneasily at times but to me it simply needed to be longer. Knowing Eastwood I doubt that there will be a director's cut, but as it is I enjoyed every second of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: J. Edgar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amateur history buffs will find joy in discovering the many historical milestones that Eastwood had peppered in the film, thanks to Dustin Lance Black's story that captures key events that J Edgar Hoover and his agency had inevitably had a role to play in, as we follow how they struggle from their relatively humble origins to become one of the best funded in country, sowing the seeds as one of the few professionally run, reputed investigation agencies in the world. And at times you'd just wonder if Hoover was actually the right man for the job, willing to bend the rules, and seek out advantages that may not always be legal or morally right, such as the much suspected and speculative theory of him compiling naughty dossiers on prominent people so as to bring about personal advantages and one upmanship against any leader who has the potential of disagreeing with his views.Then there's also the ensemble of historical characters making their way to this film, such as the Charles Lindbergh (Josh Lucas) whose kidnapped son became the catalyst Hoover needed to consolidate and expand his range of powers, Jeffrey Donovan as Robert Kennedy, the presidents of Dwight Eisenhower (Gunner Wright), Franklin Roosevelt (David A. Cooper), and Christopher Shyer as Richard Nixon right down to the swear word he uses, child star Shirley Temple (Emily Alyn Lind) and Judi Dench playing Anna Marie Hoover, the motherly figure who occupies such a prominent role and influence in her son's life. In some ways the costuming and make up departments of the film were unjustifiably robbed of at least some Oscar nominations from this year's awards season, since they did an incredible job in making everyone look their very best like the characters, and coming up with a range of looks for the key figures in the film as we follow them through the most parts of their lives.And as if the engaging story that's focused on the more operational functions of the FBI and J Edgar's influence in leading the Bureau to operate the way he wants it to be run, coupled with getting credited for bringing cutting edge forensic science and technology of the time to the Bureau, some which are taken for granted in investigations of today, Eastwood balances the film with insights into Hoover's personal life and even sexual orientation which had always been the subject of speculation. A fair bit gets put into examining Hoover's relationships with his close inner circle of trusted associates, such as Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) his confidential secretary and Clyde Tolson (Arnie Hammer) who eventually became his closest ally in the Bureau's fight against crime and his rumoured lover, that it pokes some serious holes into the gung ho persona of a crimebuster, and showed the more vulnerable side of the man.These will include the innuendos spouted when in the privacy of his companion Tolson, as well as the much talked about necessity (or otherwise) in having to show J Edgar in drag, which I felt had tested the spectrum of Leonardo DiCaprio's acting skills and his recent snub at being nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars is keenly felt. And credit has to go to the star for taking up challenging roles in his choice of films to date, here having to portray a man who has dedicated his life to the building of an agency, to (at least to him) the fervent domestic defense of his country against external threats in whatever form they may ta1ke, and yet having to repress his innermost feelings and desires because it's the right thing to do, and not go against his much adored mom, nor want to stain the reputation of his office at a time where skeletons were still best kept in the closet.But while credit has to go to DiCaprio, I felt that Arnie Hammer also did an equivalent of a job as Tolson, having to be the counterfoil to the more volatile J Edgar, and also being a witness to a series of historical events that will come back to haunt the growingly inconsistent FBI head honcho. It will be interesting to track this star's progress from The Social Network where he played twins, to next year's The Lone Ranger as he takes on the titular character. Naomi Watts had an important character role to play, but was ultimately shelved from anything more interesting once her character ditched the early opportunity to be married, only to be so to her job, and the painstaking moments both she and Edgar share even when she disagrees with the methods her boss employs.Clint Eastwood may be getting along in years, yet possesses so much energy to helm films, to direct and produce, as well as to come up with the score for his movies' soundtracks, that it's really quite remarkable that he would be able to sustain working with a group out there to make the best possible out of their little film. You may have seen Hoover in or mentioned in many films from time to time, but I'd bet that nothing has yet so far given him far a film focused on his exploits that's bound to polarize audiences toward the film. It's not the movie's role to set the record straight or be definitive in its account, but herein lies the purpose in showing how people tend to skew accounts to their benefit of course.Told in a timeline that jumps into flashbacks, J. Edgar has all the ingredients necessary for it to become a great bio-pic, and told in the way only Clint Eastwood knows how, to engage, entertain and provoke some thought into the legacy of a man who had founded an institution. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>23 years after Bird, director Clint Eastwood went back to the biopic genre focusing his attention on a certainly fascinating person, who is rounded by a diffuse cloud of urban legends which should be dissipated: John Edgar Hoover (1895-1972), director of the F.B.I. from 1924 to 1972 (in fact, it could be said that he was its founder, because the "Investigation Bureau" was a minor branch of the Justice Department back in that time), who is more famous because of his legendary paranoia and rumored homosexuality than because of his genuine achievements. The film J. Edgar tried to show us Hoover's multiple facets, but in its effort of moving away from the morbidity and the scandal, it ends up being too bland and cold in order to capture us into its diffuse narrative.The screenplay from J. Edgar constantly jumps forward and backward through time, visiting important moments in Hoover's career, but refusing many times to bring us the necessary context in order to appreciate the main character's evolution (or corruption) through time. It seems that this film was exclusively made for scholars of Hoover; or maybe to people around Eastwood's age who lived the events portrayed in the film in the news. But as a casual spectator, I felt frequent frustration for not finding the narrative thread to give the story cohesion. The impression J. Edgar left on me was the one of one of those biographies from History Channel, in which the narrated passages were deleted and only the actors' recreation is left. The result is moderately interesting...but also incomplete and not very satisfactory.Leonardo DiCaprio brings a brilliant performance in the leading role, and he is well complemented by the solid works from Judi Dench, Naomi Watts and specially Armie Hammer. Those performances are the main reason why I consider J. Edgar worthy of a slight recommendation. However, when the movie ended, I was left with the impression that if I had only read Hoover's biography during some minutes on Wikipedia, the effect on me would have been absolutely the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film got everything right except for the most important bit: the cast. The sets, the score, the costumes, everything evokes the period (rather long) that is meant to be evoked, but everyone, repeat everyone, including Judi Dench seems miscast. DiCaprio does not -- despite the layers of false flesh under which he is smothered -- have the gravitas to play Hoover,and everything about him, beginning with his voice, has a false ring to it. At times, the production had the feel of a well-funded school play, earnest but inept. I wish they had simply hired different actors to play the young/old characters rather than add an extra jowl there, or unconvincing slouch here, to convince us of the lead actors' virtuosity. I didn't feel I got any deep insights into the personality of either Hoover or, the people to whom he was closest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" We must bend a few laws in order to Protect the Country "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" J. Edgar " is a new Film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood who's reputation is already made with such films as 'Unforgiven' and 'Gran Terrino.' In this offering Mr. Eastwood tackle's the mundane and luck-luster life of the F.B.I foremost lifetime Director. Interspersing his early life as an inconspicuous agent, the audience observes that he is more interested in Fashion, Facial appearance and fear-mongering than criminal apprehension. Though he is seen as an innovator, his twisted and often paranoid beliefs that America is forever being invaded and over-run with communists and foreign elements, the audience is given a subdued version of his private and controversial life-style. Great care was invested to make sure that Hoover's (Leonardo DiCaprio) crime-fighting endeavors were foremost to his career. Downplayed were Hoovers' efforts to hide his life-time Homosexuality with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) which is painted with light strokes, verbal innuendos and hand holding. Gone are the real life efforts to deal with Organize Crime, Political Coruption and the personal conflicts with the Kennedys. The one actress which stole the show was Judi Dench (James Bond's boss), who's portrayal of Hoover's domineering mother, leaves little doubt where Hoover acquired his feminine side. The movie is a ping-pong feature which bounces from early FBI to the twilight years with the bureau. In the end, one concedes that Hoover must have been at odds with himself, but only Tolson who knew him better than anyone, could help Mr.Eastwood provide the missing parts of the story. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover... but don't expect a history lesson!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood returns after the critically panned 'Hereafter' with a film that was bound to put him back on his high horse. 'J. Edgar' is an epic yet intimate portrait of one of the most notorious and powerful men in 20th century America. It also stars Leonardo DiCaprio who has seemed to be churning out one great performance after the other in the last 5 years. All of these factors has pointed J. Edgar towards the Oscars but it recently received no nominations and garnered mixed reviews from audiences and critics alike. Let me tell you my version of the truth...When reviewing a film like J. Edgar, it is best to start with the films successes. Rather than telling the story like a solid historical film that details the history of the FBI (and consequently, around 40 years of American political history!), it focuses on J. Edgar Hoover (DiCaprio) as a person and his often tragic journey through life with his colleague, friend and possible love interest, Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). The film finds it's emotional core by showing the relationship between Hoover and Tolson; Hoover will never openly admit any feelings for Clyde and it's the suppressed feelings that come through in DiCaprio's astonishing performance that give the film a true heart. We are not seeing imitation but true expression and embodiment of character when DiCaprio plays Hoover. Every precise detail about him has been researched, with his character traits and obsessions coming out with extreme subtlety whenever DiCaprio is on screen.Eastwood is balancing a biopic, a love story and a brief overview of Hoover's FBI department over a 50 year period. This is a hard task to handle and the films shortcomings are seen in the moments when the movie isn't sure what it's trying to be. The production design is very realistic despite the drab, dull colours, but it shows a great authenticity as America looked very dull back in the 1930's. Additionally, the make-up department has unfortunately done a half hearted job on this film, as a fraction of the fantastic performances by DiCaprio and Hammer are hidden under the thick layers of prosthetic false skin. However, none of these points are of such importance that it stops 'J. Edgar' from reaching it's full potential as a film.Because of the large time period it occupies, the script by Dustin Lance Black (writer of the Oscar winning 'Milk') occasionally struggles but never loses focus of the force that is Hoover. From the start of the picture, his determination and focus is made very clear, something which is kept consistent throughout the picture. Additionally, Black explores some incredibly human sides to Hoover; Watch out for a scene where he tries to tell his mother of his sexual orientation or DiCaprio's perfectly realised reaction to a fight between Hoover and Tolson. It is a performance which is certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination and with only nine nominations (rather than the usual ten) for best picture this year, this film should certainly have been given a chance.Clint Eastwood has made his best film since 2008's 'Gran Torino' with 'J. Edgar' and even though it brushes over many facts to get to the story behind the man himself, it is a very beautifully realised story. Leonardo DiCaprio boasts one of his best performances, the film is very well made and despite the balancing act the it has to maintain, Eastwood does a good job of rounding everything up for a fitting ending. There are moral messages about America in this picture that can still apply to today's society but the most important message running through the heart of the film is that love will always be far more enduring than hate or discord.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dilly, a veritable Daffodilly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar tells the story of the man and his agency. J. Edgar Hoover for better or worse shaped the history of the last century as few others have. He was a pioneer in the field of law enforcement a reformer who made the Federal Bureau of Investigation free from political corruption, gave it modern crime fighting methods, and near deity status among the masses. I've always maintained that had Hoover just retired at the end of World War II his historical reputation would be much higher today. But as he points out in this film no one shares power in Washington, DC and few ever give it up willingly.All this and at the same time being a frightened man, way deep in his closet's closet as a gay man. Most gay folk will tell you now even in this post Stonewall age the hardest part of coming out is to family. In Hoover's case it was his mother played here by Judy Dench who was an imperious Southern bred lady who tells Leonardo DiCaprio as Hoover that above all she does not want to have a 'daffodil' for a son. The gay in him is pretty much repressed until he meets Clyde Tolson who becomes Deputy Director and Hoover's silent partner for decades. In real life Tolson who is played here by Armie Hammer was something of a stabilizing influence on the real Hoover, many times talking to him or even subtly countermanding moves that would be public relations disasters for the image conscious Hoover. In his life few knew of his role in the agency and fewer in Hoover's personal life.The other key player in Hoover's life is Naomi Watts as personal secretary Helen Gandy who was that for almost his entire time with the FBI. He tries clumsily to get a romance going, but settles for her just being the woman who kept the secrets for the man who held all the nation's secrets.Director Clint Eastwood who will make fewer and fewer appearances in front of the camera at his age gets some great performances from his cast in a story that takes up the middle of the American 20th Century. Leonardo DiCaprio is so good you absolutely think you are looking at Hoover himself. Helping in that is one of the greatest body and facial makeup jobs the cinema has ever witnessed.Henry Kissinger once said of Richard Nixon that he was a brilliant man who might have not fallen or even done the things he did good and bad if he ever felt loved. That could easily have been J. Edgar's story as well. One wonders also if Hoover had been born three or for generations later to see the Stonewall Rebellion in his youth how that might have shaped him as well.J. Edgar is one remarkable film from the remarkable team of Eastwood and DiCaprio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even famous people's lives can be dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a dull biopic, both because of the way it is structured and the topic.STRUCTURE: The most annoying structural flaw is the non-linear time line. Unfortunately, this way of editing biopics has almost become a standard. Take a famous person's life, chop it off, scramble and mix it, so that only those familiar with it will understand what is going on.One must study a biography before going to the cinema. I had the same feeling of irritation when I watched "La vie en rose". I knew next to nothing about Piaf, and I found the movie unbearable with the constant switching from one period of time to another, without any logical reason for that.Here we are in the same territory. The movie opens with J. Edgar half-way into his life. He starts narrating "his side" of the story to an FBI agent and from here we jump back ? but also forward - in time. We see the bureau in 1919, when anarchists were the archenemies, then we switch to the 30's and the fight against gangster, mixed with the Lindbergh kidnapping. This case takes a lot of time, without actually being the centre of the story.We see Hoover with his mother; at the races, with his deputy Tolson; with Robert Kennedy; while waiting to meet several US presidents (that could have given a nice chance to give some structure to the film) all of this scrambled and mixed in the non-linear structure.OTHER FLAWS: Another major flaw is the make-up. In their final years, Di Caprio and especially Hammer (playing Tolson) look like the old man in "2001, a space odyssey". Honestly, Hammer's make-up and the way he moves are straight out of the final reel of "2001".Finally, given to the non-linear structure and the lack of any real turning point in the story, this movie seems to go on forever. I am rarely bored at the cinema, but this time, I was actually looking forward to the end.TOPIC: the life of Mr Hoover was far from exciting. He is credited with making the FBI the powerful crime-fighting machine it is nowadays and he definitely accomplished a great deal throughout a life that was almost fully dedicated to work. Unfortunately, lives dedicated to work are hardly exciting, even if the work in question involves master criminals and dealing with US presidents.From what we see in the last Eastwood's movie, such was the case also for J. Edgar. A secretive man, who might have been a closet homosexual, but perhaps was just somebody not very interested in sex. A monomaniac with a tunnel vision and an obsession about fighting crime and the communists. A lonely man incapable of expressing his emotions. Whatever he was, we do not get to know, because all his secrets disappeared with him.We are left with speculation and old gossip. Kennedy had sex with lots of women? Not much of a revelation. Eleanor Roosevelt was a lesbian? Who cares anymore? Hoover had files about the dirty secrets of lots of people? Perhaps, but we will never know if he actually had them and what was in them, so all this is pointless guesswork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the lights went up in the theater where I went to see J. Edgar one thought immediately popped into my mind, "What was the point?"The 137-minute biopic about J. Edgar Hoover should have been fascinating. It should delve into the story and reveal to us the "truths" about Hoover, and with a figure such as Hoover there was plenty to work with. Instead the movie falls flat, committing to nothing aside from the fact that there were feelings between Edgar and Clyde Tolson. Even the widely believed rumor that Hoover liked to cross-dress is only nodded too once and in a way that made it seem as if he was dressing in his mother's clothes out of a act of mourning as opposed to a preference for pink fluffy dresses. If you are not comfortable with writing things that are not 100% documented then why even create this movie? Nothing about J. Edgar's life is documented because that was the kind of secretive man he was. The movie touches on the corruption that marked Edgar's many years at the FBI but felt more like a way to mark the time that has passed rather than truly telling us a story.The movie, directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Dustin Lance Black, lacks a heart. There is a lack of development of key relationships, whether they were not provided in the script or simply did not make it to screen I do not know but the movies feels pulled in so many different directions that it did not have an opportunity to focus on or fully develop anything. In the end this pull left me not really caring about what happens to these people. Clint Eastwood seems to struggle with his use of shadow in this piece, sometimes showing us emotional scenes and putting the actors entire face in the dark. One such scene is when J. Edgar (Leonardo DiCaprio) is mourning over the death of his mother. Instead of letting us see the pain in Edgar's eyes, Eastwood instead shows us his reflection in a mirror where the only body part we can distinctly make out is Edgar's right ear. You have DiCaprio acting out the single saddest moment of this mans life and all you give me is ineffective shadows? Even the age makeup on DiCaprio, Hammer, and Watts felt like a preliminary trial instead of what we should be seeing on screen.The highlight of J. Edgar comes in the supporting cast performances. Naomi Watts plays Helen Gandy, Edgar's personal secretary. Watts performance is subtle, playing a woman who knows the depths of Edgar's corruption but also believing in him. When she is on screen things seem to light up and my eyes could not leave her face, such small reactions play across it and that gave depth to this character. Armie Hammer is Clyde Tolson, arguably the person closest to Edgar. Coming off of his acclaimed performance as Cameron &amp; Tyler Winklevoss, Armie Hammer holds his own in a cast full of veteran actors. Hammer's Tolson is handsome and charming but also has a constant sense of vulnerability that makes the interactions between Tolson and Edgar work.J. Edgar manages to take what could have been a fantastic biopic (after all we had Leonardo Freaking DiCaprio as our lead) and turns it into something lack luster, only grazing the surface of where it could have gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad movie Bad acting &amp; Unbelievible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can not be taken seriously. They selected an actor based on his name, but no amount of make-up can help this beleaguered supposed Hollywood star fix this picture.His accent is such a put on that it sounds like he had a someone from a foreign country give him J. Edgar's accent lessons. He often sounds like he is forcing his words through a mouth full of marbles.It is difficult to watch because Leo just does not fit this role he is in. They would have been better served to take different actors to fit the age of the time they were portraying J. Edgar then to waste it on Leo.He makes this movie impossible to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could I possibly have imagined that in this Clint Eastwood film about J Edgar Hoover the driving force is the love Story between Edgar and his life long assistant. That's the only aspect of this sad tale that has any kind of human features. Leonardo Di Caprio who became a hero of mine after "This Boy's Life" and "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" has shown that it's not enough to work with some of the best living directors but training, classical training is vital in the professional life of an actor. His performance here, for the most part is merely that, a performance. Reciting a laundry list of ex-positional lines is not the shortest cut to our understanding and/or feelings. Damn shame if you ask me. To push this story to the verge of camp is Judi Dench's mother. Somewhere between the mothers in "Psycho" and "Notorious" but not nearly as entertaining. Did Robert Kennedy got the news of his brother's assassination through a call from Hoover? Really? Even if it's true I don't believe it. And that goes for the entire pitiful tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great, reasonably balanced, biopic on a highly controversial figureA study on J Edgar Hoover, famed long-serving director of the FBI. Explores his drivers and motivations, and personal life. Told through flashbacks as he narrates his career for his biography, we see how he built the FBI from scratch, some of his higher-profile cases (eg the Lindbergh baby), his obsession with Communists and anyone else he deemed enemies of the US and his relationship with Clyde Tolson, Assistant Director of the FBI, closest confidant and more. A good study on a controversial, divisive, almost mystical, figure in US history. Not entirely complimentary, it gives a stark, and balanced, look at a very powerful, shaping force figure in US history.Great performance from Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role. Good support from Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subdued biopic explores thoroughly its subject matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A workable biopic of FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, featuring strong direction from Clint Eastwood and a good leading performance from the dependable Leonardo DiCaprio. J. EDGAR isn't my favourite of Eastwood's movies because it does feel very slow and stately and it lacks the kind of depth present in some of his other films. However, it's much better than the overrated MILLION DOLLAR BABY, and about on par with THE CHANGELING.The film is told in flashback for the most part, and given Hoover's lengthy career, there's plenty of material to cover. We get involved in kidnappings, political wranglings, the Kennedy family, plus Hoover's own private relationships with his secretary, friend, and mother. J. EDGAR isn't a showy film at all, as it remains subtle and subdued throughout, and the actors in support like Naomi Watts barely register on the viewer's attention.While I didn't have the problems with the quality of the make-up that other reviewers on here did, I do take issues with the darker-than-dark cinematography. Eastwood seems to be going out of his way to make the whole thing as dark and gloomy as possible, which I always find makes for a faintly depressing movie. What happened to films being filled with sun and colour?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but flawed, much like Hoover himself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always a big fan of Clint Eastwood although prefer him on the screen rather than behind the camera. I was intrigued by him doing a film on Hoover partly because of his political standpoint, you knew that this wouldn't be a leftwing hack job that it easily have been but that it would also be a warts and all portrayal, especially in terms of Hoover's relentless self-promotion and pettiness towards anyone who threatened to steal the limelight from him. The Good? Brilliant performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, you saw him in Titanic and wondered if he was just going to be another passing hearthrob but he really has matured into this remarkable actor and this film really lets you see his range. Judi Dench terrific as his mother, especially in the scene 'daffodil' scene, so damn powerful. The fight impassioned fight between Hoover and Clyde is also a great scene, quite shocking in its' realism.The Bad? Concentrates a little too much on the negative aspects of Hoover's legacy over the positive, he doesn't receive enough credit for the manner in which he brought a more professional ethos to law enforcement and introduced scientific methods, the mishandling of the Lindbergh kidnapping a prime example of the limits of local police and need for the FBI. We never see the FBI successfully battle Nazi agents and Communist spies. The flashback format doesn't really work too well which is a shame, it just leaves you confused.So good but could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoilers ahead*Eastwood's excellent film is a typical example of his preference for working within genre while at the same time creating refreshing variations on its basic themes. J Edgar comes on like a standard issue biopic as an elderly Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) dictates his memoirs to a succession of young agents about the founding of the FBI and its early triumphs under his leadership. But late in the game Eastwood and writer Dustin Lance Black spectacularly pull the rug out from under us by having Hoover's close friend and confidante Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) declare that everything we've seen thus far has been a pack of lies. The question then becomes why and it's here that the point of Eastwood's film becomes clear. This isn't actually a biopic at all, it's really a tale of unrequited love, of Edgar's unrequited love, and of what happens when that love is denied and those impulses find another outlet.I've never been a fan of DiCaprio but I must concede that here he gives a compelling and sympathetic performance as J Edgar in a time period spanning the best part of five decades and it's a testament to the humanism of both the script and his performance that as monstrous as the character often is we never entirely lose our sympathy for a man whose loving instincts (his date with the young woman who ultimately becomes his lifelong secretary is an absolute hoot) are crushed by a domineering mother (Judi Dench) and the strictures of the time which made an open (and not necessarily physical) same sex relationship impossible. As the object of Edgar's affections Armie Hammer upstages the star with a touchingly heartfelt performance as Clyde Tolson and there are brief but strong supporting performances from Judi Dench as Mother and Naomi Watts as Edgar's loyal secretary Helen Gandy.For all its epic sweep - we see the young Edgar fighting communists in the early 1920's and his involvement in the Lindbergh kidnapping of the 30's - and the beautifully conceived flashback/forward structure (at one point the elderly Hoover and Tolson shuffle into a lift only to emerge from it as their younger dynamic selves 40 years earlier), the way these events are yoked to Edgar's psychology make this an almost suffocatingly interior film. Fatalistic, wreathed in shadows and unreliable memories, suffused with loss and shot through with a haunting, melancholy feel, it's a long way from your standard Hollywood biopic.At one point in Edgar's self-aggrandising version of history a young black agent asks him which is more important, the organisation or the man who founded it. Edgar's reply is that there's no difference between the two and that's the tragedy of J Edgar. That prevented from developing a loving relationship he gave his all to the FBI with himself as its only permitted star. The result for Edgar was power, fame and fear, but never love (a stroke of genius here is the way Hoover's FBI bureau reflects that isolation. It seems like a hermetically sealed environment cut off from the outside world, even from the rest of Government, and unchanging even across the best part of fifty years).When Melvin Purvis shot John Dillinger, Hoover was so enraged at the prospect of the man's fame that he had him sidelined instantly. The film reveals that Hoover appears to have co-operated with Hollywood and commercial interests quite happily just so long as he was the beneficiary. One especially memorable moment has Edgar humiliated before a senate committee as one wily politician demands to know in light of Hoover's endorsement of umpteen commercial properties (everything from G-man movies to cereal boxes) how many arrests he's actually made (the answer: none). This comes as a real shock since up to this point we had no idea Edgar was so involved in promoting his own image. Eastwood is in his element here. The theme of image vs reality is one of the perennial themes of his work and runs through the likes of Flags of Our Fathers, Unforgiven, Invictus and many more.Of the wiretappings, illegal recordings and secret files Edgar amassed the film fascinatingly implies they were the product of Edgar's own repressed impulses, his inability to express love turned poisonous and fuelled his abuse of power - his attempted blackmail of Robert Kennedy, President Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, his hatred of longhairs, progressives, communists, blacks, hippies and all the rest.One thing I particularly liked is the way that as Edgar gradually succumbs to his demons it's Tolson who becomes the voice of his conscience. In a key scene he warns Edgar away from an attempted blackmail of Martin Luther King. Ultimately it's too late to save Edgar but as the man ascends the stairs to his bedroom for the last time in his life there's a recognition from him that of all the things in the world, love is the strongest and most enduring of all. It's a very moving moment and topped in the scene following as Tolson weeps for the man he loved.This could be, in another director's hands (Oliver Stone for example,) incredibly salacious but Eastwood directs with real sensitivity - the attraction between Hoover and Tolson is subtly presented but not in an exploitative or prurient manner. Indeed the 'was-J Edgar-gay?' question is much more open to interpretation here than you might suppose. This is about love, it's not about being gay and it most emphatically is not about sex. There's also a lovely nod towards those rumours about Edgar's supposed fondness for cross-dressing. The production values and sense of period are utterly believable and a remarkable achievement on a budget of some $35 million. Cautiously recommended then but don't go in expecting some standard Hollywood biopic. Despite early appearances to the contrary it really isn't that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood and Di Caprio work their magic with this reliable work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA Clint Eastwood film, chronicling the life of J Edgar Hoover (Leonardo Di Caprio) and his struggles against Bolshevik Communists in the early 1920s, through to his controversial wire tap and surveillance methods to keep an eye on any suspected dissenters, as well as his crusade against a crime surge in the shape of boot legging, armed robberies and onto his handling of the Lindenberg kidnapping, that also shines a light on his equally colourful private life, where his lack of warmth and empathy was equally apparent.When Clint Eastwood sets his mind to something, as regards producing and directing a hit, even in spite of his old fashioned method of direction and production of a film, that feels more and more far removed from what modern film goers are probably used to with each passing minute, there's still a lot of sturdy film goers who will appreciate his style and delivery and admire how he goes about putting things together. Still, that hasn't stopped his biopic of federal stelwart J Edgar Hoover from receiving mostly lukewarm reviews at best, something I only remember happening before with his awful 2002 thriller Blood Work. Still, while this is far from his best work, I still found it a reliably solid, polished effort, of the sort he pulls off magically with the Malpaso company.Di Caprio is and always has been well suited to these kind of real life roles, and he reliably brings the domineering, hard line Hoover to life in the only way he can. The film covers a wide portion of Hoover's life, the main theme being his various crusades against varying criminals and as such other interesting side notes about his life are dusted off to the corner, his reputed cross dressing interest only hinted at in a scene after his mother dies. 82 year old Eastwood is probably the most reliable figure to go to make this kind of film, and the best way to describe it is being presented in the sort of slick, polished manner anyone familiar with his work will have come to know and expect. All the right ingredients are here and while it's not quite a masterpiece, it's still a reliably solid work. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood and DiCaprio do justice to the life of J. Edgar Hoover.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been around long enough to actually remember J. Edgar Hoover. Back in the days we of course didn't have the internet and all that comes with it, nor did we have 24-hour news channels, so the public only got bits and pieces of news. We never knew all the things that were really going on, like Hoover's FBI. So watching this movie is a revelation of sorts, assuming it is basically accurate. Being an Eastwood film I suspect it is.Leonardo DiCaprio has shown in a number of different roles that he is one of our best, and here he is superb as J. Edgar Hoover. Since the film covers all of J. Edgar's adult life we see DiCaprio in a variety of different make-up modes, from very young to very old. Much of the film is told in a sort of flashback format as the elderly Hoover is dictating his memoirs.It has been widely discussed and depicted subtly in this film that Hoover was in fact gay. As a young man there is a scene where he invites one new stenographer, Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy,on a date. He actually takes her to the Library of Congress where he shows off his classification system that lets one find any book on any subject in just a minute or two. Then he tries to kiss her, but she pulls back, she has no interest in him, so he ends up hiring her as his confidential personal secretary for the rest of his life. The scene and outcome illustrate Hoover's social ineptitude and confusion over his sexual orientation. The movie is long. Long and slow. I found myself wishing it would conclude quicker. It covers much, including some organized crime issues, the kidnapping of the Lindberg baby and subsequently investigation and trial, plus a host of other issues and a list of presidents. Maybe it was too ambitious a coverage. Still it is a good movie, but if you aren't particularly interested in the life of Hoover and the history of the FBI, then you will probably be bored with it.</fullReview>

As for the movie I really liked it. The longer it went on the more I got into it. The only problem I had with this movie is that it tried to put every important aspect of his life in and the movie became a series of little clips that were about ten minutes each that didn't seem to flow together in a normal story like form.

Edgar is a American biographical of FBI' first Director "J.Edgar Hoover. who changed the face of FBI by centralizing fingerprint file and creating forensic laboratories to catch criminals. In his almost 50years tenure as director, he became the most controversial person in FBI. J.Edgar Hoover's story is not only fascinating but troubled too. He has caught some of the notorious criminals in the American history &amp; introduced tons of new innovative methods to do so. Clint Eastwood is a great director &amp; in recent times directed some really good movies like Million Dollar Baby, Invictus &amp; Changeling. Just like his previous movies, J.Edger is a victim of poor lighting ..as always not only his subject matters are dark, he shoots the whole movie in dark too, which makes it sometimes hard to see what's happening on screen. This time another disappointment was bad makeup of Leo, Armie &amp; Naomi in their 60plus age. Terrible make up made it really annoying to watch them in their elderly avatar, it seemed like surgery gone wrong. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was impressive as always. Armie Hammer is charming &amp; in Hotel burst out sequence his performance was simply incredible. (I love his voice ever since Gossip Girl). Naomi Watts was good but she is not aging beautifully. Overall, J.Edgar is good but poor lighting &amp; makeup makes it annoying sometimes plus their is no shock-value in it though J.Edger's life was nothing but Shocking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For 50 years, one man ruled the FBI with an iron fist, by means of blackmail and increasing use of force. And along the way, he introduced the concept of scientifically provable evidence in investigations and court cases, and launched the system of cataloging criminals by means of their fingerprints. These things can be abused, and are today, but they are essentially tools, and we would be worse off without them. Like many other great biopics, this focuses on one specific event, to highlight vital aspects regarding the person it is about(and it is very true of this that one scene or line of dialog is enough for us to piece together how that specific thing worked). Here, it is the Lindbergh kidnapping. What makes or breaks this is largely the performance of DiCaprio(who by far exceeds every other credible, interesting character of this in screen-time and development), and the quality of the aging make-up(no, really... this makes occasional leaps back and forth in time, from the chronicling of the life and career, and the last days, of the titular lead... establishing, for example, that his personal secretary and his closest friend and colleague both stayed with him until the end), and fortunately, both are phenomenal. Everyone is a human being in this, and though there are a lot of things that we can disapprove of, we understand where it comes from and no one is a one-note "good" or "bad" guy. All of the acting is great. This is well-paced and keeps you engaged throughout. The historical setting and figures are very nicely and convincingly re-created(Nixon is friggin' perfect, in a cameo of a role). This is filmed and edited well. The humor is fitting in tone and amount, meaning little and often subtle. Obviously, this has to deal with the seeming homosexuality and cross-dressing of Hoover, and both are explored respectfully and in a way that you do not take pleasure in this man's misfortune(not one person in my packed theater giggled at Leo in a dress and with pearls on), even with all the terrible things he caused, you sympathize with him, and even realize why he tried to tear other people down, particularly those that opposed him, even when they were correct. He was an insecure, arrogant, self-hating, repressed man who could not admit to anyone, including himself, who he really was. It is a tragic tale, and one that will stick with viewer's minds for a while. One of Eastwood's best. There is a little strong language, blood and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who wants a proper treatment of this fascinating individual. 8/10</fullReview>

He represses his sexuality, and like many politicians today that are guilty of the same behavior, he constantly seeks deviance in others.

		<fullReview>I looked forward to seeing this on DVD so much that I preordered it on Amazon. After watching it I'm sorry I bothered. Where do you start ? The constant chopping and changing of time period,which would have confused seasoned time travellers like Dr Who. It certainly confused my fellow viewers who unfamiliar with the story gave up in places. The photography which was nearly monochromatic. You could hardly see anything in some scenes. I kept shouting "turn the damn lights on !" The gay stuff, which was truly bizarre. Portraying Hoover and Tolsen as unconsummated lovers, when many accounts have said otherwise. It degenerated to fighting at one point making it look like a middle class Broke Back Mountain remake. The hideous make up, on the three leading actors that looked like science fiction mutation. The worst was Tolsen who looked like the victim of a aircraft fire at one point. More unintentional comedy.But it was what was omitted that made the film look weak. Very little on the JFK, RFK and MLK assassinations, that Hoover failed to investigate properly. Or may have helped occur. No analysis was attempted here. Nothing on his fake war on crime while hobnobbing with gangsters. Absolutely zip on World War 2, were he actually caught a few Nazi spies. Nothing about how Hoover's 'Get King Squad' was given the job of investigating his murder. Nothing on COINTELPRO, the largest illegal opening of personal mail in history. Nothing on how most Communist organisations in the USA were fakes run by Hoover to trap new recruits. Nothing on LBJ, who was one of Hoover's neighbours and a close friend. Next to nothing on the McCarthy Trials, apart from mentioning his name a couple of times. This was were Nixon made his name being fed information by Hoover at the Alger Hiss trial, none of which was included. We didn't even get to see the shootings of Dillenger,Floyd or Nelson in any detail - robbing the film of a chance of a bit of excitement. Also, all Hoover buffs know he wore a gardenia in his lapel every day. This film was practically flower free.I can't really see the point of making a biopic with so much history removed, suppressed and deleted. Hoover did enough of that in real life without Hollywood doing the same. The chance to shed some light ( pun intended - see lighting notes above )on a dark period of American history was spectacularly missed. Hoover comes out instead as a well meaning eccentric rather than the monster most people say he was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J.Edgar was a big disappointment from a legend director ? Client Eastwood. The only saving grace was sterling performance by Leonardo Dicaprio. In the time of Great Depression , J.Edgar takes the charge as an acting director of FBI and revives the process in the federal law. He hires new agent, comes with a new policy and vows to bring down the crime rate in America and guarantees peace and harmony. But behind the doors , he held the secrets that would have destroyed his image , his career and his life. Directed by master director ,Clint Eastwood , J.Edgar is good attempt on a powerful man who changes the face of FBI during great depression but is brought down by loose screenplay. The screenplay doesn't hold attention of the audience and drags down a lot. The editing should have been trimmed by few minutes. Even the makeup work of Dicaprio and Armie Hammer. The only silver lining is a towering performance by Leonardo Dicaptrio. The supremely talented actor proves his versatility yet again with his portrayal of J.Edgar. The actor gets into character and you will never get a chance to think someone who can do justice to J.Edgar's character. The art direction is compelling showcasing the great depression era elegantly. The background score is just about OK. The performances by rest of the star cast is fine. So , Overall , disappointing flick from Clint Eastwood. Watch it because of the mesmerizing performance by Leonardo Dicaprio. Average 2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Hoover will probably be remembered just as much as the most famous American presidents during the 20th century. It's strange nobody has told his story on the screen before. Clint Eastwood makes it here.It tells about Hoover's fear. For communists, for women, for his mother, for anything which threatens the world he settled in the early 20s. That of course also goes for homosexuality, which he doesn't recognize in himself, although he has this platonic relationship with his companion.Hoover's building-up of FBI is just the frame here and Hoover the person is more important. DiCaprio is in his own way also splendid, acting a 60- or 70-years-old man in a manner which makes you completely forget DiCaprio's actual age. But this is anyway so mainstream and you hear between and from the lines what perhaps is Eastwood's message: USA must protected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>failure to launch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thinking this would be more of a historical representation of J Edgar's years, and the founding's of the FBI, expecting more on secret files and political gamesmanship and their related power plays; but Contraire!! The movie was very inwardly focused, way too much time spent on his personal relationships with his mother and is gay assistant and their close relationship. Not sure why Director Eastwood thought he needed to spend that much time on character development. The movie was choppy at best, with continual hops from J Edgars early days / pre and early depression era, then back to him as an old man, in the late 60's and 70's?. so much of a structural failure with the way the story unfolded, or attempt to unfold. It was educational and interesting to a degree, and at times there was some witty humor injected here and there that prompted a chuckle from the audience.. but honestly not much more. Disappointed? more suited for netflix, when not much else is available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The wonderful style of Eastwood again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1924, with only 29 years, Edgar Hoover was FBI director general appointed to reorganize the institution. He served until his death in 1972, surviving eight presidents, some of whom unsuccessfully tried to oust him. Files Hoover jealously guarded, full of unspeakable secrets of important personalities, made him one of the most powerful and feared men in the history of the United States.This history tells us in random order while an elderly Hoover has its greatest achievements and endless misery. Eastwood manages to get us into the mind and personality of a man historically controversial, which have said many things, but none have been proved.Interesting but creepy character biography J.Edgar, not only for the power that comes to have but by the ways in which he succeeds. Keywords as "blackmail" and "repressed feelings" invade this movie. Here we see a single person with a huge and amazing organization reaches manipulating several U.S. presidents and all his political gear. And we also see his skepticism toward some leaders and the relationship with them almost always "stained and blackmailed" for hidden secrets and shameful for the country.It's another great work of Clint Eastwood admired director, a true genius and creator in the direction of a lot of works of art that have been deservedly enshrined in film history. No single film of this artist not good and instead consider most of his films are among my favorites. In my opinion is one of the best directors we have seen.From Leonardo DiCaprio, on the other hand, nobody can deny that he is an actor with a career in upward progression that fits easily into any character he plays, his talent test The playing strength offered by this actor is the key to that we can never completely hate or love his character. Eastwood obviously do not want to glorify a radical anti-communist and cold character, but does not want to break your hero figure and he did it.Armie Hammer in his character of Clyde Tolson faithful, is one of the biggest surprises of this film. Clint Eastwood trusted him, putting him in a character almost as important as the protagonist and hit.Thank Eastwood style is softened dominance of the Hoover's mother, the obsession with safeguarding American nationalism, the friendship of the two protagonists Hoover and Tolson. In a delicate way the director gives a touch of softness to the values at that time intended to give to American society, and as in many of his films, loneliness is presented as the finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This speculative biopic of the controversial FBI director stars Leonardo DiCaprio. The story opens in 1970, as Hoover is dictating his history of the Bureau; in flashbacks, we see his pivotal role the Lindburgh case and his battles with Communists, the Roosevelts, Kennedys, and Martin Luther King, Jr. He was also obsessed with his doting mother (Judi Dench) and his long-time Assistant Director, Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer).The story is, in turns, exciting and boring, heartfelt and cheesy and has two insurmountable flaws: DiCaprio is horribly miscast as Hoover (he still looks and sounds like boyish Jack Dawson, despite supposedly aging 53 years) and the terrible old-age make-up used for Hoover, Tolson, and Hoover's secretary (Naomi Watts) is absolutely terrible. Tolson, in particular, looks like Boris Karloff's Mummy and even though director Eastwood filmed the entire movie in dim, half-light, the make-up is distracting and never convincing.I found the story of Hoover's life interesting and came away feeling quite sorry for this sad, tortured man, but the casting and make-up ruined it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J. Edgar + L. DiCaprio + C. Eastwood = A Misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the pedigree of Leonardo DiCaprio, Naomi Watts, Armie Hammer, and Judi Dench, with the cachet of Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, and the tantalizing subject of one of America's most secretive public figures debunked, the film J. Edgar collapses under the weight of its own self-importance, pounds of garish make-up, and its unwieldy focus on the eponymous subject. Clint Eastwood begins the film with promise: the (unknown to me) 1919 Bolshevik bombings of American houses and Senators, a coordinated attack of great power and a precursor of later day terrorism, which scars a young Edgar as he bikes by the carnage and picks up the leaflets left by the attackers. DiCaprio's Edgar is a go-getter in the Bureau, a momma's boy who is fastidious about his wardrobe and socially awkward with a nervous stutter, yet conniving and relentless in his myopic pursuit of what he wants A botched marriage proposal to secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) results in a lifetime commitment as his personal secretary and keeper of secrets. Dinner every night with Mother (Judi Dench) influences Edgar's clothing and philosophies, as well as his self-loathing and guilt. Friendship with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) reveals him to be the crush that Edgar hires impulsively as Assistant Director and befriends while rebuilding the Bureau's reputation and his own wardrobe. As a frame narrative, Eastwood shows an army of young male agents helping Edgar type his life story which is intertwined with the history of the Bureau and the rise of forensic science. For as much time as Edgar is shown to be a visionary of law enforcement with his prescient belief in the integration of science into their work such as fingerprinting, Eastwood gives at least twice as much focus to Edgar's bloated, reptilian face and his waddling to the window during inaugurations as well as his cryptic blackmailing of presidents with his infamous files. There's a lack of balance or just priority in this film. For example, so much time is given to the Lindergh case, but without context, emotion, and clarity it is difficult to tell how the case enraptured the public's attention, the time frame of the kidnapping and its investigation, the aftermath of its resolution. Edgar rushes a federal law into place post Lindbergh kidnapping which Clint Eastwood seems to be drawing comparison to the Patriot Act, yet was making kidnapping a federal crime an example of overreach or just good politics? Edgar menacingly states that rules have to be bent to find the criminals, and there's the implication that the Lindbergh killer may not even be guilty. He seems to push for profiling and wire-tapping, all post-9-11 hot topics, though he stops the brutal beating of a suspect at one point, suggesting a disgust for violence? Yet beyond these surface comparisons to modern day America, I'm not sure where Eastwood is going with this. The film lacks the conviction to do much with Edgar's repressed sexuality and his close friendship with Clyde Tolson beyond hint and dodge. A mid-film throw-down fight is welcome for its change of pace, but the blending of past and present becomes tiresome and artless, draining the film of any momentum or sense of time. And a final scene loses any dramatic power, though a quotation chosen to end the film is intriguing.However fun it is to consider the role of a public figure who served under eight presidents (Just consider the sheer jumps in technology and law enforcement from Presidents Hoover through Nixon!), ultimately, J. Edgar chooses not to go deep into Edgar's obviously haunted psyche, what drove him to such lengths, his obsession with using Hollywood and the G-Man image to project his will on the American public, or his thirst for power. How much of his actions are self-loathing? How did Edgar personally reconcile his own hypocrisy with his pursuit of hypocritical public figures? Did religion play a part at all in his inner-life? That is not to say that there is not a great movie in here somewhere. J. Edgar Hoover remains a captivating 20th Century figure, a contradictory tragic hero, one seemingly shaped by Bolshevik attacks on American soil which infused his paranoia and obsession. I think that J. Edgar Hoover deserves a more thoughtful film with a better script. And none of the cast benefits from the pounds of garish make-up that they wear for more than half the film. I wonder if it would have been better to cast older actors and actresses instead of piling on the receding hairlines, the liver spots, the paunch, and the neck wrinkles to stars DiCaprio, Watts, and Hammer? If your movie is going to require more than half of its running time with your stars hidden under latex and make-up, when does that decision ultimately hamper a younger actor or actress? I like all three performances, and I wonder why DiCaprio was not nominated for Best Actor. I just simply might not be a great performance from him. I wonder how it stacks up against Meryl Streep's Oscar-winning performance as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. A disappointing misfire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made movie that just however doesn't tell you enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems that for every great Clint Eastwood directed movie, there are at least 2 mediocre ones. And yes, this movie is also quite mediocre. which is still not the same as something bad of course.For a biopic this movie just doesn't tell you enough about its main subject. After watching this movie I still have no idea who J. Edgar Hoover exactly was, why he did the things the way he did and most importantly what drove him. It's not a very insightful movie but more one that only covers the surface.Perhaps it's due to it that the movie just doesn't really know what to think about J. Edgar Hoover. The movie itself seems to be in doubt about it, whether he was a good- or a bad guy and therefore doesn't really know how to approach him. You have the feeling that because of this the movie is never going far enough with any of its presumptions and plays it safe instead.So it's not entirely successful as a biopic but as a movie on its own, it still has plenty of value to it. It of course features a pretty interesting concept, being set in a pretty interesting time. Lots of well known people and cases of its time pass through this movie but that bring me to another problem of the movie as well.Something that the story could has used was some more focus. It should had had a more clear main plot line in it and now instead the movie is making some too big leaps at times. Whenever you think that the movie is heading into an interesting direction, it suddenly wraps it all up and starts with something completely different. It also seems quite pointless that the movie keeps switching back and forth between the young and the old J. Edgar Hoover.Besides, the story that it is telling just doesn't always come across as that interesting, though the movie does still present itself as a very heavy and dramatic one. It's actually a very forgettable movie, that I don't think I will ever see again. It's just not the sort of movie you pick and sit down for, for a pleasant night of movie watching. It's not a very easy or pleasant movie to watch, due to its story and the way its being told.I can still really appreciate it for all of the skills and talent, that got put into it. I'm probably making it sound like this is a horrible movie, which just really isn't the case. Technically it still remains a well made movie, with some good cinematography, art-direction and make-up effects. I actually wouldn't be surprised if this movie ended up earning a couple of Oscar nominations, in any of those categories and perhaps in some more ones as well. This is simply the type of movie the Academy Awards love; a true historical story, about an iconic person, played by a well known actor and with a acclaimed director at the helm of it. And even though Leonardo DiCaprio looks absolutely nothing like, the short, fat, balding, ugly J. Edgar Hoover (no matter how much make-up they throw on him) he still does a great job at becoming the character. You could tell he gave it everything and studied his subject a lot. Most of the other characters and actors in this are however, just like the entire movie, forgettable ones.A well made- but very forgettable movie, that's worth seeing only just once really. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

And I'm sure that this came up at the table, "Leo wants to do it. It's his next Oscar. Release the funds!" You're telling me that no one, I mean NO ONE in any of those meetings said anything like, "Excuse me. Excuse me, please? Has anyone read the script? Hello? Anybody? Has anybody read this script?" This film is an absolute bore! I was stunned. When I glanced to my right, the entire row in this 3/4 full theater was snoozing. I looked to my left, half of the people were sleeping. The other half were slung way low in there seats, looking at their watches and glancing back up at the screen with that, "Is this thing over yet?" look.Sorry Clint. Sorry Leo. I'm sure many will praise this film just because you are involved and you portrayed all the idiosyncrasies of this complex, troubled man. Dudes! Artistic license.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant performance by Leonardo DiCaprio...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Leonardo DiCaprio gives a towering performance as J. EDGAR in Clint Eastwood's film of that name, nor that the other supporting performances aren't extremely well played. I never found the age make-up and prosthetics used to give DiCaprio a remarkable resemblance to the older Hoover a distraction, as others have claimed. His brisk, authoritative manner barking orders while riddled with a personality that covered a whole range of eccentricities, is nothing short of brilliant. All of the main facets of Hoover's life while in office stick pretty much to the truth in the script.But the film's basic flaw is that there's almost too much to tell about Hoover and not enough time to give any of the material more than a surface look. And the fact that the story is going back and forth in time holds up the momentum when it comes to the segments dealing with the Lindbergh kidnapping. What should have reached the peak of intensity in the story is muffled by the fact that the script spaces the event amid a period of other happenings, all of which take away a strong enough focus on "the trial of the Century." Eastwood's direction of the players is so strong that this flaw doesn't really matter in the end. He gets across a full illumination of the kind of man Hoover was, despite all the complexities stemming from his attachment to a dominating mother (Judi Dench) and made even more apparent by his singular attachment to his fellow co-worker at the FBI (Armie Hammer) as Clyde Tolson. Scenes between DiCaprio and Hammer reach a peak moment in their physical struggle as Hammer reacts violently to Hoover's admission of getting "serious" with Dorothy Lamour.Many personalities of the '30s and '40s are impersonated from time to time, the least convincing being the child actress chosen to represent Shirley Temple, who adored the F.B.I. Aside from blonde ringlets, she in no way resembles that child star in looks, speech or manner. Much closer are Ginger Rogers and Anita Colby. Nixon is played by an actor considerably more handsome than the original and Josh Lucas only makes an acceptable Charles Lindbergh.But whatever casting flaws there are, all of the main supporting roles are very capably entrusted to the right people. Naomi Watts does a fine job as Helen Gandy and Judi Dench is likewise admirable as Annie Hoover. In the end, though, it's a good film that might have been great with a tighter script.And certainly, DiCaprio can look forward to an Oscar nomination for Best Actor of 2011. Whether he wins or not, it's a role he put a lot of guts into and the payoff is there for all to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows the life story of J Edgar Hoover , the legendary director of the FBI---the man who built it into the formidable organisation that it is today .It shows how little power it had in the beginning , and how Edgar built it step by step to fight the internal security threats to the land of the free---America , what else.....And even in 1919 , before the era of the cold war has begun , the threat that Edgar perceives to the American way is that of communism..... For the bolshevics have taken power in Russia and are hellbent on spreading communism everywhere...... From giving radical speeches to bombblasting people , they are trying to foment revolution across the world.....It is upto people like Edgar to protect the Americans from this danger..... And protect them he does , by taking risks to his career as he has to bend the official rules many a time ........And as the great depression of 1929 strikes , Edgar moves onto facing the next danger , that of rising criminality among the population which has turned to crime as they have lost their jobs due to the collapsing economy . What makes his job even more difficult is the fact that unlike the contempt they have for communism , common people regard the gangsters as heroes in the depressed economic times . But Edgar triumphs over the gangsters too , catching many and teaching many a lesson they will never forget.....And as always , he bends the rules to do so..... Which prompts some Presidents to think of removing him.....No problem for our intrepid hero...... He uses the FBI to keep tabs on their personal lives , and if threatened with removal , he subtly threatens to expose the personal lives of the high and mighty , like President Roosevelt's wife's affairs or President Kennedy's romp in the bed with an East German communist woman......So presidents come and go , but J Edgar Hoover is a constant , a permanent factor in the security system of the world's most powerful democracy......And he keeps his image in the mind of the American public as a larger than life hero , by creating photo-ops and planting fictitious stories in the press about how he caught such and such criminal or how he personally fought and arrested such and such lawbreaker......All this is fine , but there is a major flaw in the film..... And the flaw is that the movie concentrates too much on Edgar's personal life.....But what is so fascinating about his personal life that the movie has to change gear ?? It is the fact that the final protector of western democracy from the scourge of communism , the pillar of America's much vaunted security apparatus his highness J Edgar Hoover is....is gay !!And the movie spends way too much of its time in showing Edgar's lack of interest in women and his affair with his aide Mr Tolson . And this ruins the movie as the parts showing all this move very slowly and reduce it to a personal story rather than how Edgar was in the thick of fighting America's enemies .Also way too much time is spent in showing the kidnapping of the baby of American hero Charles Lindbergh and its investigation and aftermath .In the end Edgar dies in office during the presidency of Richard Nixon . But as Nixon's agents move to scour Edgar's office to find out what secrets he has kept from them , they find it empty...... All his secret files have been destroyed by his faithful secretary Miss Grandy---the old man ( as Nixon calls him ) has outwitted the president one last time.....And the director of the film ( Clint Eastwood !! He should have stuck to western movies , really ) has outwitted me too---out of my money..... ......For frankly , I didn't like the film at all....Verdict---not good .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A disgusting person. The great irony is that the person that invented the concept of public enemy number one turned out to actually be public enemy number one. This is because he was an enemy to the fundamental principles of the Constitution. He regularly violated multiple aspects of the Bill of Rights. His only interest was to retain himself in power. And all his good intentions were based on bent and twisted personality distortions, mirrored back to the world and communicated in rhetoric that sounded sane and truly intentioned. It is not that he didn't accomplish some good. He was instrumental in bringing science to criminal forensics. Although the movie hit the major themes, it took it too easy on J. Edgar. Also, the movie was boring because it focused the attention of the entire movie on him and he was extremely boring. Clint Eastwood is one of the most brilliant film makers today. His movies are thoughtful, compassionate and tender. But it is clear that there are some flaws with his state of consciousness (in my opinion). Although he is a Republican, I had thought he was one of those old fashioned rational and practical types, with a true intention of public service. But I heard recently that he was supporting Herman Cain for President. But I guess that this can't be held against him too much. Although Cain is crazy, there isn't a single Republican candidate whose mental state is reality based.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misstep in the career of both Eastwood and DiCaprio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no other way to put this: This film is awful. There's a few great sets and costumes and a decent performance by Leonardo DiCaprio and that is it. There is nothing innovative, revealing or entertaining about J. Edgar.I probably should have expected it after I saw what Robert De Niro did to the C.I.A. Clint Eastwood does the same to the F.B.I., but how could he make the character of one of the most notorious figures in the world a complete bore too?What we are left with, is a story about a man who was socially awkward but Eastwood doesn't let him be all that professionally competent either. The character doesn't seem like a man who was all that powerful to me, and that is the movie's biggest flaw. Sure, there are a few scenes showing that Hoover was able to gather information about the most powerful men in the country to get his way, but you don't really feel any effect of that power. A scene at the midpoint where Hoover is ridiculed in public diminishes the character deeply and doesn't seem to recover from that at all.I think I would rather see the F.B.I. Story which told a highly glamorized Bureau than I would like to see this again. The story arc about Hoover's sexual orientation is also mishandled. In a particular awkward scene, we see both Hoover's sexual confusion and his not so healthy relationship with his mother. However, it is handled like quotation and not a really developed story point.Armie Hammer, who I thought was brilliant in The Social Network gets the short end of the stick here. His character is portrayed as weak but a key confrontation between him and Hoover made me wanna pity him more than it made me wanna root for him.So, alas another missed opportunity to make a really interesting biopic. It has happened a lot now. I recommend you see Public Enemies one more time. Sure, it isn't truthful, but it is 10 times more exciting than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>am finding really hard to find something good to say about this latest dull dull dull film by Clint Eastwood. I am actually even beginning to think that it's probably time for Clint to enjoy his retirement, instead of giving us every year a film which borders between the cheesy, the flat and most crucially the rhetorical propaganda! I am sorry to say this, because I love the guy as a person, but let's face it, both Invictus and (especially) Hereafter were real stinkers As far as J. Edgar is concerned behind the thin patina of gloss, the actual true fascinating story and an impressive cast, there is otherwise very little to enjoy. Eastwood directs it all almost by numbers, as if he wasn't even there, without any visual flair, any care or attention for details, any subtlety, or worse any real ideas or anything to say. Every decision behind the making of this film seems to have been wrong one: the decision to break the film up, flashing backwards and forwards makes it too complicated to follow and keeps the audience emotionally detached for at least the whole first half. The decision to allow Eastwood to recycle his usual plain piano notes soundtrack, which sounds exactly the same as every other one of his films and actually here is used in the most cheesy possible way to its worse effect. The decision to have J Edgar Hoover telling the story of his life to a biographer (my God, can it all be a bit more obvious please!?), but most crucially, the decision to have Di Caprio &amp; Co acting with (not very good) prosthetics for half of the film thus forcing the audience to get constantly distracted by the bad hair lines, the dodgy fake wrinkles and the rubbery feel on people's faces. I must have spent half of the film looking at the make-up thinking "God, this is bad" and even when sometimes I though "mmm, this is a bit better?" I was always aware of it. Even when you look at the publicity stills from the movie (the picture above this review) you can see tell how fake the hairline is. In an age of seamless CGI (look at the ageing effects of Benjamin Button!!) I am surprise to see such shoddy work (hopefully it'll look alright on DVD, but on the big screen I saw this, digitally projected, it all looked incredibly ropey). I am usually a huge fan of Di Caprio: I loved him since "A Boy's life" when he upstaged even Robert DeNiro (in a time where DeNiro was actually still good), he was absolutely amazing in "What's Eating Gilberg Grape" (to this day one of my favourite films), but on "J.Edgar" Di Caprio is forced to spend half of the film covered in that damn thick prosthetics which prevents him to convey any real emotion to his character. I felt like I was always watching Di Caprio in a fat-suit as opposed to J.Edgar. To be completely honest, it's not all his fault. Eastwood 's direction jumps from scene to scene, sometimes quite randomly, trying to cover as much ground as possible from the undoubtedly intriguing real life. There are way too many characters, too many story lines, most of which are left hanging without a real sense of place and eventually the emotional focus of the film gets diluted and any understanding of his character gets lost. There are some potentially very strong moments: for example the relationship between J.Edgar and his domineering mother (the always very watchable Judi Dench) and the sexual tension between Di Caprio and Armie Hammer, are both potentially very strong, however in the hands of Eastwood they all fall into schmaltzy and clichs as those cheesy piano notes tell us "a now, watch out? this is going to be emotional". It's all handled so badly that it even kills a potentially good performance like the one by Di Caprio. The rest is just a hollow mess where characters come and go without leaving any real mark: we never really know why Naomi Watts's character decides to stick with J. Edgar right until the end, we never really get a grip on the procedures that made finger prints database possible, we never really get a sense of what could have happen if the real J.Edgar had been exposed and while all sorts of lawyers and politicians appear and disappear in a seemingly random succession we are getting more and more lost in irrelevant subplots. It could have been a fascinating story: a closeted gay, the first director of FBI, a man who lived through presidents like Truman, Kennedy and Nixon. There could have been so much here and yet it's all wasted in bad storytelling, staging and wrong choices at every turn. I blame the direction, the script (surprisingly the same person who had penned the quite gentle and a lot more subtle Milk),but also the editing: obviously a lot has been cut out trying to condense 50 years into 137 minutes. But instead of loosing entire subplots and deciding to make it all more focused, somebody made a terrible decision to actually have it all in. The first 20/30 minutes are some of the most disjointed and messy I've seen in any film recently. It would probably deceiver even less than a 5/10 rating, but some of central performances are quite good, despite everything else around them. moviegeekblog.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's Most Legendary G-Man: Warts (Lots OF Them) And All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the history of America during the 20th century, few people were as revered, admired, feared, and hated (sometimes all at once) as J. Edgar Hoover, the mercurial, often-paranoid man who ruled over the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1924 until his death in 1972. In his time, he saw the expunging of Communist subversives, the destruction of Depression-era gangsters like John Dillinger, and an ability to keep tabs and files on people in high places in the U.S. government, including all the presidents and attorneys general that he held sway over. But there was that one personal secret of his that he definitely did not want getting out, which would have destroyed the image he had built up of himself as the toughest law enforcement chief there was. All of Hoover's aspects, savory and unsavory alike, are shown in great detail by director Clint Eastwood in J. EDGAR, one of the great biopics of recent vintage.Told largely in flashbacks that span the first indications in 1919 of a Bolshevik revolution threatening America, to 1972, when Hoover died, J. EDGAR stars Leonardo DiCaprio in a mesmerizing performance as the tough-as-nails FBI man who prided himself of getting rid of the rotten elements in American society, and ordering his bureau and his agents to live up to his professional standards of loyalty and patriotism. Both Eastwood and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black depict the great things Hoover's FBI did, but they don't whitewash the fact that he was also a shameless, unapologetic huckster and salesman at boosting the FBI image at home and abroad, sometimes taking credit for certain big FBI catches (capturing the killer of Charles Lindbergh's baby; the killing of Dillinger) that he was never even present at?and, of course, the fact that his relationship with his close aid Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) was, how shall we say, more than merely professional. Eastwood, more content now to be behind the camera than in front of it, gets a great performance out of DiCaprio, as well as solid turns by Naomi Watts (as Hoover's long-time secretary Helen Gundy), Dame Judi Dench (as his mother Annie), and Jessica Hecht as the notorious subversive Emma Goldman, most of them unrecognizable, including DiCaprio, under all the prosthetics and make-up, but still able to deliver the goods.As a director, Eastwood proved long ago, going all the way back to his directing debut PLAY MISTY FOR ME in 1971, that he was more than just Dirty Harry or the Man With No Name, that he was a director of offbeat and extremely challenging projects, whether or not he was also on the other side of the camera as an actor. Recent films of his like CHANGELING, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, INVICTUS, HEREAFTER, and MILLION DOLLAR BABY proved this; and J. EDGAR does as well. This is a film to be appreciated, not only for its detail, but also for giving us an unvarnished glimpse into a man who, regardless of how one feels about him, changed the face of American law enforcement forever.</fullReview>

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, How much more do I need to talk about a movie that has such a grey over tone. Much of the acting could be presumed is good but nothing that would satisfy my brand; not even close myself and a good friend laughed about how quickly we began falling off into snoozeville halfway through the film, that was more entertaining then actually watching the move.

		<fullReview>J. Edgar Hoover would absolutely revile Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar. Hell, he'd probably rustle up enough dirt on Eastwood to muscle him out of the industry, let alone quash his film. And that's why it's so unexpectedly genius and on-point. It would be almost a disservice to the enormity of Hoover - controversial, hugely problematic, but fundamentally influential - for his biopic to be anything but, and Milk screenwriter Dustin Lance Black deftly, cleverly takes this dissonance to heart. So be warned: J. Edgar takes patience, and is, at times, almost unwatchably frustrating. But if Hoover's FBI imparts any moral, it's to always dig deeper - that's where the really rewarding pay dirt lies. If Eastwood and Black's aim was to immediately rid the viewer of traditional notions of comfort, they are resoundingly successful. The film's first act, with Leonardo DiCaprio buried under pounds of nauseatingly distracting prosthetics (picture Red from That 70s Show crossbred with a turtle) steering his own retroactive biography like a cringeworthy, self-congratulatory Citizen Kane, is so off-putting and tastelessly clich that I nearly walked out. Actors mumble indulgently expositionary dialogue to coax out faux-gravitas in the FBI's confusing, under-explained inception, pretentiously underscored by harpsichord interludes(?!). It's also nearly impossible to see anything that's going on, as Eastwood, as if drunkenly skimming a film noir textbook, belligerently refuses to turn on a light. There are occasional bright bits (proverbially - they're still 90% in shadow): Eastwood's period-piece mise-en-sc?ne is spotless, and Hoover taking his secretary on a date to show off his Library of Congress cataloguing system is exquisitely awkward. But it's not enough, amidst such a bundle of the laziest, most grimly unrewarding contemporary celebrity biopic tropes, and it's a real slog, to say the least. And then the cracks begin to show - cracks, interestingly, in the film's highly produced facade of monotonous convention, exposing these excruciating interview interludes as commentary on such problematically, inherently manicured personal access (ooh!). As Hoover tackles increasingly more ambitious crimes, we get steadily less of the excruciatingly overproduced interview flashbacks, and more personal access into many of Hoover's accomplishments being? flubbed or exaggerated, as Eastwood sashays into a comfortably gripping pace, flashbacks and all. We get a breezy montage of DiCaprio, summoning his best Catch Me If You Can charm, leading a series of high profile arrests, and posing with Shirley Temple at the red carpet premiere of G-Men. We get impressive cutaways of DiCaprio barking out the need to be constantly vigilant for commies and criminals, only to have his movie theatre PSA being unceremoniously interrupted by an ad for James Cagney's The Public Enemy. And, uneasily, we wonder: is Eastwood poking at the pompous solemnity of Hoover's true crime legacy somewhat? Are we - dare I say it - having fun? It's still too dark to see much, but, at this point, I'll take it!And then, the final reveal: J. Edgar masquerades as a political crime drama, but boil away the surface trappings and we're left with a harrowingly moving unrequited love story. Yes - even the staunchly conservative Eastwood is unafraid to meet those rumours head on, and, upon the introduction of Armie Hammer's Clyde Tolson, and Hoover's eyes slyly, guiltily lingering on him, things take another turn for the even more interesting. Suddenly, Hoover's underbelly is laid bare - a sequence of him nervily practicing diction into the mirror, surveyed by Judi Dench's ferociously tyrannical mother, is far more Aviator than Catch Me If You Can - while his attempted 'coming out' to her, and the ripple effects in his subsequent weekend getaway with Tolson, are genuinely, viscerally heartbreaking. And, for those riding out the film with morbid curiosity as to whether Eastwood will go all the way and dress Hoover in drag (don't deny it; we're all with you), by the time he finally does, it's such a tender, intimate, and emotionally weighty moment that you'll be too busy fighting back tears to explore any inherent camp potential. Hey, it's not like the tenebrous lighting will let you see anything anyway? Awards-baiting aside (not this time!), DiCaprio's performance here is too expansively impressive not to be recognized. Apart from spanning the emotional spectrum of robotically stilted to slickly charismatic to explosively vulnerable, DiCaprio works because he understands what makes Hoover tick - his uncompromising repression, need for control and order, both macro and micro, at all costs, and fear of the power of secrets - and integrates this into every precisely orchestrated scowl, gesture, and cuff-links-straighten. That said, it's, surprisingly, the infinitely charismatic Armie Hammer who walks away with the show, even miraculously out-acting his ludicrously liver-spotted old-age makeup. Each moment Hammer's Tolson is on screen - usually silently in the background - surges with quiet but riveting, palpable emotion, and the preciously few moments he's allowed to uncork are truly stunning and enormously moving. The naturalistic, tender chemistry he shares with DiCaprio is a thing of rare beauty - elating and wholly devastating at once - while his being one of the exceedingly rare examples of a younger actor convincing at 'playing old' is worthy of all accolades in itself. Naomi Watts also delivers consistently emotionally hardy work in the largely thankless role as Hoover's secretary confidante, while Judi Dench was born to play a terrifyingly domineering mother, and infuses each syllable of ruthless intolerance with perfect acrid fervour. Eastwood and Black arguably don't dwell on the amorality of Hoover's political machinations as much as they could (perhaps thinking his reputation served as shorthand enough), but delivering such a powerfully, emotionally charged invasion of his private life feels like its own exquisite justice. Morality aside, Eastwood finds a certain profundity in the identically framed sequences of Hoover ushering in each successive president ("Alrighty"). As times changed, Hoover WAS the consistency of America, or at least its warped dream - and J. Edgar commits the unforgivable offence of understanding him.-7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. Edgar (2011): Dir: Clint Eastwood / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Armie Hammer, Naomi Watts, Judi Dench, Josh Lucas: Another winner by Clint Eastwood that spans decades and presents one of the most powerful men in history. J. Edgar Hoover ran the Bureau of Investigations for some five decades and the film cuts back and forth from his early days where he presented a dominating image of himself, to his dusk where he tells his story but only his version. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a masterful performance under convincing aged makeup and stern mannerism that presented a forceful image to the public while possibly concealing a closet homosexual and his submissive relationship with his mother. His life long partner in the business is Clyde Tolson, played with understanding by Armie Hammer who has proved himself as the aggravated sorority twins in The Social Network. Here he plays Hoover's right hand man who grows frustrated when Hoover conceals his sexuality yet he maintains faithful even when health issues arise. Naomi Watts also makes a great physical transition as Hoover's loyal secretary Helen Gandy whom he seemed at first smitten until she reveals her professional nature. She knows his secrets and is trusted to keep them secured. Judi Dench as his mother obviously disapproves of any notion of homosexual relationships and attempts to wean her son to become more a man. Unfortunately the role is predictable and standard. Josh Lucas makes an appearance as Charles Linbergh. Curious film about one's celebrity and one's secret reality. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Leo Di Caprio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creating a biopic about one of the most powerful man of the 20th century, who built and made what the FBI is nowadays is something of a challenge.But Clint Eastwood is a director whose talent is not to be proved anymore. His movies are always masterpieces and always brings a lot of emotions. J.Edgar is not an exception even if this movie is less known and much underrated than his others pictures.To impersonate a charismatic and powerful character such as Hoover, you need someone who has to be as charismatic and smart as him. Leonardo Di Caprio is the perfect choice. Since Titanic, he has impressed me in each new movie he starred in. In each movie I can see how easily he can get into the skin of the character he is suppose to play. Seeing him as Edgar Hoover is mesmerizing. He is always in the just tone and attitude. Charismatic and powerful when he should be. More vulnerable when he has to. I loved his scenes with Dame Judi Dench who stars as Hoover's mother. We can feel how powerful the relationship between Hoover and his mother was. He impressed everyone he encountered but he was impressed and influenced by his mother. And Leo and Mrs Dench is playing it as perfection.The fact that Clint Eastwood used flashbacks to tell the most important events of Hoover's career at the head of the FBI is well thought and shot but sometimes I felt lost between them. Maybe another approach like a continued story would have been preferable. But besides that, the movie is admirably shot and the recreation of the 1910s and 1930s environment is really well done.It would be also unfair to not notice the beautiful performance of Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts respectively as Clyde Tolson and Helen Gandy. The romantic scenes between Hammer and Di Caprio are really emotional. Seeing those two men loving each other can make some feeling uncomfortable but the relationship between them was not a secret. Naomi Watts was graceful as Miss Gandy and I could feel that she was secretly in love with Edgar Hoover even if they both decided to keep professional. Naomi Watts is also a talented actress and she proved it again in this performance.In conclusion, I'm giving a 8 out of 10. Despite his slow pace, this is still a very beautiful film to enjoy. And if you are a big fan of Leo and Clint then it's definitely worth the view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. Edgar is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a very impressive biography film that informs us on the life of J. Edgar Hoover, who was head of the FBI for almost fifty years, it certainly does a great job of conveying the dedication, as well as struggles, that this man had. It still has many flaws however, probably a lot more than you would expect from a film directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, but the narrative of the film is very confusing, it jumps around to different parts of Hoover's life and this can get very puzzling at times, also I don't think anyone other than DiCaprio was given enough time to shine, a powerful performance is also related to the many actors who support you, but I never felt like anyone else was given a proper opportunity to do so. The best scenes are certainly those with the older Hoover, DiCaprio's performance is the most powerful here as he is almost completely unrecognizable in stunning make up and a powerful voice. It has its downfalls, but J. Edgar is still a very interesting and enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or biography. An exploration of the public and private persons of J. Edgar Hoover, the controversial head of the FBI. Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio Worst Performance: Judi Dench</fullReview>

I don't really know what happened in J.Edgar because the movie was too dark to watch. All I can remember is J.Edgar was director of FBI for over 50 years and that's all I can remember of what happened in the movie. The movie was also really hard to follow as well because it was too dark.So the actors and actress's acting is really good but I don't like the storyline because it's not interesting and the picture was too dark, that's what I like and I don't like about the movie.

		<shortDescription>The Gatekeeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The name of J. Edgar Hoover not only marks half of century of the history of defending the law and making justice in the United States, but still raises passions until today. The developments after the terror attacks on 9/11 have brought back to the front stage of the public debate the balance between rights of the the citizens to be protected and the rights to privacy and freedom of expression, and about the role of the federal government and its agencies in protecting freedom for the many while respecting the rights of the few. 'J.Edgar' the movie clearly belongs to the genre of the biographical documentary, and according to your beliefs you may get out of this film liking or hating it. There is one thing that is hard to deny in my opinion - this film has passion too, same as the character it describes. One may admire J.Edgar for his dedication to the ideals of making out of America a country of law and order according to his own vision or for building out of nothing one of the best government agencies in the US and the world, or one may hate him because of his obsessional search for a no. 1 enemy, or for the methods he put in the service of the cause. One cannot deny reading the biography or watching this film that he was a man of passion.There are things that I loved and things that I hated in the way this film was written (by Dustin Lance Black) and directed by Clint Eastwood. The parallel running of the auto-biography of the character as dictated 40 years later to a young colleague is smartly run in parallel with the 'present' of his late age career at the time of the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations. One character is already old, the other ages and the story advances. I should actually say one triplet of character, as the extraordinary Leonardo DiCaprio (whom I do not like, but I cannot prevent myself to admire) is very well supported by Naomi Watts as the never consumed lover who turns into the eternal secretary of Hoover and Armie Hammer as the eternal friends who also figures up - as rumored by history - as potential lover. All are supported by a Judi Dench as Hoover's pious mother, as splendid as you expect. What I liked less is the ex-screen off-screen story telling, hard to digest even under the pretext of Hoover dictating his memoirs at the sunset of his life, or the schematic sound of some of the dialogs - even bad guys seldom speak on clichs as some of the characters here do. Overall the excellent acting and the well kept pace overwhelm the dark sides of the production.At the end of the day we get another story big as a cinemascope screen of an American hero. Or anti-hero. Depending of course on your beliefs and on the way you relate to the character and the different threads of the story. Hoover appears as a historic character who had to be obsessed with a Public Enemy no. 1 be they real or imaginary. In parallel he lived his personal drama of (historically alleged) homosexuality, the dark secret of the blackmailer who could so easily be blackmailed. One cannot deny that he built a fabulous crime fighting institution which definitely remains his principal legacy. However, Hoover was also for almost half a century a Gatekeeper, even one who loved to present himself as a popular hero, in comics or movies. Here is a very different kind of movie about him. One which leads the viewer at the end to ask the question of what was The Gatekeeper defending his country against.</fullReview>

The choice of coloration that makes the entire movie a dark and gloomy one is indeed unique. It, and also the set selection of mostly indoors, night times, and cloudy days, help set the mood for the movie as a dark one. I personally think it is a great representation of how dark those times were for the USA. Leo's acting is, as always, beyond expectations. He gets really into character in being a relentless investigator and a ferocious spokesperson. Arnie Hammer plays the partner well enough, even though I think it was not Hammer's best performance. Naomi Watts is not really doing a good job considering that she couldn't really make her character stand out. The movie is good, but quite frankly I'd say that it's not for entertainment consumption.

		<fullReview>As a non-American, that is as one who isn't necessarily obliged to insist that the United States of America is the best, most upright country since the dawn of time and a gift of God to mankind to boot, I feel I might be allowed to take a rather more dispassionate view of J Edgar Hoover and his life and work. But I am equally not obliged ? nor, in fact, inclined ? to view the US as the Great Satan of Islamist (and, it has to be said, of some liberal American) propaganda.At the end of the day ? and this might well upset those US citizens who are biased to the first view ? the United States is just another country of several hundred which exist on this earth in 2013, although I must admit it is one that, because of its wealth and the size of its economy, plays an important role in the destiny of other modern countries. (And it should also be remembered that the US has several centuries to go as a 'superpower' before it can even be ranked in the same league as the Persian, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and British empires. And then some.) This might seem like a pretty obscure way to start a film review, but it is, in fact, relevant.It is relevant because depending upon your conception of the United States ? to put it bluntly, hero or villain ? you might also be inclined to take a quite specific view of Hoover. So, for example, Hoover's ruthless, and quite possibly illegal, hounding of American Communists in the early part of the 1920s when a great many of those on the left hoped to emulate the example of the October revolution and turn the US into a socialist country could well be seen by some as perhaps unsavoury but sadly rather necessary if 'freedom' was to be preserved. Others might take a diametrically opposite view. (I might be best advised here to lay out my own views ? obliquely ? by asking whether Hoover's concern for freedom in the United States was also a concern for preserving the freedom of its black population. I rather think it wasn't.)Then one should also consider the means by which he kept a very tight control on the FBI for nigh on 48 years: reputedly he kept secret files on the many presidents he served (and their wives) and was able to safeguard his position as director of the BOI and, from 1935, the FBI by letting them know that he knew what they (or their wives) had been up to. If true ? and it probably was ? it wasn't really quite the behaviour we would expect of a democrat. So this is the deal: you pays your money and (as we say here in Old Blighty) you makes your choice from the different and widely varying accounts of Hoover, his life and work.That observation brings me to a review of the film proper, and to another observation that a film, however well-made and however well-intentioned, is, at the end of the day, essentially a work of fiction (as of course are plays novels, poems and paintings which like to present themselves as biography). So someone hoping to be given a true account of The Man Hoover, His Work and His Life, could well be sold short.For all we now, it might all be true. And it might all be complete nonsense. Or, taking a more liberal tack, some of it might be true and some of it might be nonsense: the crucial point is that we simply don't know and never will. Oliver Stone's JFK faced and faces the same problem. So who was Hoover? In my view Clint Eastwood does his best to give an balanced account, and that is to his credit.Hoover was undoubtedly a very complex man. Was he gay? Did he (as some claim) like to dress up in women's clothing? Who knows? Were he and Clyde Tolson 'a couple' or not? We don't know. And even if they were, would that have any bearing on his work? Given that he lived in a far more homophobic age, the chances are that if he were gay and wanted to keep it quiet, it might well have done.I repeat: we don't know. So let me now get to the point: is Clint Eastwoods's J Edgar a 'good' film and one worth watching? To that I will give an unequivocal 'yes', and in many ways that is down to the extremely good and entertaining performance of Leonard Dicaprio. I think in man years' time when I have already been pushing for a number of years he will be regarded as one of his generation's best actors (and there's a lot of competition). But he has a good supporting cast.There's one aspect of Eastwood's film I should particularly like to highlight: it is, like all films today, a colour film, yet it is so skilfully filmed and light and shadow are so skilfully manipulated that we might well be watching a black and white film. That aspect of it, and Dicaprio's performance, are typical of high standards throughout, so perhaps special mention should also be made of Tom Stern, Eastwood's cinematographer. I recommend it to everyone interested in J Edgar and well-made films. But please remember that it is, first and foremost, a film, a fictional interpretation of the life of a controversial man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How J. Edgar Hoover; the man who turn the small group known as Bureau of Investigation into the FBI, we know of today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love historical movies, and J. Edgar was just one of those movies that wasn't too boring, nor way far out from the historical truth and facts. It wasn't a documentary, but a form of story-telling based on a historical figure. I enjoy the pace of the story, and like being a giant nerd: love seeing the names and images of historical events and names. Reminds me of Hoffa mixed with Brokeback Mountain. J. Edgar Hoover is dramatized in this movie as we see him as the Appointed Director of the Bureau of Investigation. Screenwriter Dustin Lance Black's narrative moves freely among various stages of J. Edgar Hoover's life and career, framed by scenes in which the aging FBI director dictates his memoirs to an admiring young agent. The movie jumps around through his life from 1919 to 1972. In 1921, he became the Deputy Head of the Bureau of Investigation. He had no wife, no girlfriend, practically no social life, and so, the Attorney General promoted him to Appointed Director in 1924 after Anarchist bombings. This is where J. Edgar (Leonardo DiCaprio) meets his new loyal secretary and first love Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) and started to keep personal and confidential files on several people in crime or anyone that was after him, he wanted them investigated and a file started on them. J. Edgar became obsessed with wanting to solve crimes, and the movie focus on some of the most interesting cases during his time, such as the Emma Goldman deporting, and the disappearance of the Charles Lindbergh baby case. Half of the movie, become less about J. Edgar and more about solving this crime to the point, I was asking myself is this about J. Edgar or a movie about the baby case? Also, the movie rarely touch on the rise of the gangsters in the 1930s. I would have love to see John Dillinger in the film since the opening had his death mask on J. Edgar's desk. Nor does the movie talk about what Hoover did during World War 2, or McCarthy's hearings in the 1950's. Joe McCarthy and Hoover had a very interesting feud that would be great for the film. A lost there. It doesn't even talk about his work against the union strikers, his work against the Mafia, and barely talks about his war on Rev. King and the civil right movement. But the civil rights movement was one elephant that couldn't be sidestepped, even by Clint Eastwood. The movie made J. Edgar think Martin Luther King only as a threat. It didn't explore his racist attitude toward blacks. This final crusade against the public opinion that served him so well finally discredited Hoover and his Bureau of Inquisition. Top it off with his moral blackmailing, while hiding his own inadequacies, and you have a dark portrait of the typical hypocrite-persecutor. Not an unlikeable character indeed. He believed that information was power and used wire-tapping. The organization he created was the introduction of fingerprint files, crime labs and agents. He even invented one of the most vicious, racist, and destructive programs ever to emerge from the U.S. Government: Cointelpro. J. Edgar kept his personal life very private. This movie depicts his speculated personal life as having a relationship with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), his FBI Associate Director for nearly 40 years. Whatever went on behind closed doors of their homes will never be known, however in the end, Hoover left his entire estate to Tolson. I think some critics are bashing the film due to its homoerotic. Some critic might view this as homosexual activist's propaganda to promote their perversion or same-sex marriage, but let's remember that J. Edgar was indeed a close-door homosexual. Stop gay bashing. Other supporting cast were great, such as Judi Dench as Anna Hoover, Hoover's overbearing controlling mother. It's shows his fears, a paranoid mother's boy who wants to break out, if it's by creating G-Man comics books and movies, or making this stories more than it seems, desiring a celebrity like status. I love the theme how Edgar couldn't express his love and compensated by channeling his passion into a lust for fame and an obsessive collecting of sexual secrets with which he intimidated prominent political figures. It not a standard biopic but a character study of a paranoid, secretive man. Of course it feels closed in. That's the point! I did have an issue with the old make up for the stars. It really was distracting and I think altered their performance. Tolson, in particular, looks like Boris Karloff's Mummy. Hammer's old man acting is just laughable, but better in his normal age. DiCaprio does a fine job of staying in character including his East Coast accent. Naomi Watts is great, but not greatly noted. While the actors all offered up top notch performances, poor lighting and subpar makeup took away from the aesthetics of the film, while a confusing narrative and humdrum storytelling diminished any impact it might have otherwise had. Perhaps designed to create a visually dark mood to match Hoover's reputation, the scenes are so dark you sometimes can't see what's going on. But that's very far from the main problem. The story, a back 'n' forth between old age and the main events of his life is so choppy that it's often hard to follow. Still, the film inspire you to research more about the man and discover what this man Hoover really did for this country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great triumph for Clint Eastwood as director was his 2011 film, "J. Edgar" about proclaimed (sometimes tarnished) FBI director John Edgar Hoover. The film tracks his life from a young man in 1919 to his death in 1972. Many scenes involved Eastwood obtaining permissions from historical places including the Library of Congress (which was recreated to resemble how it looked when Hoover started the library's card catalog).Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the legendary Hoover and plays him well. However, DiCaprio's voice is quite different than Hoover's own. The story delves into speculation to whether Hoover was a blatant homosexual and even shows a scene of him kissing a man. Many who know some history of this man know his nature was not all that normal.The film was however, fairly accurate on historical events and how Hoover was seen by each generation differently. The power shifts, collide and fall apart in this gritty biographical film of the longest serving FBI director. A great work by Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sure that the master Clint Eastwood squeezed everything possible out from this rather mediocre plot. Or the person of J.E. Hoover was not catchy enough as he was no multi-talent but focused on rather narrow issues for a very long period. Most of the scenes are inside, at home or offices with similar interior, and there are people around wearing similar costumes and haircuts. All this becomes gradually monotonous. Plus reasoning dialogs and inner monologues full of small-mindedness.All the main actors portray their characters both young and old and they are quite convincing - partial thanks to make-up artists. Leonardo DiCaprio is amazingly good, the other gems of the movie are Judy Dench as Hoover's mother who apparently has too strong influence on her son throughout her life, and Naomi Watts as his devoted secretary.The movie is for you if you like historical events and personalities with metaphysical discussions. Otherwise these 2 hours 15 minutes may pass slowly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human strength and weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie intends to be the biographical story of J. Edgar Hoover for many considered the most powerful man in USA while he was director of the FBI till his death in 1972. He is presented here as an almost fanatical enemy of those he considered the very dangerous enemies of his country: communists, radicals and gangsters. He was obsessively chasing and tracking them down and for that purpose he managed to create a huge and powerful body formed with people he recruited and for whom he required the greatest capacity, skill and loyalty. But the movie shows also his human weaknesses. Among others he was lonely,never married and it's even presented here having a gay relation with his closest assistant, Clyde Tolson. It was certainly a difficult movie since it deals with somewhat recent events and characters but it looks like being honest in general terms though I don't know if it is veracious in every detail but this is not important providing it's not false either. In what concerns its technique it uses a very dynamic cut with constant flashbacks and forward moves who draw our attention permanently and the evolution of DiCaprio's make-up that goes on with his aging is excellent and gives a very realistic impression. Not an exceptional movie but a good one indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leo Gives A Powerhouse Performance As J.Edgar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar is a biographical drama that focuses on the career of J. Edgar Hoover,the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for nearly 50 years.It stars Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role together with Armie Hammer, Naomi Watts, Josh Lucas, Judi Dench and Ed Westwick in key supporting roles.The film explores the public and private life of one of the most powerful, controversial and enigmatic figures of the 20th century.It was written by Dustin Lance Black and directed by Clint Eastwood.The narrative moves freely from various stages of J. Edgar Hoover's life and career, framed by scenes in which the aging FBI director dictates his memoirs to an admiring young agent. The events that were included were his crusade against supposed Communists; his involvement in the capture and trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, who was convicted of kidnapping and murdering Charles Lindbergh's infant son; the creation of the infamous confidential files he kept on his many enemies; his relationship with Clyde Tolson,his lifelong friend, companion, and conscience; and his vendetta against Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960's. The point of view is not entirely unsympathetic, but while it's clear that Hoover was responsible for several crime-fighting innovations, it's equally apparent that this coarse, insecure, socially inept man remained forever under the sway of his overbearing mother, was only too happy to break the law when it suited him, scolded others with self-righteous vigor, and lied shamelessly about his own heroic exploits. In view of all that, it's easy to understand why Hoover's legacy is controversial, to say the least.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a powerhouse performance as Hoover.No question that he remains one of the most formidable and talented young actors we have around in Hollywood.As for Eastwood's direction, he has long since established himself as a master of his craft, and although the lengthy film has its tedious moments.Also,his direction does not allow the viewer into getting to know the FBI director's psyche due to his cautious portrayal of the man,the lack of energy and excitement in the screenplay and somewhat confusing narrative as it was told in a non- linear fashion.Interest in getting to know the man is essential to fully appreciate it.But nevertheless,it remains to be an admirable and excellent film.Giving it the highest rating is fair enough considering for Leo's portrayal of Hoover alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not exactly a movie. but an essay. about power. about power of a man. the good point - mixture between a great director, a wise cast and story. because it is not a biographic film but search of intentions, gestures, decisions of a legend. result - a kind of parable. about truth and necessity of lies, about patriotism and private life like a drawing. a film of Judi Dench, Emma Watson and Clint Eastwood. but, more than, a magnificent work of Leonardo di Caprio. sure, the expectations was great, the disappointment may be large. but important is the director intentions. a movie about a mystery person must be, in many senses, a fiction. the rumors becomes truth. the myth is credited as reality. it is not a bad solution. only a way to present an existence not in skin of a pink novel but in its basic lines. sure, the make-up of old Tolson is a catastrophe. sure, the real facts are smoke balloons. but the final result is impressive. for suggestions, for full image, for the crumbs presented today in politic. for the hunting against un-patriots, for need to control society, for dose of fear and desire to be absolute master of others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Not Entirely Satisfying Taste Of A Very Complex Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar Hoover. I know enough about American history and American politics to know that the very name was enough to strike both fear and loathing into the hearts of successive American presidents for decades. J. Edgar Hoover. For almost 40 years the director of the FBI, played in this bio-pic by Leonardo DiCaprio.The movie (directed by Clint Eastwood) includes a lot of interesting reflections on Hoover's life and what made him the man he was - a complicated relationship with his mother; a complicated relationship with Clyde Tolson, his assistant director and close friend/lover/whatever; obsessively self-promoting and obsessively jealous of agents who got too much publicity. He's certainly a worthy enough choice for this kind of bio-pic. The movie basically shifts back and forth from the investigation into the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby in 1932 up to Hoover's declining years in the 1960's and early 70's. There's a great deal of interesting material 9mostly related to the subjects I've already mentioned.)Di Caprio was an interesting choice to play Hoover. To be perfectly honest, I can't say that he really leapt out at me in the role. Armie Hammer was better as Clyde Tolson. The most interesting scenes in the movie are probably those between DiCaprio and Hammer as a glimpse is offered into Hoover's private life (which is still a source of debate.) The movie moved too often and too abruptly between the two time periods, with the result that it didn't seem to flow very naturally to me. Obviously, with almost all of the scenes being set in the two afore-mentioned time periods, there's a lot of material from Hoover's career left out.So, the movie certainly gives one a taste of how complex a character Hoover was, but it doesn't entirely satisfy.

		<shortDescription>Great Film! Another Snubbed Oscar Worthy Performance from Leo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not have nominated this movie for Best Picture, but Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in this movie was most certainly Oscar-Worthy. While there are hints of Leo's earlier performances, like when he played Howard Hughes in The Aviator, in this movie, Leo experiments with a role he hasn't done before. He takes on aging make-up to play an older J. Edgar. For the first time, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a man who may have been a homosexual and plays it off most subtlety, with much nuance, as opposed to the in your face, out there performances of Sean Penn as Harvey Milk or Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in Brokeback Mountain, all of which either won or were nominated for Oscars.It is amazing that Clint Eastwood has been able to continue to make a name for himself not just as an actor in his twilight years, but more so as a story-teller or director. Eastwood even has his own look to a movie that shines through and helps tell the story of J. Edgar. That sepia-toned look in his movies has become the Clint Eastwood trademark of his films, that and a jazzy soundtrack of his making! The script was well put together. J. Edgar could easily have been a three and a half hour epic movie that covers the entire period J. Edgar was director of the FBI, and would have lost an audience very fast, but the screenwriter chooses two main periods of J. Edgar's life [1919-1935, 1962-1972] and masterfully ties the two periods in together. To clock in at 137 minutes is an epic feat.While not an exceptionally exceptional Eastwood film, it is one worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of Eastwood, DiCaprio, or both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It never claimed to be a documentary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This appears to be another highly accomplished and intelligent work from an "Old Master" that will need a few years to finally gain the recognition it deserves. Part of the problem may be that it is not a topic or type of film that most people would expect from Eastwood. He runs afoul of "expectations" much as Scorsese did with "The Aviator" (a biographical epic which may be that director's masterpiece...despite it's losing the Best Picture Oscar to Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby"...how ironic that both that study of H. Hughes and this portrait of J. E. Hoover share not only a leading man but a dazzling sense of period and cinema technique that leaves much of modern film craft in the shade.).One wonders if the critical brickbats and public indifference that contributed to this films lack of recognition were not largely in response to ultra macho "grand old man" Eastwood taking on the subject of Hoover's clandestine and as depicted here, never acted upon homosexuality. Criticism of the film as being confusing and unable to fully chronicle this mysterious man's remarkable life seem like a lazy knee jerk reaction to this director attempting to move far outside his usual range.To me this is one of his most graceful, deft, and rewarding jobs as a director yet...and he helps guide stars Di Caprio and Armie Hammer to their richest and most resonant performances. To label the film as an incomplete documentation of it's subject's existence or endlessly quibble about a few technical imperfections (yes, some of the aging makeup is not 100% perfect seems heartless when the performances coming through the makeup are so brilliant).In summary...if you are looking for gripping drama, some witty high comedy, great acting, and a superstar director proving that he has reserves of sensitivity and dynamism that may well be bottomless you should ignore the quibbles...sit back...and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complicated Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a somewhat true story about J. Edgar Hoover, one of the most secretive and complicated men in our history, who was credited with establishing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).The word "somewhat' is important here because we can never really know all the truth about J. Edgar and the swirl of rumors that flourished during his time and even now. However, we are convinced that the most important thing in his life was making sure the United States government was protected from Communist infiltration.The story starts out with J. Edgar retelling his life story to set the (read " his") record straight. I do not recall an autobiography of Hoover that was of any consequence so this was a surprise to me, but no matter - this technique mixed with past and present day events was fine and filled in some blanks that may have been harder to explain otherwise. It is generally agreed that Hoover kept secret files on top government officials and numerous celebrities to be used as leverage when he wanted things his way. His credo was "information is power." After Hoover's death, President Nixon had his offices ransacked looking for those files. The movie makes it clear that J. Edgar was drawn to men instead of women with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) as his love interest. There were rumors of Hoover's cross-dressing only after his mother (Judy Dench) had passed on if we are to believe Director Clint Eastwood's interpretation. All was tastefully done and there were no uncomfortable moments in here. What was good? An Oscar should go to DeCaprio's Make-up man. DeCaprio was made to really look like Hoover. Kudos. DiCaprio's speech pattern for J. Edgar was spot on and we know this from newsreels of Hoover back in the day. All the acting performances were excellent. DiCaprio is always deserving of a Best Actor nomination. And, I especially liked Jeffrey Donovan's portrayal of Bobby Kennedy.What was not so good? The film was shot in color, but most of the scenes were in the dark or with low lighting giving the black/white dramatic effect to further promote Hoover's secrecy concepts.What was "somewhat" confusing? There is that word again. I couldn't help wondering if things may have turned out differently for J. Edgar if Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) didn't rebuff him when he made attempts at romance in that library. Nothing more is learned about her except she became his secretary throughout his life and kept his secrets. J. Edgar leaves his estate to Tolson but, we did see a niece early on and no other family was introduced or noted. We can consider both as somewhat confusing and unexplained loose ends.We may never know the full impact J.Edgar Hoover had on this country, but even with his good and bad traits, the idiosyncrasies, and secrets, his drive to make the United States safe cannot be denied. Simply put, he was a complicated man.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb uttered by the Richard Nixon character, and not much soft stuff by others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Private life of Edgar J. Hoover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1987 there was a TV film called "J. Edgar Hoover" where Treat Williams played the role of the former boss of FBI. To be frankly I liked much more that old film than this new one. The reason is that in 1987 the film goes more into the problems managed by Hoover. The new one with DiCaprio goes more into the sentimental aspects of the Eastwood's hero. In the film there are perhaps some facts, which require more information of what really happened. For example, Nixon decided from the very beginning to fire Hoover once elected in 1968. The 1987 film showed Hoover crying and asking Mr Nixon to reconsider this decision, while in the present film Mr. Nixon requested private files to be given to him and firing Hoover at the same time. The bitter relationship of Hoover with Kennedys is slightly shown in the film, but little is also shown about his relationship with other presidents as Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon Johnson. Hoover was a man who lasted for long as FBI director and his work is covered superficially. With this film one never can understand why an anticommunist as Hoover had so bad opinion about Joseph McCarthy, a man of similar political thinking. This film emphasized too much the love relationship of Hoover with his assistant, it would have been better to have a balance of his work and of his personal relationship. His mother (Judy Dench) seemed to be far away of knowing the real attractions of his son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I cannot understand the bashing that the movie received. Agreed, the make-up wasn't great, but wasn't as bad as some made it out to be (The make-up on Armie Hammer was laughable though). One thing I would say here is that this movie is slow, which is not everyone's cup of tea. After reading a few reviews, I had no idea what to expect when I started watching, but unlike most of the people here I was pretty much satisfied at the end.I don't know much about the 'real' Edgar Hoover so I don't know how much of the movie is spot-on in terms of his real persona, but boy oh boy Leonardo had the depiction spot-on! He is one of those who take time to understand their character and simply marvel acting as such. That's one of the many reasons he is my favourite actor. Here I must stress that he wasn't the only one, most of the actors took their roles quite seriously and were, for the most part, spot-on. But I felt the script was weak. It could've been made a little more interesting. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, but I'm not sure if he is ever going to be remembered as one of the greatest directors. But imagine trying to do a film surrounding the life of one of the most secretive men in history. A man, about whom, most of the life history is made up of rumours. The movie shows Hoover's strict standards that he laid down, his loyalty to his work and his rise to the top of the law enforcement in the US. He basically helped the way crimes are solved. He was completely clueless when it came to the opposite sex, and may or may not have been homosexual.Overall this movie is good if you're into the whole history thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leo elevates this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say he's mastered a Brooklyn accent, but I won't deny that Leonardo DiCaprio can act, and sometimes even act well. In J. Edgar, I saw him transform into a character with more potency than anything in his previous career. The movie itself is a little stiff and bloodless, but he elevates it.Clint Eastwood's depiction of J. Edgar is arguably bizarre in its construction. He jumps between the decades, until you realize that you are watching three different narratives progressing at the same time. We have J. Edgar: the mother's son, and the socially troubled individual. We have J. Edgar, the closet homosexual who loves Agent Tolson (his assistant director) but can't express himself. And then we have J. Edgar: the old man, sick, paranoid, and abusing his prescriptions, and yet unwilling to retire; a fighter to the end. As is common of Eastwood movies, this one is shot like a film noir, with heavy intense shadows. Even in daytime, the film looks kind of dark. As a story, J. Edgar does have a few issues. There are times when you feel it could go deeper, but where the movie stumbles the most however is Make-up. In trying too hard to age Leo and costar Armie Hammer, the make up dept has made them look almost non-human at times.The film succeeds primarily as a wide step forward for DiCapprio. This might be his best role yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's decent, though nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not Eastwood's strongest work, not even close. One of the things about the actual J. Edgar Hoover is that his private life was never made clear to anyone outside him and his supposed closest friends. So making a movie that takes such a strong stance on what he really was behind the closed doors is a bit unsettling. That is not always a problem in these kinds of films, but in this case I would have hoped for a bit more ambiguous story. Something that hinted at, but didn't explicitly state.The other problem with this movie is its narrative, which is all over the place. Some parts of the story are told rather well, portraying Eastwood's considerable talent, but the movie lacks focus. It jumps between the two timelines way too much, which leaves the viewer confused and somewhat annoyed, because no single scene is allowed to grow and be continued upon. The choice to tell the story as flashbacks as told by the aging Hoover was unwise in my opinion. Just start at his youth and go on from that.But, the film has its upsides as well. It perhaps doesn't portray J. Edgar Hoover ambiguously enough for my personal tastes, but it manages to nail the feeling of the man in question. Throughout the movie you will grow to both respect and despise this man of singular vision that sacrificed pretty much anything to reach the goal that he had set for himself/that was set for him. And that is admirable. Furthermore, DiCaprio makes a great role in this film. He perhaps wasn't the perfect choice as far as his look go, but he has the charisma and the acting talent to portray this man correctly and that's exactly what he did with this role. A good choice in my opinion.So yeah, it's not a perfect movie. The narrative is all over the place, the story takes some strange liberties with the real-world source material and the effects to age the two main actors look really fake and distracting. But, it's not a bad film. It's just average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What we all suspected of J. Edgar Hoover, conveyed with as much tact as was possible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface by saying that the IMDb storyline is brief but spot on. As a staunch and steadfast fan and admirer of the works of both DiCaprio and Eastwood, I eagerly awaited to see this movie; so don't count on me to be unbiased. The only work by Eastwood I don't like is precisely the few movies he's on the record for admitting himself weren't among his best decisions (paraphrasing of course).The movie is a subtle biopic of J. Edgar Hoover. There are numerous scenes where the main character utters statements that make you cringe, and made me silently curse with outrage. Take this one: "I could care less whether they've committed a crime and more with the intent to." And these: "Sometimes you need to bend the rules a little to keep your country safe?", "Information is power". In another instance, (paraphrasing) "I was not blackmailing him, merely letting him know I was being a friend by safeguarding him from what would be devastating to his reputation if it were to be known." Not to leave out this gem: "Find me something on them... or make it up." Hoover is painted as a narcissist, mama's boy, coward, liar, repressed homosexual, hypocrite etc.etc., but one who did build the crime fighting federal agency (FBI)that was to become the envy of many countries. Producer Director Eastwood reigned in what could have easily been a one sided depiction, to show the subject had some accomplishments despite how he achieved them, or what kind of person he was. DiCaprio is excellent; I don't recall any of his previous characters being so lacking in social value and so ideologically contrary. Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts are superb supporting actors in their roles as Clyde Tolson and Helen Gandy.</fullReview>

If I were to put the blame on someone, it's the screenwriters fault. The only problem were your big expectations, given the fact that Dicaprio's latest like 10 movies were masterpieces and I would say the trailer is too promising as well.The movie has 2 layers : the present where Edgar is old and the past, where his story is revealed. With the storyteller talking about the event before it happens, they did create quality tension in some scenes. As always, Leo makes a very authentic intense role. In fact, he is the main reason I'm telling you to give this movie a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating but bad makeup and too much time jumping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of J Edgar Hoover and what he accomplished is actually very interesting. The faults with this movie are the jumping around in time and the bad makeup for ageing the actors. I am usually bored by the slow pace of Eastwood's movies and wish they would end earlier. I was pleasantly surprised how engrossed I was in this movie. The early days of the FBI and crime solving like the beginning of fingerprinting and use of specialists is quite fascinating. There are various historical figures and events that are dealt with including the Lindbergh kidnapping and the Kennedys. The homosexual relationship is shown more as a love story but isn't too explicitly dealt with. The acting is good. Leonardo is intense and acts well. Luckily he isn't imitating a person who's mannerisms and speech are not that well known today so unlike My Week with Marilyn you don't have to compare too much. Armie Hammer as his assistant Clyde Tolson shows some range. Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy is good and looks quite right in the old fashioned garb. Her ageing makeup was okay unlike the others. Judi Dench was a mistake with her fierce face and her British accent.The flaws have been mentioned a quite a lot by critics and it is surprising how obvious and easily they could have been fixed. The makeup for ageing the actors (Leo and Armie) was terrible both inconsistent with the time frames and frightfully artificial to look at. Sometimes they looked older in the middle of their lives than at the end. It would have been better if they just added some grey instead of making them look so ghastly. The jumping round in time was excessive. One or two flashbacks would have been okay but here there were flashbacks too often and it broke the narrative and caused confusion. It would have been so much better if the story had simply been chronological.If the 2 main faults had been fixed it might have been one of the better movies of the year. But in the end the flaws don't detract that much from what is a good biopic and the movie is still very worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacing and Makeup are the flaws of J. Edgar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do I kill everything that I love? J. Edgar is Clint Eastwood's latest biopic that tells the story of Edgar Hoover's life and how he created the FBI during a span of over fifty years. Hoover was a very controversial character, some people hated him and others loved him, but Eastwood doesn't take any sides; he simply allows us to judge his work for ourselves showing us the good and the bad. Hoover didn't have an idealistic life either; Eastwood also focuses on his personal life and exposes some of his secrets. The film was written by Dustin Lance Black, who also wrote the Oscar nominated biopic: Milk, but unlike in that movie, this time the story suffers from a very slow pace. The weakest thing about J. Edgar is truly its pacing. The subject matter is just so wide that the movie fails to focus on just one particular detail and tries to mash everything together with a series of numerous flashbacks. There were some very interesting moments during the story, but they were just too far spread out and most of the film was really a bore to sit through. I wish the film would have focused more on just one or two aspects instead of trying to include such a broad range. By trying to show everything that went on in Edgar's life, we truly end up not knowing much. This movie suffers from the typical case of trying to say so much that you end up not saying anything at all. The film should of focused on a much shorter time period (let's say the Lindbergh case for example which was probably the most interesting part of the film) instead of covering all the specific details. The highlights of this film however are the performance from Leonardo DiCaprio as Hoover, and the art direction which is just beautiful (like in every Eastwood film). As for the story, the movie begins with an older version of J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) narrating his memories to one of the agents and telling him to write his memoirs. It was during the communist hunt that J. Edgar found the opportunity to tighten his grip in the law enforcement agency and make important arrests after several communist revolutions began taking place across several major cities in the US. Hoover was completely dedicated to his job and slowly began building what today we know as the FBI. He had a very awkward social behavior, and very few friends. They called him Speedy for the way he talked, and he was very close to his mother (Judi Dench), to whom he looked up too all the time for advice. He trusted very few people, one of them was his personal secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) and the other his right hand man and personal assistant, Agent Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), with whom he had a secret love affair despite the fact that he tried to deny it and hide it. After the witch hunt was over with, Hoover's attention shifted to arresting important gangsters and mafia groups, and in doing so he slowly began to build the Bureau. He had secret personal files on every United States president he served under, whether it was Roosevelt or Kennedy. The true highlight of the film and the turning point for the Agency's autonomy came with the Lindbergh case which received a lot of media attention after a child was kidnapped from his own home. Hoover used this case to build prestige for the Bureau and create a fingerprint database of every citizen in order to solve crimes easier. He built the Federal Bureau of Investigation and this is how he did it.One of the most distracting things about J. Edgar is the makeup. Some of the actors really looked bad when they had to play older versions of themselves (Armie Hammer above all). They should've stuck with hiring older actors to play those roles because the makeup really didn't work. It was awful. Leonardo DiCaprio does save this movie however, from being bad thanks to a great performance. He deserved an Oscar nomination, but I guess the film just wasn't good enough. Armie Hammer also was great in his supporting role, but his makeup when playing an older version of himself distracted us from his true performance. The rest of the supporting cast just doesn't have enough time to shine on screen, with the exception of Judi Dench who is as brilliant as usual. Naomi Watts did have plenty of screen time, but she really didn't have a memorable performance. I'd have to say that J. Edgar is one of Eastwood's weakest films, but I am still a huge fan of his work and wish him the best in his upcoming projects. The subject matter in this film is interesting, but the pacing is just poorly done. I recommend it only for DiCaprio or Eastwood fans although I wouldn't be watching this film a second time.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was powerful. Judi Dench did a great job portraying Hoover's mother, and of course you will note that I liked the part when she was teaching him to dance.Tolson portrayal was good, but toward the end his prosthetic makeup as an older man made him look like a really bad store mannequin. His face also reminded me of the dummies in the seatbelt commercial of some years ago. I did like his fashion sense early in the movie, and along with Mrs. Hoover Tolson did great work in convincing J. Edgar to get some high quality clothes that would make a leadership statement.The Shirley Temple part was cute. Too bad Shirley did not teach Hoover to tap dance up and down the steps, lol.How on earth could Hoover's private secretary stay with him all those years? The money must have been great. She said she would never marry him? In today's times, he may have gotten married to Tolson.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychoanalyzing J. Edgar Hoover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard several bad reviews about "J. Edgar". It had also been roundly snubbed at the recent Oscar nomination announcement -- no nomination for Best Picture, Director, Actor nor Screenplay. I am not exactly a fan of Clint Eastwood as a director as he tends to make overlong melodramatic movies, like "Changeling" or "Million Dollar Baby." I am though a fan of biographical films, so despite all the prior "warnings," I still went on to watch it.You know what? It is not all that bad after all. It was actually a very good overview of who J. Edgar Hoover was, a man who led the FBI for almost 50 years. We get a glimpse of his similarly controversial private life as a old bachelor who lived with his mother (Judi Dench). Furthermore we also get to meet Hoover's constant aide and companion Clyde Tolson (Arnie Hammer). I thought it was pretty fair and interesting summary of this prominent man's life and career, although you know they were just skimming off the surface of a thicker brew.Leonardo diCaprio did very well in the lead role. I admit it is not too easy to get rid of his star appearance, even behind his make-up, but I say he pulled this off. Arnie Hammer played Tolson very well as a young man. But as Tolson aged, with the ugly old man make-up, so does Hammer's performance falter. Clint Eastwood does a very good job in psychoanalyzing the driving force behind this powerful man. Dustin Lance Black (who won the Oscar for the Screenplay of "Milk") wrote this story with obvious homosexual undertones. I do think though that this film is worth the time to watch to get to know J. Edgar Hoover a little better. I think this film should have gained at least one Oscar nomination, and that is for Best Actor. Leonardo diCaprio deserves at least that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning! This review is pundressed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Mesa (that would be me) was chosen to investigate the Clint Eastwood bio picture "J. Edgar". Who chose J. Mesa? I guess some controversial agency that jumped the pun gun by selecting the aforementioned pun- induced movie aficionado, which would be J. Mesa not J. Edgar. Anyways, Sir Eastwood's "J. Edgar" focuses on the life of the longtime F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover, who dressed up the F.B.I. with revolutionary methods such as innovative fingerprinting and creative investigation; and at the same time cross-dressed himself with women's attire. Sorry, Mr. Hoover! Eastwood direction was very astute by developing the narrative not only on J. Edgar's aggressive stance on deporting the radical communists of the 20's and capturing the famed bank robbers of the 30's, but also on his lifelong relationship with his right-hand man and FBI assistant director Clyde Tolson. It has been perceived that the men had a romantic relationship for many years. "J. Edgar" actually fixates itself more on the Hoover and Tolson relationship than the evolution and progression of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; that is probably because the movie's script was in the hands of Academy Award winning screenwriter and gay activist Dustin Lance Black. Eastwood also gets very maternal with the movie by prioritizing J. Edgar's relationship with his caring but domineering mother Anna Marie Hoover. Eastwood is infamous for instilling melancholy themes within his movies, and he does more of that in "J. Edgar"; even there are more incorporated in J. Edgar's personal life than his professional life. The Lindbergh baby kidnapping case which was instrumental in enacting kidnapping federal laws is also featured in "J. Edgar". Leonardo DiCaprio does not shy away in accentuating another acting performance with a thick accent, this time Leo goes verbally mid-Atlantic in fine fashion with his excellent portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover. Armie Hammer proves that his twin-killing debut acting effort as the Winklevoss twins was no fluke by hammering down another noticed performance as Clyde Tolson. The mother of all British actresses Judi Dench proved that as long as she has a heartbeat an excellent acting performance is a sure thing. Dench was great as always in her performance as Mama Hoover. Watts the F*ck! Naomi Watts even looks hot as an aging woman, as she was most of the time in heavy makeup in her admirable performance as Hoover's longtime secretary Helen Gandy; if you are not into a geriatric Naomi, there is no need to worry because a younger Naomi is seen a few times during the movie's first chapter. The rest of the supporting cast of "J. Edgar" was mainly comprised of a bureau of Hollywood-funded seasoned actors portraying historic U.S. figures; including Josh Lucas as Lindbergh, Ken Howard as Harlan Stone, Dermet Mulroney as Colonel Schwarzkopf, and Jeffrey Donovan as Robert F. Kennedy. OK, so Donovan is not exactly a seasoned actor but he burns to be noticed. OK, I will cut it out with the pun bureaucracy; mainly because my movie investigation of "J. Edgar" is almost over. In all, though it's not a perfect movie, "J. Edgar" is worth for you to investigate at your nearest movie theatre. **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Origins of Scientific Detection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certain figures are larger than life. J Edgar Hoover ranks highest among them in a career that spanned 55 years from 1917 to his death in 1972 at age 77. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of a lifetime as the bull dog who forged a sleepy federal agency into the premier law enforcement agency mastering the art of scientific detection. Only the great actor Jimmy Cagney who often played G-Men could have done better.The story is told as a retrospective account Hoover toward the end of his life dictated to a newly minted agent. The story begins in the Palmer raids following the bomb radicals had planted at the home of Attorney General Mitchell Palmer (Geoff Pierson). "One more turn of the rocking chair and the AG would have been splat," Hoover recalls. Though G-Men would later assume an air of professionalism and scientific dissection of crime, Hoover arms the G-Men with hand guns and does allow the rough stuff on the radicals. The radicals Hoover complains enjoy too much rapport with the public. "What's important," Hoover tells the G-Men, "at this time is to re-clarify the difference between hero and villain."An agent who expresses the reservation that "The crimes we are investigating aren't crimes, they are ideas," is summarily dismissed even though he is a friend of Hoover.No real Americans were damaged by The Palmer raids. Hoover found an ally at DOL (Immigrations) to ensure that many culprits were sent back where they belonged.Neither the Palmer raids of the 1910s nor the excesses of the Roaring Twenties cemented the FBI's position as the nation's premier law enforcement agency. It was the identification of the Lindurgh kidnapper which made the Bureau. And this was no simple task accomplished despite a botched investigation by Jersey State Police and interference from the national hero Charles Lindburgh. In the process Hoover invented scientific detection even if he had to close DOJ's smoking lounge to do so.Dr Albert Osborne: Is that all Mr. Hoover? I have a 2:30 class to teach. J. Edgar Hoover: No, you don't. Consider your pay doubled; you now work for your country. Congratulations, Dr. Osborne.Ever brilliant and always effective in self-promotion, Hoover despite claims to the contrary secretly funded favorable Jimmy Cagney movies about the Feds, giving rise to the Great Myth that Washington can solve all local problems. But he kept his eye on politics or more particularly politicians, to ensure he maintained his fiefdom. By the time of Nixon, Nixon did not even ask to see the confidential files.The film is long and some say it drags. However I might have liked to see Clint Eastwood's spin on how Hoover ended the open mob warfare of the 1920s. More likely than a few apprehensions of some notorious bad guys, the FBI cut a deal with the Mafia to put a lid on the gun battles, kidnappings and bank robberies prevalent throughout the 1920s. Hoover publicly denied that the Mob existed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. Edgar was a good film about one of the most powerful men in US Government history in a way even more powerful than the 8 Presidents he served under. Leonardo DiCaprio led by Director Clint Eastwood portray this powerful man in public as a Sad, Pathetic and Vengeful man in private who was what we we call in today's world as gay but this was prior to gay being accepted. He aggressive attacks against all who he believed were attempting to bring down the United States by legal or illegal means sounded like word for word like the words that are used today by the entire Republican Party it was scary I hope all the Republican Presidential Nominees see this film and learn something from it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The age make up stinks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone compared this movie to Citizen Kane and in a way they are right. There are parallels between Charles Foster Kane and J. Edgar Hoover, in that they were both people who were initially idealistic with good intentions but in the end were corrupted by their tremendous power and died broken, pathetic old men. SPOILER before the death scene at the movie's end, you almost expect DiCaprio's Hoover to whisper Rosebud. Clint Eastwood does his usual masterful job directing this film and like others I wanted to mention the outstanding musical score. Some have called this movie superficial but I think it does as good as can be expected when you consider it has only a little over two hours to cover Hoover's eventful half century stint as Director. I have two complaints with the film, rather minor, one is that it cuts back and forth so much between past and present that its rather disconcerting and also the makeup on DiCaprio and the one playing Tolson, no nice way to say it folks it stinks, its a joke. DiCaprio is still too youthful to look convincing in old age makeup and Tolson's makeup is just laughable. However, DiCaprio does give a tour de force performance that perhaps might win him an Oscar. His Hoover is portrayed as a very complex and difficult man. He took a corrupt, inefficient government agency and made it into the greatest law enforcement agency in the world. He had children playing G Men in the streets, but at what cost? The question I had watching this film is perhaps is it safe for one person to have to power that Hoover did? This was a man that Presidents were afraid of and deferred to. However, we also see Hoover's personal demons as well. Judi Dench does a A+ job as Hoover's domineering mother, he was a real mama's boy. Its almost chilling in the scene where she tells him she would rather have him dead then be a "daffodil". I am glad that Eastwood didn't go overboard with the, ahem, issue of Hoover's preferences. SPOILER ALERT, yes we do get to see him in a dress but only briefly. Yes there is a scene where him and Clyde Tolson kiss, however its only after they about beat each other to death! This is a fine film, but they get a lot of the historical facts wrong. I have read about twenty books on Hoover and they messed up at certain points. Hoover didn't actually arrest Hauptmann it was the state police, Hoover didn't actually dictate the hateful letter that Martin Luther King got that encouraged him to kill himself, it was an agent named William Sullivan. When Hoover called Bobby Kennedy to tell him about the assassination Bobby was at home having lunch he wasn't at his office as shown in the film. The most glaring error in the film is that it shows Hoover and his agents arresting public enemy Alvin Karpis in 1936 while still working on the Lindburgh case. Bruno Hauptmann was arrested in 1934, tried in 1935 and executed in 1936, get your facts straight guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked this up in a remainder bin. That should have told me a lot.Let me count the ways this overly long biopic fails:(1) The lighting while intended to be atmospheric capturing the 1930s/40s, starts to get very irksome a wee way in. I want to see the characters not squint through the entire film.(2) The writing fell far short of exploring the complex character of J. Edgar, traits are lightly touched on and then irritatingly withdrawn or totally incomplete - i.e. his rampant racism and hatred of MLK is offered without explanation.(3) The aspect of Hoover's homosexuality is barely touched upon and his cross-dressing shown as a one-off event after his mother's death.(4) The makeup was completely over the top, especially but not limited to Armie Hammer playing his lover Colson. More suited to a comedy skit.(5) The sequence of events is all over the place, very distracting and also Hoover's lies about events are depicted as if reality and much much later revealed to be fantasy.(6) Overall a shambles of a film. But lawd, how they tried.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid workmanlike job but lacks feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an old man in his office trying to put his life on paper. He begins in 1919 when police procedures are haphazard and Bolsheviks try several bombings. It's long climb to the top of the FBI as he takes on radicals, gangsters, and everybody in between.Director Clint Eastwood is very straight forward with this biopic. Leonardo DiCaprio does a reasonable job, but I'm always certain that this is Leo. It's especially true as an old Hoover with the obvious makeup. He never truly loses himself in the role. Maybe Eastwood's approach is too traditional and lack real feelings. It never digs too deeply into his inner self. The movie shows what he did but I never get a sense of his soul. It's very hard to get a feel for the character. It's solid workmanship filmmaking. It's cold. It's prodding. Leo does a solid mimicry job. The movie cares more about his organizational skills but I want to feel something about him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Eastwood Gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting ridicule, vilification, or even justification, this would be the wrong movie to watch on J. Edgar Hoover.Eastwood delivers a dark brooding, and rather objective look at one of the most controversial and polarizing figures in America. While the story itself may not be overly compelling, it does offer explanations behind some of the motivations that made up the man, John Edgar Hoover. The cinematography was a crucial element in creating and maintaining throughout a sense of secrecy, brooding, alienation, as well as distance. The chronology is disparate and effective: at times we see Hoover dictating his memoirs to an array of journalists and then we are taken back to the time in question, all the while framed in this overcast mood that fits the film and its subject matter perfectly. As a matter of fact, the manner in which this was filmed constitutes, to me, the biggest indication of Eastwood's opinion one way or the other - Hoover was a dark man with some even darker secrets.J.Edgar's homosexuality as well as his proclivity for cross-dressing are only suggested and are handled with the utmost sensitivity. There is one scene which strongly implies his helplessness with his desires to cross-dress that was simply quite touching. And the relationship between Hoover and Tolson was beautifully written. No, I did not come away feeling empathy/sympathy for Hoover at all; neither were any of my perceptions surrounding him challenged in the least. I did leave the film however with surely a more heightened sense of his humanity.This could NOT have been accomplished however, were it not for the positively riveting performance by Di Caprio. This guy can just ACT, okay? The other supporting players were equally excellent, most notably, Judi Dench who played his overbearing mother, Naomi Watts as his faithful secretary, Helen Gandy, and Armie Hammer, as Hoover's lifelong companion, Clyde Tolson. Some of the movie's most compelling scenes involved these three and all three gave powerhouse supporting performances to match Di Caprio.I highly recommend as yet another excellent outing from a very good director.

		<shortDescription>A Solid Attempt At J Edgar Hoover's Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio), powerful head of the FBI for nearly 50 years, looks back on his professional and personal life.The film starts out strong with Emma Goldman and a little humor (an agent saying, in regards to his mustache, that "the ladies appreciate it"). And overall the movie is quite strong throughout, looking great and really telling a complicated story in a relatively simply way.I am not sure how I like the presentation of Hoover and Tolson, with Tolson coming across as quite flamboyant. The film strongly leans towards the rumor of their homosexual relationship, or at least pushing Tolson as gay. I can see this as a positive thing, trying to recruit Hoover as a gay icon, but it just has no basis in fact -- the rumors have never been proved, so to make them a part of the film was misguided.We also see the complicated nature of Hoover, a man who pushed for the Lindbergh Law to go after kidnappers and at the same time argued that he had no jurisdiction to take on organized crime. He had no jurisdiction on kidnapping until he pushed for it, so clearly he had priorities.Because of the style and subject matter, this makes a great companion piece to "Public Enemies". This is the better film ,but they overlap nicely in certain respects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story Just Isn't Complete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have mentioned, "J. Edgar" is more of a character study than a straightforward biography or documentary, and there are times when "soap opera" might be a more appropriate term. The general picture it paints is one of an ultra-neurotic buffoon, albeit one with a few admirable qualities. Although Hoover may have been a hard guy to completely like or admire, it just seems the creators had some issues with their subject that show through a bit too obviously. Also, the way the film reverberates between public (Hoover's formation of the FBI, Communist subversives, kidnapping of the Lindbergh's baby, etc) and private life (his close relationship with his overbearing mother, awkwardness with most other women,workaholism,cross-dressing and apparent latent homosexuality, etc) gives it a patchy feeling. Granted, coverage of both areas is necessary, and they are not easy ones for a director to synthesize. Nevertheless, some bad choices were made here regarding what to include and what not to. There is nothing, for example, on the prosecution of the Rosenbergs or the FBI's role during the Vietnam War years. I, for one, would have liked to see more on such areas and less on Hoover's family life (or lack thereof) and his relationship with his right-hand man, Clyde Tolson.Despite the long time-span it covers, "J. Edgar" is smooth enough to follow, and Hoover's conflicting qualities--e.g., insistence on professional conduct and limitations of the Bureau's jurisdiction, yet, defiance of his own standards by becoming a sort of Rona Barrett of Washington--are often quite intriguing. Still, a linear biography told from a more distant and objective third person perspective might have worked better as the structure of this film.Most of the acting is tepid, but Judi Dench and Naomi Watts both give admirable performances as the two important women in Hoover's life (even though the make-up is terrible).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do We Really Know This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess there is no bigger character to do a biographical film on than J. Edgar Hoover. The plot structure is documentary-like as it contrasts the "modern-day Hoover" with the up-and- coming young Hoover. He is portrayed as a driven, jingoistic monster who sees himself as the savior of the United States. Once he has entrenched himself in power, he is able to rebuild the Bureau of Investigation in the FBI. He has files on every significant and not-so- significant person in America. He maneuvers himself into the spotlight time after time (at least the script tells us). He becomes feared by presidents and congressmen, labor leaders and socialists, and so on. The movie tells us he has dark secrets. He is the poster boy for Freudian psychology. He dotes on his mother and she spouts venom like some sort of Medusa. Listen to the speech about daffodils. There are some very good moments in this movie, but somehow it gets a bit boring and slow. It doesn't seem to go anywhere. His cross dressing and homosexual behavior are there on view. But is this based on real knowledge or on a mythology that developed. We do know that his life-long friend was his heir. Were they lovers? We just don't know, but the movie tells us they were. Leonardo de Caprio does quite a nice job (he is certainly a versatile actor), but it's as if Eastwood pulled back. Maybe it's because he felt just a little tenuous. Not a bad movie, but it leaves me a little ill at ease.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's fine but it could be better, almost epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grandiosity of production scale, character and intention doesn't always means grandiosity in quality. If this fails a little flat it's because it tries too hard to reduce in a very limited time to paint a fair portrait of one of the most distinguished and controversial figures of America's history. The partnership between Eastwood, DiCaprio and Dustin Lance Black, Oscar winning script for "Milk" didn't live up for much expectation; and if the film works it's because of the work of all the other actors and some of the technicians involved. "J. Edgar" chronicles the life's trajectory of FBI's powerful head J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) from his younger years as agent until old age, period in which he was still the big boss of the bureau, up until his death. This movie's huge ambition to stand above another films made on Hoover is to focus on the highly debated yet still slightly proved, Hoover's closeted homosexuality, and having as longtime partner his number 2 in the office, the loyal Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). Naomi Watts and Judi Dench play the important women in Edgar's life, his personal secretary and his devoted mother, respectively. What's the biggest achievement of "J. Edgar", the movie? To be an brief summary on Hoover's life, to explore , even if superficially, the bureau's creation and the way investigations and cases were conducted. In this little aspect I think it succeed better than "The Good Shepherd" which was about the CIA's creation. At least it was less confusing but not a better film than De Niro's ambitious project."J. Edgar" could team all the involved together; Clint, Leo, Dustin and the others...but the effect would be felt graciously if made as an 6 hour HBO miniseries or similar. And maybe with another director in charge of the project. Mr. Eastwood's choices in conducting this are somewhat wrong, without energy or vigor, an slow pace that often distracts its viewers followed by the ugly dark cinematography he started to use since "Changeling", that doesn't cause any sensation and doesn't help the movie.I don't know how much is fact and how much is theory in here but all I know is that Mr. Black's script hide of what was supposed to be most open and interesting part of the film. Hoover/Tolson relationship isn't explored enough, it's just as closeted as they were in real life. There's pain, denial, several inner conflicts specially when it comes to Edgar demonstrate his emotions to Clyde, it's all well played. But it should have more. Yet, only that kind of approach is inexcusable for a film whose purpose is to dwell deep in aspects of the analyzed life. "What determines a man's legacy is often what isn't seen" says the tag line; movie should show everything that we didn't seen about him in real life. One strange kissing scene during a conflict, or Hoover's detailed attention on what clothes his agents are wearing, and the couple's talks showing some affection between each other isn't enough to characterize an fair and accurate portrayal of the public figure who always knew how to keep his secrets. "J. Edgar" is too secretive with the things it shouldn't been.Does DiCaprio makes a good J. Edgar? Yes, kind of. Far from being my favorite (a tie between Pat Hingle ("Citizen Cohn") and Bob Hoskins ("Nixon"); this comparison is terrible since they're playing in supporting roles) but he displays plenty of qualities and defects. He probably played in the way biographies and relatives described him: well mannered, with a certain shyness but with very authority, demanding, hiding himself from people all around not knowing how to act sometimes, a little pitiful, different from the other presentations of Hoover in films elsewhere. Is it Leo's best performance? No, I'm afraid. It's a good one but not his best. Most of the time I couldn't disconnect from his Howard Hughes role in "The Aviator" (truly his best, in my opinion), all the time he was playing the bossy, fast talking character, giving orders to his staff. It's the kind of mannerisms and twitches he doesn't know how to lose or change. Therefore, he's limited in his range. At least, for this project.However, the huge surprise of "J. Edgar" was Armie Hammer's performance in all the periods portrayed. His Tolson is dedicated, very compassionate and tender, incredibly loyal to his boss/partner and he's a moving character. Not to mention, the old age makeup effects worked better on him than with DiCaprio, such effect was laughable on Leo, not so well made. I argued a lot about its problems but I can't trash it and say it's a bad film. I enjoyed a lot, just felt disappointed with many of its construction. It's a decent and noticeable biography with very informative facts, historical events and a right way of not solving the enigmatic puzzle Mr. Hoover was. I was quite surprised when this wasn't Oscar nominated but after watching I understood why it wasn't. It was good but not all that much to enter in the race. Not that it matters but it helps in getting more audience. And this could make very good use of it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Edgar Hoover founded the Federal Bureau of Invesgiation and led it in megalomaniac style until his death. This account of his career and speculation of his private life is a dark movie on so many levels. It deals with serious criminality ranging from mobsters to kidnappers to spies; it portrays a FBI that tramples over human rights and itself spies on citizens; it is a portrait of a man who effectively blackmailed presidents but hid his own sexual tendencies; and the whole thing is shot in bleached-out colours and endless shadows.It is an ambitious project for producer and director Clint Eastwood, who has tackled the bio-pic before with "Bird", and writer Dustin Lance Black, who scripted the bio-pic "Milk", since they cover the huge period from the Palmer Raids of 1919 to Hoover's death in 1972 in a series of flash backs involving multiple characters which makes it hard work for the viewer. Of course, it is an even tougher enterprise for Leonardo DiCaprio who has to portray the eponymous and complex FBI chief as he ages half a century. DiCaprio is a fine actor who has come along way since "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" in 1993 and he too has done the bio-pic thing before ("THe Aviator") and is quite well deserved by his prosthetics (which one cannot say for Armie Hammer as Hoover's No 2 at the Bureau Clyde Tolson).So this is a fascinating film but it lacks a narrative thrust and real drama or excitement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful biography depicting the life of near-half century Director J. Edgar Hoover, masterfully played by Leonardo DiCaprio in a gem of a screen performance.Hoover was an extremely complex man who served under 8 presidents. He was tyrannical in every sense of the word in the way he ran the bureau, but his contributions to society in making the Bureau for what it is today cannot be overlooked.As anti-Communist as you get, Hoover was totally dedicated to his position. A crime-buster who did overly exaggerate his accomplishments, his unforgettable life portrayed on the big screen can never be forgotten.DiCaprio got wonderful support from Armie Hammer, fabulous as his assistant and homosexual lover, Naomi Watts as his devoted secretary, married to her position, and Dame Judi Dench, as his possessive mother.The film makes expert use of flashbacks back and forth to current times as opposed to years ago.The film shows Hoover as an embittered man who kept files on people he didn't like, or of whom he felt were a threat to the American existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History Conjectured.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially, it seemed like a TV movie, except for two recognizable performers, Leonardo DiCaprio as J. Edgar Hoover, President-for-Life of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Naomi Watts as his loyal executive secretary. DiCaprio sounded like an actor trying to impersonate someone else, Naomi Watts is no longer a teen ager, and the photography was exceptionally dark. Then, without knowing it had been directed by Clint Eastwood, I was gradually drawn into the story, conjectural though much of it must be.Except for his meticulously choreographed public appearances -- and the appearance of appearances -- Hoover was a kind of "gated personality" in the way that some wealthy communities are "gated", surrounded by fences and armed guards to protect whatever it is that's inside. In this way he was a Rorschach ink blot. You can project whatever you like into his private life because hardly anybody knows about it. His personal files were destroyed and unlike many public figures he left no memoir behind.So, in "The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover (1977)," Broderick Crawford could play him as a good-natured and efficient protector of democracy, hectored constantly by the petty Attorney General Robert Kennedy. In "Kennedy" (1983), Vincent Gardenia had him as a slow-moving but irresistible force for morality seeing to it that presidents toed the line.Eastwood and DiCaprio treat him as a bundle of repression, a man who is fighting what he considers his most base impulses, who loves his mother and has a non-sexual affair with his deputy, Clyde Tolson. There is a tender scene after the two have grown old, Tolson has a stroke, and Hoover prepares his breakfast while lecturing him. It's touching, really. Does Hoover dress up in a feather boa? No. At his mother's death, weeping, he pulls on an old dress of hers and drapes her beads around his neck, then tears all this off and collapses, muttering, "Fight it, fight it." I don't admire J. Edgar Hoover the way Eastwood and his writer seem to. I believe Hoover thought he was surrounded by domestic enemies and bureaucratic rivals but Eastwood seems to think that this was a natural state and the driving force behind Hoover's unorthodox methods was patriotism, whereas in retrospect it seems far more personal and more than a little paranoid.The kind of world envisioned by Hoover looks like that described in Thomas Hobbes' "The Leviathan" (1651). People are born into a state of nature, governed by selfishness and greed. This leads naturally to "a war of all against all" in which the life of man is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." We avoid this catastrophe by agreeing to subordinate ourselves to a sovereign authority who rules everything. The sovereign authority is the ultimate judge and doesn't share his power. And who is the sovereign authority in Hoover's vision? Who is most moral, efficient, ruthless in rooting out domestic dissidence? Guess.I applaud Eastwood, though. The guy is in his 80s and is still turning out tasteful and balanced movies like this. Aside from the conception itself, the only weakness I could identify on screen was the sentimentalizing of Hoover's death. I have no doubt many of his loyalists wept. But Eastwood lingers over it for too long and the music is formulaic. Orson Welles never treated Charles Foster Kane that way, one of the many things that makes "Citizen Kane" such a superb movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shunned by Oscar, it's still worthy of a view on a quiet Friday night instead of Eastenders.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar is a film that, after the initial hype, looks very likely to disappear without very many people (in the UK, at least) seeing it. It's unlikely you'll catch it at a multiplex near you, partly because, at the time of writing, my blog isn't live but largely because this time of year there is a glut of films (great, good, hopeful and just bilge the studios are throwing to the world amongst the others because they have no faith in them) for the cinema chains to chose from. We, the viewers, benefit from this because there's a rapid turnover and great choice. The big losers, however, are the filmmakers that rely on word of mouth for the success of their films. The days of a slow-burner hit are long gone.None of that is to say that J. Edgar isn't a good film; it is. It just isn't great and it's pitched against the likes of The Help, The Descendants, The Artist and The Iron Lady. Two of them are better films, Two are not. The difference is that each of them has been embraced by Oscar and the Golden Globes whilst, despite the early promise, J. Edgar has been completely shunned. At this time of year, with this type of film, that can be damning.I'm not going to outline the plot other than to say it skims over the 48 years of Hoover's career leading up to and creating the FBI and looks into his personal life with the few significant people he kept close. I'm sure you know as much as me and, either way, Wikipedia will give you more detail than I have space for.With Clint Eastwood directing and a principal cast of Leonardo DiCaprio, Naomi Watts, The Social Network's Armie Hammer and the always dependable Judi Dench (as Edgar's mother), it was always going to be a pretty good bet that this would be well worth watching. As biopics go, it's not quite up there with Ali but it's a hell of a lot better than The Iron Lady! It's very watchable, it trundles along at a good pace, is educational to a degree and DiCaprio gives a performance that justifies some of the hero-worship he enjoys, but I left thinking What do I write about it? I expect more from Eastwood. He is, after all, the multi Oscar winning director of Million Dollar Baby and Unforgiven. But he fails to match those heights with J. Edgar.The unevenness of the film is illustrated perfectly in the make up of the two principals. DiCaprio's prosthetic is virtually part of his face, it moves and expresses and is at times easy to forget exists and yet Hammer's, presumably by the same make up artist, sits on his face, unmoving and obvious. It's a mystery how the contrasts are possible in the same film. Maybe it was a lack of concentration or care for the job in its entirety and perhaps that's the problem with the whole film.So put it on your Love Film list as a fairly safe bet for a quiet Friday night in but don't have the high expectations of Eastwood's finest. It's way above Space Cowboys but it falls short of the award-laden Mystic River.Another film review from The Squiss.

		<fullReview>This film reveals not only the persona of J. Edgar, but of Clint Eastwood as well. As in all of his recent films, we are not offered a conclusion. We are instead given a set of facts, circumstances, and theories, and left to decide the matter for ourselves. The film itself is well presented and the cast is nothing short of formidable. Leonardo DiCaprio creates the impression of growth and personality, showing us the changes from Hoover's past and how they are influenced by his mother and his friends, which are few. The allusion of homosexuality is dealt with in a tasteful and sensitive manner, and again allows us to draw our own conclusions concerning his relationship with his assistant director and companion, Clyde Tolson. Armie Hammer plays his role with sensitivity and passion, as does Naomi Watts. As Helen Gandy, her obvious devotion to Hoover is clear. The remaining cast is incidental, although Jeffrey Donovan gives us another glimpse into his abilities with a flawless performance as Robert Kennedy. At the end, I am left with the impression that Hoover's life was sad and personally unfulfilled, but you'll have to see it yourself to draw your own conclusions. Rated R for subject matter and language, this film is collectible for lovers of Eastwood films, and anyone who enjoys a serious biography.</fullReview>

Leonardo DiCaprio's was pretty good.avoiding the makeup on Armie Hammer I must say the film was fantastic! I have to say it is my favourite. Tom Stern's job as the Cinematographer was great. In some reviews by people they say how some scenes dragged on and needed to but cut a little. I did not notice that. However it did take me a while to get into the film. About 33 minuets to be exact.overall I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates good movies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's Answer to "The Aviator"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"J. Edgar" can be seen as Clint Eastwood's answer to Martin Scorsese's "The Aviator", another biopic starring Leonardo DiCaprio. In both films the central character- J. Edgar Hoover here, Howard Hughes in Scorsese's film- is a controversial real-life individual who rose to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s at a comparatively young age. In both cases that individual is portrayed as a morally flawed individual who also had some genuine achievements to his credit.Hoover's flaws are well-known to history; he was quite prepared to use strong-arm methods and to go outside the law in his pursuit of criminals, he was capable of petty feuds and jealousies, even against members of his own organisation, and was reputed to keep personal files which he used to blackmail prominent personalities, and there is plenty of evidence of these matters in the film. According to the film Hoover had no great regard for Senator Joe McCarthy as an individual, describing him as an opportunist rather than a patriot, but he himself had McCarthyite leanings in that he, like the Senator, tended to conflate political dissent with sedition or subversion. An example was Hoover's hatred of Martin Luther King, whom he believed, quite without foundation, to be a communist agent.On the credit side, the film also points out that Hoover was responsible for creating America's first effective nationwide crime-fighting force, that he was an early pioneer of the use of forensic science in solving crime and that in the twenties and thirties the FBI achieved notable successes against communist and anarchist terrorists and against notorious gangsters like John Dillinger and "Pretty Boy" Floyd. The film is told from the perspective of the elderly Hoover in the sixties, recounting his memories to his biographer, although he only gets up to the mid-thirties; the struggles of the FBI against Axis spies in the forties and communist agents in the fifties are rather skipped over. Doubtless Eastwood felt that the film was quite long enough already and that to include any more material would make it unwieldy and repetitive.One controversial subject the film does touch on relates to Hoover's sex life. There has been a long-standing rumour that he was gay and had a sexual relationship with his close friend Clyde Tolson, the FBI's Associate Director. (Richard Nixon, although always respectful in public, referred to him in private as "the old cocks*cker"). The film, however, does not support this allegation; Hoover is shown rejecting a sexual advance from Tolson, whom he regards as a friend but nothing more. There is a suggestion that Hoover may have been a transvestite, but transvestitism is not necessarily linked to homosexuality. Indeed, Hoover is seen making an unsuccessful proposal of marriage to a female FBI employee, Helen Gandy, who, although unwilling to become Mrs Hoover, was to become his trusted confidante.DiCaprio gives another strong performance, giving the impression of a man driven by a powerful will yet also by equally powerful subconscious impulses. Credit must also be given to the make-up team who succeeded in making the 37-year-old DiCaprio look credible as an old man more than twice that age- Hoover lived to the age of 77- although they were perhaps less successful with the 25-year-old Armie Hammer who is similarly required to portray Tolson from youth to old age. The film, however, is not in my view on the same level as "The Aviator", which I regard as one of the cinematic masterpieces of the twenty-first century. It lacks the epic scope and visual power of Scorsese's film, with nothing, for example, comparable to the heart-stopping aeroplane crash scene. Perhaps the difference between the two films arises from the differences between their two central characters.Although Howard Hughes and Hoover had some things in common, in other respects they were very different. In old age Hughes famously became a recluse, but in the earlier part of his life- the part on which Scorsese concentrates- he was a larger-than-life extrovert. Hoover, by contrast, was an introvert and an intensely private person about whose emotional life little is known for sure, although there has been plenty of speculation, often unsupported by hard evidence. Whereas Hughes was a man of many faces- businessman, aviation pioneer, film-maker and the lover of a number of beautiful women, mostly Hollywood actresses- Hoover was essentially a behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, who often envied his subordinates their more exciting lives. (According to the film he tried to raise his own high public profile by falsely claiming to have carried out arrests in person). Little is known about the most potentially fascinating aspect of Hoover's career, the contents of his private files, as these were nearly all destroyed after his death. He was not, perhaps, therefore the most natural subject for a filmed biography. In making "J. Edgar" as interesting as it is, therefore, Eastwood and DiCaprio have achieved a considerable feat. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"J. Edgar" was a good film, because it showed the vulnerable side of J. Edgar Hoover and his relations with his mother and his friend Clyde Tolson. It was not as good as Invictus, Unforgiven, or other of Eastwood's previous films. DiCaprio, Judi Dench, and Armie Hammer nonetheless had standout performances. The Lindbergh baby kidnapping and other events of the 1930s, as well as Hoover as a young man circa 1920, are interspersed with Hoover's days as FBI director during the 1960s. The transition is sometimes labored, and this is one of the film's weaknesses. His personal life is never fully explained, except the possibility he was gay and not fully aware of it. The movie succeeds in showing Hoover's humanity, despite his abuse of power and strange vendettas against JFK, Dr. King, and others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. Edgar tells the story of John Edgar Hoover and how he built the F.B.I into the respected bureau that it is today. Also focusing on Edgar's personal life, mainly with his best friend Clyde Tolson, his mother Annie Hoover and his personal secretary Helen Gandy.Dustin Lance Black wrote a terrific script which Clint Eastwood beautifully transformed into a movie, Even though I believe using make up instead of CGI to make the actors look older was a big mistake. Leonardo and Armie have great on-screen chemistry which makes Edgar and Clyde's grotesque friendship seem very authentic.The casting director did a fantastic job hiring the cast. Every actor brought their A-game and I consider no one to be a weak link, Armie Hammer was not at his best while portraying Clyde Tolson in his older years but I've heard that it is extremely hard to emote or even act through it, out of respect I give him the benefit of the doubt.Clint Eastwood did not show up until the first day of shooting, which means most of the actors had to figure out on their own how they would portray their character. What you see on screen is therefore most likely what the actor thinks the character was like, untouched by the director.After viewing the film a lot of questions popped into my mind about John Edgar Hoover. What was he hiding? Was he bisexual? Or even homosexual... None of these questions are answered in the movie which leaves it up to the viewer to conclude what happened, which is a quality I like about movies like this one.To conclude: J. Edgar is a remarkably good film that raises a lot of interesting questions about J. Edgar and his life. Everyone involved is extremely talented and did an extraordinary job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Semi Interesting - Perhaps Clint's Worst Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented J Edgar hoping to learn more about this interesting historical figure. I really didn't learn much more than I already knew and I'm not expert on the guy. This is the worst Clint Eastwood directed film I've ever seen.DiCaprio again shines, but the problem really was the direction. The movie was filmed mostly in dark scenes with little light. Perhaps that was to indicate Hoover's dislike of light and/or to reflect that the story took place in the past or that Hoover had secrets. Regardless, it was distracting. The music was also not very good. The single piano notes were actually quite annoying--Eastwood usually prides himself on great music since he is a musician.Perhaps the subject was simply not worthy. The story jumped around in time way too much. I think a more linear time line of events would have been easier to follow and would have accomplished a better result for the story. If you're a biography or history buff, you may find interest in this. I didn't feel like my time watching this film was a total waste, but I would have rather watched something else in retrospect.

I have to admit, that I am not that familiar with the biography of Mr. Hoover, but I the movie really sparked my interest to dig deeper and find more stuff about him than is commonly known.Of course some of the things depicted in the movie were not in tune and weren't taken lightly by quite a few people in the states. Sort of like when Oliver Stone made Alexander and some people took offense to the way he portrayed the myth/man himself. It's not as provocative of course, but it does show a flawed person that might only had good intentions on his mind, but went ahead to (possibly?) pursue them in a very wrong way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incomplete Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was understandable to be excited about "J.Edgar" when it came out. A film about one of the most intriguing characters in American History and to top that off, it would be directed by Clint Eastwood, written by the Oscar-winning Dustin Lance Black ("Milk") and would star DiCaprio playing the protagonist. What (at least most people) found was a film which was extremely disappointing due to many reasons depending on their own evaluations. What made it disappointing for me was that it seemed to barely scratch the surface into the life of this man and was thus an incomplete look into a man's legacy (however despicable) and his contribution to American History.No one doubts that Hoover was a fascist who manipulated the most powerful people in America, who threatened his power, by using blackmail to solidify his position as the director of the FBI. However, it cannot be disputed that he turned one of the most ineffective government institutions America had and turned it into one of the most powerful and feared police institutions in the whole world. This he did with no previous police experience which makes this accomplishment even more significant. The film, however, used the relationship he had with Clyde Tolson as the central plot-line (probably in an attempt to humanize Hoover) and by doing so over-looked some of the most significant events which must have made this complicated man as powerful as he was.The screenplay was poor and Eastwood's direction was not captivating and the method in which he told the story fell flat. The film was paced extremely poorly and it's editing was choppy and didn't have the flow which it required for a film which continuously relied on flashbacks to tell it's story. The make-up was pretty horrible and made the "aged-looking" younger actors that much more implausible. All in all it was a bad exercise into film-making with almost every aspect of it's production falling flat and making it into just another disappointing film of what was truly a disappointing year for Hollywood.The only salvation, however small, it had was it's acting. Actors are, in most cases, can be as good as the story that is being told around them. Armie Hammer does provide a very good performance as Clyde Tolson and DiCaprio was believable as the character he was portraying (however terrible their make-ups were) and it made the chemistry seem believable. Judi Dench was not bad as Hoover's mother and Naomi Watts was not disappointing, given that she was not given that much screen time. DiCaprio however, I think did the best he could with the material that he was provided with and at least portrayed the character, as Eastwood wanted him to. with as much realism as could be expected. However, when you are telling a story which is as dull as this film is, there is very little you can do to salvage it from the mediocrity it is bound to be associated to.The ability of an actor to make a mediocre film seem better than it actually was happened only once when Al Pacino rescued "Scent of A Woman" with one of the greatest performances in the legend's career. However, even in that case, Pacino played a charismatic figure who used the good material written for him to his highest ability giving one of the most captivating performances of all time. As "J.Edgar" was lacking in all departments in it's production, it would be unlikely that DiCaprio would be able to do the same. To top that off, DiCaprio is still no Al Pacino. A forgettable film and at least in my opinion, is not worth the viewing. It was even more painful for me because it was directed by Eastwood, who to me made the greatest Western Film of all time at a time when the genre was past it's glory days and then followed it up with films which might not have been as memorable but still held a bar pretty high (barring "Hereafter"). If you are an Eastwood fan, stay away from it, it would bring you nothing but disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood has changed. And I think it's just great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, if not a masterpiece, a highly entertaining biopic from the old master Clint Eastwood. It depicts the life of J. Edgar Hoover, the revolutionary who took the FBI and made it great, and who also introduced the now familiar fingerprint system to identify criminals. Don't expect an action film. I know the trailer was a bit misleading. It made the movie seem a little more exciting than it really is. It's more like a drama. The story is told from J.Edgar's perspective, as he dictates his memoirs for a book at the end of his life. It tells not only of his involvement with the FBI (specifically the Lindbergh case, which was revolutionary because it finally made kidnapping a federal offense), but also exposes his social problems, his struggle with his homosexuality, and his almost romantic friendship with his right hand Clyde Thompson. It depicts him as a man completely dedicated to his work, who has little attention for anything else, including love. It's amazing the way Di Caprio plays all ages of J.Edgar, 20 to 75. There aren't a lot of actors that could play this role. Also amazing is that the film never gets boring (at least, to me: a lot of people here seem to think it does) even though its almost two and a half hours long and almost nothing exciting happens throughout. That just shows how great of a director Eastwood is. The same goes for Gran Torino by the way, which I think is even better than this.Conclusion: if you're a fan of action/horror films, you will probably not like this one. I would advise you to not waste your money. Everyone else should go see this, don't listen to all the negativity around here. People who dislike something talk more than people who like something, just the fact that this is rated 7.1 should prove that.</fullReview>

Edgar Hoover.The cast did a fairly credible job handling the weak script; but even the Dicaprio name was not enough to save this one. By far, Eastwood's poorest work.One additional thing that severely detracted from the quality of the film was the abysmal make up job on the aging Clyde Tolson - Japanese creature horror/sci-fi flicks of the 50's did better.Not a worthwhile use of time - either in the theaters or at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a Patriotic Career for The Leader of the Bureau!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonardo DiCaprio has delivered a fantastic performance as he portrays the FBI founder and head J. Edgar Hoover, in the movie of the same name "J. Edgar". Obviously. The film has been brilliantly well done by the director Clint Eastwood. Dame Judi Dench was terrific as Hoover's mother Annie, and Naomi Watts was superb as Hoover's secretary Helen Gandy. Also, Armie Hammer was outstanding whilst portraying the assistant Clyde Tolson. Similar to the flashback style of another classic movie Citizen Kane, Hoover recalls his lifelong struggle and endurance to make the government organization FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) a successful authority for the safety and justice of the nation. The threatening and critical oppositions include mob leaders and gangsters, child kidnappers, and American leaders like President Richard Nixon, who notoriously disapproved of Hoover's directives.Hoover's political and authoritative struggles were just as large as his personal conflicts. His mother, regarding her son's homosexuality, threatened that she would not accept him as a son unless he became a more straight and stronger man, interested in the romantic charms of women. She mentored and molded him to be a son to be proud of, she even taught him how to dance. After being trained by his mother who later died from an illness, Hoover was still torn between the two different interests towards men and women. As well as trying to charm Helen Gandy, who only wanted to be his secretary than a girlfriend or fiance, Hoover faced the arrival of Clyde Tolson, who was having a job interview to become an assistant. Clyde eventually showed a loving affection and attraction toward Hoover, and the two became partners, literally. Clyde enjoyed having dinner with him at fancy restaurants, however he argued with Hoover about his involvement with women. Years later in the relationship, Clyde also reminded his friend about his public dishonesty. Hoover apparently lied about arresting suspects, instead having his officers do the detaining work. Despite his flaws, Clyde stood up for Hoover and expressed his companionship.Yes, Hoover also has his victorious achievements: the shooting of John Dillinger, the capture of the baby murderer Bruno Hauptmann, and the deportation of dangerous radicals like German agents threatening the government. Overall, this movie is like a landmark. We learn all about the man who started the FBI, which is currently one of the greatest and productive law enforcement organizations in the United States. So for this great American vision, I give DiCaprio and Eastwood's work a 10 star rating. Watching this film, and also touring the FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. is a great way to learn about the methods and brave commitments of this historical authority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bites off more than it can chew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life of a person as famous, complicated and influential as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover deserves a mini-series treatment rather than standard feature length, especially considering that a sizable chunk of the running time is wasted on a not particularly insightful or dramatically gripping rehash of the infamous Lindbergh kidnapping case that dominated headlines in the early 1930's. Clint Eastwood directs with a careful?perhaps too careful? hand but the script by Dustin Lance Black bites off more than it can chew in 2 hours and 17 minutes, forcing too much information to be spat out as voice-over narration. This un-cinematic approach results in something like an elaborate show-and-tell session or History Channel re-enactment. What's worse, the film is shot in pale blueish tones that tend to drain whatever passion occurs in the sequences that are fully dramatized. Black does manage to tiptoe suggestively and paradoxically around Hoover's sex life. This is a wise move, considering the conflicting claims made by various people who knew him. The point is made that it's quite possible that the only intimacy he ever knew was what he read in stolen correspondence or heard on surveillance tapes that captured the sounds of sexual trysts by the likes of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Most of the story is framed as reminiscence by the title character (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) in conversation with young biographers. DiCaprio's old age makeup is too obvious and photographed too clearly for too long (that of his co-star, Armie Hammer, who plays Hoover's companion Clyde Tolson, is even more extreme, making him look more like Freddie Kruger), so that we are constantly reminded that we are watching a young actor trying to play old. Speaking of old, Judi Dench as Hoover's doting mother looks more like his grandmother, and why would an American woman of Swiss ancestry speak with a British accent? Dench is easy to take, however, because of her essential screen charisma. As is usual with biographical films of this type, we are presented with a parade of famous figures, few of whom are portrayed by actors who really resemble them. Jeffrey Donovan and Christopher Shyer (as Robert Kennedy and Richard Nixon, respectively) are exceptions. The miscast actresses playing Ginger Rogers and her politically active mother Lela miss the boat entirely. They don't even slightly resemble each other. Naomi Watts beautifully inhabits her role as Hoover's long- time personal secretary. Eastwood also composed original music and it is unobtrusive, as is his delicate use of period recordings to lend subtle flavor to certain scenes, although it's hard to imagine that an upscale Washington D.C. restaurant would have been playing a phonograph record of Gene Austin singing "My Blue Heaven" while patrons dined.</fullReview>

Edgar was pushing it, especially because it takes a long time to really get into the story. I'm a fan of Clint Eastwood's films, Million Dollar Baby is a personal favourite of mine, but J. Edgar suffers from serious pacing issues. The film has the same problem that The Iron Lady had, told from the point of view of the character in an elderly state and it slowed the film considerably. The other major issue with this is the two story lines going on at once, the "modern" story and the "old" stories don't match, they are so different that you lose track of where you were in each one. The other issue being the story of how Edgar rose to power in the FBI is far more interesting than his quick decent into death.Music in the film is fine but by no means spectacular, just your average strings driven arrangement. The camera is handled as Clint Eastwood often does with simplicity, nothing worth noting. Nicely framed and good at capturing the actor nuances, exactly what you want from a film of this kind. The scripting on the other hand was often laughable, especially in more dramatic moments. The "coming out" scene of Clyde Tolson is particularly funny, whether this is to do with bad acting on Armie Hammer's front or just poor scripting would involve re-watching, something that I wouldn't put myself through.Though acting here is mostly good, Leonardo Di Caprio is obviously fantastic in the title role. Supporting actors are fine but once again nothing that stands out, Di Caprio and Hammer have decent chemistry. Naomi Watts is OK at best and Judi Dench seems to put little to no effort in her role. I haven't yet seen Dench play any other character other than Judi Dench, I think more notice needs to be put on Imelda Staunton in my opinion.Now this isn't the worst of the elements of the film I have saved that for last. That goes to costume and makeup, now the bits based in the 1930's I'm pretty sure the actors don't have to wear clothes that are quite literally 80 years old? They look scruffy, and out of place even the costuming on more modern time characters is uninspiring. This element wasn't helped by seeing W.E. just before it whose costumes were a highlight. And the "old" make up on the actors was rubber, and you could tell. More gentle lighting could have been more forgiving on this makeup, but unfortunately it was very flushed out and you could see it was fake which completely destroyed the illusion. Once again after seeing The Iron Lady I expected more from this film on this front.J. Edgar was a very disappointing, overlong and joyless ride. There are some poignant moments here, but they are over shadowed by poor scripting, bad costumes and makeup and uneven amateurish lighting. I expected a lot more from a veteran like Eastwood, but for a convincing portrayal of this historic man Leonardo Di Caprio does deliver, even if the rest of the film doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Largely Speculation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps private lives are best left to the speculation of biographers, where a nuanced explanation of the guess work can be presented. I kept wondering what we know for sure, what we are guessing and what pretty much has to be true, but is still a little speculative. Granted, the broad outlines are known. J. Edgar must have been gay and probably was a cross-dresser (the cross-dressing is not shown in the movie). Seems pretty certain that he did some unauthorized spying and used the results to buttress his own personal power. We know that he hated Martin Luther King, Jr., and had his agents spy on the man. But after that, this movie, for me, raised far more questions than it answered and I kept wanting to take a look at the footnotes, which of course are nonexistent. So it was frustrating to watch, although it is motivating me to perhaps get a biography of Hoover and learn a little more about this fascinating person.To me, there is something a little unfair about publicly guessing about the unknown details. The author is putting his own words in another person's mouth. Nobody can know how close to the mark it is. Yes, this is done a fair amount in the film biz and does not run afoul of any laws. There is an understandable motivation in bringing something that the author feels is important to the national popular attention. A documentary would be very unlikely to succeed at this task. Still, however, the author places himself between Scylla and Charybdis, in that the more interesting (inflammatory) he makes the dialogue the more he risks really creating a false picture of his subject. But if he holds back the effort won't have enough popular success to justify the project.So -- sadly -- a movie better left not made. My guess is that the financial backers, if motivated principally by financial consideration, agree with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Power corrupts, absolute power?..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar Hoover is a unique historical character that can be easily overlooked. He was credited with developing the FBI and organizing criminal investigations to include forensic investigation. With all of the good things he did for us, he was also a focus of scandal and a prime example of how absolute power corrupts absolutely. He was rumored to have surveillance on many political figures and would use them as blackmail material.Does the movie, J. Edgar, mirror the facts of his life? I can't say I don't know more than what I have read on Wikipedia. Is this an interesting movie? Yes, but from a purely academic standpoint.For more of this review please go to http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Questions on biographical wealth, Oscar nomination will abound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar: Great acting?now if it could have just given us more.From the most disappoint to the best of J. Edgar: The script revealed that America's most famous or infamous (depending on your viewpoint) FBI director possesses self-serving crime-fighting zeal, and that he was a liar and manipulator, a gay and a cross-dresser, full of resentment and a momma's boy to boot. But most folks already knew at least some of the above about J. Edgar Hoover. And while the bio-pic gave us some otherwise esoteric information about his development of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that will be new information to many, the movie was entitled J. Edgar, not "The FBI." As such the value of this bio-film would be far greater if it showed provided more details about protagonist.Without knowing that there's got to more to Hoover life and career, you have got to believe that there must be. Framing much of the story through his dictating of his memoir, director Clint Eastwood may have decided to give viewers the most interesting part of Hoover's life or what he thought folk were most curious about ? within the constraints of a two-hour and 17-minute film. However the numerous flashing backwards and forward leaps over most of the 1940s and 1950s, which makes it hard to believe there was nothing screen-worthy in Hoover's life from those period.In all fairness I am not a reviewer who has made himself privy to the Hoover biographical materials that are out there. So it could be possible that Eastwood, his writer Dustin Lance Black and his co-producers (which included Brian Grazer and Ron Howard) decided to play it safe and use only the bio-material that they had a comfort level with respect to veracity.The above questions notwithstanding, Oscar nominations will abound for this film.Leonardo DiCaprio did nothing to diminish his cr?me de la cr?me acting resume. Like Denzel Washington as Malcolm X, Philip Seymour Hoffman at Truman Capote and Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler, DiCaprio made you almost believe that he really was the G-men head. His performance will make most forget or at least forgive what they perceive to be shortcomings in the biographical substance. There is no doubt that there this should be his fourth Oscar nomination (third for Best Actor).Armie Hammer, a relatively new actor, forced us to pay attention to him in his outstanding double-duty twin-brother performance in The Social Network. In his role as Hoover's right-hand man and life partner, Clyde Tolson, Hammer displays another dimension to his acting range. He should add an Oscar Supporting Actor nomination to his resume.There may be an Oscar Best Supporting Actress for Naomi Watts for her turn as Hoover's secretary Helen Gandy (iffy; depending what is available for the rest of that nomination field). And if it is based on the 50-span of young to old Hoover, then there should be an Oscar nomination for Make-Up, which from where I was seating was pretty flawless. However, the make-up accolades might also be threatened by the less impressive and down-right ghoulish work on Hammer's elderly Tolson years. The latter years makeup for Watts was somewhere in the between quality-wise.Finally, Clint Eastwood's flashing backwards and forwards seemed somewhat unsteady and uneven. However, the acting of the central cast was so great that it might save his opportunity for an Oscar nomination here. His prudence on how long to dwell on the cross-dressing and scandalous areas Hoover's life, along with his willingness to deal with Hoover's attempts at revenge against Martin Luther King will both also score points with the award nominators.Anyone who wants to see great acting should go see this film. Anyone who is well-read on the biography of J. Edgar will still want to see the movie, but should not expect any new revelations.</fullReview>

It shows his rise to power, and his American dream to make this world a better place. But this film also shows that he was a tormented man, the people he was close to the most where Helen Gandy(Naomi Watts) his secretary, and Clyde Tolson(Armie Hammer, The Social Network).Leonardos performance was tour De force, he really did his homework on the man, I hope he will not be missed by the Oscars. Naomi Watts and Armie Hammer are also great in there supporting roles too. Clint Eastwoods direction is like watching a brilliant painter, when has his direction not been considered brilliant.

		<shortDescription>A well crafted biopic, another impeccable work by Clint Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you have to do with Mr. Clint Eastwood you expect much, and you usually get more than you expect. I was not so much fascinated by this story, before watching the movie, but soon got deeply involved in it since from the beginning. What impressed me was the lucid, at times disturbing portrait of a man, devoted only to himself, to a maniacally rigid public image, fighting against any possible enemy of the legality and security of the country. But Clint Eastwood never abandons his human perspective and tries to go beyond the facade, to look for the tormented psyche of an obsessed man. A man who certainly suffered from megalomania, but was also probably the victim of an insane relationship with an oppressive mother, and had to live with a sexual orientation and a whole emotional life he could only repress. The result is a very strong, but also balanced biopic, where every character, scene, detail, every single word seems to be calibrated and carefully represented.The movie appeals then as a thoroughly crafted character study, but proves to be more than this, in its honest portrait of a whole state-system of national defense, that seems to need a public enemy at all costs, and uses all means, even those which it's apparently fighting, in order to maintain its worldwide indisputable supremacy. A theme having accompanied American history for decades and which is never out of fashion. I will never stress enough Di Caprio's persuasive performance, as well as Eastwood's impeccable direction, but let's also note the skill of Judi Dench, who sometimes steals the show. Certainly a long movie, which goes back and forth in time to cover almost 40 years of history, a very demanding effort for a movie and requiring a certain time-run, but never resulting boring for the viewer, on the contrary capable of capturing and never losing the viewer's attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arrested Development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is recommended.Mr. J. Edgar ( as in Hoover ) was an iconic symbol of corruption, law enforcement, and good ole American values all rolled up in one very larger-than-life package. He was...A mean one, a heel, as cuddly as a cactus, a nasty wasty skunk...Oops, now wait! I am getting a bit confused...that's Mr. Grinch. Let me start again. He was...Daring and resourceful, led the fight for law and order, a greater champion of justice, with his faithful Indian companion Tonto...Whoa! Wrong again. It's easy to confuse the man and the myth and Clint Eastwood's well made but slightly disappointing film, J. Edgar, tries to clear up some of the facts and fallacies that have befell this crusader throughout the decades. He ( Mr. Eastwood, that is ) doesn't always succeed, but he does create a complex man trying to come to terms with his own power and fame and yet unable to accept his own human flaws and foibles.Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Hoover and runs the vast emotional gamut from a young idealistic and ambitious man ready to conquer the world to an aged cynical and lonely tyrant. DiCaprio expertly hones in on his character, that of a hypocritical man whose own life was shrouded in secrets and lies, an unethical schemer who took great pleasure exposing other peoples' secrets and lies.There is solid support by Naomi Watts as his stalwart and loyal secretary, Helen Gandy and Judi Dench as his manipulative and controlling mother. Yet the star-making charismatic turn comes from Armie Hammer as his closer than closest friend, Clyde Tolson. Hammer adds the needed charm and central moral conscience to the film. This talented actor plays Tolson as more than a handsome cipher or Arrow shirt model. He brings serious gravitas to the role and his dramatic outbursts with DiCaprio are the film's highlight. To put it more bluntly, Hammer nails it. ( Oops, another pun! Sorry! )Eastwood's leisurely paced biopic shies away from the more salacious details of Hoover's and Hammer's relationship, only hinting at and gently suggesting a darker side of his sexuality, something the real man would have never done when investigating any subject of interest. The film's remoteness and inability to flesh out his more personal side weakens this arresting ( pardon the pun ) film. The more intriguing aspects of Hoover's private life remain private and strangely off limits in Eastwood's vision. In fact, the film is so episodic in structure that it never builds to any emotional tension. The real connection to the film's characters remains remote due to Eastwood's vision and the film's arbitrary screenplay. The script by Dustin Lance Black instead chooses to focus mainly on just the facts, ma'am ( another pun, I'm afraid ) avoiding all gossip and sly innuendos as it spans the 50 years of Hoover's career and his rise to become the F.B.I.'s most notorious bureau chief. Some scenes become highly melodramatic and could easily verge on camp were it not for the outstanding acting by all involved. From his implementation of such innovative programs as fingerprinting analysis, wiretapping techniques, and collating dossiers on suspects of both criminal and/or political adversaries, to his misdeeds which include blackmail, extortion, and threatening anyone with an opposing viewpoint, including former presidents and senators alike, J. Edgar glosses over Hoover's peccadilloes whenever possible and remains safely in neutral territory, rather than supporting any conjecture on that controversial subject. The film is dishonest in its honesty.Production values are top-notch, with the sole exception being some pasty and unnecessarily artificial make-up during Hoover's and especially Tolson's elder years. Yet other scenes involving the aging make-up and the prosthetics on many of the characters is quite accurate and believable. However, one would think, with make-up being such a pivotal aspect to the film's credibility, that these flaws would have been worked out before the film process began. To say that the make-up is spotty is an understatement. While it's true that Hoover didn't age well, he certainly didn't age this badly as this film resurrection indicates, doing a major injustice to DiCaprio's fascinating portrayal. DiCaprio imbues the depth of his character, showcasing the anger, paranoia, and uncompromising side of this troubled man very well. However, moviegoers can only linger at Hoover's interfering physical appearance in this film, on the poorly executed prosthetics in the later scenes, which upstages this actor's fine nuanced work. Thankfully, DiCaprio's acting choices captivate and he is mesmerizing in the role.If only J. Edgar would have had a more risky and edgy goal in defining this man and his myth, the film could have been all the more interesting. Instead, it feels a bit unsolved and too pragmatic for its own good. The film continues to gingerly sidestep many prominent issues about the man's personal life as opposed to investigating and confronting these details head- on, leaving loopholes and questions still unanswered. J. Edgar opts to follow a more conventional approach, becoming a spiritless facsimile of its own cold case file. GRADE: BNOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leo's brilliant performance makes this a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"J. Edgar" is the story of one of the most powerful men in America, J. Edgar Hoover, brilliantly portrayed by Leonardo diCaprio. Directed by Clint Eastwood, it tells the story of Hoover's rise to power and of his contributions to the world of law enforcement - a fingerprint database, forensics, helping to make kidnapping a federal offense, wiretapping, and the formation of the organization itself. The script by Dustin Black also takes some educated guesses about Hoover's private life, what there was of it - his relationship with Tolson (Armie Hammer), his mother (Judi Dench), and his secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts.The film switches back and forth in time, juxtaposing the young, ambitious J. Edgar with his older, paranoid self who senses, if he hasn't quite come to grips with it yet, that he's losing his power. He is depicted as a man stuck in his Victorian upbringing, with a formal way of speaking (indeed this was true of Hoover) and a set of strong, unwavering values by which to live, some of which were in direct contradiction to who he was. His closet homosexuality is explored -- and if Hoover was gay, and there seems to be every indication that he was -- he probably was too uptight to have ever directly acted on it or acknowledged it; indeed, he seems to have been homophobic. Some reviews indicated that this was subtly presented. I didn't find it subtle in the least. What I did find is that Eastwood tries to present Hoover's life in a balanced way, showing us a complete human being.The film takes us through some of Hoover's big cases, Lindbergh kidnapping being the main one, with references to the capture of John Dillinger by Melvin Purvis which seems to have been a real thorn in Hoover's side. The movie also covers the deportation of anarchist Emma Goldman, Hoover's work against Communism, and his efforts during the gangster wars.The production values are excellent, showing the U.S. in the '30s, the clothing of the era, and the depiction of gangsters in film, with scenes from "Public Enemy." All in all, a very absorbing and ultimately sad story, with some marvelous performances from the chameleon-like Naomi Watts and Judi Dench. Armie Hammer as Tolson suffered from one of the worst makeup jobs in history, worse even than James Dean in GIANT - I could easily believe at the end that he was supposed to be 90. His is a very difficult role, that of a man more open about his sexuality and treading a thin professional line as well.But the star of the film, the person who commands it, is Leonardo diCaprio. Cursed with the same face he had when he was ten, DiCaprio manages to become J. Edgar Hoover, and his character development and aging are spectacular. He gives us a man of deep and mostly unexpressed emotion whose work was his life, but in the end, the victories seem empty.Really great work from the 81-year-old Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Presenting us a hero but not defining hero versus villain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"J. Edgar" is worth the hype, the fuss and the wait. I was particularly intrigued by the prospect that it was directed by the older, masculine Clint Eastwood and written by the younger, out-and-proud Dustin Lance Black. I got the biographical story of the FBI leader and I also got the deeply-touching love story of a closeted gay man. Both stories were woven together seamlessly.We jumped around in time, and also a bit in reality, to not just tell us who he was and what he accomplished, but to show us why he was that man. Near the beginning of the film, J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) makes the comment that it's time to re-clarify the difference between hero and villain. That's definitely what he wanted, but I'd wager that the opposite is closer to what he got.American kids growing up towards the end of Hoover's life seemed to think that they were to regard him as a bad man. Mostly because he did things that most people believe are wrong. But if those wrong actions come from a pure, child-like need of understanding good and evil and wanting good to be celebrated and evil to be punished, is that really so bad? He deeply detested politicians, anarchists and communists. I think he also believed that they were frequently one in the same. But he formed the FBI to protect America from any and all crimes. He cared about appearance, decorum, and respect. Mustaches are bad, well-cut suits are good, and he hired and fired on both accounts.The intimate details of Hoover's life (which we probably can't know for sure) came to life in the film when Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) walked into his office and was immediately hired. Presumably because he's handsome and knows how to wear a suit. Tolson was shown to be more in touch with his sexuality. With Tolson by his side, the drama was heightened to show all the warring elements within Hoover ? how he was raised contradicted with who he actually was and what he believed to be right contradicted with what was actually happening.Leonardo DiCaprio was an impeccable choice to play J. Edgar Hoover from a young man to his dying day at age 77. DiCaprio himself is nearing 40 but still looks the same as when he was a 16 year-old homeless kid on "Growing Pains," and now might be his time for the Oscar. The transformation through all of Hoover's weight gain, hair loss, and infallible belief system was perfect. He showed us the man as he should probably be remembered, and almost as he would like to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Only Scorsese Directed this Monster of History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life of this notorious public figure that was hated by many is too by-the-book. The biography lacks any raw energy. The soundtrack lacks any real impactful music score. This is something a better director like Martin Scorsese would have addressed. Also lacking any real momentum is the editing. A Scorsese picture will cut to the meat of a scene and focus on the interaction, then cut away, no loitering around after. Dicaprio is certainly capable of acting. Whether he is perfect for this role is hard to speculate. Too much, however, is spent establishing his different ages via old makeup, to older makeup, to ridiculously old makeup. I think his over-attention to that kind of detail overshadowed what should have been better exploration of themes.These themes were able to be slightly touched upon in certain moments of the film, but got lost in the bloated screenplay. When Scorsese attempted a biopic of Howard Hughes, instead of trying to span his entire life, he concentrated on the most incredible period of his heyday. Here, too much time is spent with Hoover in his ridiculously old age period recalling his important moments, not really telling us much about Hoover the man in the process. For such a far reaching individual, the scope of this too long film is way too narrow, focusing only on Hoover and his two immediate assistants. Some nice Washington figures that factor into Hoover's world could have given this film a badly needed breathe of life. Instead, they are kept out of frame. Only Nixon near the very end of the film is allowed to provide some balance to the one-side Hoover show.It is unfair to the important subject matter to treat this monster with little confrontation. There seems to be some buildup to a climax (Kennedy assassination? Martin Luther King? Illegal Wiretapping?) but none is really given much emphasis. The only fireworks left is the not so revelatory relationship he had with his partner and personal assistant. Sure, it would have been a blockbuster scandal back in the day, but now it has no surprise or bombshell impact. Worse, of all the misadventures Hoover engaged in that could have been better explored in the 2+ hour movie, the unexciting rapport he had with his two sidekicks is by far the most boring. OK we get it, his assistant Gandy was a loyal conspirator. After scene after scene of Hoover and his partner Tolson, not much else comes out of it. All that is left to explore that would have remained in Scorsese's version are the scenes with Hoover's mother. Clearly, a great deal about who Hoover was came from her, and at least all parties involved get that right.Eastwood, let's face it, is an old guy. His direction is a little wooden. There is little flair or momentum to his recent films. The lack of a powerful soundtrack absolutely sucks all the emotion out of the film. I am reminded of "The Good Shepherd", where an important story that is integral to our country's history, is treated too benign in fashion, when a real piece of history should have a visceral impact on us. Such moments can be found in this screenplay, but they are buried in a pile of less important dialogue that passes without any comment. Although significant characters in history are involved, they never show up in the film. Scorsese and Decaprio, the duo that brought us the excellent "Aviator" and "The Departed", would have been a perfect match for a truly scandalous biopic. The single fact he could hold his seat of power for 40 years or so should spark controversy alone, but just goes by without really being addressed. The audience loses the chance to feel the impact of that fact with this blah by-the-book storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood is No Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film (finally) on Netflix and I found myself glued to the screen for two and a half hours--not entertained, exactly, but fascinated by the way that so many talented people could produce something so "not good." This movie is not really good. It's acceptable, but not special enough to deserve more than a six out of 10, and that's including two stars for the script, which was clever and concise, and that's high praise for a movie script.The problem with the movie wasn't the cast or the script, it was the director. This film needed a firm hand on the wheel but there was no such guidance. It just drifts off message and runs into the rocks. It reminded me of "Hoffa," which also featured a weird biography of a famous (infamous?) character, that was fascinating because it was so weird. "J. Edgar" desperately needed to show us something about, well, J. Edgar. It needed to demonstrate just how he rationalized his crimes and emphasized his heroism. I think the script originally attempted to do that--to show a tortured soul coming to grips with the distance between his reach and his grasp, between his actions and his motives, but the execution is off. We needed to have a pause or two in the action, where "Speedy" Hoover would slow down, or even stop, the camera could give DiCaprio an opportunity to convey the internal hurricane that could result in the man like J.Edgar Hoover. But Clint Eastwood's direction never takes a break and we speed along like a cheap tour bus of Famous Homes of Washington--never pausing to take a breath and never having the chance to imagine what it must have been like to be one of the most famous men on Earth and, also, one of the most secret.This movie was a missed opportunity. Clint Eastwood seems to produce some mighty fine motion pictures when horses, horsepower and shooting and punching are on the menu. When the evil that men do is quietly done by those wearing spiffy suits and ties, he's out of his depth. This film suffers from too many answers and not enough questions. To understand a man like Hoover, a few good questions go much further than all the bogus "answers" in the world. Somebody, at some time, during the filming of this should have made the "too on the nose" gesture and told Clint not to be so literal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather dull, and not really clear as to its purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, when everybody still looked like they had stepped out of a picture by Edward Hopper or Jack Vettriano, there was a rather weird guy who built an empire which he then pursued to the point of obsession, at the expense of all else and in a way that actually did himself harm and hurt many others... Let me guess, a never-really-bettered film made with (and by) Orson Welles 74 years ago? No. OK, then maybe Howard Hughes as portrayed in "The Aviator" by Leonardo DiCaprio? No, but (very) close - J. Edgar Hoover as portrayed in the film of the same name by Leonardo DiCaprio! Supplementary question: how many more times is Leo going to age slightly unconvincingly in a movie? Answer came there none. To be fair, I learned some things about America I did not know from "J. Edgar", most especially in the first few minutes of the film about the period immediately after the First World War. However, for the most part (about 2 hours) we get to know a bit about a rather unpleasant man doing rather unpleasant things in what seems like a rather unpleasant country. This is actually a bit unfair on the FBI, since obviously they must have done plenty of good stuff. (So much in fact that the "X Files" and especially (Olivia Dunham in) "Fringe" make this reviewer personally feel regular regret that he did not sign up for a job at the Bureau years ago!) But here, Hoover tries to protect his position - obviously in the name of America, its Constitution and people - from just about anybody he feels like, and also from politicians out to get him who publicly might seem like heroes, and indeed say much themselves about America, its Constitution and people, but privately are at best flawed and at worst criminal, crooked, merciless or all three. Right and wrong simply melt away in such contexts, and we cease to care. All the more so, when the general atmosphere of uncertainty about America's democratic credentials leave us wondering if the film itself takes a slant we are not aware of! These are near-unsurmountable problems where a film has to make us care about at least something...If I want a history of the FBI, I'll read a book - hopefully one written by a Brit. If I want more about Kennedy or Martin Luther King, well there are films on that (documentaries and otherwise). For all its flaws (and length!) "JFK" is a true work of film art. If I want to know about America in the 30s-60s, I could go with that similarly fine film "The Butler", which takes its stance, knows what it wants to say and sticks with that, in impressive if controversial manner. If I want to see what a bad guy Hoover was, this film won't do it, given that everybody else is bad too, and maybe even America as such (sadly enough, given its superficial reputation). If I want to get to know Hoover as a person, I need less of the history and more of the man - even if they are rather inseparable. If I want to know that - beneath it all - Hoover was a good guy, then this film also won't cut it, despite the odd tender moment. If I want to know that Hoover was a real person, warts and all, this film is not the best vehicle for that either, given that it seems fantastic in places, not least because of that makeup department, in which "warts and all" are what we get, absolutely literally!Sadly or happily, films are not books, and they have to take some kind of line at some point, and not just splurge together past, present and future, private and public life, institution and man, and hope that some kind of sophisticated analytical picture emerges from the chaos. For it does not, and there is just the chaos...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not successful as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching J. Edgar I, as usually, checked out the IMDb score. I try not to be influenced by it that much, but have to admit that the thought of the low score the movie had received, didn't leave my mind the entire time. And I kept asking myself - is it because of actors, plot, writing or something else? It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't a successful one as well. Because I'm not an American, the history of FBI and Hoover was quite unknown for me. And I usually like movies that can teach me something new or at least make me do some research, especially if it's related with historical events and people. But there's a negative side to it as well. Sometimes movies fail to explain simple things in an understandable way and it keeps you in the dark through the whole movie. I had a notion that this is going to be the case, so I opened Wikipedia already from the start and followed the movie time-line and some of the characters. Is it really the task of the audience to read additional materials or it is writer/director that has to provide this information? I don't want to write a full review here, but in short - DiCaprio was excellent as always, but couldn't save the whole movie. Other characters lacked emotion and their personalities weren't deep enough. I lost the confidence and belief because of poor makeup and dark lightning. Not going to watch it again, sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise for an Obscure Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie after picking it up on Blu Ray at Big Lots for $3.00 recently. I had never heard of the film, and that made me skeptical about it. But, it was a historical drama with Leonardo DiCaprio and it was directed by Clint Eastwood, and it was only $3.00, so I decided to take the risk. And I'm glad I did!In light of all the above, I went into this movie with low expectations. It's not every day that a DiCaprio film flies in under the radar without making major headlines, nor does an Eastwood-directed film perform poorly at the box office very often. For some reason this film did just that, which is really unfortunate because it's a great movie. Would I call it one of DiCaprio's best? No. And I might say the same for Eastwood, although it is still a very well made film even if it might be second tier to "Unforgiven", "Million Dollar Baby" or "Mystic River".One thing that does make the film a bit odd is that DiCaprio's portrayal of J. Edgar Hoover has him going back and forth between a young Hoover and an old man. From the outset of the movie, you quickly see DiCaprio made up as a man in perhaps his 70's, and I will say that my first take on the first viewing of him like that left me thinking that they could have done a bit of a better job with the makeup. However, as the film went along, either the makeup got better or I got more used to it, and by the end of the film I had a better appreciation for the time that had gone into the transformation.That said, the film itself was quite educational. I'm ashamed to say that I didn't really know very much about J. Edgar Hoover at all before having watched this film. As a Generation X-er, Hoover's story all happened before my time, and my experience of U.S. History is that folks my age got more exposure to the great wars of the 20th Century than we did to 20th Century domestic affairs in school. "J. Edgar" was a great learning tool, even if the film is more of a dramatization than a documentary.That said, I'd give the film a 7/10. It's not the best film you're ever going to see, but it's also a pleasant surprise if you go into it with low expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In three words; Good ? Bad - Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We follow J.Edgar Hoover throughout his life, the story is told via Hoover writing his memoirs with the assistance of various upcoming FBI agents whilst he also carries out his duties as head of the FBI. Eastwood dances around various stages in Hoover's life in perhaps an overly complex way. Clearly the director didn't want to plod through the story in chronological order however; at times I felt that he needed to be more cohesive with the narrative. There were times where he lost the pace of the film.I knew very little about Hoover before watching the film however he clearly led a full and interesting life. What strikes as rather odd from the first scene in why Eastwood would have chosen DiCaprio to play this multifaceted character in the first place? He is not the obvious choice however his acting ability shines through and he is believable even when in full make-up as the older Hoover. Having said this I felt I needed time to get used to his accent and character but as the film settles it is easy to enjoy a very good performance.We have to rely on DiCaprio to hold the film together as he has a poor supporting cast. Armie Hammer plays Hoover's close assistance Clyde Tolson. He also has full make-up in order to age him at different parts of the film however; unlike his co-star he is unable to make a believable transition to an aged man. Hammer's portrayal of old Tolson would not be out of place in a skit on Jackass but here he's a sore thumb.I really liked Hammer in The Social Network as the Winklevi twins however he is clearly out of his depth in this film. Tolson was one of only a few people that Hoover felt comfortable with and could become himself. However, there is reluctance for Hoover to portray his true feelings despite Tolson's drawn out advances and Hoover's own feelings. I feel that Eastwood was as uncomfortable in dealing with Hoover's sexuality as much as he struggled with it during his life.In one scene with Hoover and Tolson the best Eastwood can do to highlight their intensifying homosexual relationship in a conversation about woman's clothing and what I can only describe as a hissy fit! This is condescending to the audience and rather embarrassing. One would expect a better scene from Dustin Lance Black, the writer of Milk.Equally as disappointing was Naomi Watts who plays Hoover's trusted secretary Helen Gandy. She struggles to portray an older Gandy and comes across as constantly being completely fed up however we are meant to believe that she is a loyal servant to Hoover. This does not portray the relationship she had with Hoover very well and ultimately lets the film down.Whilst DiCaprio has to bind scenes together with these poor performances from his colleagues he is saved by Judi Dench who plays Hoover's mother, Anna Marie. Whilst their scenes together are much better than that of Hammer and Watts we still see a struggle in building a believable relationship. Hoover was, for want of a better word, a mummy's boy and Dench does well to show this however the script again lets the scenes down as far too often we hear Hoover saying 'yes Mother' 'no Mother'. It all became a bit Norman Bates to me.Eastwood is very much a hit and miss director for me, at times he is highly overrated not only as a director but as an actor. Fortunately he does not make an appearance in this film. Generally the look of the film works my only criticism is the numerous scenes with Hoover standing on his balcony watching the latest President being inaugurated. Whilst CGI is seldom used in the film, and in these scenes it is minimal, it still does not compliment an otherwise beautifully filmed flick.Eastwood is unable to bring his cast together and perhaps he has relied on DiCaprio too much and he is an exceptional talent but not even he can save the film. There is Oscar talk for the leading man which is fair enough but there will be no awards for Dirty Harry, the remaining cast or writer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. Edgar is a 2011 American biographical drama film directed, co- produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood written by Dustin Lance Black, the film focuses on the career of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover from the Palmer Raids onwards, including an examination of his private life as an alleged closeted homosexual.The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the title character, Armie Hammer,Naomi Watts, Josh Lucas, Judi Dench and Ed Westwick. J. Edgar opened the AFI Fest 2011 in Los Angeles on November 3, 2011, and had its limited release on November 9, followed by wide release on November 11.It explores the public and private life of one of the most powerful, controversial and enigmatic figures of the 20th century. As the face of law enforcement in America for almost fifty years, J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) was feared and admired, reviled and revered. But behind closed doors, he held secrets that would have destroyed his image, his career and his life</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After studying a little background on Hoover I realize that if Christians were writing and producing this the slant would be about Hoovers view of God. But since the Gay mafia in Hollywood must be approving and many script writers are...My bias is to say I don't believe he was gay many close friends said his relationship to Clyde was quote "brotherly"..my view of history is that if a man has done great things deserving of honor to piddle around with whatever his flaws were is simply "petty". Also I thought De Caprio was outstanding in this performance. I found myself admiring even more J. Edger's roll in keeping America safe and his focus on being at least as equipped as the bad guys should be a source for national pride. Again as I recall the Senator's comments about if Hoover himself had personally made an arrest "petty" Why is it we as humans so often don't feel secure unless we've taken you down a notch or two as the Senator endeavored to do with Hoover.?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DiCaprio's Crowning Performance in a Mediocre Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching J. Edgar I had nostalgia for the 2008 film by Clint Eastwood, Changeling. Eastwood coincidentally tackles the same decade with that film as he does here with J. Edgar. At times, it felt like sequel to Changeling in a very strange way. Sam subject matter, same cars, same sets, same costumes, Jeffrey Donovan; but, Changeling is a superior film to J. Edgar. Though it features one hell of a leading performance, J. Edgar is a dead movie and one of Eastwood's worst directing efforts.The movie does offer some insight to J. Edgar Hoover's life and celebrates the man who moved our country forward. Things in today's time we forget weren't around 100 years ago. We travel down Hoover's historical life through flashbacks, but this approach doesn't work for the film. It almost feels like "story time"; very convoluted and amateurish. J. Edgar does show some of the brutality of the time, but the film frequently asks us where would we be without the man?The film's undeniable asset is the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio's career as the title character. DiCaprio has always been one of my favorite working actors, sadly after rewatching some of his best work, my opinion of the actor slowly began to dwindle. After my viewing of J. Edgar though, DiCaprio has reaffirmed what I believed to be true. DiCaprio has tackled a lot of yelling scenes in his career; roles that allowed him to go over the top of the overt. But in J. Edgar, he dials it back immensely and it works to his advantage in capturing Hoover's spirit. Setting the voice aside, he really has nothing to really flaunt. It's all created in the scene, within the soul of the man coming out in the actor.DiCaprio's stunning portrayal is what got me through the duration of the picture. He just as much chemistry with Armie Hammer as he did Kate Winslet (times two), Marion Cotillard, and Claire Danes. It's the crowning work of DiCaprio's short career so far, too bad it had to be in a mediocre film. Armie Hammer is really great in his role, too. Namoi Watts is handed a horridly written role, but goes head under water to make her performance the most it could've been. Judi Dench also has a few scenes, but doesn't leave an impression. J. Edgar may have actors giving it all they've got, but it's as flawed of a film as a guilty person on death row. Clint Eastwood usually knows how to command his pictures, but must've been asleep while filming J. Edgar, if he wasn't, he certainly put me to sleep. He drains any life the decent screenplay had to offer. The big thing that distances the audience from J. Edgar is the horrible cinematography. Murky and mud-like, the cinematography makes the film look worse than what it probably is. The film score, which Eastwood perfected in Changeling, is embarrassing and awkwardly placed here.Narrating the movie was a great way to keep the audience aware of the plot, but the way Eastwood does it in a lame way. The script has good notes of our history, laws, rights, and organizations that ran the world at the time. It appropriately shows Hoover's rise to power, change, and innovative ideas about the justice system. The film itself benefits from the occasional style J. Edgar supplies with shootouts, Hoover's handwritten signature, and many genius make-up scenes. In the movie, we see Hoover living momentous occasions such, but after so many pile up you begin to wonder if they wanted to explore Hoover's reactions or if they were just too lazy to try.I didn't know of the possibility that Hoover may gay. There's never a straight answer given to the public (some were even offended when the film was released questioning his possible homosexuality?), but this is one area where Easwood got it right. It gives us a straight answer of yes, he was homosexual. It's more complicated than just gay or straight because he denied those pent up feelings to retain his mother's approval. The scene where the mother and son have that conversation was chilling. I'm glad the bio-pic covered that topic with great detail, showing one of the most valuable men in the history of our country was homosexual. J. Edgar may be a dull film, but sometimes it stretches further than boredom. Rating: 4/10Grade: C</fullReview>

Also his movement is inconsistent.. sometimes he tries to move slow like an old person might but then he doesn't. The whole thing comes across as unintentionally comedic. the guy who does the wobbly head thing also does so in a laboured way. not impressive these two problems of makeup and voice undermine the credibility of this movie. but he seems to think that di caprio is invincible and capable of taking on any part, like the next robert de niro.

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's romantic political epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is a master in cinematic storytelling. Not in the sense of giving us a cinematic experience in the tradition of a Christopher Nolan or Spielberg film, but in the art of storytelling, pretty straightforward with a powerhouse script. In this instance he was let down by the script which boarded on a Douglas Sirk sought of melodrama, and as if it was directed by John "Pink Flamingos" Waters who attempted to go straight. Not that there is anything bad about that, in actual fact I enjoyed it in the same vain as that other camp classic MOMMIE DEAREST (1981). DiCaprio's performance was sublime, perfect for such a melodrama. Under the ageing make- up he reminded me of Jon Voight, (the performance did have a Jon Voightness about it). Even when delivering those corny lines, DiCaprio excelled, even more with the homosexual aspect that was played out brilliantly by all without it being too obtrusive. To add to the campiness was the ageing make-up. It was distracting at first, but I soon settled into the high camp melodrama about a brute who did some good along the way, but as with all great historical figures, they have some kind of attachment with their mother.A somewhat interesting melodrama, (and an educational one), that in the end to me seemed like a romantic movie between a brute and his sidekick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, although it didn't slip into the clichs I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a "good" movie, but not a great movie.Let's start with the three faults of this film. First, I don't think I've ever seen poorer makeup jobs on actors in my life...particularly on Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson. Just horrible.Second, I'm not a big fan of flashbacks...I think many film makers overdo them tremendously. But this was a terrible job of using flashbacks. One minute Hoover was trying to solve the Lindburgh baby kidnapping, and in the next scene he was listening to tapes of JFK having sex with Marilyn Monroe. I guess there was connection, but I didn't see it. And that happened again and again in this film. I expect better from Clint Eastwood.And third, that has to be the worst portrayal of Richard Nixon that I can imagine.Beyond those three issues, I thought this was a good movie. I've never wanted to "like" Leonardo DiCaprio, but over and over and over again I am impressed by his screen performances. I don't think he sounded like Hoover here, but I still think it was a good portrayal. And, it is admirable that he took a role that would be unpopular.I also admire the perspective of the film. I don't think it had one! Hoover was portrayed not as a villain, but rather as a dedicated man with many peccadilloes, including a vengeance streak. Not the evil clich that we usually see in portrayals of Hoover, but rather as a very, very flawed man. Bravo for not descending to what I expected to find.But, this film could have been so much better. So I give it less than the "normal" 7.</fullReview>

Also, I think the writer took liberties with Hoover's story and all the movie portrayed has never been confirmed. But, the acting was good and I liked the makeup they did for the older Hoover.The movie sort of confused me since it would jump back and forth in time, but from what I could gather, the story centers around the older Hoover as he tells about his accomplishments to a journalist and when it shows him in his younger days, that is him retelling the story. And according to the movie, with a lot of embellishments. FINAL VERDICT: OK, but too long. If you want to watch a drama, this is a good pick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but nothing new in this biopic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Clint Eastwood directs this sometimes riveting biopic of J. Edgar Hoover(Leonardo DiCaprio), who wanted attention and loved thinking of being in command. Very early Hoover seemed to have over zealous intentions when he entered the U.S. Department of Justice, where he met his faithful personal secretary Helen Gandy(Naomi Watts). J. Edgar had a fixation on the communists and anything that in his mind hinted to be a revolutionary faction. Hoover became the first head of the FBI in 1924; diligently building a reputation for the agency he ruled heavy handed for over forty years. He personally hired and fired his agents; even giving a job to the unqualified Clyde Tolson(Armie Hammer), who would become his life long confidant and special companion. Hoover wanted a biography written stretching the truth about a few facts like his involvement in finding Charles Lindbergh's kidnapped baby and the capture of the notorious John Dillinger. A darker side of one of the most feared men in America, has J. Edgar attempting to manipulate the Kennedys, Martin Luther King and President Richard Nixon. Not much time is spent in regards to his cross-dressing and his rumored homosexually; although there are a couple of scenes of his varying degrees of affection for Tolson. J. Edgar Hoover died in 1972 and with him his "personal" files on citizens, entertainers and politicians. At times this film lumbered making you feel your two hours-plus investment. Nothing new, nothing shocking and don't expect the truth and nothing but the whole truth. Also in the cast: Geoff Pierson, Ed Westwick, Josh Hamilton and Judi Dench.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It feels to me like the academy tries to avoid nominating Leonardo DiCaprio for Oscars. Even though he doesn't give it his all sometimes, you can't deny that he should've been nominated for 2011's J. Edgar, a disappointing film that should've been better, while DiCaprio couldn't have been.The film follows the life of former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, and who better to direct it than four time Oscar Winner Clint Eastwood, one of the best. Eastwood is usually a master at directing biopics, so I thought that the duo of Eastwood and DiCaprio would bring home the gold.Sadly, it's not as great as it sounds. With a screenplay written by Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black(Milk), J. Edgar, while being a good movie, is too long, and there are a lot of moments in which I would drift into outer space. and because it's not that great, it didn't get any nominations, or, Oscars.They would've nominated DiCaprio, and should have, but they are always out to get him. I have a feeling that this year he's a double threat, with both The Great Gatsby and Django Unchained under his belt. DiCaprio gives one of his richest performances, playing a sad man not knowing what he wants. He knows what he wants, but he knows that in his day and age, he can't have it.The films most interesting moments, I thought, were the ones with him and Clyde(Armie Hammer), his right hand man, who was rumored to be sleeping with him. J. Edgar was a private man, and this is a private movie, that leads you to make conclusions, but even though it's mainly speculation. Overall, J. Edgar is good, but not as good as it should've been.B+</fullReview>

Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) gives a rousing performance of an insecure, power hungry man who clings to his position as the director of the Bureau of Investigation, the predecessor to what later became the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) which he held since the agency's inception. It was a position he clung to for almost 50 years. Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) gives an equally power performance as Hoover's Associate Director for 42 years.The on-screen tension of Hoover and Tolson's "relationship" being more than just colleagues seemed to dominate the film. There is one particularly volatile scene with Hoover and Tolson where Hoover suggests to Tolson that it might be time to get married and Tolson erupts in anger leading to him revealing his true feelings to Hoover.Check out my full review here: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/ 2012/05/j-edgar.html#!/2012/05/j-edgar.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Interesting but Also Incredibly Boring (Sorry)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, I wanted to enjoy this movie so much more than I did but I guess I should've known from the start that it just wouldn't be my sort of flick. I've never been a major Clint Eastwood fan. Sorry, I'm just not. He's too dry. I enjoyed MILLION DOLLAR BABY, but not enough to warrant watching it a second time. Outside of that, he's just never been my style. Add to that the fact that this movie is a biopic on a political figure, which comes with it's own level of expectation of disinterest. But I was really hoping this one would be different because a) I've really come to enjoy Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor and b) the story behind the formation of the FBI and its infamous founder sounds awesome. But alas, it wasn't. Despite everything this movie had going for it, this movie was just sooo booooring. And what's worse than a boring movie? A boring movie with a runtime of nearly two and a half hours. This was a true test of endurance for me to sit through. It's the story of J. Edgar Hoover, the man who resided as the head of the FBI from its formation in 1935 until his death in 1972. It tells of how he formed the foundation we all know today, pioneered new forensics techniques crucial to solving crimes, and collected secrets on the most powerful people in the country. It also touches on the unconfirmed homosexual tension between Hoover and his second-in-command, Clyde Tolson.I hate to discourage anyone from viewing this movie based solely on my negative feelings with it, but I watch all movies (including biopics/historical dramas) with the sole intent of being entertained. Films that are historically accurate are a bonus (and, for the record, I have no idea how accurate this film is to real life). In the case of J. EDGAR, I was bored to tears so many times in this film that I'd lost count. It's a very interesting movie and it would've made for a great subject for a History Channel documentary, but the movie just doesn't cut it for me. Now I may not be an Eastwood fan but I will agree that he is a masterful filmmaker. This film looks amazing. Visually, it's incredibly beautiful. Eastwood (and of course, cinematographer Tom Stern) have an incredible eye for film and every frame is wonderfully shot. There is great production value in this movie, from the sets to the costume design. You'll feel as if you've stepped back in time to mid-20th century America, but the story (encompassing a span of nearly 50 years) is so drawn out that I couldn't help but lose interest. I do like that the Lindbergh kidnapping was integrated into the film as the key case that brought attention to Hoover and the effectiveness of his FBI. It's a case I'm not all too familiar with, but know enough of it that engaged my interest in the story from that point.And the performances in the film are not to be doubted. Like I said, I've come to respect DiCaprio as an excellent actor and he lives up to it here. To be honest, I had a hard time buying him in the old age makeup for Hoover's older years. He looked older, but still sounded like a young DiCaprio so I wasn't buying into it. The same for Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson. The old age makeup in this movie just didn't work for me. It looked as if they were wearing rubber masks, and their voices sounded no different so it never clicked with me. I was able to get over that fact about 2/3 of the way through the movie. As for the performances, they really were great. DiCaprio should at lease be nominated for some awards and Hammer might deserve a couple nods himself. I almost didn't recognize Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy, Hoover's secretary and confidant. And of course there's Dame Judi Dench adding her strength as Hoover's overbearing mother, which brings us to another aspect to the film I wasn't sure they'd touch on: the one bit of information I retained about Hoover from a high school research project I did on the man was that he was a rumored cross-dresser. The film does touch on his possible unspoken relationship with Tolson and there is a brief inclusion of Hoover's cross-dressing, but it doesn't steal the spotlight. The focus remains on Hoover/Tolson and the birth of the FBI, but it's only barely interesting enough for me to recommend. Watch the film, but expect the need for breaks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I lacked the really interesting parts of J. Edgar's life and even missed out on some of the dirty and gritty stuff I was wanting to see. Which is a shame because since J. Edgar played a crucial role in founding the FBI and being the head director. It just felt that it lacked parts that should have been more engrossing, especially since the guy had many secrets. Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor and he did a alright job playing J. Edgar Hoover although the way he tries to talk like J. Edgar seemed a bit forced. The story goes back and forth in time periods which can get slightly confusing at times despite it showing J. Edgar being young at one point and another old. Despite the flaws in the story because of the lack of it or lack of what could have been intriguing. The directing is very well done by Clint Eastwood. The way he J. Edgar rose to power didn't seem fully developed though but that was probably to give more time in showing what he did after he rose to power. And his personal life the way it was told didn't seem all that interesting despite the fact that he had many interesting aspects when it came to his life. Even if the story is told in J. Edgar's own words in the movie. But what I liked was how the movie didn't try to force itself to give an answer for everything behind the man, since it's more accurate that way. Another flaw is that the movie drags on sometimes and felt more like a documentary than a movie sometimes, even if this movie is based on a true story. So in a way it can be a good thing and might even be a decent autobiographic movie for history class. And the way it showed what J. Edgar brought to the FBI was semi-intriguing. Especially the second half of the movie and also I would suggest watching "Public Enemies" 2009 which is a alright movie before seeing this. So there is some positive things about this movie but also has it's flaws. So overall it's a pretty good movie with very good directing and almost top notch acting, but nothing extraordinary. But far from deserving the bashing it has been getting.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt like this movie had everything. It had action, drama, and adventure. Ever since I seen the previews this movie looked like a captivating movie. I am not a big Di Caprio fan but surprisingly he did a pretty good job with this one. This movie had me at attention the whole way through but that could be because I am a big history buff. This movie tells a great story about our American history. I also like the make up they did on Di Caprio character and the props they used for the time period, the suits were pretty sweet as well. Overall this movie is a good movie to watch if your into the whole history thing. It had a really good plot to it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brokeback Mountain 2: G-Men...where's the rest of the story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the thing that disappointed me the most about J Edgar is that it isn't a historical epic. This is NOT about Hoover and his life, or at least it doesn't focus on that as a main topic. The casting for the film is strange at best, and the story is told as almost a fairy tale, taking well documented rumours and putting them all together to tell the story. It also takes historical liberties by using factual historical moments and skewing them to fit this particular telling of Hoover. An example which would be the Lindbergh baby kidnapping which this movie has Hoover himself arresting the man who would eventually be killed for the crime, something that never happened. In fact I think if you asked Hoover himself he would probably not even put the Lindbergh kidnapping in his top ten best cases but they use it as a pinnacle in this film. I'm not trying to be nit-picky because a film like this is indeed fiction so I can handle it not being completely accurate but it takes such liberties unapologetically and never even tries to nail down any truly factual moments in Hoover's life.Perhaps one of the biggest stars on the planet, Leonardo DiCaprio really gives a powerhouse performance in this film. Is he playing Hoover? No not really. He's playing someone that vaguely resembles Hoover in personality but not even remotely close in looks. If he had been playing some random fictional character his performance would have been THEE performance of the year. He is excellent. Almost the same could be said for Armie Hammer who gives a solid performance as Clyde Tolson who is reduced to nothing more than Hoover's lover in this movie. We don't see anything of what he did for the FBI, or his dedication to his job parallelling that of Hoover's. He is literally reduced to being Hoover's lover in this movie and nothing more. Naomi Watts plays Hoover's most trusted secretary for his entire career, Helen Gandy. If you blink you'll miss her in a handful of scenes but the ironic thing is...this was Helen Gandy. She was always there, always by his side, always doing everything, but always in the background so in that aspect they nailed the character. The supporting cast are all good in their respective roles but ultimately are just background for DiCaprio and Hammer's love affair. I do have to mention the casting for the character of Robert Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Nothing against these two men that portrayed them but neither one were good casting for the roles.Anyone that knows me or follows my reviews know that I idolize Clint Eastwood. He is one of my favourite people on the face of the earth. I'm just not sure where he is going with this film. You watch the special features and he says that Hoover's personal relationships are for us to decide what we believe but this film leaves nothing to the imagination. It is plain and clear that Tolson and Hoover were lifetime partners and lovers. If this film had been presented as exactly that...a romance...a fictional 'what if' about Hoover and Tolson...even if they had called it "Hoover and Tolson" then I could review it as a romantic historical epic but it is presented like the life and times of Hoover and it is not. Yes you get breezed through his career and it makes a nutshell of every political relationship he had and it just barely touches on the brilliance of how Hoover stayed vital in American History for decades but then the main story is the romance. I understand now why critics chastised Eastwood for the film because you aren't expecting every other scene to be about his sexuality. That was one tiny tiny part of this man's existence. Now to pay homage to the good in the film. The special effects, make up, and cinematography in the movie is breathtaking. The way they aged DiCaprio, Hammer, and Watts is absolutely brilliant. I've never seen it done so well and so flawlessly. The way that the world comes to life and everything is shot is flawless. I wonder if Eastwood even read the script or looked at the content of the story or if he just lined up shots and worked on the outer workings of the film.So in short...some powerful performances, brilliant make-up and wardrobe and good cinematography but historical accuracy is completely skewed, very little fact based reality, and a love story between two men. Much disappointment for me in what could have been a historical epic. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I voted the movie with a 6 because even if it was a better than a 6 movie I was disappointed by the director's view on the essence of the matter. I usually admire his stance and attitude towards other themes but this time he appears to have a really conservative approach. The way I saw it he is probably a supporter of hoover's work a man who in the most obvious way was not a friend of democracy. I'm not an American and I cannot judge using the same criteria that Americans do but the figure I saw in the movie is a well done try to improve the image of the legacy of a person that even the director despises!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to explore the ambiguities and psychological complexities of the man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of the 20th century was an incredibly corrupt and conspiratorial period, particularly in American politics. A figure within this rich history was John Edgar Hoover, founder and head of the FBI from it's inception in 1935. He did much for the modernisation of police procedure, but he was also a very contentious character. He kept secret files on public figures, using them to blackmail. This also kept each new president in check, creating a position in the country who was above the law, unaccountable, and practically untouchable. His FBI was corrupt, and Hoover himself publicly stated that organised crime did not exist on the level that was claimed about The Mafia. It's interesting that it was not until Hoover's death in 1972, that the US supreme court et al began investigating and eventually prosecuting organised gangs.Obviously this first paragraph is unable to summarise the full complexity of a man, - speculated as being homosexual (something that has never been proved) - I was expecting good things for a project directed by Clint Eastwood (who has been active over the last decade or so, producing some incredibly accomplished films), and starring Leonardo DiCaprio (who has himself been involved in great films, and performing spectacularly - despite still having the "heart-throb" label attached to him due to one film, Titanic (1997). J. Edgar's main focus is not necessarily the full complexities of the real man. It's attention is focused upon the man as a public figure, a character that he plays himself in life. The image is important to him; he is shown as being a great PR man. In the early stages of the FBI, he influenced the content of radio shows, comic books and movies (such as 'G' Men (1935)) that were depicting the courageous activities of the bureau. Hoover's public image is portrayed as being practically identical to his private persona, keeping only three people close to him: His mother Anna Marie (Judi Dench), his secretary (Naomi Watts), and Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), his close associate at the FBI. Tolson and Hoover were close their entire careers, leading to the speculation that they were lovers - something that seems plausible on the evidence, but has no concrete conclusion. Therefore, the film only really briefly suggest this, leaving the viewer to ponder personal conclusions.Whilst the screenplay (written by Dustin Lance Black, who had previously won an Oscar for the fantastic Milk (2008)) fails to really explore the ambiguities, or even much of the psychological complexities of Hoover, the production is exceptional. The film's span brings it through the 1920's into the 1970's and costume, sets and cinematography is dazzlingly beautiful, and exacting of their periods. DiCaprio's performance is good, but the screen is quite often filled with prosthetically 'enhanced' pensioner's, which at times actually aggravated me. This is not to say that the make-up is bad, it is very good. This could have been less distracting had there only been one character, however, with three or more, is too much. With some great talent attached to this project, I would have expected a more interesting film. As it is, it's not the worst biopic that I have ever seen. However, for my money, if you want a film about this interesting historical figure, I would advise you watch Larry Cohen's excellent low budget The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover (1977).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hero, monster, human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a film about the life of legendary, and to many, notorious, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, in his time one of the most powerful people in the United States, is not easy. Too divided are opinions about the man, too high are the emotions running still. Trying to portrait of Hoover is an attempt at which one can only lose. Clint Eastwood has tried and he has at least not failed entirely. As flawed as the film is, it at least presents a sketch, if not a full portrait, which offers food for thought and discussion.The fanatic control freak driven by equal fear and hatred of everything he considered extremist is here reduced to an insecure, complex-ridden, Oedipus-like figure trying to compensate for his own self-disgust. It is a view that mostly reduces Hoover's motivation to the private, his low self-esteem, the adoration and fear of the dominating mother (memorable: Dame Judy Dench), his problematic sexuality. This Hoover is less a political fanatic than a man seeking attention, ultimately seeking love, yet always half believing he does not deserve it. For the right he might be too unheroic, for the left too human. This Hoover, created by Eastwood and brought to life by an impressive Leonardo DiCaprio may be sitting between all chairs, but there is some plausibility to him.At the heart of the film are his two major relationships: with his mother and with his friend, assistant and love of his life Clyde (Armie Hammer). Hoover's rumored homosexuality is hinted at but not finally resolved. they clearly are in love but in what way remains open. DiCaprio masterfully portraits the uncertainty, the paranoia, the aggressive dominance and, yes, even the vulnerability. As flawed as he was, as dangerous as he may have been - and the film does a fine job of allowing glimpses into his dubious methods, especially towards Democratic presidents such as Roosevelt and Kennedy, he was a human being who knew pain as much as he knew love.The film's problems lie elsewhere: Eastwood often excels at giving his films a very distinct atmosphere which allows the viewer to experience how the times in which the film takes place may have felt like. He fails to achieve this here. This is as best costume drama, the paranoid atmosphere of the 1920s and later the Cold War or the gangster folklore of the 1930s are talked about but not recreated. The film also fails to have much of a development. Early on, the themes are set, most of what comes later is repetition. Hoover is not allowed to grow and so the film with its different chronology - it tells Hoover's story until the 30s and then picks up in his later years, the earlier parts subject to Hoover's telling them to prospective biographers - let it unravel into the episodic, the fragmentary.J. Edgar is too long, especially the last 30 minutes are increasingly painfully repetitive. Only at the very end when some of what we have seen before is revealed to be Hoover's lies, is there a hint at what this film could also have been: an intelligent study of appearance and reality, about a man writing and re-writing his own life. As it stands, it is a convincing sketch of Hoover but little more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J. Edgar - and Norman Bates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is very much in the style of Eastwood's 2008 CHANGELING but not quite as enthralling. As in Meryl Streep's recent take on Mrs Thatcher, Leonardo DiCaprio spends a lot of his screen time playing seriously old (amazing make-up!). The flashbacks to his life and achievements are given more depth than Margaret's but here too the emphasis seems a bit skewed. There's a lot about the Lindbergh baby kidnap case (for which Hoover falsely claimed more credit than he was due) and plenty about his relentless pursuit of US Communists, but not enough about his fractious relationship with the Kennedys (and other administrations) - just a brief scene of him listening to a JFK bedroom tape on the day of the president's trip to Dallas.Edgar's momma's-boy closeness to his clingy old ma (Judi Dench) is sensitively brought out, although the context of the single "little black dress" moment (which I was impatient to see!) tends to evoke the spirit of Norman Bates. Hoover's relationship with his FBI personal assistant Clyde Tolson is covered in depth but a bit coyly. There are some cosy domestic scenes (they lived in separate homes) and a bit of discreet hand-holding, but we seem to be invited to infer that the 'affair' was platonic (although Richard Nixon is allowed to suggest otherwise in a particularly fruity moment). There's a pleasingly cringe-making scene when a starlet asks Edgar for a dance and a nice edgy row with Clyde when Edgar lets slip that he's been dating Dorothy Lamour (wish we'd seen more of that).DiCaprio gives an Oscar-worthy performance, and Arnie Hammer is excellent as Tolson, teetering on the edge of camp (though he gets short-changed in the old-boy make-up). Dame Judi is good as always, and Naomi Watts makes Edgar's tirelessly loyal secretary an intriguing character. The film has a palette so muted (too muted?) it often seems like black-and-white. Eastwood's direction, like the script, is solid and makes a real effort to unravel the enigma that Hoover was, but the movie comes very close to being leaden in parts. Hoover served eight presidents: does this make him too sacred a cow to be put thoroughly through the revisionist meat-grinder?</fullReview>

With a special DiCapprio and perfect Christoph Waltz. With cantankerous Judi Dench and a harsh gestures. A tale. Like many from childhood. Same subject, same victory. And shadows of sacrifice and unfulfilled gay yearnings. An Eastwood is a show. Powerful, strange, iconoclastic.... and gripping.Same rule in this case. But movie begins after its end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the wax museum darkly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonard DiCaprio continues to distinguish himself as an actor with a powerful performance as America's number one crime fighter of the twentieth century in Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar. Focusing more on the man than the achievements it is a joyless interpretation by Eastwood who displays some sympathy but mostly dubious aspects of the FBI Director's career re-hashing with very little new insight the same old tired rumors tossed around for decades about a paranoid workaholic with quirks that had the goods on enough Presidents to give him absolute power, corruption being the perk.J. Edgar Hoover first made his name rousting Reds during the Rise of Bolshevism in the 20s. At age 26 he was given charge of what would be the FBI which he would transform into the elite crime fighting and forever Red hunting organization of the USA. The Linbergh baby kidnapping is solved, Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly, Baby Face Nelson are all brought to justice. With success comes fame and more power which Hoover plans to hold onto for as long as possible. In this case it will be his last dying breath.Eastwood's script and direction runs with all the rumors of the day ( homosexuality, cross dressing, glory hound extroadinaire, ) to flesh out J. Edgar and it comes across as catty as Hoover and Tolson in a scene gossip queening about Lucy and Daisy. There's a Ginger Rogers look alike Robert Kennedy and Richard Nixon imitators along with the dismissive glances of real American hero Charles Lindbergh who sees through the crime busters facade to convey his venality but little evidence from the up tight but elusive Hoover to offer viewer or historian anything new beyond the suppositions half a century old. With Eastwood literally and figuratively putting Hoover in a bad light throughout the film it is left up to DiCaprio to humanize him which he does with a startling restrained coldness and power of a man delusional or otherwise whose aim is true. From young adulthood to grave DiCaprio remains fully focused, convincing and absorbing. DiCaprio can only carry J.Edgar so far though and Eastwood's attempt at defining the man as a humorless Darth Vader most of the way adds nothing revelatory to the anti myth of the past few decades that followed the legendary build-up of the 20s and 30's. It's like walking through Madame Tussauds .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Controversial American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The portrait of one of the most controversial and feared men of the 20th century is brought to the screen with the cool, calculating precision of Clint Eastwood. J. Edgar Hoover was a man both admired and hated, a man who rose to be the most well known government figure to several generations of Americans; some loved him, some despised him. J. Edgar portrays the man in an honest and unflinching manner, chronicling the life of the creator of the FBI.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hoover, giving his best performance in years. From the idealistic up-and-coming moralist to the embittered and paranoid old man, DiCaprio completely absorbs himself into the character. He brings Hoover's repressed homosexuality to the forefront of his portrayal. Every movement, every expression is done cautiously, as if Hoover was completely preoccupied with guarding his secret. The man who had dirt on everyone had a secret more taboo than anything else.Hoover's love interest is played by Armie Hammer, who is wonderful. He essentially provides the concise to Hoover's ambition, and as a result he is slowly silenced. Barbara Hershey is amazingly creepy as Hoover's overbearing and domineering mother who controls his life until the day she dies. "I'd rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son" she tells Hoover.Eastwood directs the film in a cool, slow-paced manner, focusing on each scene to make every one of them important. The slowness may infuriate some, but this reviewer found it refreshing after a summer of Transformers. If there is any fault with the movie, it lies with Dustin Lance Black's script. He doesn't seem to be able to heighten the drama, and fails to pack a punch in some moments. But Black's use of the Lindberg kidnapping case as the dividing line between Hoover the idealist and Hoover the obsessed old man is well thought out.Overall, J. Edgar is a competent and intelligent film. Clint Eastwood does a remarkable job of recreating Hoover's world, and everyone in the main cast is Oscar worthy. The film succeeds by giving an unbiased and brutally honest look at one of the most hated men in American history.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Eastwood's strengths lack DiCaprio almost manages to make up for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'J. EDGAR': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Leonardo DiCaprio gives another mesmerizing performance in this biopic based on the famous FBI head honcho, for nearly 50 years, J. Edgar Hoover. He teams with director Clint Eastwood, who's directing turn is not nearly as impressive as DiCaprio's acting. The film as a whole is full of flaws and drags in narrative but DiCaprio's performance is still more than worth the price of admission and the subject matter is interesting despite the lack of quality storytelling. Eastwood has proved to be not quite as talented a director in recent years as many once thought he was but he still knows how to bring his trademark punch to all his work and, like I said, where his strengths lack DiCaprio almost manages to make up for. A film still worth seeing despite it's flaws (in my opinion).The film jumps back and forth from Hoover in his final days (DiCaprio in not so impressive makeup) to the time when he first took over the FBI and showed the world a new form of detective skills and law enforcement (including the tracking of fingerprints and knowing how to fully investigate a crime scene). The film focuses on his days working at the bureau as well as his private life, including his relationships with his overbearing mother (Judi Dench) and his close work associate Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer, in even worse makeup as an old man). It centers on his struggles with his feelings for Clyde, as well as cross-dressing, and his battle to keep them hidden from the rest of the world. The film was written by Dustin Lance Black (who also wrote the critically acclaimed 'MILK', from two years ago).The movie is pretty slow moving and all over the place; like most biopics there's no real plot direction but this film seems even more aimless than most. Like I mentioned the makeup is pretty bad and other production values in the $35 million budgeted film seem surprisingly amateurish. Even besides DiCaprio the acting is all more than decent though and Eastwood gives the mood and feel his typically nice touch (although it's beginning to feel really familiar). Hoover is a very interesting character and they really couldn't have gotten a better actor to pull off the performance. This drives the film and definitely makes it worthwhile, despite it's flaws.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V98a86sRto</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Recalcitrant Daffodil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. EDGAR is a cinematic accomplishment of the first order! From the screenplay (Dustin Lance Black) as acted by a host of consummate actors and directed with extreme sensitivity by Clint Eastwood, the sum of the parts is an extraordinary achievement in presenting a portrait of one of the strangest men in history. The manner in which the life and deeds and personality are woven together presents as full an image of a man of contradictions, a man who planned to have his personal files destroyed after his death in order to maintain the iconic image he so desperately desired, is nothing short of a work of dedicated investigation on parts of everyone involved. And electing to tell this story through the ever-changing chameleon aspects of this bizarre man by shifting from youth to old age in a constant parenthetical manner was a stroke of genius.The rise of young John Edgar Hoover from a mother-favored child, through the emotional conflicts this mother worship produced, through the sightings of incidents suggestive of early 'Bolshevik' interference/threat in this country that Hoover focused on in his usurping power as the head of the newly formed Federal Bureau of Investigation, provides a background from which we can observe the morphing of this obsessed man. The act of staging press conferences around the Lindbergh case and the capture of the big criminals of the day were manipulated to give Hoover supreme power to investigate 'threatening people of interest' by wire taping, spying, etc. But all of this runs parallel to the personal story of Hoover's private sexual life. From his living with his mother until her death, to his incompetent attempt to force himself on the woman who would be his secretary throughout his career, to his bonding with Clyde Tolson who he chose to be his assistant and never was far from his side, to his final hours when Tolson though suffering from the residuum of a stroke was the only person Hoover could trust as Richard Nixon planned his destruction.Each of the incidents that highlighted Hoover's long career as founder and head of the FBI is presented well, but it is the de-mystification of Hoover the vulnerable man beneath the tyrannical faade that makes this film so extremely powerful. That is due to the script and the direction, of course, but it is also due in large part to the brilliant portrayal of this enigmatic beast of a pathetic man by Leonardo DiCaprio: he remains credible throughout and moves through the aging process and intermittent flashbacks to his younger days with complete ease and credibility. Likewise the performances of Judi Dench as his strange mother ('I'd rather my son be dead than be a daffodil' - her term for 'gay'), of Naomi Watts as his secretary who thwarts Hoover's initial awkward physical advances to become his lifelong supporter, and of Armie Hammer as Hoover's love interest Clyde Tolson acted with such a full range of emotion and subtlety that he is completely credible - these key roles are all of Oscar caliber as supporting roles. Eastwood's careful casting of actors for the roles of Charles Lindbergh (Josh Lucas), Eisenhower (Gunner Wright), Franklin Roosevelt (David A. Cooper), Harlan Fiske Stone (Ken Howard), Robert Kennedy (Jeffrey Donovan), Colonel Schwarzkopf (Dermot Mulroney), Bruno Hauptmann (Damon Herriman), Richard Nixon (Christopher Shyer), and Haldeman (Larkin Campbell) gives the audience the opportunity to catch glimpses of the people influenced by Hoover without stooping to caricatures. But in the end it is the slow dissection of the relationship between Hoover and Tolson that is the most powerful element of this film. The audience is left with little doubt that these men were, in truth, lovers without the expected obvious stereotypical activities and conversations. It is an act of greatness on the parts of all involved, and for this reason probably more than any other aspect of this huge film, this biopic deserves to be in the lineup for Best Picture of the Year.

		<fullReview>Very well made that got my attention from the very beginning. But it does go on a bit too long and becomes a gay love story. Was J Edgar gay? No one is really sure, he most probably was, but this film emphasises that too much. The rest of his life is sort of skimmed over. Having said that Leonardo does an excellent job of portraying the man with all his faults. He comes across as a very capable man who is totally incapable of relationships. The make up was interesting as on Hoover and his secretary the ageing was very well done but on his assistant it looked like.. well make up.So glad I watched it but not a film I would particularly watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eastwood misses the boat again by casting just about 6 foot De Caprio as a 5 foot 5 little man with real short men problems. That really was what many of Hoover's problems stemmed from - by his grabbing of power he could fight back. None of that comes through due to the casting. Still it is a presentable film that manages to skim the surface and not touch any of the nitty gritty of Hoover's sexuality. After his lifetime Hoover became very much persona non gratis and the film, whether intentionally or not, does at least show sprinkles of that. But at the end of the day it didn't say enough about anything - a lot of hot air about nothing. I was really disappointed with Eastwood's molly coddling of his subject. Hoover was ripe for the picking and Clint let him get away.</fullReview>

I did like the look of the film though; the muted colours matched the mood; Eastwood always has a good eye for a shot and it shows. I also quite liked the original music, also written by Eastwood, nothing too ostentations, but nicely matched to the action. The performances were all very good with DiCaprio easily standing out but I thought Naomi Watts was woefully underused. Over all, I can't say I was entirely thrilled with this one. I felt the whole thing was maybe too ambitious. If they had concentrated on (say) the Lindbergh kidnapping and used that as the backdrop to the narrative then maybe it would have worked better.

JFK, LBJ, or Nixon, most likely. And they'd be wrong. During all their turns as chief executive, only one man had all of them quaking in their boots.J. Edgar Hoover (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is dictating his autobiography to a young FBI agent and this provides the sequence of events for the film. The beginning of his relationship with long-time secretary and confidant Helen Gandy (played by Naomi Watts), the creation and growth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and those prominent cases that helped to garner press coverage for the Bureau and Hoover specifically. Chief among those is the Lindbergh kidnapping. But we find out later during a private moment between Hoover and his deputy, Clyde Tolson (played by Armie Hammer) that his recollections are usually embellished and occasionally flat-out lies. And while the relationship of Hoover and Tolson has been the subject of much speculation, the film does little to explore it.If you read and remember my review of Water for Elephants, than you know I hate Leonardo DiCaprio. That hatred, however, has not stopped me from enjoying several of his movies in the theater and purchasing them on DVD. The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and, most recently, Inception to name a few. I also enjoy Clint Eastwood's work as both a director and an actor despite serious missteps like True Crime and Blood Work. And while I've never liked Hoover, I was anxious to see this film on his life. When you start off intending to make a film about a paranoid, power-mad, cross- dresser with a penchant for blackmail and who is alleged to have had an affair with his second-in-command, ending up with a dull finished product is practically an accomplishment and that's what happened. Perhaps any one film is not enough to offer real exploration of this polarizing historical figure, but with the cast and crew already mentioned and a script by the same writer who brought us the 2008 biopic Milk with Sean Penn in the title role, this was a disappointment and a rather significant one, at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another underachiever from Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Eastwood's prolific offerings in the director chair after his MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004, 8/10) triumph has taken a tumble recently after the bad reviews and box office lethargy of HEREAFTER (2010, 6/10) and INVICTUS (2009, 6/10), however the much-hyped J. Edgar Hoover's biography unsuccessfully backfires again although it have a much more capable cast and piquant fodder at Mr. Eastwood's disposal, the common view is that, like INVICTUS, the film is wanting a revelational catharsis which is an episodic gambit in the genre.First of all, one bizarrely uneasy pain-in-the-neck is the make-up of the elder Hoover and Clyde (Watts' Helen Gandy can be spared since the screen-time of her senior persona has been less-executed), which uncannily more zombie-lized than the verisimilitude process of natural aging. DiCaprio and Hammer still squeeze inside my yearly Top 10 list in the lower ranks, in spite of being marred by the artificial skin, hair and wrinkles, their profound endeavor to render their respective characters cannot be bypassed (although wearing dead- mother's skirt is over-exploited). Meanwhile it is a remorseful crime to leave Dench and Watts underused (the mother role clearly has an essential influence on Hoover's queer behavior and Dench has very meager screen time to enhance the multitude while Watt's long-term secretary has been left no room to testify her distinction except the brief last- moment messiah in destroying the secret files before Kennedy could get them. The film has inherited a sombre hue resembles Eastwood's previous vehicles (MYSTIC RIVER 2003, 8/10; MILLION DOLLAR BABY etc.), which is a rightful choice according to the milieu, but the jumpy narrative does has an unfriendly towards audience who are not so familiar with Hoover's heroic undertakings and the American history (foreigners like myself for example), thus a sense of detachment is destined. The gay-romance between Hoover and Clyde is basically dealt with a circumspect caution, but the overt "I love you" confession is betraying the whole scheme, as if it is the only way to dictate their life-long closeness to the face of the spectators. So, J. EDGAR cannot restore Eastwood's esteeming reputation and after his "talking to a chair" performance and the ominous feedback of his acting project TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE (2012), there is a late-bloomer's eulogy in the wind</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this film a 5 out of 10 simply because of Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. He did a great job....the story, however, is quite boring and doesn't portray anything that we don't already know. It is my opinion that Hoover was indeed a closeted homosexual, but in all reality, who cares?? It makes perfect sense that he would have been "closeted" given the times and attitudes, etc. All his fanatic interest in the sex lives of others would be expected as well, given the fact that he was unable to express his own sexual feelings. I certainly expected more out of a Clint Eastwood movie. Hoover was a very strange and weird man...the movie could have been a lot more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never imagined I would see a Clint Eastwood film where I would look at my watch impatiently before the first hour was even up, but alas the day has come. "J. Edgar" is a dimwitted, passionless project that brings almost nothing to our previous knowledge about the formation of the FBI and the men who made it all possible. Only a couple of sharp, provocative moments from Dustin Lance Black's screenplay really stand out. Now Clint Eastwood has made five or six masterpieces during his forty-year career as a director and about twice as many great films, so despite my disappointment, I am prepared to allow this one to fade from my memory.Not that that would be very hard. If J. Edgar Hoover had a file cabinet labeled 'Instantly Forgettable,' that is where this film would have gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was not the worse film I have ever viewed and in comparison to some of the dross I have endured this was Citizen Kane. In some films flash backs can work very well in others it is a cumbersome tool, this film is the latter. Strangely for a Clint Eastwood film it lacks pace and suspense. The portrayal of J Edgar Hoover as simply a fantasist and coward cannot be right someone who inspired intense loyalty and ran the FBI for the length of time he did most of had some qualities not portrayed in the film, the film fails to show why he wanted to portray himself as the arresting officer, could it be to counter the cult of the gangster? The film tries to show the whole of his life with the FBI an impossible task, a better film was there, take a portion of his time with the FBI and we would not have a film which appears as a tick list, communist threat tick, gangsters tick, Lindbergh baby tick, homosexuality tick etc. After watching the film I went on line and Goggled J D Hoover the Wiki page reads like the script of the film. The acting was OK, Di Caprio has turned into a good actor and the rest of the cast did a good job but it all seemed a bit ponderous but was the makeup department taking some experimental drugs? The ageing process was abysmal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An attempt on a biography is indeed a perilous task. To take on a bio- pic indefinitely requires heightened attributes of courage and confidence. Veteran director Clint Eastwood takes on the life events of John Edgar Hoover and spins out in my opinion a rather compact and fathomable angle of the widely feared gentleman's life.The man himself is an iconic leader of the yesteryears. However this name would only be one that is familiar to the audience provided one is from a culture of similar geographical location. Eastwood is considering the fact that not everyone is as fluent of J.EDGAR as need be. This alone is one of the many reasons why I am rating this movie in one of the higher ranks. A biography made for everyone who is keen to learn the story. John Edgar Hoover was a law graduate who began to serve his nation at the department of justice and thereon worked his way through to the higher ranks and was instilled as the 6th director of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI) of the United States of America. Mr. Hoover was tough man who saw a threat to the nation in almost everyone in almost everything thing they did; a man who would stop at nothing and would go to the furthest extent to protect the nation and its citizens. Mr. Hoover was one with a vision of centralizing a finger print file, a valued source of data that would aid in fighting crime and controlling discipline. Although his ideas were harshly put aside on many occasions his sheer perseverance found him instituting the finger print system and the forensic laboratories. 11 years down the road as director of the BOI Mr. Hoover founded the Federal Bureau of Investigation thus being the first director of the worldly popular FBI.Leonardo DiCaprio who plays J.Edgar is a tyrant. DiCaprio has matured long since his early years and is undoubtedly living the role. DiCaprio seem to be taking every movie he does over the ropes. It's disheartening that he didn't get a nod at the Oscars for this exploding performance. His versatile acting of both the senior version of J.Edgar and the young adamant Edgar is spotless. The ferocity of the protagonist is uncanny. DiCaprio plays Edgar in a tone where it's hard to place his characters mood which adds a subtle anxiety to the viewer. The rise and the fall of the great director of the FBI was lived by DiCaprio and was elegantly aided by Armie Hammer who plays his number 2 guy and soul mate; Clyde Tolson. Wide historical speculation states that Mr. Hoover and Mr.Tolson at the time may have had a relationship that reaches beyond the norms of the bureau, how DiCaprio and Hammer bring that to life is convincing enough that I am not surprised that we do not know up-to date that it was in fact true. A viewer can never be certain if they were in fact gay, just as none could state for sure back in the day. A lion's share of the credit of the movie indeed deserves to focus on these gentlemen as they infuse its plot with a much needed essence of finesse.Judi Dench on the other hand could be considered as some talent that did go to waste. J.Edgar needs a strong mother who has the grace to stay afloat like a swan on the lake. Judi Dench indeed was nothing other than that. I somewhat preferred if she did have more screen-time however writer Justin Lance Black seem to have felt it was more appropriate to give the larger slice of the screen cake to Naomi Watts. No harm done in that either since Watts is indeed a valued asset in Edgar's team. The change in the way Watts played her character while switching in between the young and the older versions of Helen Gandy (Mr. Hoovers trusted secretary) is as great as Hammer and DiCaprio. Despite some unconvincing makeup on the veteran portrayal of Clyde Tolson every-other aspect of the picture is passable to a normal mature audience. I can't avoid the obvious. It's harmless to assume that the scales of the movie can always tip towards either side since it's a subjective arena. An audience with strong opinions on the life of Mr. Hoover and Mr.Tolson may disagree with a majority of this biography since it's obvious that Clint Eastwood is focusing purely on the stronger attributes of the gentleman. Such an audience may indeed disagree with even the DiCaprio performance as being unconvincing. With due respect to the Late Mr. John Edgar Hoover it's the only human approach as a director and as a writer to take the high road in making a biography.J.Edgar is a powerful motion picture with astute performances by some great actors and actresses and it unveils the compressed biography on one of the strongest and hard willed men to run the BOI /FBI. Do keep the genre in mind prior to sitting down with a bowl of popcorn!Title: J.Edgar Directed by: Clint Eastwood Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Armie Hammer, Naomi Watts &amp; Judie Dench Rated: R Rating: 7.5/10 137 Minutes</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.I really liked this movie. It's quite, at times slow but also beautifully acted and directed. I was really interested in how the FBI was created and that part of the movie was really interesting. Now for the performance of L.D.Caprio, i thing this is his best performance so far. I like him as an actor, and he really does a wonderful job of portraying J.E.Hoover over the decades. The only thing i didn't liked in "J.Edgar" was a make up for an old Clyde Tolson, at times it really looked fake and, well... just bad. Overall, "J.Edgar" isn't the best C.Eastwood's movie, but it's really good for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a beautiful love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody knows that Clint Eastwood is Sergio Leone's artistic son. Everything in his shooting and editing style shouts this single fact at us. Mainly based on the Confucio's famous phrase ("Before you embark on a journey of revenge, you dig two graves"), Mr. Eastwood's work, in its entirety, relies on the concept that, whatever happens to you, your life is (or should be) an act of love. And "J. Edgar" is just that, a beautiful, aptly directed love story. They are wrong if they look for a police/FBI movie here. Wrong to seek for accuracy in the historic accounts. Very far from historians point of view about the subject of this movie. Largely away from a courtroom play. Far apart from everything but a nice, smooth, intelligent love story. This closet gay, this schizophrenic, obsessive, manipulative (and subtly manipulated) man that devoted his life as a whole to improve (according to him and almost nobody else) the USA homeland security, is trapped between his one and only professional interest and his deranged, unhappy, socially handicapped private life. He loves someone, somebody loves him as well, some people just tolerates him because they can get something in trade... And this situation perpetuates itself for weeks, months, years, decades and more decades.Eastwood directs this film in his usual, highly stylized manner; huge detail shots to remark some point, the fluid, ubiquitous steady cam job and his tender, meticulous cut-to-the-bone actors directing. He doesn't think Hoover was a completely sane man, and chooses to declare this (and his admiration for Hitchcock) through a scene that clearly resemblances "Psycho" (only with the Goldeberg variations instead of Herrmann's score and the "Eroica" number 9 record).This movie, great as it is, supports itself on Eastwood's visual goldsmithing, a powerful script and four extraordinary performances: Leonardo DiCaprio, Judi Dench, Naomi Watts and Armie Hammer (somewhat disfigured by a flawed makeup). Nice cameo by Lea Thompson (as Ginger Rogers' mother) and David Clennon (who starred in John Carpenter's "The Thing" as the ever-stoned pilot Palmer). Regarding to this, one of the most claustrophobic films ever made, there is a tiny tribute to Carpenter in the scene where Hoover talks sincerely with his mother.Looking for action in "J. Edgar" equals to look for boxing in "Million dollar baby": they are only movies about love, father-sister, mother-son, lover-lover, friend to friend and so on. This is what Mr. Eastwood masters the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think its important to understand that having a basic knowledge of 20th century US political history (especially the anti communist movement) is important to truly appreciate and enjoy this movie. Without it a viewer can feel lost and disconnected (I know because my sister who has NO knowledge of these historical events whatsoever didn't really enjoy the film as much as I did).Having said that this is a great film which portrays Hoover in a neutral light. It doesn't delve into his unsubstantiated political connections and manipulations and presents his life from what is generally known about him (except for some details about his supposed homosexuality which isn't substantiate in real life I believe). I personally found Leonardo DiCaprio to be a great fit for this role and he deserves praise for adjusting his acting style and mannerisms to suit a character much older than he is. Arnie Hammer's role also fits into the narrative with ease and he does a great job at portraying his character with a lot of ease and charisma (especially the scene where he's old and frail). The sets and costume design and makeup are all top notch as you would expect from a Clint Eastwood movie and the overall feel of the movie is quite authentic and comfortable. The movie moves along nicely and I didn't feel 'lost' or disconnected from the movie in any way. Its a good movie for history and political buffs and if you're a Leonardo DiCaprio fan along with that then you'll have a great time I'm sure.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, maybe the real J. Edgar Hoover was a powerful man in his time. Maybe he really had everybody under watch and terrified a couple of Presidents with the knowledge he had about them. It is said that he was a crucial person in the hard decades that followed World War II and put the western democracies under siege. But the character shown in this movie is hardly anything else than a poor old gay man, sexually frustrated, dominated by his mother, who listened to porn tapes. I think it is a failed portrait of the real man, and a deceiving movie. I usually like Clint Eastwood's work, but not this one. I left the movie with the feeling that no one should have been afraid of Hoover, except for those wearing stripped suits and mustaches. And i'm not really sure that was the kind of discipline that the U.S. Would have needed to win the Cold War.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eastwood is as great a director as he is an actor. His films strike that rare balance of being powerful and entertaining. 'Unforgiven', 'Mystic River' and 'Million Dollar Baby' are all, in my immodest opinion, five-star films. 'J. Edgar' is a three-star one which, on my chart, stacks up to better than mediocre, but not quite very good. Eastwood's film makes the same point Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' did in 2009: John Edgar Hoover, who was head of the FBI from 1935 until his death in 1972, was a great administrator. He took pride in his ability to organise even a simple filing system. He never made arrest, never got his hands dirty. He was a pencil pusher, albeit an extraordinarily good one. But the man had unusual quirks and major flaws, which explains why Eastwood wanted to tell his story. Son to a senile father and a smothering mother, the young Edgar was tasked with establishing the family name. His first job was to root out suspected Commies. Because he loved his country to the point of jingoism, this was child's play. After Reds came John Dillinger, Machine-Gun Kelly and Baby-face Nelson: the bank robbers. Edgar said that he had to win the hearts and minds of the American people if they were to be successful in their mission. His belief in science as the weapon to fight crime was initially met with great suspicion, ridicule even. His idea of fingerprinting was initially dismissed as a 'speculative science'. The FBI's challenge wasn't limited to crime-fighting; they had an image problem. Kids wanted to hold up Tommy guns, not badges. Edgar did things to change that ? things that were scorned then, but lauded now. He insisted that the FBI needed to be independent of politics, that recruits should be chosen on merit, be college-educated and physically fit. He chastised anyone for wearing facial hair and anything but conservative suits. Old age normally tames even the most tyrannical figures. Edgar just got worse. He took vitamins as though he was an athlete, he worked obscene hours and he strengthened his suspicion of any perceived threats to his country and himself. Anyone was fair game. Presidents? Hell, he'd spy on their wives if he wanted to ? and he did. There's a comparison to be made with 'Citizen Kane'. Both films have the protagonist (better to say lead in these cases because they're not traditional heroes) rise through sheer ambition and then fall because of their spiralling megalomania and paranoia. Leo DiCaprio is predictably brilliant as Edgar. I am at a loss to think why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. He gets into the skin of his eccentric character. Regrettably, however, the makeup team, usually the unsung heroes in movies, have made old Edgar look like a cheap waxwork. The standard of workmanship is egregious. Edgar was a mommy's boy. His mother (Judi Dench) had such a hold over him that he had no social life, couldn't dance, had no concept of how to court a lady, and perhaps couldn't be intimate with one. His purpose was to succeed professionally whatever the cost and that ambition was all for his mother. The scene where Edgar cross-dresses to remember her could have been farcical, but Eastwood directs a scene of sensitivity and brilliance. Then there's the issue of his sexuality. Was he or wasn't he? I thought I had made up my mind, but Eastwood makes you switch opinion with each scene. Armie Hammer plays Clyde Tolson, the one that people suspected of being Edgar's lover. Hammer, who has also fallen victim to the makeup artists (were they abstract?), is very good as Edgar's suffering number two man. Naomi Watts does well in a minor role as Miss Gandy, Edgar's servile PA. One thing I did like was how Eastwood shows the minutiae of a great man's ascension. A long time is spent on emphasising Edgar's punctiliousness because that was one of his signature qualities, something which separated him from others. DiCaprio gives a powerhouse performance in an average film, which is why he and Eastwood will miss out on Oscars this year.www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. Edgar (2011) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Another winner from director Clint Eastwood tells the story of the FBI and it's main force J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) starting in 1919 when the young Hoover first got the idea for such a place and we follow its rise to power as well as Hoover's self- centered importance to himself. Whenever a film based on a true person or events is released you usually get a side that comes out swinging saying how upset they are that certain aspects weren't covered or perhaps Hollywood put too much frosting on something or didn't shine a spotlight on a certain storyline. I'm sure many history buffs might find something else in Hoover's life more important but for the most part I thought the film was about as good as one could expect and this is due in large part to director Eastwood and star DiCaprio who certainly fit each other very well. I think that Eastwood make a wise decision in how he showed Hoover because it really does feel as if he just wanted to tell a story and never meant to show Hoover in a positive or negative light. If anything I'd say that the film is a lot more truthful and open than some people are giving it credit for because it certainly doesn't paint Hoover as some sort of God-like character and while it does show his greatness it never covers when it comes time to show some of the wrong that he did. The film cuts back and forth between the early days of the FBI and up to the Kennedy assassination, the stuff with Martin Luther King, Jr. and all the way up to Hoover's death. I think some of the most fascinating aspects deal with the kidnapping of Charles Lindburg's baby and how Hoover tried to use this as a way to get more money and more power. Another interesting aspect of the film is the relationship between Hoover and his right-hand man Clyde (Armie Hammer). The homosexuality aspect is certainly covered but I guess some will be expecting something a lot more graphic or in detail. Yes, there's a love story told between the two men but it's one of friendship more than anything and it's very nicely handled by Eastwood. Of course, one of the best things is getting to see DiCaprio add yet another great performance under his belt. It's really amazing to watch this guy act because once you get used to see him in the older make-up he really delivers a strong performance and one so great that you have no problem seeing Hoover and not an actor playing him. DiCaprio perfectly nails the accent and I thought the emotional range was terrific. The supporting cast is equally good and that include (Armie Hammer) as Clyde and (Naomi Watts) playing the personal secretary. If there are some flaws in the movie I think the biggest one is the make-up department. I thought the effects worked well on DiCaprio but some of the supporting characters looked so bad that it almost looked like a test rehearsal. Just check out the scene towards the end of the moving at a racing track when Clyde has something happen to him. I won't give away what but the make-up on him at this time looks so horrid that I was expecting it to slide off his face. Another minor problem is that I think too much is covered in a too short amount of time. The film clocks in at 137-minutes but it never feels too long and instead it almost comes off as being too short. With that said, J. EDGAR is a very entertaining movie and it's perfectly suited for someone like Eastwood. He perfectly captures the time and look of the past and DiCaprio delivers the performance to bring Hoover to life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very well done biopic. I had apprehensions after reading many negative reviews, but I found this film captivating. This unique historical figure created his own power base by deception and threats. The story of his life is sober and interesting with this subject matter where it would have been so easy to go over the top. The use of black and white to color helps to follow the story back and forth to the past. The images of the past are very realistic. Contrary to what I read, I found the makeup of the aging characters very life like. I must finally admit that Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and so much more than the pretty boy of Titanic. I could sum up this film this way: Norman Bates (Psycho) backstage to power throughout most of the 20th century in the USA. A keen interest with American politics helps to appreciate this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clyde Tolson and John Edgar: A love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie may as well have been called "Clyde Tolson and John Edgar: A Love Story." That love story is what the movie is about. When J. Edgar died in 1972--to allude to men holding hands, men kissing, men wearing dresses, men in long term asexual relationships--well that would be the stuff of Alfred Hitchcock. Who pursued whom in this relationship? And how much of the details of this relationship was verified by third-person eyewitness accounts? The pivotal moment in the film occurs when Hoover tells Tolson that there might be a future Mrs Hoover in the shape of Dorothy Lamour. Tolson goes ballistics, gets into fisticuffs with Hoover, bloodies his face, and finally kisses Hoover passionately. Hoover was either toying with Tolson, underestimated what their relationship was about, failed to recognize what that relationship was, or all of the above. And like so many people, Hoover was simply brain dead when it came to relationships. As astute a politician as he was, he could not discern subtleties of interpersonal relationships.It becomes clear with each of his interactions with the presidents, that the presidents would have preferred to get rid of him if they thought it would have been politically feasible. They each kept him waiting.By the time Hoover died in 1972, it was common knowledge that he had spied on many famous people: Eleanor Roosevelt, Frank Sinatra, Martin Luther King, and so on. This spying would reveal that President Kennedy and Chicago Mob Boss Sam Giancanni were sexually sharing the same women. At some point, Hoover crossed a line in domestic surveillance. What he found out about these people in that surveillance was their private sexual activities, and he used that knowledge to emotionally blackmail people. When John Kennedy is assassinated in 1963, Hoover is listening to a taped reel of a hotel tryst with some actress and some politician--the audience is intended to think John Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.Hoover writes spurious letters critical of Martin Luther King's sexual affairs. He anticipates that because of these letters, King would decline the Nobel Prize. And tells Tolson as much as they watch television together. It was not only creepy, it suggested that Hoover was simply not-all-there as the saying goes. Psycho would be a more accurate term to describe Hoover.Clyde Tolson is not just J. Edgar's toady. He challenges Hoover in obtaining search warrants, he challenges Hoover's interpretation of events. The movie is a recollection by Hoover to various scribes; a reading Tolson challenges.The biggest flaw in the movie: the makeup. Actors wearing makeup to make them look older, is atrociously realized. They look like creatures from the walking dead. Whoever supervised this, approved this must have his head examined.I saw the movie within a context of Sept 11, 2001. "J Edgar" starts out with Attorney General Palmer's house being blown up and getting him and his family almost killed in June, 1919. Those were tumultuous years. The Reds, the Bolsheviks, wanted to bring down the country. The Lindberg baby kidnapping, the underworld run rampant during Prohibition--criminal behavior whose perpetrators had to be tracked down and brought to justice with the latest forensic tools. So the Patriot Act of George W Bush was a natural extension of Hoover's own policy for the common weal. And today with cyber-space being what it is, every keystroke, every telephone message, becomes traceable within minutes. By anyone with knowledge to hack into a computer, a telephone. Not just the police. What's the Fourth Amendment? What's a warrant? What's probable cause? What's the right to privacy? The Watergate Scandal would bring Nixon down; an important part of his argument: Nixon as President had carte-blanche to act as he did because it was not illegal since he was the President.But what's at stake in today's world? Some Terrorist planting a dirty nuclear bomb in the middle of Times Square or Washington, DC in Praise of Allah. When is the right to privacy annulled? What words have to be uttered to have those rights annulled? (Those are not quite rhetorical questions; we know what actions, what words are required for the intervention of the law.) "J. Edgar" struck a complex tone within that love story between Clyde Tolson and J. Edgar Hoover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every director certainly has a style and while some may try to shake things up every now and again, keep people on their toes, others stay the course and deliver time and time again what you have come to expect from them. That's not always a bad thing, especially when you have serious accolades and awards already under your belt, but it can also set up a certain type of expectation about the quality and depth of each story you bring to the screen, which sometimes can be a lot to overcome. The truth is there is no end to the sophomore curse. Your last fantastic picture is always quickly overshadowed by your current less than stellar outing. Clint Eastwood is the man under the spotlight right now and what he brings to the table is another tale of power, passion and persecution, all inside one continuously conflicted person.J. Edgar is one theory of the story behind the story, the man behind the machine that created the F.B.I. and reportedly had the skeletons of scores of American citizens, including the presidents he served under. The film follows his rise to power, his curious relationship with his number two man, and his own seemingly unquenchable need to be feared and revered, leaving a legacy that could never be tarnished.J. Edgar offers a scenario of what might have went on behind closed doors between Hoover and Tolsen, his number two man, and what motivated Hoover to push himself as hard as he did. Much of it is based on circumstance and conjecture though, so it'd be best to view this film as an imaginative or (at best) a mildly educated guess about the truth behind the most feared man in decades.Eastwood delivers yet again another deep, layered and complex narrative about a troubled protagonist, someone who you are never really sure whether you want to root for. The film is extremely slow paced and at times drags in its repetition, showing Hoover in one situation after another where his power is called into question. Jumping back and forth between his later life and his early years was a nice touch in the beginning, but by the end, it felt disjointed, like you were being dragged back into the past or thrust into the future just at the moment when things were getting good right where you were. I might have thought about just using the older version of Hoover as bookends to the story and play it out more along a traditional timeline, but who knows, that very well could have dragged as well.The performances are always the most important part of these types of biopics. You need to be able to lose sight of the actor, usually someone incredibly well known, and truly see the person he is trying to represent. Look at Frank Langella as Nixon in Frost/Nixon, Will Smith as Muhammad Ali in Ali, even our man here, Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes in The Aviator, these are invested performances that elevate the movie beyond just a mere educational stroll in the cinematic park. Yet, DiCaprio falters this time in capturing his past fervor, not for lack of trying, just due to a lack of foundation underneath the moments. Naomi Watts also struggles to really find footing as the dutiful secretary, Helen Gandy. The true breakout here is Armie Hammer as Tolson, who brings a magical assured quality to his early life and a beautiful gentleness in his senior years. Hammer truly burst onto the scene last year in his dual performance as the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network, but in J. Edgar he shows he can handle much more than just overconfidence. Tolson is really the moral compass of the film and the only avenue for the audience to navigate their way in, but even with such a virtuoso performance from Hammer, it wasn't enough to pull the whole film together in the end.Eastwood's decision to use younger actors in dramatically older roles also may not have worked to the film's advantage. I understand it allows a connection, both physical and emotional, between the two versions of the character on screen, but sometimes it can also feel jarring. While we have come light years ahead in the technology of makeup, truly transforming these early birds into aged senior citizens, the one thing that remains is the sound and tenor of their voice. There is something so unique and distinct about a voice that has been speaking for seventy or eighty years, something that is nearly impossible for these youthful actors to capture. Once again, Hammer seemed to outshine DiCaprio in this arena as well, but I still feel it might have been more powerful to have actual older actors in those roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing this one, but I wish I would have stayed home. Anything that remotely interesting story line wise just never went anywhere. They had a somewhat interesting flashback mode that never really accomplished anything other than minor confusion. All of the major points of the movie barely scratched the surface. I thought the movie was really dragging and it was, but it was a 2 1/2 hour debacle. I was wishing that it would end at about the half way point and briefly thought about just leaving, but I kept thinking it would start delving into some of the things that had been left hanging. I was wrong. Many implications, innuendos and such, but no real substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of DiCaprio, and can watch his performance as another iconic figure, Howard Hughes in Aviator, time and time again. I went to see the film because of the possibilities inherent in depicting J.Edgar Hoover, a major public figure of the 20th century, and feel the opportunity was wasted.We do not know the inner life of this man, so there was an imperative for a plausible fictionalization within the boundaries of his documented public life. Instead are shown a stilted individual without the modicum of passion or even charisma that had to be there in some form to have catapulted him to the position he held for so long. And the presentation of his actual biography, what we could have learned from the film, was wrong on some of the few items that even this non expert could notice.The call from an agent that JFK was shot, who responded when asked if anyone knew about it, was, "No, only you." This is absurd. The news of Kennedy's being shot was flashed around the world within minutes, faster than any agent could have placed a personal call. And then Hoover broke the news to his brother without any empathy that would be expected, even to a political enemy.Then there is the multiple references to love letter to Eleanor Roosevelt's from her lesbian lover. We have no way of knowing whether this was true, as the case of the recordings of Martin Luther King's trysts, also dramatized. The existence of the King tapes have been reported by multiple sources, but this is the first time I have heard of any letter that gives validity to the rumor that E.R. had lesbian relationships. And this is one of the failings of the film, that it is simply sloppy in that we can't tell verified fact from fiction, even given that much is unknown.Considering that the film was anything but entertaining, the experience of watching a dysfunctional unhappy human being, without any insight, or discernment of the actual from the fictional, makes this film quite less than what it could have been. .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very strong movie! I am sure this movie will get an Oscar, because Client is a great director and Dicaprio is great actor! Client Eastwood is a good director. Client never insults the viewer by telling too much of the story, but lets the view come up with his or her own opinions reading in-between the scenes. If the director is too blunt you have dumb down t v stories. Client made a long movie watchable with fine acting, a good story pace, and knew when to edit a scene in order not to give too much information. Leonardo Dicaprio shines in his role of J Edgar. One believe the character is J Edgar! The audience views the good, bad, and personal life of a complex man. Eastwood has the viewer decide if Dicaprio's character is a hero, villain, or just human. I like this movie! When a long movie get across as a short movie then you know its good. I give the movie an eight out of ten. I like the part where Nixon beat Edgar at his own game!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ruling by Frusrration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world where appearances are that matter there was once a man who told people what they wanted to hear, ruled with an iron feast and cunning foresight. Whatever drove him, hunger for power, resentment over dreams he couldn't attain, self-delusion, or extreme frustration, we might never know, but he assembled a personal support system that allowed to him to succeed in a ways many can only dream of. He created an institution that is part of the American landscape; yet it's possible that no other leader might ever equal his compulsive desire for control.From the start, forces push J. Edgar, and aspirations to counter them develop. He focuses on development an organism that will allow him to set things straight, to fight evil, to be what he can't be otherwise, under the iron fist of a mother who can be both loving and suffocating because of her own personal beliefs. It can be argued she's both the source of his success and his personal nightmares. He's lucky enough to find an unwavering source of support, and although the film scratches the surface in elegant and subtle ways, one can probably guess that it was a very intimate relationship. Some of the best acting involves the quiet moments where the depth of such bond is explored. Actions are timid, careful, and once in a while, language dares to reveal a bit more.More successfully told than "Anonymous", the film goes back and forth in time, showing how Hoover gained power over the years, how his point of view attempts to control his audience, and the script is well put together that his spell works most of the time. The introductory scenes are a bit slow, but once we have become accustomed to Eastwood's pacing, we follow the seductive narrative that details how his brain worked, how his emotional side was a blend of torture and overcompensation, and there are hints of a repressed ability to care for others.Many wonderful scenes show a vulnerability many people probably never knew existed; still for the most part we see a man who hungers for acceptance, fame, control, and yet many are able to see through his insecurity but dare say nothing because he has become after all, a formidable force.Much is to be praised here, from Watts, De Caprio, and Hammer's work, to an unobtrusive musical score hinting at the not so obvious. The film is not perfect because there is so much that can't be explained, and once again the aesthetics threaten to overwhelm the substance, but it's hard to push Eastwood's reliable direction, and "Hoover" shows us he's possible, America's best movie director, a man who understands great movies originate from great scrips, great acting, and real confidence on the source, not on the dazzle of technique. This might not be "Million Dollar Baby" or "Mystic River", but it certainly stands out, and it's one of his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming, sappy, and grossly inaccurate historical whitewash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'J. Edgar (2011)' represents a serious disappointment and critical misfire by director Clint Eastwood and writer Dustin Lance Black.The film's crimes are many, but its most annoying offenses are: 1.) Devoting the bulk of its two plus hours to The Lindbergh kidnapping (a rather infinitesimal footnote in the Hoover story) while completely glossing over or ignoring Hoover's greater and darker legacy (his collusion with organized crime, the Nixon/Kissinger wiretaps, COINTELPRO, McCarthyism, etc., etc., etc.), and 2.) focusing on unfounded (but sensational) speculations about Hoover's supposed homosexuality and cross dressing.Numerous scenes between Hoover and Clyde Tolson simply defy credulity. By devoting large portions of the film to highly speculative private interactions (rather than what is historically known and documented), Black and Eastwood have fashioned together a non-credible account of one of America's most interesting (and loathsome) figures. They attempt to excuse themselves by suggesting that this is the story Hoover would want us to believe in that much of the narrative is framed by Hoover's dictation to his biographer, and in fact a late scene in the movie has Tolson literally accusing Hoover (and the film itself) of fabricating history. But these small efforts do not excuse the predictable confusion most audience members will experience nor the resulting mess of a movie the filmmakers have assembled.Compounded to the film's questionable accuracy is a rather groan-inducingly sappy tone, especially in the final act. Despite the character's contemptible standing, the audience is forced to endure a barrage of syrupy and sorrowful sequences upon Hoover's death, including disembodied words of reflection by Hoover and a sequence with Tolson crying while reading love poetry.On the plus side, Leonardo DiCaprio elevates the lackluster script and keeps the film generally watchable, or at least as watchable as can be expected beneath the weight of so many other shortcomings. Attempts are made to depict portions of Hoover's accomplishments, career, and legacy (including his contributions toward crime fighting techniques, willingness to blackmail sitting presidents, bloated paranoia of the communist threat - both real and perceived), etc.) Additionally, the minimal score is effectively sad and pretty, if not inappropriately manipulative. Unfortunately, these few positive points do not counter-balance the film's innumerable failings.At best, this film represents poor reporting, an incomplete story and a missed opportunity of the highest order. At worst, it's exploitation and outright bunk knowingly served as fact. A shamefully bad movie in either case.</fullReview>

Incidentally,the "comic books" mentioned were actually the old pulp magazines (Feds, G-Men) in which Hoover tried to inflate his own heroic image for the kids of America.

I was in awe of the movie; the sheer emotional power of it left me heartbroken.It's certainly better if you remember your early 20th century American history, though I can't imagine it's too hard to understand even if you forget.

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's Hoover Bio, Starring DiCaprio, gets it all wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, the new Warner Bros. epic is full of errors and misrepresentations. Here's the real, never-been-told inside scoop on the celebrated FBI Chief.Don't get me wrong. I'm a great fan of Clint Eastwood's...and I happen to like the guy. I worked closely with Clint on a screenplay some thirty years ago at Universal and again at Malpaso, his own company. Clint actually optioned "THE HOSTILES" twice in an effort to get it made with co-star John Wayne. Unfortunately, Duke did not sign on and Clint and I were both disappointed that the film never came to be. Over the years, I have had several cordial encounters with Clint so I have no ax to grind with him personally. He's a great filmmaker and a fine fellow. Unfortunately, his new movie about J. Edgar Hoover is so full of untruths that I can't sit idly by without making comment.I recently received a call from Leonardo DiCaprio's company, Appian Way, asking to see a copy of my movie about J. Edgar Hoover, which starred Broderick Crawford as Hoover and Dan Dailey as Clyde Tolson, with a splendid cast headed by Jose Ferrer, Celeste Holm and Rip Torn. It was a very well regarded film, particularly in England where it had a significant theatrical run plus two highly promoted telecasts on the BBC.In America, the film was a victim of the fears of film distributors that the FBI would retaliate against them for releasing a picture critical of the Bureau -- particularly at a time when the FBI anti-piracy seal was being affixed to every VCR put on the market. Still, the film was released by American International Pictures and received many terrific reviews.After sending a copy of my film to Mr. DiCaprio, I got a call to schedule a meeting with him -- but it was unexpectedly canceled and there was no follow-up. I could only assume that Leonardo had been advised by Warner's attorneys or by Clint himself to steer clear of me. (I might add I consider Leonardo a most gifted actor and I wish him nothing but success in this new role).Shortly after I was privileged to read Clint's screenplay on Hoover, I did receive a call from Mr. Rob Aurins, who identified himself as Clint's producing partner. His message expressed sincere interest in discussing what elements I might add to the new movie but after I returned the call, I never heard from him again. It's unfortunate since the new movie is full of inaccuracies and outright misrepresentations. (Read entire piece on my website)Sincerely,Larry Cohen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Some people are so precious -- all this hoo-ha about bad role models and positive images! Of course gay people are murderers, bigamists, drug addicts and nasty people -- just as much as heterosexual people are all of these things. What it all boils down to is, we are all people, and we all have the same human desires. It just happens that some desires go this way and some desires go that way. It's sad when people are oppressed. But it's a question of rising above it. Personally, mentally and, if you have to, physically. " Jaye Davidson, famous for "The Crying Game" (1992), when inquired about the way homosexuals are perceived in the media. Dustin Lance Black, the talented screenwriter/filmmaker who won a much deserved Academy Award for Gus Van Sant's "Milk" (2008), is responsible for another dense, non-linear, and utterly fascinating biopic of a controversial American figure, the first director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover (1895-1972).Harvey Milk, the openly gay rights activist, was an American hero who deserved and needed to be rediscovered by the world, and the Black-Van Sant-Sean Penn teaming succeeded on that wonderfully. Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio), on the other hand, was a more enigmatic - and definitely less honorable - figure who abused his power to gain fame and admiration (which made up for the emotional emptiness of his upbringing and whole life). Also, Hoover was, as many believe, a closeted homosexual who had a long-term relationship with his protg, Clyde Tolson (played by Armie Hammer, "The Social Network"). That, obviously, is a big part of this story. But while "Milk" was about somebody who fought for civil rights, "J. Edgar" is a look into the darkness surrounding somebody who, repressed and unloved, used the politics of fear and abuse of power to make a name for himself. Black-Eastwood-DiCaprio manage to humanize Hoover's figure yet without ever trying to conceal or apologize for his despicable acts. This brings me back to the Jaye Davidson quote with which I started this review. Gay people are no better or worse than heterosexual people. Harvey Milk was a hero, Edgar Hoover was a tragic - yet undeniably guilty - man who used his intellect for less than honorable purposes. This is a great film about a man who did some terrible things, on a large scale. In Black's own words, it's a cautionary tale. It's also a fine coverage of some important moments of American History in the 20th century. At heart, it's about choices. The young men and women out there are capable of becoming Edgars or Harveys, Anita Bryants or Rosa Parkses; it all depends on what they are taught to believe on: the value of power, or compassion. Also starring Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy, Judi Dench as Anne-Marie Hoover, and Josh Lucas as Charles Lindbergh. 137 min.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J. Edgar: The Man Behind the Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one key to any great performance, it's in the eyes. A person's eyes provide a window into his inner thoughts, into the emotions and conflicts he might otherwise obscure from view, into his very soul, and the best actors, from Humphrey Bogart and Marlon Brando to George Clooney, Meryl Streep and, to use last year's Oscar winner, Colin Firth, are those that are able to harness this incredible tool and control it to best expose the subtleties and nuances of a character that cannot be expressed otherwise. Few contemporary performers have the talent to do this as well as Leonardo DiCaprio. As the title character in Clint Eastwood's latest, he commands the screen, honing that brooding intensity he's been developing throughout his career, though particularly since he became Martin Scorsese's new protg in Gangs of New York and The Aviator, to a quiet, deadly perfection. He doesn't rely on over-the-top mannerisms, and while he does attempt, with adequate success, to capture J. Edgar Hoover's distinctive voice and spends roughly half the movie in unglamorous, aging make-up, he doesn't hide behind either of these devices. He goes beyond the standard biopic impersonation and instead, burrows deep into his character's psyche, bringing all of Hoover's personality and contradictions ? the paranoia, ambition and loneliness, the egotistical drive for power and glory matched only by his deep-seated, suffocating insecurities ? to a potent simmer always lurking just beneath the surface. When DiCaprio does let all of this loose, the result is explosive, as in one especially powerful argument scene with Armie Hammer, who portrays Clyde Tolson, Hoover's number two man and possible lover. One thing is for certain, he sure has come a long way since the star-crossed teen heartthrob he played in Titanic thirteen (!) years ago.Though J. Edgar is worth watching simply to see DiCaprio's tour-de-force performance, it has its other virtues. The aforementioned Armie Hammer shines as the demure but relentlessly honest and devoted Tolson, a complete removal from his breakout role as the self-entitled Winkelvoss twins in last year's The Social Network. His chemistry with DiCaprio is restrained yet undeniable, conveyed largely by minute gestures and exchanged looks. Most historians have dismissed the idea that Hoover was gay, but regardless of its validity or historical accuracy, the two actors make it feel utterly believable and real in context. The movie is never more compelling than when they share the screen.As Hoover's secretary and one-time girlfriend Helen Grady, Naomi Watts does an admirable job of conveying her character's constant struggle to remain loyal despite the increasingly morally questionable tasks her boss assigns her, even if we never quite understand why. She makes the most of limited screen time and a part that, on paper, is rather flat. The rest of the supporting cast, which also includes Judi Dench as Hoover's mother, is solid but uninteresting, with the exception of Jeffery Donovan, whose cringe-worthy portrayal of Robert Kennedy sticks out like a sore thumb.Aside from the acting, perhaps the most interesting element of J. Edgar is the narrative structure. Instead of following a conventional, chronological timeline, Eastwood uses the present, which, in this case, is actually the 1960s and involves Hoover dictating his personal thoughts and memories to an FBI agent who will apparently compile them into a book, as a framing device for flashbacks to various moments throughout Hoover's career and life. Though this constant jumping between different time periods makes the initial fifteen minutes or so feel disjointed, a confusion heightened by the lack of the usual subtitles to indicate time and/or place, it also makes the film feel less like a traditional, note-by-note account of Hoover's life and more like they are getting glimpses of his memories, as though they are remembering along with him. It becomes less like a biopic and more like a character study along the lines of Citizen Kane, concerned not with the particular events themselves so much as the man behind them and how he was affected by them. This provides the audience with an intimate and detailed portrait of Hoover, but it has the downfall of shortchanging some of the other individuals in the story; because everything is told through Hoover's eyes, our entire perception of these characters is based on what he knows about them and what he thinks of them. Though, as previously mentioned, Armie Hammer and Naomi Watts bring some much-needed depth to their respective roles, their characters, and several others, are not nearly as well-developed as Hoover, and their motivations are not always completely clear. One also wonders why Eastwood included flashback scenes that do not involve the central protagonist; not only do these moments, which mostly relate to the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, violate the movie's general narrative approach, but they feel simply unnecessary, failing to add anything important to the plot or characters that could not have been revealed in a different way.Still, despite these and other flaws, including an ending that could have used some minor trimming, Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar is a capable, engrossing portrayal of one of the most intriguing figures of the 20th century. The period sets and costumes are noteworthy, bringing to life five decades of American history, but like the sparsely albeit effectively used score, never draw unnecessary attention to themselves. There is much to admire here, but it is Leonardo DiCaprio's riveting performance, along with the support of an equally talented, bright-eyed Armie Hammer, that truly pulls you in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I'd rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son," Annie Hoover (Judi Dench) J. Edgar will win the Oscar?for makeup. Not since Orson Welles became a believably elderly Charles Foster Kane has that artistry transformed a youthful star into a curmudgeon. Leo DiCaprio goes through multiple stages in the life of the most famous FBI director of all time, J. Edgar Hoover.While the energy of one of history's great ages is mitigated by a measured biography of the 20th century titan, the makeup is divertingly interesting as when it makes the beautiful Naomi Watts (playing Hoover's life-long secretary, Helen Gandy) look dowdy.Director Clint Eastwood makes up for the screenplay's softening the drama of world events by inter-cutting among the 20th-century's Hoover epochs with that makeup to help the transitions. The parallel editing results in the newest era being dramatically no more interesting than the last.Not that the first 75 years of the 29th century lacked drama; it's just that this treatment dwells on the putative gay relationship between Hoover and his handsome assistant, Clyde Tolson (Arnie Hammer), and too little on Robert Kennedy as his Attorney general boss and Martin Luther King as a target, for just a few examples of the rich historical context.The humanization of Hoover is the film's strength, but given the lack of evidence to support him as gay, the time spent with him and his assistant is a loss of opportunity for his many contradictions, least of which are the lives he crushed and the laws he broke to break the back of radicalism.Eastwood and DiCaprio are two of my favorite film artists today, but when they develop a film in which I enjoy a second-rate imitation of Richard Nixon, then the two-hour seventeen minute film is too long on Hoover's intimate life. For Eastwood, the little drama of little people as in Million Dollar Baby or Unforgiven is more dramatic and poignant than a biopic that attempts to touch all the epochal bases but misses the demands of drama that makes you care about its characters.Truman Capote labeled Hoover and Tolson "Johnny and Clyde." However, I prefer Jimmy Cagney as a G-Man over a daffodil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not one of Clint Eastwood's better movies. His attempt at making a major biopic about a major historical figure misses the target. The movie is too jumbled, its themes conflicting and the acting at times stagy. The movie's main problem is the portrayal of the title character, Mr. John Edgar Hoover. By the middle of the movie, the audience is left wondering whether this is about one of America's foremost crime fighters who broke rules in order to protect his turf or an expose on Mr. Hoover's sexuality, the latter of which is clumsily dealt with in the movie. Indeed, there is one scene involving Mr. Hoover and his associate, Clyde Tolson, that is so transparently Hollywood that it generates unintended laughter; by this point the movie loses the rest of its dramatic power and it's all downhill from there. The question of Mr. Hoover's sexual orientation simply is not enough to sustain the story and is really irrelevant to the larger question of Mr. Hoover's legacy as the crime fighter. Was J. Edgar Hoover a pompous fraud or was he a dedicated public servant who put the needs of his country ahead of his own personal needs? This movie fails to answer that question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS*** We get to see actor Lenny DeCaprio play FBI Director J. Edger Hoover from a 24 year old pencil pusher in the US Justice Department in 1919 to a sick and dying 77 year old man trying to hang on to his job as America's "Top Cop" as his good friend columnist Walter Winchell describe and popularized him as in the spring of 1972. In between those two dates Hoover consolidated his power as FBI Director that he became the most powerful and feared man in America. So powerful that no President of the eight that he served under would dare stand up to and challenge him. Hoover did this by amassing tens of thousands of secret files, mostly about their sex lives, on every member of the House Senate as well as Presidents and their cabinet members who would or could ever be a threat to his power. As for Hoover himself we see he wasn't that squeaky clean as he and his admirers or toadies made him out to be.We get to see that Hoover had a secret life of his own as a closet homosexual that haunted him his entire adult life. Sometimes he couldn't hid the fact that he was gay especially when he got drunk in public together with his gay partner in life Clyde Tolson, Armie Hammer, who was his hand picked second in command of the FBI. Acting with him as he was going on a date with girl or woman Hoover would after a couple of stiff drinks let out his feelings about Tolson in what a soul mate he is to him that caused rumors about the two that were anything but complementary. There's a scene where Hoover in trying to prove to the American public that he's straight telling Tolson that he's planning to marry actress Dorothy Lamuor in order to squelch the rumors abut his gay lifestyle. This shocking revelation on Hoover's part in having Tolson playing second fiddle to Miss. Lamour had him throw a fit and physically attack him back at the FBI's office building. Kissing and later making up with Tolson Hoover after that nasty incident never tried to show any interest in women, in a sexual way, again even if they were a just harmless flirts or put-on. Yet it was a woman Hoover's personal secretary and Girl Friday Helen Gandy, Neomi Watts, that he entrusted with his personal papers as well as secret files that she after Hoover's death had shredded. That was to keep the then US President Richard M. Nixon, Christ Shyer, from getting his hands on them and using the files against his political enemies like Hoover used them against his.We get to see J.Edger Hoover for what he really was in the movie. A truly extraordinary man like President Nixon describe him but also a very petty insecure and vindictive man as well. There's no doubt that Hoover did a lot to save he US from Communist anarchists in the 1920's and Nazi saboteurs during WWII. He also personally made the FBI the envy of all crime investigating and fighting organizations in the US as well as the world at large. But his Achilles Heel was his very secretive lifestyle as a closet gay. It was that information that the Mafia had proof of in secret audio tape and photographs that compromised his ability, by him being blackmailed, in fighting or even recognizing the Mafia or organized crime for what it was: A major threat to the American way of life. And in J. Edger Hoover permitting it to grow all out of proportions made things far worse for all of us than all the good that he did in protecting the country from both domestic and foreign enemies over his 48 years as FBI Director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kind Of Movie Hoover Deserved.........A Poor One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwoods J. Edgar tells that Hoover was a complex man. Ceratainly not a highly intelligent man. A man whose vanity knew no bounds. (every-one knew that) If you are looking for some new revelations about Hoover, you wont find them here. These days everyone "knows" Hoover was a cross dressing man who was in love with another man. Nothing about that is in this tedious bio-pic because the paranoid Hoover had all his secret files destroyed after his death. I don't think it is in the least important whether Hoover dressed in ladies clothing or if he loved a man. He will fade quickly from American consciousness because he was not a great man, nor a good man. Half of this poor movie is about the kidnapping of Lindbergs baby. The other half is a scrambled mess of uninteresting flash backs. Leonardo DiCaprio is average as the bashful cross dresser, but really Mr. Eastwood...it may be time to put your feet up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J.EDGAR is the Hollywood version of J.Edgar Hoover's life story. It begins with him dictating his life story to a Assistant F.B.I Agent. Hoover glorifies his role in the F.B.I. Flashbacks show us the real story. Hoover was a tragic figure. He denied himself the basic things. He denied himself love. Unless you count Clyde Tolson his faithful and dedicated no.2 man at the F.B.I. Hoover denied himself the chance to find happiness. He did however have one thing going for him the man was a genius. He brought in the modern age of Crimefighting with forensics. But Hoover also loved to keep secrets on the rich and powerful ensuring his job as the director of the F.B.I. Hoover held the job for over 50 years. The film shows us also a sad and confused Hoover he wants to get married but he wants to stay with Clyde. I've heard That Hoover his secretary Anna Gandy and Clyde Tolson formed a complete circle of just the three of them.Hoover once proposed to Anna but she turned him down wanting to be dedicated to her job. Hoover showed the same dedication. He was Also a Master P.R. Man making the F.B.I into the greatest Crimefighting organization anywhere. Hoover's Legacy is the F.B.I. If the real story was anything like this film. Then it is a true tragedy. J.Edgar Hoover sacrificed everything for his job. And History has not remembered him kindly. Which really is shame the Man in the end was a hero. He didn't go out in the field. He only made one arrest. But his vision and his drive made the F.B.I What it is today. The Film only scratched the surface of this story. J.EDGAR. Should be viewed with Johnny Depp's PUBLIC ENEMIES as a companion piece. Worth seeing if this Era appeals to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "J. Edgar" we see the directing skills of Clint Eastwood once again deliver a superior movie that shows the human side of the controversial figure that is J Edgar Hoover.Through more fine character acting Leonardo Di Caprio is a believable Hoover, taking us through the various events that shaped this larger than life character in his formative years. We can see why Hoover was so motivated to fight the communists and we gain an insight into his relationship with his dominating mother .He reveals his overwhelming desire for order, from the innovative filing system in the congress library to his very precise requirements of his "G-Men".We are voyeurs to Hoover's early, seemingly latent (and, incidentally, disputed), homosexuality, which rappears to be confirmed by his extraordinarily close relationship with Clyde Tolson (ably played by Armie Hammer) who became a trusted and loyal aide - and his constant companion.Hoover created and empowered the FBI, protecting it from several presidents with the help of his "secret files", the contents of which will likely never been known.When he is stung by criticism that he himself rarely gets involved in arrests he simply embellishes a few high profile investigations and the inserts himself as the arresting officer. Anything to raise the profile of his beloved bureau (including, it would appear, leaking "G-Men" stories to comic book editors) The movie tells the story but does not appear to have any particular agenda - one of the enviable traits of Eastwood's recent films. He leaves the viewer to take in the characters and events and decide for themselves the type of man Hoover was - that is the art of great movie making, and indicative of the towering talent of Eastwood as a director.Personally I admire Hoover because there can't be many people who held such sway over quite as many presidents as he did, and surely claiming the FBI as his abiding legacy secures his place in history, alongside the likes of Lincoln, Kennedy etc. Eastwood's movie is a fitting tribute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first walked out of the theater, I believed that Hoover was dishonest but well intentioned and haunted by his secrets. Eastwood and DiCaprio essentially humanized him and emphasized his gangster era accomplishments at the beginnings of the FBI. It seemed as if Eastwood chose to show him at arrests and such events where he had never been simply to make the life of a bureaucrat seem more exciting, yet this Hollywood trick proved unnecessary. Hoover was constantly engaged in enough blackmail and corruption that actual focus of the film on his homosexuality and exciting cases he wasn't involved in lowered the film to the most tabloid subject matter and ignored substantive events that more Americans should know about.I originally thought that the fact that I left the movie wanting to know more was a sign that it was interesting, yet after reading a biography on his life I've realized how scant the film's coverage of his invasions of privacy, illegal operations, and corruption really was. The current political atmosphere indicates that a person's effectiveness in their position should matter more than their sexuality. In light of this, while "outing" Hoover may have tabloid interest, it isn't really relevant to his impact on America, and he had committed enough horrible, life-ruining acts to others that his orientation is almost a mundane detail by comparison. I realize that Eastwood's greatest difficulty was probably in trying to sum up Hoover's 40+ year career into a movie shorter than 3 hours, yet I was disappointed by his choice in emphasis. As it progresses towards his later career, his major actions increasingly seem like 2 minute footnotes within the film in order to make room for unnecessary elements of drama.DiCaprio had a convincing performance, yet frankly isn't ugly or fat enough to play Hoover. The actor who played Tolson had ridiculous and unconvincing makeup at the end, yet again probably too youthful looking for the role. This is Hoover's life with a heavy Hollywood treatment; a braver attempt would have less glamorous actors, less violence, and more demonstrations of his duplicity and reactionary behavior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong and Jumbled, Meanders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Clint Eastwood in "J. Edgar" together with Dicaprio are trying to go for the biographical grand-epic movie which turns out to be overlong, jumbled, and certainly meandering. Dicaprio is playing the same lead character in at least 3 different time periods, and sometimes it doesn't come off well, or loses touch with the supposed age. While Dicaprio gave his usual ferocious energy, I thought Armie Hammer did a great supporting job. Anyway, rendering the period is well put together, but why make this movie? IMO the guy's life as the movie depicts it doesn't seem too interesting - he's made out sort of as a materialistic Momma's Boy with a chip on his shoulder all the time. Yes, the character is not very interesting to say the least. The movie suffers for it, and swapping time periods so often grew tiresome as well. Can't recommend it.</fullReview>

These movies, I scared to be bored, I don't know why, maybe my movie buff instinct...But I waited for this one. Since I only heard of its project to be made, two years ago. Like TITANIC, starring the same Di Caprio. But not because of him, of course. Actually, in this Eastwood's film, he is absolutely great, although I would have guessed Philip Seymour Hoffman in the lead character of the famous Edgard Hoover. But Di Caprio is really a great actor, convincing, poignant, and the music score seems to be always the same in Eastwood's films. A very good score.I will watch again Larry Cohen's feature about the former FBI head master, and starring Broderick Crawford. It is in my collection and I have to search for it. And I only realize now that I also have the TVM, starring Treat Williams, and shot in the eighties. I have not seen it yet.But this very last Eastwood's film is awesome, terrific. I highly recommend it. The Caprio's performance is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood so masterful a director creates an fine film in "J. Edgar". Leonardo Di Caprio takes the seemingly impossible task of portraying J. Edgar Hoover and scores a direct hit. Splendid performance. Noami Watts and Judi Dench are also fine indeed and so is Dermot Mulrooney in a cameo. The art direction re creating the tone and tenor of the times is splendid as always in an Eastwood production. Two performances stand out: Arnie Hammer as Clyde Tolson is superb as Clyde Tolson, the great love of Hoover's life, and Josh Lucas who plays Colonel Charles Lindbergh to a fare the well both actors deserve supporting nominations. (Lindbergh was said to be in real life totally unemotional and in fact scolded his wife for crying after their baby was horribly kidnapped.) The musical underscoring is intriguing and yet does not get in the way of the film, another Eastwood trademark. Unless someone is dense one gets the true love story of Hoover and Tolson.Kudos to Malpaso and Eastwood for another great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*CAUTION, THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*I just got back from seeing "J. Edgar" and I must say, I quite enjoyed it. Before "J. Edgar", I was only aware of his work from the previous FBI title, "Public Enemies" with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. If you do choose to see either of these titles, you'll have to ignore what the other says because there are factual errors coming from both, specifically time wise. When one thing happens in "Public Enemies", it happens in "J. Edgar" but at a very different point in time and with different circumstances. That aside, this was a great film.Leonardo DiCaprio really brings one of his best performances without a doubt as John Edgar Hoover. All performances were top notch to be honest. I really can't begin to describe the acting because it's all great.Clint Eastwood definitely shows all aspects of Hoover's career with Roosevelt, The Kennedy Brothers and Nixon. I honestly cannot describe this film any further, you just have to see it.This film lost the 2 stars because I was hoping to see a little more action with some of the major criminals from Hoover's era; John Dillinger, Baby-Face Nelson and all the others.Please, go see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>J. Edgar--Captivating Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Leonardo DiCaprio is becoming one of this country's premier actors. He can play just about anyone and playing J. Edgar was no exception. I was in particular riveted to his performance and consider it Academy Award worthy. In addition Judy Dench's performance as Hoover's domineering over-protective rather cruel mother was her usual great.I give it an eight star out of ten review. I love various eras in post WWI US history, knew many of the issues presented in the film, knew about Hoover's alleged homosexuality and his life-long relationship with Tolson. We will never know, I suspect, if that relationship was consummated but the affection both clearly had for one another was obvious. Contrary to what interviews of the director, Eastwood, suggest I think the film does NOT elude to Hoover's homosexuality it shouts it and that the love of his life was Clyde Tolson. It is crystal clear from various scenes and emotional moments between Hoover and Tolson and because a straight man usually would not subvert his desire not only for sex but for having a family life ESPECIALLY if one were in a high position of power like Hoover was. In addition, the two men were never out of each other's company whether it was lunch every day or after hours. Moreover, and even more telling Hoover left nearly his entire estate to Tolson and finally they were buried close to each other in the same cemetery. If it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck it's a duck! His relationship vis a vie the film I think made it CRYSTAL clear where Mr. Hoover's inclinations lay. In essence the film depicts Hoover as an Oedipally neurotic hypocrite. He went after other people's suspected immoralities but kept his own proclivities secret and worse destroyed many lives by his Communist in every closet hysteria and his penchant for the tyranny of right wing politics. It is because of his homosexuality AND also because he wanted to keep his job that, I believe, he created his secret file. According to the film that file was shredded by his loyal secretary Ms. Gandy when Hoover died. An article in the Washington Post says all of his secret files can be read. Why the discrepancy I do not know.Was the film perfect? Probably not but I came away from it feeling about Hoover what I felt the many years since the protests against the Vietnam War and that was that he was a tortured man, tyrannical in nature and prone to valuing the supremacy of the state over the civil liberties of the individual. His lust for power and his temper cut like a knife. His idiosyncrasies were obviously odd. I admit to his creation of a superior national police agency, the FBI, but I loathed his politics in life and 40 years after his death and viewing the film I still do!I recommend it for those who love the history of that period and for those who find Hoover's tyranny -- J. Edgar that is ? entirely fascinating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Look at "The Jedgar" By Mary Ellen GraybillClint Eastwood is known for his last supernormal movie, "Hereafter" and Leonardo Decaprio known for his last portrayal of a patient on "Shutter Island" in a scary and subtle movie directed by Martin Scorcese. So, it's no surprise that in the recently released Warner movie, "JEdgar," Eastwood directs Decaprio an almost paranormal experience for a movie goer. The viewers are treated to a mind-boggling array of real life events. Eventually, it is clear that Hoover, the former Director of the FBI in a time when public figures were sheltered in their private lives, is an egomaniac for power, both vengeful and misled. He starts out seemingly ordinary, soft-spoken and possessed with what looks like patriotism.Judy Dench as Anna Marie Hoover provides a key pivoting point for a look at Hoover's personality. She is smothering and seductive, and yet supportive and affectionate.The scene where his mother instructs him to dance is typical of subtle, perhaps deliberate "goofs" in the movie. Mother instructs him in dancing but takes the lead herself.Overall the effect of several "goofs" within the film itself makes it seem like this is a movie along the lines of "Shutter Island" for Decaprio. Knowing the talents of Ron Howard and Clint Eastwood in directing, it seems possible that certain "goofs " might have been deliberate. The color palette also adds another dimension to the movie, with more color at the end of the movie, which starts out pale and washed out looking.As Hoover, Decaprio keeps secret files on important people, has no real friends except his male associate and partner, and one another "alien" to the human race, his secretary, who adheres to his wish to destroy all paper evidence when he dies.All in all, it's easy to know why the movie is described on www.famousmonstersoffilmland.com as a horror movie!End.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoover movie from a sympathiser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie evades practically all the dirt on J. Edgar and portrays him as a dyed-in-the-wool anti-Communist and criminal basher. He may have been both, but his methods were hideous, deporting Communists and "radicals" in their hundreds at the start of his career, including Emma Goldman, who was a US citizen. Hardly the act of a patriot, more of a zealot. Hoover's youthful enthusiasm became hard-bitten bigotry as his career went on, and he assembled files on everyone he opposed, including Martin Luther King: his treatment of the civil rights hero was utterly disgraceful, and we do glimpse it in Clint Eastwood's confused biopic that leaps about in time until our brains are addled. The make-up of DiCaprio (Hoover) and Clyde Tolson is totally over-the-top and sometimes they look more like puppets than actors, they are caked with so much latex and make-up to age them. Hoover was undeniably weird, but you'd never guess it from this picture, that depicts him as an enthusiast rather than a zealot, and a lonely gentleman rather than a homosexual. For me, Hoover built a horridly puritanical, armed national police force that did very little good and has evolved effortlessly into part of the totalitarian emerging state in that benighted country. The wrong director, and the wrong star, IMO. It could have been good, but definitely was not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J EDGAR wasn't half bad. I watched it with very low expectations since De Caprio was in it. De Caprio is aesthetically displeasing but I guess we've got to get used to the guy since he is going to be in most of the biopics for the foreseeable future. In his defense, he did try real hard, but it is a pain watching him for 130 minutes.I guess Americans tend to look at their past with a lot of guilt so obviously J Edgar is portrayed as this evil little man who was earnest but misguided. I would have liked to see a different portrayal of Hoover, something more pro-establishment, which is what I expected from Eastwood. De Caprio lacked the range to portray hoover and the dialogs were way too sentimental at times. Hoover was portrayed as a very talented but also broken man who had trouble coming to terms with his sexuality. The makers used this as a cause for his cruelty.Armie Hammer was surprisingly good. Naomi Watts didn't have much to do. But she is always solid. It would have been better if they had cast somebody else as hoover.(5.5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Old person' suits and clunky storytelling spoil the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I don't know a great deal about the man in focus, I know the basics about him. And there seems to be one problem with the whole idea of making a movie about J Edgar Hoover -- he isn't a very likable character. Black tries his best to construct a sympathetic character, but instead weaves a tale that is clunky and not cohesive. DiCaprio does a fine job as Hoover, proving again he has the magic, but the make up spoils half of the show. While all the prosthetics and makeup are wonderful and would have been great if used in only a few scenes, it is painfully obvious that you are watching a young actor in an 'old person' suit. And when everyone is in all that getup for 75% of the film, your chances of having a moment where all that 'aging' doesn't work is pretty high. All this complaining aside, however, J Edgar is not without it's moments. There are many elements that do work. Parts of the story are very interesting, the camera work is nice, Eastwood brings his 'soft touch' to the craftsmanship, and the human story of Hoover and his alleged lover is very endearing (although I find it hard to believe Hoover was a closet homosexual. I can believe that he was so detached from his sexuality that he didn't know how to love anyone ((and that's how the homosexual rumors got started)). But this film was aiming for waterworks). But once everything is all said and done one has to remember -- Hoover wasn't a very nice man. Look at what he did in context, even the things he did in this film. And that just goes to show, no mater how much you polish up a lump of coal, it will never turn into a diamond. That is the case here, with the man and the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but not too bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In creating a biopic, filmmakers have a large mountain to try and overcome right off the bat. To condense a person's entire life into a two or three hour film is a daunting task and one that is, frankly, impossible. With 2009's Invictus, Clint Eastwood tackled making a picture about Nelson Mandela in an intelligent way; instead of trying to handle his entire life he just focused on one time period, attempting to capture the essence of the man without making it a history lesson (unfortunately the film was a failure, but it was a smart idea). J. Edgar does the opposite, and that's where it's problems begin.J. Edgar Hoover is a fascinating historical figure, but the film tries to cover his life from the early days until his death and in just over two hours it is way too brief a duration to do this successfully. When handling who Hoover was, the complexities of his character and what motivated him, the film starts to spark. Leonardo DiCaprio is an actor who I've always found has a hard time disappearing into his roles, and while that remains true here he is still able to capture a lot of Hoover without letting him as an actor become too distracting. It's always difficult for an actor as recognizable as him to fully disappear into a role and that's the one thing that holds him back from true greatness here, but his grasp on the insecurities and internal conflicts of Hoover is impressive, to say the least.The film focuses a lot on Hoover's relationship with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) and the struggles they faced being forced to quell their passion in favor of Hoover's political agendas, and I found a lot of emotion when it was dealing with this topic. It doesn't hit the hammer too hard when it comes to Hoover's homosexuality, but I was surprised that Eastwood tackled the issue so directly instead of putting the large majority of it in subtext. There are scenes with Hoover struggling with his sexuality that I found devastating, particularly one with his mother, played by Judi Dench. Ultimately though, it's too little and the film focuses much more of it's time on telling Hoover's life in detail, but in such a brief duration there isn't nearly enough time to appropriately capture any of that.It follows a lot of the standard procedures of biopic filmmaking, dealing with the big flashy moments and building the whole thing around a structure of Hoover writing his life story, and there are a lot of times where it feels way too much like a history lesson as opposed to an actual film. It had a tendency to feel like something you would be forced to watch in high school, and then fall asleep during, with a major over reliance on narration and time cuts. The film feels a lot more focused when it deals with Hoover's investigation into the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, so much so that I feel like it would have served better if it had only focused on that period, the same way that Invictus did with the World Cup. Because as focused as it is there, it's oppositely sporadic for the rest of it's running time, having a hard time getting it's footing and often being incoherent.DiCaprio was surprisingly impressive, but a lot of the supporting cast barely gets any room to do anything. Jeffrey Donovan is hilariously bad as Bobby Kennedy, Josh Lucas could have done wonders in the Lindbergh role but he gets virtually no screen time and Naomi Watts is locked away in a disappointingly stock character. The only ones who get much to do are Judi Dench and Armie Hammer. Dench is strong in her few scenes where she gets a lot to do, her and DiCaprio have a great working chemistry that made you feel the history of those two characters. Hammer, on the other hand, is an embarrassment. At the start I didn't mind him, but as the film went on he became worse and by the time it got to his money scene he felt like an acting student trying so hard to impress his teachers and failing on every possible level to the point of absurdity.Clint Eastwood is a director who stays true to his style and it's one that I've always enjoyed. Even when he makes films that I don't care for (which is honestly more often than not), he has a style that feels very cinematic and old school and I admire it a lot. It feels a lot like the man himself and I'm always hoping that he can bring that style to more films that work better overall, but unfortunately this isn't one of them. It's not a bad film overall, but I can't say it's a good one either.</fullReview>

The life and times of J.

DiCaprio's tenacity and strong support by Hammer as his thinly-veiled possible homosexual paramour (tightrope executed by the canny screenplay by Dustin Lance Black) and right-hand man Clyde Tolson are both award worthy.

		<shortDescription>The Hoover of history is no hero, but human.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A heavy set mood will discomfort the viewers of Clint Eastwood's "J. Edgar". Portraying the broken memories of an aged John Edgar Hoover, Dustin Lance Black's screenplay flows with guilt ridden narratives. As the plot transitions mercilessly between time frames with little warning, this quality of a senior in regret makes the film a psychological character study of the passed Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Leonardo DiCaprio's convincing role as Hoover edifies this troubling persona. And, to be honest, relaying the story to you is just as troubling. Yet this is what makes "J. Edgar" a good movie. By witnessing the major sequences of his life as they spring to his mind, the audience learns about J. Edgar only as he wants you to know him. It begins when Hoover was just a young man, and an attempt is made on the life of his boss, Mitchell Palmer. Tom Stern's beautiful yet daunting cinematography of Washington D.C.'s evening landscape reminds the audience of current global issues as the city burns under multiple terrorist attacks.Indeed, just as this terror is set in the background at the movie's outset, the image impresses itself in the back of our minds throughout the film's duration. And no matter how unethical Hoover's tactics show to be, we can't help but agree with him. As such, his arguments against his opponents stress one unnerving fact: that war can, at any time, hit home.Many of the memories (I think it's more accurate to call the scenes memories) recount Hoover's triumphant cases. There is an ongoing narrative concerning the political kidnapping of a wealthy aviator's infant son. Hoover is diligent to remind his peers that the Federal government must up the ante on its crime fighting strategy. As this particular case pans out tragically, Hoover's message gloats an unfortunate reality. Toward the conclusion, Eastwood choreographs a beautiful montage sequence of Hoover's psyche: "when morals decline, and good men do nothing? evil flourishes". Case after case, Hoover proves to be not only ruthless against crime, but a social visionary.Although he is steadfast against crime, Hoover is no hero. He is impatient and jealous when others are credited, and is even willing to taint the news. A famous example is the hunt and killing of John Dillinger. Hearing about Melvin Purvis' success, Hoover is indignant and orders that the honoured agent be terminated from the FBI, so to take the credit himself. In the end, Hoover had taken truth as a commodity to exploit: to promote justice as the FBI synonymously with his own name. DiCaprio transcends drama and moves into the territory of the educational. His depiction is simply convincing as the Director of the FBI. He is handsome, yet awkward. He demands respect, yet is vulnerable to ridicule. His role in "J. Edgar" makes it clear to the audience that talking about Hoover is as problematic as the man himself. Such is the reason that describing the film's plot is as relevant as analyzing DiCaprio's performance. Embodying Hoover's dispersed memories, DiCaprio does history a service by acting against his egoistic and deluded intent: Hoover was no hero, but a flawed, yet passionate, human being. I judge the film to be the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie Clint Eastwood gives us the lifespan of J. Edgar Hoover ? the man who made the F.B.I. a household word across the U.S. and perhaps the world. It bounces back and forth from the F.B.I.'s very beginnings in 1920 to the 1960's. Hoover recounts his historical role to an F.B.I. historian. For J. Edgar Hoover (played rather well by Leonardo DiCaprio) the F.B.I. and himself were very much the same thing. It was his organization from top to bottom.Even though Leonardo gives a superb effort, this film really falls flat ? it lacks dramatic zest ? in fact the first portion recounting the F.B.I's origins are simply boring; very much like a docudrama that you see on the History Channel. It's filmed in this grey-colourless style which adds to the void that we feel through-out. Only on occasion, as when we see J. Edgar Hoover encountering Bobby Kennedy, do we get a feel for the sinister power that Hoover readily exercised and possessed. We also witness this in his persecution of Martin Luther King when Hoover prepares tapes of Dr. King's conjugal escapades for mailing to his wife. This was accompanied with letters urging Dr. King to commit suicide. The film shows some members of his staff objecting to these nefarious attempts, but in reality Hoover surrounded himself with toadies who readily cooperated. For instance, even after Hoover dies, his secretary Gandi destroyed all his secret files.The other characters in the film seem to be mere fill-ins. There is a strong suggestion of sexual repression in his initial court-ship with his life-long secretary Helen Gandi (played by Naomi Watts) and then with Clyde Tolson (played by Armie Hammer). The infatuation with Helen Gandi is purely speculative; that with Clyde Tolson less so, as they spent several holidays together at government expense, had lunch together daily at government expense, plus Hoover left his estate to Tolson.These suggested sexual inhibitions were trying to create sympathy for Hoover ? basically a lame attempt to explain the man's vile behaviour. And vile he was ? he constantly used sex as a way to denigrate and blackmail anyone who had the audacity to disagree with him. He was constantly warning of the dangers of communism when during the 1950's the U.S. Communist party had less than 5000 members of whom close to 1000 were F.B.I. undercover agents. He loathed any attempt by African Americans to gain their civic equality ? in fact he worked to suppress it. He publicly called Martin Luther King "the most notorious liar in the country". He put thousands of his alleged enemies under surveillance and kept files on all. There are historians who rank Hoover as the most sordid man of twentieth century American history.The film does give a reasonable representation of American history which may hold the attention of those who have an interest in this period. But much like the subject portrayed, the film lacked heart. As I was watching I couldn't help feeling what another director could have done with this material ? let's say Oliver Stone!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When morals decline and good men do nothing evil flourishes. Society unwilling to learn from the past is doomed. We must never forget our history. We must never lower our guard.""J. Edgar" is a biographical drama directed by Clint Eastwood, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Armie Hammer, Naomi Watts, and Judi Dench. The screenplay was written by Dustin Lance Black who is best known for his Oscar winning screenplay MILK. The movie is based on a true story; some scenes are based in pure speculations.This film tells the life story of J. Edgar Hoover (DiCaprio) taking the audience back and forth in time between his early years in the justice department and the years during his tenure as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), until his death on May 2nd 1972. The film has a great storyline. It develops focusing on Hoover's career and his lifetime dedication to the FBI. For the most part, the movie is told from Hoover's perspective as he dictates his life story to a few different typists (Young FBI agents) because he felt that it was time for people to know the other side of the story. Hoover is presented as the hero of the story; at times, exaggerating his accomplishments. The tale portrays Hoover as a young dedicated patriot, perfectionist, dedicated to create order, with an obsession against communism, working his way up, overcoming challenges, accumulating power throughout the years, and later becoming one of the most powerful men in history of the United States. The movie reminds us that Hoover wasn't afraid of bending the rules a little in order to keep the country safe. Perhaps, Hoover is best known for his infamous wiretaps and the never found secret files. As we see in the movie, a clever Hoover making files on anyone that crossed his way. Allegedly, even using these files to blackmail presidents to manipulate their actions and that way managed to keep his position as head of the bureau through nine presidents. At the same time, Hoover shows a weaker side and is portrayed as a childish man with a speech impediment who was influenced by Annie Hoover (Dench), his mother. Mrs. Hoover is portrayed as a very religious, rigid and conservative person that tells her son in an occasion that she'd rather have a dead son than a daffodil. Assistant Director of the FBI and long time friend, Clyde Tolson (Hammer) FBI Secretary Helen Gandy (Watts) Overall, J. Edgar is a good movie with a good cast and great performances. This is a very well done movie. There were a few flaws; the makeup used to age some of the characters was a little odd and not convincing taking away from the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DiCaprio was horribly boring, as usual! My wife and I tried for 45 minutes to find anything redeeming in this travesty and gave up! Last DiCaprio movie I will ever try to watch again! First of all he tries to go through the scenes with a monotone. Then he overplays being a weirdo. It was obvious the intent of the movie from minute one was to trash Hoover. Way too heavy handed to even be believable. They never showed any humanity in Hoover... Just portrayed him as a freak... Typical Hollywood bias against anyone associated with the Republican Party. Not even historically accurate. See IMDb's "Goofs" section. The producers flubbed this one bad. And to give it any awards just shows how Hollywood covers for crap! This movie is trash!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie this morning and really enjoyed it. I am 65, and one of my favorite movies of my youth was the "F.B.I. Story", which came out when I was in the 6th grade. After seeing that movie, I bought a copy of the book and read it. I also loved the T.V. series about the F.B.I. After a couple of years in the Army and going to college, I grew up a bit. I then understood that sometimes your idols have "flaws". Mr. Hoover was flawed, but he built one of the best crime fighting agencies in the history of the world, and this is a very good story about how he did it. The movie was a bit hard to follow, as it kept switching from one time period to another, but I think it presented Mr. Hoover and the F.B.I. in a way that we can understand why our country has one of the top crime fighting agencies in the world.J. Edgae Hoover died a few days before my college graduation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has been receiving quite a bit of mixed reviews that I thought I would throw my hat into the ring and explore my own views and experience on what I thought of this film. Well, I loved it! This is my favorite non-animated film this year and I am saddened that there were a good number of people who did not share my movie going experience, but to each his own I suppose.Leonardo DiCaprio really busts out his acting chops in this film, decorated with Eastwood goodies, supported by a strong cast including Armie Hammer, Naomi Watts, and Judi Dench. His depiction of Hoover was nothing short of miraculous, from young to old, he really captured the mysterious and powerful essence that was this iconic figure in American History. Being narrated by Hoover himself, it is very interesting to see how the elements he dictated to the scribe became exaggerated and embellished, while moments that were being remembered or recollected were deeper and in some cases, darker and in others intimate.Eastwood's use of camera tricks and pacing were well placed. One distinct element was the use of camera style coloring and lighting to help assist with the various time periods, from a more sepia inspired younger Hoover to a more colorful, yet faded older Hoover. I also loved how the film paced back and forth (one moment comes to mind when they enter the elevator old, and leave it young in a flashback). His simplistic composition really added to the sadness and dramatic elements of the film.Though I won't say that other's criticisms were necessarily wrong, I will say that I disagreed with many of them. Though I understand much of the make-up critiques, example, DiCaprio reminding me a lot of Jon Voight and Hammar a little like the Six Flags dancing old guy, it did not detract me from the film at all. I can very much see many aspects of the film being at the very least nominated, though sadly I don't think there are enough people who care for the film to see it win many of them.Being as it may, I had no complaints about the film and left feeling very satisfied and recommended it to everyone who asked me about it, though they may not share my admiration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film undoubtedly is a gay romance film with J. Edgar's life in The Bureau as the backdrop. I think people have the right to know that. I am not sure what disappointed me more, Clint Eastwood or the Hollywood marketing machine. The point, I felt lied to, the tailer and released plot summaries I read did not reflect the true hidden agenda of the film. I use the word hidden because I feel the the way the film was intentionally positioned had left out the true heart of the story. Clint Eastwood, if you are going to make a gay romance movie, hats off, just give us an honest heads up so we know what we are walking into. Don' masquerade the truth to make a buck with miss leading marketing to capitalize on opening weekend. You duped us to because Hollywood knows gay films in general do not do as well financially as non gay films. Not a slam or slur, just a fact. Shameful, I use to have respect for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eastwood the director was more hard hitting when it came to Flags of our Fathers than he is with Hoover. Once more DiCaprio plays a real life, divisive character who had a malign influence for decades in the USA. Even Presidents were afraid of him. A braggart, bully, blackmailer who walked over the constitution he meant to protect.Of course to some Hoover is a hero, a man who stood up to communists but where Eastwood gives us a biography with not so good aged make up on DiCaprio and Arnie Hammer and is willing to give a bit of a mild kicking to his subject, even a gay relationship is hinted at, there is no doubt that polemic approach from a film-maker such Oliver Stone might had made a more interesting, edgy and politically charged film.DiCaprio gives is usual good performance, Hammer is OK but no great shakes and both actors seem to be hampered when they play their older characters. What could had been a great, interesting film is just solid but uninspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"J. Edgar" begins as autobiography of an important FBI officer-- or however it's called. Leonardo DiCaprio plays this tough agent who seems to be very confident of himself. Since press told us there would be a big secret involving a tough guy, everyone could presume it would involve his sexuality; said and done. As the movie goes, we discover DiCrapio's character has no interest in women. More than that, he makes friends with another officer, and then the plot comes back to war or something like that which was happening. I don't know what is more uninteresting: Edgar's career, officers love, war in the USA or conversations these characters have. There's simply NOTHING for you to be preoccupied with the story, since the writers can't seem to find a climax. Clint Eastwood surely has done better jobs. See it for curiosity or don't see it at all.</fullReview>

What this film lacks in excitement it attempts to make up for with a muted color palate and undertones of sexual repression. While I lacked the ludicrous pancake makeup that the characters wore in the film my mid film impersonation of a shaky Clyde Tolson was the most exciting thing about the film.This film is as fresh as a last years Easter candy. Everything is stodgy and old in this film from the lack of color to the dialogue.

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining History Lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was an entertaining history lesson. I did not know what to think going in, but I did come out satisfied. Unlike many others, I found my eyes glued to the screen, because this movie was quite interesting to me. Leonard DiCaprio gives an Oscar worthy performance as J. Edgar Hoover, the man who created the FBI. The makeup was not outstanding. I mean, it looked wonderful on Leonardo DiCaprio, yet when Armie Hammer first appeared on the screen with his full makeup on, I swear I broke out laughing. It was terrible! The only thing that I liked about his makeup was the jowel, thats it. I knew some very basic facts about J. Edgar Hoover, yet there were a lot of stuff that I did not know. (He was a closetted homosexual, for instance.) Armie Hammer plays Clyde Tolsen, his partner in crime, as you may say. They did everything together, even going to Horse races, and they never missed a lunch nor a dinner together. Armie Hammer, I thought was wonderful! Especially in his later years, when he is older. He consistently shaking, which I thought was cool. This movie was really well made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Educational more often than electrifying, although the truths and revelations are cursory at best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's debatable whether or not J. Edgar Hoover's life is deserving of an epic biopic, or even if his private life secrecy and historical adventures leading to his legacy are worthy movie-making material. What is not in question is Clint Eastwood's directing capabilities and Leonardo DiCaprio's acting chops. Both are nearly flawless. Writer Dustin Lance Black (Milk) also delivers a sharp script, which magically keeps a two-hour film from dulling or dragging and cinematographer Tom Stern utilizes techniques that demonstrate an attractive, nearly black-and-white style. And while the subdued nature of Edgar's sexuality, bigotry, highly sought public eminence and corruption/extortion occasionally clashes with what many audiences might hope to see examined, it's still an exquisitely made piece.In 1919, Attorney General Mitchell Palmer (Geoff Pierson) conducted his raiding of Bolshevik communists and anarchists, aided by a young John Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio), who experienced a quick rise through the ranks to become head of the anti-radical division of the primitive Bureau of Investigation. By 1924, Hoover became the acting director, slowly building the unit's power, authority, jurisdiction, scientific aptitude and overall crime-fighting effectiveness. Federal laws, counter-intelligence, fingerprinting, and centralized information gathering allowed the FBI (officially formed in 1935) more respect and veneration. His involvement with the gangster wars and bank robbers of the 1930s, the public's eventual admiration and recognition of the FBI as heroes, the Lindbergh kidnapping, the Great Depression, and Kennedy assassination are all touched upon ? but just as many details are excluded as included.In his unequaled dedication to the bureau, J. Edgar's personal life suffers ? in this film, his homosexuality, friendlessness, illegal surveillance collections, and blackmail attempts are confirmed, as his controversial private dealings are dissected. Each of these contentions is handled with delicacy, preventing any single aspect from overwhelming the whole of his career. Eastwood clearly isn't seeking out shocks. The masterful performances are what stand out the most, with strong supporting roles by Armie Hammer as forbidden love interest Clyde Tolson, Naomi Watts as faithful secretary Helen Gandy, and Judi Dench as his proud yet restrictive mother Annie.One of the more interesting angles to Hoover's life is that his impact on history isn't so notorious that it's common knowledge (despite at one time being revered as the most powerful man in the world). This film sheds light on the formation, progression and evolvement of the FBI, its battles with governmental opposition, and Hoover's suspected accumulation of secrets and confidential files concerning prominent political leaders. It serves as educational more often than electrifying, although the truths and revelations are cursory at best. Ironically, this tasteful approach to a tumultuous existence may be the film's greatest criticism. And since the movie spans several decades, extensive makeup effects are used to age each of the primary characters (seamlessly edited time shifts are frequent and unnecessary); while this element will probably garner Academy Award attention, the extremeness is hard to take seriously. Seeing DiCaprio as a hunched, wrinkled, fatter elder is far more distracting than convincing (this goes twofold for Hammer in his later years, who resembles Pruneface from Dick Tracy).- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a man who was the backbone of the United States for nearly five decades, one would think Clint Eastwood and Leo could've turned out a better movie than this. I went to a showing tonight and there were less than 10 people in the audience, that should've been a sign.The style in which the movie is told is very similar to the 1959 Jimmy Stewart classic, "The FBI Story", which backtracks history of the FBI from its early days and reviews its key early triumphs. There's also biographical accounts of Hoover's life, but nothing major we didn't already know, as in his likely homosexuality, his grudge against RFK, and tapes of scandalous material on JFK and MLK. The whole time I kept wondering to myself, what's this movie about and where's the story? The make-up on Leo and his sidekick, "Clyde", was also ridiculous when theyhad to make them look older, it reminded me of the first Jacka$$ movie when Johnny Knoxville did the old man shoplifting sketch. Perhaps they would've been better off casting a legitimite aged person to play the older Hoover. Although in brief scenes, Bob Hopkins portrayal as Hoover in "Nixon" and Ernest Borgnine's version in "Blood Feud" left a better impact than the two hours Leo had to work with.Without a real central story holding this together, with Leo not fooling anyone in his old man costume, and the fact we learn nothing substantial about Hoover we didn't hear about before, this movie is a real dud. Even if his more fictionalized and outdated, one would be more satisfied with the Jimmy Sterwart 1959 story about the FBI than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done historical biography film of a complex yet determined man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I for one am a history buff and film fan so it was only a given that I view "J. Edgar" a biopic that tells the history and life and times of FBI head director J. Edgar Hoover, and as most may know Edgar was a complex and different man yet he rose to the top of his game with change as he took on all comers. Director Clint Eastwood the all pro always does a well job with research and history and he highlights J. Edgar with plenty of power struggles in both his professional and private life, Edgar was clearly a mother's boy and most likely a homosexual which he kept very well hidden.The film mostly told as a biography flashback from J. Edgar's point of view it highlights many of the memorable events from the 1930's thru the 1970's. The kidnapping case of a famous child goes on to propel Hoover to push for the FBI to start a science lab of fingerprinting and investigative techniques of fiber and hair evidence collection. Also Hoover was the man to invent wiretapping and the training he started was top notch having agents with college degrees and they all should be fit and in shape.Aside from all of that most interesting is how Edgar felt that communist and terrorism posed a domestic threat also not just internationally like he told attorney general Robert Kennedy. Hoover as the film showed was also a man with many power struggles as he questioned politics and fought congress to put the national spotlight on federal law enforcement. His secrets of being gay was well hidden from the public as he always tried to focus more on the scandal of politics and new inventions of the agency to occupy the public's mind. Hoover was clearly a mother's boy as he lived with sweet Annie(the fantastic Judi Dench). Also interesting and compelling was seeing how Edgar felt that Martin Luther King posed a threat to America. Edgar didn't always play by the rules yet even till his dying death he would outsmart everyone including Richard Nixon by hiding his personal and secret files! Overall this is a well done historical biopic that showcases a complex and different man who still yet fought for justice, freedom, and rights in his own way while being secret with his own life. The makeup work also was top notch as Leonardo Dicaprio(maybe his best performance ever)was well shown as an old and elderly J. Edgar. As this film proved justice and morals can be obtained your own way. This is one historical biography that any film or history buff should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers are minor considering the term "bio"In the defense of the actors Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic), Armie Hammer (Gossip Girls) and Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr.) did their job as actors and presented a believable tale. However, Eastwood's actions disappointed me as a viewer. I didn't like the smear campaign against J. Edgar Hoover at all. It was disgusting to sit through all of that propaganda, yet I was forced to because my friends wouldn't let me leave the theater as they were enjoying the film and found it funny. They were equally as angered; however, when later I explained that most of the things in the movie were fictitious lies spread by the media and never proved with fact. Subsequently, when the credits rolled there were many gay couples rolling their eyes at me for shouting "bull" throughout the movie. That I and a few others found funny. But getting to the point, what kind of a person makes a "biopic" filled with garbage? Hoover's private life was very much kept secret. Sure, he wasn't a saint, but few are. Can I tell you if he had girlfriends or boyfriends? No. But neither can Clint Eastwood or Dustin Lance Black. I can tell you that he crippled mobsters with his words, that he changed the way the United States looked at crime-scenes, and that he was indeed part "Negro" http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/hoover_fbi.htm Eastwood furthermore took a partnership, very much like a police partnership or any working partnership and warped it into a homoerotic fantasy based on homegrown assumptions. When Edgar's life-long friend and "work" partner had a stroke, Edgar helped Clyde Tolson financially, he even left him his home because otherwise Tolson would have been ill and homeless. That doesn't make Hoover "gay (nothing wrong with it though - Liberace, Neil Patrick Harris, and others are still good people and entertaining)" it makes him a true friend. All of the things that were "personal" in that film were based on speculation. Say that one of these days you do something "great" like create an even better defense system for your country. A few decades later, some guy trying widen his spotlight as a director finds out every rumor about you, ignores or lessons your achievements, and throws you in a dress because there was one rumor your maid created (because she thought you were racist for telling her that you too were a "Negro") how would you feel (to know while alive) that some person will probably urinate on your good name after you've passed? Better yet, how would your family and friends after your death feel to know that that is how some will see your legacy? What Eastwood and Black did was wrong and disrespectful to the dead: Especially considering what that dead person in question accomplished for his country. And even in the end of the film how do we see Hoover? Fallen over on the floor, pale, overweight and on his side like he had been crying. (Then Clyde "magically finds" a document that Eleanor Roosevelt supposedly wrote next to the bedside table -- when that was evidently shredded with personal files). This is how Eastwood wanted the man who stopped the mob's reign of terror to be remembered: as a fat gay man who lied a lot. And you know what? While Hoover was personally trying to make the U.S. a better place to live for you, families and their kin, and me... Eastwood hadn't even began "acting" yet.... He was too busy slacking off and smoking pot before 1955 and he was in his 20s then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really excited to watch this movie, I think the whole J Edgar Hoover era is fascinating. Clint Eastwood puts out fantastic work, and I also love Leo. I figured this would be a knockout. Not so. My qualms:1) The movie was way to slow. The pace was almost unbearable. Granted that the story line was always relevant and added to the overall picture of Hoover's life, but it could have been portrayed in a flashier way. This might have helped curb my urge to look at the clock repeatedly. I actually left and made a snack while the movie was playing...and came back to the same conversation. If one can get up, eat, come back and still be in the same scene on the same topic, the movie is in trouble (in my opinion)2) I don't know if this was Eastwood's intention, but I ended up despising Hoover. His entire persona was that of a giant weasel. Hoover was really a bit of a brat in real life, and definitely on a power trip, but I was hoping to see some of his kinder side. Even weasels have good parts, and I don't think his good intentions were portrayed well enough. Every time some of his genuine concern came through (as for that of the Bureau he created) he just ended up sounding whiny.3) The scene where Hoover is found dead in his bedroom is just flat out stupid. I think that could have been eliminated entirely. We all know he was extremely vulnerable, showing him dead and in his undies did nothing for an argument that was already preaching to the choir.On a more positive note, the plot line was very linear and easy to follow. The cinematography was also beautiful, and well picked for the historical era. The way the movie was filmed changed as time passed, to reflect the different decades. This was done mostly through the use of light, later time periods had brighter scenes, which was a really neat touch. Still can't get past the miserable speed and one-sided portrayal of a very complex person. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J. Edgar, portrayed as a closeted homosexual in this film. OK. But there was absolutely no discussion of why the "Manly" men of the FBI felt that J. Edgar was such a great leader and administrator. Seriously, if you talk to anyone who had been in the FBI under Hoover, it is clear that this man had the highest respect of his agents. Didn't come out in this film, it was a repeat of the "evil" J. Edgar who had the goods on JFK and Nixon, like that was hard to do.And why was the aging make-up so poorly done? J. Edgar looked like an alien in a low budget sci-fi film. The make up crew could have purchased latex masks that did a better job.Academy award nod? I must have seen a different film, this is one of the worse films by Eastwood.J. Edgar deserved better, and I don't mean that his homosexuality should have been hidden, but why in real life did the FBI agents have such respect for him? That question was never answered, nor even ask. Clyde implies at the end that J. Edgar was a liar about his history, so no one else ever thought more of their exploits than actually happened.Sorry, but anyone in even the most basic film school could have done better. And my local Halloween store has better make up than the aging process forced on J. Edgar and Clyde.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood can usually be relied upon to direct interesting films and he's done so again albeit one with a touch of the blands about it so that it's not unlike celluloid white bread. DiCaprio is clearly not averse to playing characters from history and it is a fact, of course, that Howard Hughes was contemporaneous with J. Edgar Hoover. Two hours is obviously insufficient for an in-depth probe so Eastwood throws the lion's share of a long life to the Lindbergh kidnapping which was a key investigation which helped Hoover to consolidate and expand his already growing power base. Apart from DiCaprio who is never less than competent and seldom more, Naomi Watts turns in the best performance as Helen Gandy who devoted a lifetime to serving Hoover. Worth a look but no more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Acting from DiCaprio, but Pro-gay theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J. Edgar I've heard many different sides to this man's life, mainly talking about why he never got married. It seemed to me that the majority of the film was based on that. Many people called him gay because he never got married. Eastwood directed the film, DiCaprio starred as the Head of the FBI, and Dustin Lance Black wrote the script for "Milk" starring Sean Penn (which was a very pro-gay film). There are many different ways to look at a movie, and this film has several. One example would be when J. Edgar puts on his mom's dress after she died. Most people would probably see that as gay and officially consider this man gay. That's true, but when you look at who his mother was and how she was always there for him, you might see it as, "Mom, you were always there for me, I need your help now." Mrs. Hoover had said, "I'd rather have a dead son than a daisy for a son." That makes J. Edgar understand that he can't continue to live his life as someone scared of dancing with girls. The idea that people call him gay for never getting married, is "irritating" and quite "disturbing." The thing to strongly consider is, that after having ALL his marriage proposals rejected by the girls he asked, would probably have been very depressing. I'm sure that when people see this movie, they'll leave the theater with the message: "anyone who doesn't get married must be gay" (a scary and depressing thought). I still enjoyed the movie for the acting.</fullReview>

EDGARONE-LINE REVIEW : A thoughtful, respectful, if not disjointed account of a complex man.RATING : "Wait for the instant download" (Rating System: "See it in theaters", "Wait for the instant download", "Don't waste your time"J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio, "Titanic") was a complex character. He was paranoid, homophobic and a reported cross-dresser. In many ways a contradiction to his position as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.In this Clint Eastwood directed film, we learn about Hoover through his exposition of personal files dictated to young agents over the years. It's an interesting story device. But Eastwood chose to tell the story in non-linear time. We jump from event to event not chronologically but thematically.We see Hoover's relationship with his domineering mother, his awkward ways with women, his flirting with man-on-man love, and his long-term relationship with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer, "The Social Network").DiCaprio did a wonderful job playing Hoover through his different ages and phases. He was able to melt away his own persona and show us Hoover as a leader, a son, a man, and a black mailer. The makeup for him was perfect, not so for Hammer who looked very strange as an old man. DiCaprio will likely receive an Oscar nod for his performance.The time-shifting in this movie confused me. I wasn't always aware of where I was in the time stream and I occasionally got lost as to the point that was to be made. So, for an interesting story of a complex man told with a jarring incongruous time sequence, I recommend you "wait for the instant download."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"J. Edgar" is Powerful and Sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Clint Eastwood's "J. Edgar" runs and feels a little long, and is amazing with an awesome performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. He is brilliant. Eastwood once again demonstrates his delicate and powerful touch in this captivating portrait of J. Edgar Hoover, who is shrouded in secrecy and tainted controversy. Hoover (DiCaprio), who was Director of the FBI for nearly 50 years through 6 Presidential Administrations, single handedly built and distinguished the Bureau into what it is today. Surprisingly, what compels in "J. Edgar" is the underlying tortured love story. In a moving scene DiCaprio as 80 year-old Edgar gently kisses his dearest friend and companion Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) on the forehead at the touching narrative arc. Eastwood and DiCaprio delicately address the controversy surrounding Hoover's personal life and his lifelong relationship with Tolson, his Deputy Director. Was Hoover gay? He no doubt was a complex man. I think Eastwood and Writer Dustin Lance Black hint that J. Edgar was really a tragic sexless character, say along the lines of Michael Jackson. Particularly in DiCaprio's powerfully authentic portrayal, whatever impulses J. Edgar may have had for Tolson (Hammer) were suppressed by his dedication and commitment for his job, and perhaps his unforgiving Mother (amazing Judi Dench). The culminating narrative is intriguing. In an early scene we witness Edgar awkwardly kissing his date, pretty and spirited Naomi Watts as Helen Grady, who would become his secretary. He is sweaty and unnerved when he interviews Tolson (Hammer) for a job at the Federal Bureau. Tolson's sexual preference seems evident, Hoover's is clumsy. In a heart breaking scene near the end J. Edgar breaks down confessing to his only secretary Helen (powerful and compassionate Naomi Watts), "Do I kill everything that I love?" Hoover's career was awesome that of the true patriot, who sadly spiraled into manic control and paranoia, also seemingly falling into amphetamine addiction. Black's screenplay spans from the McCarthy blacklisting, the gangster era of John Dillinger, the Lindbergh kidnapping which really established the FBI, through Martin Luther King and JFK. For Edgar knowledge was power, and he guarded it accordingly. Dustin Lance Black is stalwart in his rendering of America in its most dire period in history. However, I think he fails in the catharsis of Hoover. Ultimately, it is about what we are left with. In a way that is a shame given the powerful performances by DiCaprio and Hammer, both deserve nominations for Lead and Supporting Actor. Through Hammer's compassionate gravitas, we get that Toslon loved J. Edgar. I also get like Black; no one really knows the real intimacy of their relationship and friendship. Eastwood demonstrates brilliant restraint as he addresses the possible Hoover transvestite rumors in a stark compelling scene. Judi Dench is profoundly dominating as Edgar's Mother, who professes that she would rather have a dead son, than have a "daffodil for a son". The tragedy adds up. DiCaprio is electrifying and powerful as Edgar. He displays the authentic nobility and tragic torment of a man married to his job and cause, sacrificing all for it. "J. Edgar" is most compelling in its sad tortured love story of Edgar and Clyde. DiCaprio brilliantly captures one of Hoover's tragic flaws?he valued loyalty utmost, above even love. And even his devout dedication would never overcome that. I think the final catharsis and what we are left with is ultimately missing in Black's story. Regardless, Eastwood, DiCaprio and Hammer paint a touching portrait of humanity in "J. Edgar" which brilliantly displays the courage of his accomplishments, and the profound sadness of his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A skilled director, screenwriter, &amp; cast combine to create a memorable &amp; effective biopic about an extremely controversial American figure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of us born after 1972, it is routine to see government directors arrive in a new post, serve their designated appointments, and move on to be replaced by another bureaucrat. However, for those a bit more mature, they will remember the FBI as a place where turnover at the top did not occur. One man, J. Edgar Hoover, molded that organization into the domestic crime fighting force it is today and would react severely towards real and perceived threats to his power, even from multiple Presidents of the United States. As the subject of Clint Eastwood's first true biopic, J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) is profiled from his beginning at the early form of the Bureau of Investigations, through his rise to power, and finally as an old man clinging and clutching his valuable secrets at his last breath. J. Edgar's story is mostly told through flashbacks which is the only way one could include all of the important episodes in his history. If it was chronological, there would be too many cuts, jumps, and abrupt time shifts. The flashback angle allows Eastwood to go back and focus on a particular era for 15-20 minutes or so and come back to an old J. Edgar.Eastwood and screenplay writer Dustin Lance Black do not skimp on the history either. Early on, there is Edgar's beloved boss Mitchell Palmer (Geoff Pierson) and the rise of the internal Bolshevik threat. The perceived peril of communism and its conniving sympathizers contributes more than anything else to Edgar's perseverance to raise the FBI's stature and crime fighting abilities to stem what he says as an aggressive Red Tide. Another flashback later on shows Edgar's appointment as the Bureau's interim director, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, street fights against Depression era bank robbers, and the introduction of his life-long male companion Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). The film does not directly take a strong side in Edgar and Tolson's relationship. That Edgar is most likely a closeted homosexual is a given in the film, but as to whether or not the two work colleagues and daily lunch and dinner companions ever consummate their relationship is strategically avoided. Nobody will ever know so why invent scenes which will throw the film onto another track? Edgar's long time secretary, Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts), is also around throughout the decades to carry out her boss's not particularly ethical or legal commandments concerning wiretaps and confidential files. In the background, but certainly not hiding her influence, is Edgar's mother (Judi Dench). She is far too involved in his personal and professional life, much too emotionally controlling, but none of these traits seems odd to her or Edgar. It is how they prefer it.The makeup and ageing affects on all three of the central characters (Edgar, Clyde, and Helen) are usually remarkable. Edgar's eyes appear far too young to be hiding behind extensive layers of liver spots and wrinkly jowls. Armie Hammer is very convincing as a physically challenged stroke victim, but not so much before that and Naomi Watts ages quite gracefully but noticeably sags and shuffles a tad slower than in her younger days. The lighting is almost a character unto itself. Eastwood does not hide what he is doing at all. Edgar's face is frequently half dark and half light, especially when he witnesses illegal acts or is weighing difficult decisions. The interior lights are extremely dim because the lamps only light about a foot of space around them and the daytime outside light which streams into Edgar's office is stale and almost lime green in color giving off an air of ageing and a bygone era.J. Edgar will appear to history buffs, biopic fans, Eastwood appreciators, admirers of DiCaprio's fine acting skills, and Dustin Lance Black's writing aficionados. If the movie patron is seeking action or shoot-em-ups between the FBI and John Dillinger, go back and watch Michael Mann's Public Enemies. That film is still fresh enough in the public's mind that J. Edgar wisely sidesteps the re-telling of that particular episode in the FBI's early years. Instead, settle in for a fascinating and refreshing reminder of many of America's 20th century criminal and crime-fighting episodes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland and underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't recall knowing much of anything about J. Edgar Hoover before seeing this film. Other than recognizing the name, everything else was pretty much a mystery. I suppose that's why it was so intriguing; controversy is always interesting. Here is this man that became known for his incredibly strict standards, his loyalty to his work, his rise to the top of law enforcement, and basically helped the way crimes are solved and prosecuted evolve to what we're familiar with today who basically had confidential files on every major player he'd ever been in contact with, was completely clueless when it came to the opposite sex, and may or may not have been homosexual.The film begins during the Palmer Raids of late 1919 and early 1920 and covers everything up to Hoover's death in 1972. We constantly jump back in forth in time as an older J. Edgar (Leonardo DiCaprio) is narrating his version of his life and the younger version of J. Edgar in the 30s as he rose to the top of the Bureau of Investigation and formed the FBI. The way the film transitions between the early 1930s and 1972 and the way these transitions are edited is part of the film's charm. It already has this kind of filter on it; the one that seems to have become associated with most of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts. Everything looks kind of semi-drained of its color and is kind of hazy. It looks the way you'd imagine the past if somebody was telling you a story and they cued a flashback or something.The unfortunate thing is the film has something really intriguing at its core, but it's presented so blandly. There's a huge explosion early on in the film, gangsters, gunfire, and a dead body among other things but it's all spread out amongst rather underwhelming dialogue. DiCaprio becomes incredibly emotional in the final half hour or so, but he seems to be holding back the rest of the time. Other than portraying a different accent, he seems to just be going with the flow while the same can be said for Naomi Watts. While DiCaprio does pull it together later on, Armie Hammer practically acts circles around him the entire time. His facial expressions are what give away just how much he enjoys being in the company of J. Edgar and his portrayal of an older man with health problems is practically spot-on. Judi Dench also has quite a few memorable scenes as J. Edgar's mother Anna Marie. Keep a particular eye out for the "Daffy" conversation between her and J. Edgar.The make-up effects are easily a shoe-in to win an Oscar this year. Not only are they fantastic, but trying to think of worthy competition is almost impossible. X-Men: First Class perhaps? Either way they did a phenomenal job here. The subtle sex jokes became increasingly awkward as the film progressed. However, that was more than likely its purpose. There is also one of the most oafish kiss scenes in cinematic history included in here. While watching J. Edgar, I couldn't help but think of David Fincher's Zodiac. It was mostly in the way both films seemed to ease you into conversations and reactions revolving around what interested you in the film to begin with rather than throwing you headfirst into the subject (The Zodiac Killer and J. Edgar's private life respectively). The flaw with that comparison is that Zodiac is still more interesting than J. Edgar.J. Edgar comes off as long-winded and fairly boring the majority of the time. There is a fascinating story buried within its roots, but somewhere between pen and paper and the big screen a bland representation of what it once was became the movie we know today. Leonardo DiCaprio almost seems to hold back most of the film while Armie Hammer manages to outshine him at every turn and shows how ridiculously talented he really is. J. Edgar isn't downright awful, but it isn't great either. Even though they only played a minor role, J. Edgar manages to be the lamest and dullest film featuring gangsters I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, what's up with this movie? Is it meant to make Hoover look like such a prissy self-promoting wuss? I thought Eastwood dug him. The arrest sequences are devastating: Hoover responds to criticism of his legitimacy to run a federal agency by making a flurry of arrests but all when accompanied by a dozen agents, and he's always the last one through the door, but then stepping forward to take credit. This thing is hard to watch. And the make-up is comically bad. But Leo's in there pitching, looking like EG Marshall and acting like an inept femme. This movie actually manages to make Judi Dench look bad! Judi Dench!I didn't even recognize Naomi Watts. She is so subsumed by the Helen Gandy character that Watts is unrecognizable. Unfortunately Helen Gandy is a vacuous toady and I'd rather hear from Naomi Watts. The Winklevi dude is great. Such homo gleam. Hoover's barely repressed homo urges are given front stage -- I get it, Arnie Hammer has a smile that twinkles. Such an ugly portrait of Hoover, this movie. I mean, it may well be accurate, it might not, but I'm surprised Eastwood painted him as such a worm.Really, this movie makes J. Edgar Hoover into the emotional equivalent of an insecure 12-year old girl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Gimmickery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I found the story fascinating, the writing, acting, score and settings nearly perfect, why oh why does Clint Eastwood feel at this stage of his long career he needs to resort to lame gimmicks? Case in point; virtually every scene is shot in shadows. Not just dark, but so dark you can't make out half the face. More movies are doing such nonsense lately for God knows why. Playing follow the leader in Hollywood makes little sense if the leader is screwed up.Another example is all those flashbacks. Mr. Eastwood appeared to be attempting to give the audience whiplash. Of course biographies require going back in time, but multiple flashbacks followed by immediate flash forwards followed by what seemed to be several flash sideways all within a few minutes is extremely distracting to the viewer. And this goes on throughout the entire film.This could very easily have been a masterpiece, but much as I admire his work, Director Eastwood spends far too much time here saying, "look at me," instead of saying watch my film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INACCURATE AND SCANT BIO - Many Speculative Rumors Being Called Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was under the impression that I was going to see a true bio of this man, but I found that an enormous amount of his career was not just NOT portrayed, but not even verbally mentioned at all. Instead, we got a 1/2 assed movie that focused more on a speculative homosexual relationship.There were so many speculative individual rumors that were being played off as gospel truth, which is always so disappointing, because it has a tendency to invalidate the entire body of work.Interesting fact: Warner Brothers was the company that made Hoover's FBI movie back in 1959 (and the TV show in the '60s), where they promised J. Edgar that they would paint the FBI in a positive, heroic light (The FBI was a bumbling farce for decades, being compared to the Keystone Cops). We don't know if they were blackmailed into it (as Hoover was notorious for doing), or if it was a legitimate deal. NOW Warner Brothers put out THIS movie also, where they painted him in FAR less of a positive, heroic light.Leonardo does a fantastic job, as usual, will probably get an Oscar for it, but I hope no further awards to go this movie, because a lot of it is simply a work of fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting look at the life of someone everybody thinks they know, but , in fact, know very little about. In and around 1950, in a small town within America, lived a man whose teachings and philosophy have underpinned American thought for decades - well, that's what they say, but Obama must have forgotten to read it, or subverted the bits about dictators and oppressors.There is action in the first half, but the second half "drags" as the hero wanders around the USA in self exile - presumably most Americans would be aware of the stories and events depicted, but they do not grab the audience particularly. Lenny DiCappo acts tremendously well, but is hamstrung by the saintliness of the depiction. In fact, much of the film reminded me of a cross between 'Oliver Stones attempts to cash on on 9/11, and 'King of Kings' as a man battles with his beliefs in a time of great strife and trouble. Certainly it portrays a lot of Christian teaching without the deification element in Western culture. But we do not learn really enough about why he became so influential, and why his teaching was so radical. Guess I'll have to look on Wikipedia!</fullReview>

Well, at least they didn't put a feathered boa on him.Unlike the Williams movie, which was linear and covered all aspects of Hoover's career, this one only concentrates on the 1920-30's and flips forward to the 1960's-70's.The problem with a character like Hoover is that his career spanned such a long period that no biopic could do him justice.

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood has distinguished himself over the years, if not as a serious dramatic actor, at least as a credible actor with some degree of sensibility and independence. The trailer that was released promoting his latest film, "J. Edgar" depicts an action film about the FBI, more specifically the founder of that organization, J. Edgar Hoover. The reality of the film is, however, something entirely different from the trailer which is very carefully crafted to bring people to the theater expecting an action film. There is no action whatsoever. There is a lot of "stock footage" purchased from stock vendors with the bulk of the movie shot on cheap, closed sets. The story line is simply to smear J. Edgar Hoover. Leonardo Dicaprio, a "B" grade actor at his best, performs off the bottom of the chart in this movie, alternating from a poorly performed manipulative, megalomaniac tyrant to a twisted, maladjusted pervert. Just when you think the movie can't get any worse in its vilification of Hoover, it does get worse, Eastwood and Dustin Lance Black, drag the dregs from the Anthony Summers book and paints Hoover as a racist, a pathological liar, a tyrant, a cross dresser--but a loving homosexual-- all to the accompaniment of soft, "chick flick" love scene background music, according to Dustin Lance Black, of course. Eastwood has created a film that will have a much more detrimental effect on his own legacy than on that of J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover's image and reputation set the standard for strength, unflagging courage and dedication to his country in the minds of the American people; a man who protected this country during the darkest hours of the 20th century. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, leaving no legacy of substance to mark their own life, Eastwood and Black, will soon be forgotten, relegated to the scrapheap of Hollywood history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood, erstwhile right-wing hero, has done a complete turnabout in his sunset years and is striving to become the darling of the Hollywood lefty crowd. With the release of "J Edgar", a turgid cheap shot taken at an American hero (and a dead one at that), he earned their praise and thanks as well as several AA nominations. How long ago and far away "Dirty Harry" seems now."J Edgar" itself was a curious waste of time and talent - time because it was an unrewarding 137 minutes, and talent due to a miscast Leonardo Di Caprio and a completely wasted Naomi Watts. It is told in flashbacks and tosses pails of swill on Hoover's personal life and his career achievements, making extensive use of innuendo and fabrication. The story was uninspired and slow-moving, the photography was too dark and the color washed out, and DiCaprio, while very competent and improving with each picture, lacks gravitas for the part of Hoover.Eastwood, actor, director, producer and now character assassin, should take heart and not be deterred by this bump-in-the-road of a picture. There are many famous Americans he could smear if he tried as hard as he did here - and dead ones, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't give this thing a real review. Do do so would indicate that it is an actual film worthy of comment, which it is not. Rather than ship it to movie theaters in film cans. it should have been sent to Walmart printed on toilet paper. That way it would have ended up where it belongs.Eastwood has been revealing more and more of his personal agenda in the films he directs. He took his first leap out of his own closet where he was pretending to be a director of quality films with his release of that female boxer flick. In that one he treated us to the idea that if you really care about someone you'll kill them if they're unhappy. That way you'll be seen as a real compassionate person and your pal won't have to be unhappy any more.In this, his latest bucket of sewage, he takes all the gossip, rumors and outright lies about J. Edgar Hoover and portrays them as if they were absolute fact. Eastwood knows the power and impact of film to imprint any message you want on the minds of the viewers. At that, he is a master. Millions of people will now believe that Edgar was a cross dressing homosexual who was dominated by his mother. After all, "I seen it in the movies; it's gotta be true." You'll get more factual information about J. Edgar in the one page Wickipedia bio than in Eastwood's entire work of pulp fiction. The Wickipedia page makes it clear that while J. Edgar was indeed slandered by many, those that were closest to him knew he was straight.J. Edgar had a couple of love affairs (with women) that lasted many years. The cross dressing BS is childishly ridiculous. To think that the man who practically invented investigative secrecy was so stupid in his private life that he would let others see him running around in drag is beyond intelligent belief.The real point of this exercise in license to lie is so that Eastwood can do his bit to forward the homosexual agenda of acceptability. He portrays J. Edgar and Clyde Tolson, Edgar's best and closed friend for many years, as "sweet and sticky" homosexual lovers. The end result being that the audience is taught that homosexuals can have lifelong loving relationships just like a straight husband and wife.Whether you or I agree with that is not the point. The point is that the film previews and advance press releases completely misrepresented the actual content. The previews promised an inside view of the real life of J. Edgar. What we got was another Eastwood mash up of his personal points of view.My disappoint in DiCaprio for appearing in this low grade San Francisco skin flick is beyond measure. He takes a dump on his own career in full view of the audience. Man, I've never seen worse.Eastwood has had his last dollar from me. The man has finally revealed himself to be a moral bankrupt. Not for what he believes, but for the way he lies to and manipulates his fans for his own purposes.No more for me, Clint. You did not "make my day."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brokebank Mountain with Politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this last night at a pre-screening at LACMA with a Q&amp;A afterwards with Clint Eastwood, Leonardo DiCaprio and Armie Hammer along with the writer Dustin Black.The film is in itself good. Meaning that the story is fascinating, the pace, directing and acting excellent. It jumps backwards and forwards a lot but is never confusing. Its also enlightening in that it exposes history unknown (at least to me) about communist terrorism in the 1920's.So why the low score? Two major reasons. First of all whilst Blacks desire to get into the character and to understand Hoovers personality is laudable he doesn't really address some of the horrific things that he did. He DOES cover Hoovers attempts to get at Martin Luther King but we don't ever to get to feel or understand the horror of his bigotry. We are also expected to believe that Hoovers love for Tolson (brilliantly played by Armie Hammer) was somehow chaste or deeply restrained, Hoovers cross dressing is only hinted at. This feels like a cop out.Secondly we never get to understand how Helen Gandy tolerated Hoover. Did she admire him? Hate him? How did she cope with some of the things he did? Although Naomi Watts does her best she is never given enough scope. In the drama that was Hoovers life there were 3 players, not two.One other niggle. The make up! ugh. In the Q&amp;A Leonardo and Armie complained that it took 6 hours+ to put the make up on. They should have demanded less. It was awful and actually detracting.A good film but not the great one it could almost have been.</fullReview>
