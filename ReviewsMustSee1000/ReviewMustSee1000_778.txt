		<shortDescription>A Stick To Beat the Lovely Lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The filming of The Quiet Man was the culmination of a dream by John Ford to make an Irish picture in Ireland. He bought the rights to the story over a decade before and peddled it to every studio in Hollywood and was turned down.He went to Republic Pictures partly because John Wayne was just winding down his contract with them and he wouldn't have to pay him extra, and partly because Herbert J. Yates's small studio was the last stop. Ford got the permission for The Quiet Man on the condition he do a sure fire moneymaking John Wayne cavalry picture first. So Ford, Wayne, and Maureen O'Hara did Rio Grande first before setting out for Ireland.In her recent memoirs O'Hara said that this was her role of a lifetime, she knew it would be before one frame of film was shot. She'd been playing in a load of ridiculous Hollywood drivel films as a redheaded Bedouin princess and she did them essentially for the money. This one was to be a labor of love.Love yes, but a labor nonetheless. John Ford was a talented, but strange man to work for. He could be a bully and a tyrant on any set he was on. She was grateful to him for the career making roles she got with him, but recognized his faults. She relates in her memoirs that Ford used his influence to knock her out of an Oscar Nomination for Mary Kate Danaher in 1952 over some trivial offense Ford thought O'Hara committed and took umbrage.It was a family affair for Wayne of sorts as well. His kids came to Ireland with him and you can see them at the horse racing scene as extras. Young Patrick Wayne spoke his first movie lines. He also had with him his second wife, Esperanza Baur who was not his kid's mom. She was a tempestuous sort and they would soon part in a very ugly divorce.Sean Thornton who was born in Innisfree, but went to America as a toddler, has come back to his native Ireland after making a name for himself as a prizefighter and killing a man in the ring. He and Maureen O'Hara have an instant attraction for each other. However Wayne does run afoul of her bully of a brother, Squire Will Danaher played by Ford regular Victor McLaglen.Wayne and O'Hara marry, but McLaglen won't turn over the bride's dowry. And Wayne won't contest him for it.So with a little help from The Taming of the Shrew and a bit of Falstaff thrown in, things are put right in Innisfree. More I won't say. As in all of John Ford's films and this is one of the best, he got some grand performances from some of the most minute characters in the film. Some of his regulars like Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, Ken Curtis, Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields with the rest of the roles played by Dublin's acclaimed Abbey Theatre players. One of my favorites is Jack McGowran who played Feeney, Squire Danaher's little toady factotum. The music was arranged by Victor Young who did a grand job of using traditional Irish melodies in the score. One song, The Isle of Innisfree was recorded by Bing Crosby for Decca and sold a few platters for him the year The Quiet Man came out. The Quiet Man is an annual classic for St. Patrick's Day, the same way It's A Wonderful Life is for Christmas. At least in America it is. I've wondered if it is as well received in Ireland as it is here. I think John Ford, the former Sean O'Fearna, was hoping it would turn out that way.Mr. Ford, you got your wish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Thornton, Meet Mary Kate Danaher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lush and beautiful countryside of Ireland provides the setting for this engaging tale of an Irishman, raised in America, going back home to escape a past he'd just as soon forget. In `The Quiet Man,' director John Ford returns to his own roots, going on location to tell the story of Sean Thornton (John Wayne), a man troubled by an incident that changed his life, and now doing what he can to forget about it and just move on. And toward that end, Sean travels to the place he knows so well from the stories told him by his mother, to Innisfree, intending to buy the cottage in which he was born, White O'Morn, where he can make a fresh start and build a new life for himself. There's a problem, however; the land and the cottage is owned by the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick), and borders the estate of one Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), who not only fancies the widow herself, but wants to buy her land. Squire Danaher (as he's known) is not the only one Sean must deal with, though, as other matters arise upon his arrival in the small hamlet of his birth. And her name is Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara)-- who just happens to be Squire Danaher's sister. But Danaher or no, it makes no difference to Sean, who as soon as he lays eyes on Mary Kate determines to make her his wife.  Sean soon learns that in Ireland, however, such things are pursued quite differently than in America. To win the hand of Mary Kate he must employ the services of Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) a kind of matchmaker/chaperone/marriage broker, who will help him secure the consent of Squire Danaher, without which the marriage cannot and will not take place. So Sean has no choice but to acquiesce to the local traditions and customs, and Michaleen forthwith commences the appropriate overtures. In the meantime, he awaits the decision of the widow Tillane as to the purchase of White O'Morn, which he is determined to have at any cost. John Ford directed more than 140 motion pictures, going back to the days of silent films, and his favorite star, with whom he worked in at least a dozen of his feature films, was John Wayne. And when you think of the John Ford/John Wayne collaborations, it's the Western that instantly comes to mind: `Stagecoach,' `She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,' `Fort Apache,' `Rio Grande' or `The Searchers,' (to name a few). Yet, `The Quiet Man' is perhaps their most memorable effort, and remains a favorite among fans to this day. Ford (who received an Oscar for Best Director for it) presents the story on a very personal level, and in Sean and Mary Kate gives the audience characters to whom they can relate; and it's that personal connection he affords the viewer that may suggest the main reason behind this particular film's popularity. That, plus the fact that at the core of this story there is an honesty and genuine sincerity that rings so true-to-life. Ford also successfully captures the essence of all that is good and positive about Ireland, from the richness of all of his characters to the lavish cinematography that brings the country so vividly to life. It's quite simply a wonderful, uplifting film, impeccably crafted and delivered by Ford and his superb cast. Too often, John Wayne's work gets a bad rap; no matter what role he takes on, you're liable to hear `John Wayne is always John Wayne, the only difference is the character's name.' And, as he proves with his portrayal of Sean Thornton, it's not only a false statement, it's so unfair to an actor who brought so much to so many, in his craft as well as in his personal life. The Oscar he finally received for 1969's `True Grit' was way overdue, especially when you consider his performances in such films as `The Searchers,' `Red River' and, of course, this one. Is he the best actor of all time? Of course not; but he is good at what he does, much better than he is usually given credit for. And he (and his films) can always-- always-- be counted on to provide good, solid entertainment. Together, he and Ford have provided some of the most memorable moments in the history of the movies, and his pairing with Maureen O'Hara was a stroke of genius. There's real chemistry between them, which enables them to play so well off of one another. They made five films together between 1950 (`Rio Grande') and 1971 (`Big Jake'), and there is always that spark of magic between them, but never better than in this film. A gifted actor, Maureen O'Hara is also, without question, one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the silver screen. It's easy to understand how Sean Thornton can fall instantly in love with her when he first sees her walking through the fields of Innisfree. It's entirely believable. And when you get to know the woman behind the beauty-- who Mary Kate is down deep-- it's even more understandable. Perfectly cast, O'Hara, like Ford, returned to her roots to make this film (she was born in Milltown, Ireland, near Dublin), and apparently it agreed with her, because her performance is nothing less than natural and inspired. Mary Kate Danaher, in fact, is arguably one of her-- if not `the'-- most memorable roles of her career. The supporting cast, topped by Fitzgerald (who is absolutely unforgettable as Michaleen) also includes Ward Bond (Father Lonergan), Francis Ford (Dan Tobin), Arthur Shields (Reverend Playfair) and Jack MacGowran (Feeney). A delightful and endearing motion picture, `The Quiet Man' is, of all of John Ford's achievements, one of his best. And Sean, Mary Kate, Michaleen and all the people of Innisfree are ones you'll remember and want to visit again. It's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simply wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's not to like about this picture? A classic directed by the legendary John Ford. John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara light up the screen. Wayne's performance is brilliant, but what really stands out is that he is playing a regular guy with real feelings and emotions--no army uniforms, no indians to fight, no cavalry coming to the rescue--just a great performance. The supporting cast is unmatched--including great performances by Victor McLaglen, Barry Fitzgerald and Ward Bond. Look closely for Ken Curtis (Festus, from Gunsmoke) in an uncredited role. The scenery is absolutly breathtaking--it makes me want to go home to Ireland--and I'm not even Irish. To top it off The Quiet Man has the greatest fist fight ever captured on film. This is one of my two favorite John Wayne movies. The Duke should have gotten an Oscar for this one. Movie viewers won't be disapointed by this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Woman's Film, Aye, But I Like It Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maureen O'Hara in Technicolor is surely any Irishman's dream, and "The Quiet Man" would be timeless for that alone. But O'Hara's performance is all the more indelible for the great good humor she bestows on her character, Mary Kate Danaher. Let's face it; with any other actress, this could have been a disaster.Sean Thornton (John Wayne) comes back to County Mayo, his birthplace, to find a peace he lost tragically back home in America. He immediately discovers some old friends, and a new one, too, Mary Kate, who while herding sheep stares back at him in what James Joyce might have called "a significant manner."Director John Ford elects to shoot O'Hara from an odd angle, and with an unusual overhead shadow crossing O'Hara's face, that in anyone else's hands would have totally blown the shot but here creates something, well, "Homerific." It's one of many amazing shots in a film that seems more painted than photographed, and is perhaps the most strikingly lovely film ever made.The shot of O'Hara looking back at Wayne also clues you onto something else, that this is going to be her story as much as it is Thornton's. In fact, it's really more about her than it is about him, a film about romance and a woman's liberation at the hands of her lover. We call them "chick flicks" today. But since John Wayne is the nominal star and no one ever confused Ford with Douglas Sirk, "The Quiet Man" isn't popularly regarded this way.It's fun to read all the comments about poor Mary Kate and how this film glamorizes the mistreatment of women. They have one thing right, it's a film about spousal domination, but it's the wife ruling the husband. Think about it: She makes her lover do just about everything he does in the film, even risk bodily injury at the hands of her brutish brother (she doesn't know about his past and thinks she married "a coward.") People complain that he drags her across a dung-covered field, while a helpful woman hands him a stick "to beat the lovely lady with." But of course it's Mary Kate who's in total control of the situation. She wants Thornton to fight for her, in every sense of the word, and won't make it easy. She wants him to adapt to her culture, rather than adapt to his. (She's not one to be "honked at," as she puts it.) It's not surprising she trips and falls at one point while Thornton pulls her across a field; probably one of those puppet strings of hers got in the way.But there are worse things in life than being enslaved by the likes of Maureen O'Hara, like not being enslaved by the likes of Maureen O'Hara. She's not only beautiful and pure-hearted, but such a hilarious joy to be around. O'Hara plays up the comedy of her scenes very well; she could have opted for a more regal distance from the slapstick but plays it as rowdy as the rest instead. The scene when she spits in her hand before shaking with matchmaker Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald, who gives the next-best performance after O'Hara) tells you who she is better than any of her many sexy moments on screen. It also gets back to the point of why she's so essential in this film. She is Ireland, the spirit of Erin, and you want her to win, not because she's so pretty but because you know she's good and right for Sean, too.About the only things wrong with the film are the action sequences, the horse race and the fistfight between Sean and Mary Kate's brother. It's not because the scenes aren't terrific, but because they are so abbreviated, especially the fistfight, which feels likes its building to something even funnier and more rousing than what's come before when it just sort of stops. Ford apparently had to do some cutting to get his film in at the required length, and with his focus as much on Mary Kate as possible, probably preferred to trim the scenes that had the least to do with her. But since the focus on O'Hara is what makes the film anyway, this is a small matter. Wayne fans wanting more action will just have to content themselves with almost every other film the Duke ever made.Seeing this film for the first time reminded me a lot of "Local Hero," the 1982 comedy. Not only is "The Quiet Man" also a fish-out-of-water story about an American in the British Isles (Scotland in "Local Hero"), both films maintain a very delicate balancing act between whimsy and pathos, with "The Quiet Man," siding on the former direction and "Local Hero" the latter. Definitely worth checking out the one if you saw and liked the other. But "Quiet Man" was there first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Movie Made With Love by Entertainment Pros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They don't make movies like this anymore" is the usual phrase heard about classic movies. More appropriately "They CAN'T make a movie like this anymore" applies to "The Quiet Man".John Ford directed John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in a number of classic unforgettable Westerns with a familiar supporting cast including Ward Bond, Victor McLaughlin, Mildred Natwick and other pros. "The Quiet Man" moves these familiar icons from the post Civil War American West to the post World War II rural Ireland.You don't have to be Irish to appreciate the visual beauty of the Irish countryside and villages or the beauty of Maureen O'Hara, but your appreciation of the story is enhanced if you know something about the unique Irish culture.Ireland and America have been tightly bonded from the earliest Colonial Days of America and are permanently intertwined since the Potato Famine of the 1840's sent tens of millions of immigrants to populate the vast U.S.John Ford perfectly casts John Wayne as the Irish born, U.S. raised troubled ex-boxer returning to his birthplace and Maureen O'Hara as the Irish beauty . The rest of the lovingly assembled cast contains mostly familiar faces in supporting roles.The script covers vast ground in a mostly light-hearted manner. The story plays like most John Ford/John Wayne/Maureen O'Hara movies as one step larger than life.It's clear that everyone appearing in this movie LOVES being in the movie. Maureen O'Hara never looked more beautiful and thrives as the woman in the middle between two warring men, her brother (Victor McLauglin) and her suitor (John Wayne).The over-the-top village to village brawl between John Wayne and Victor McLaughlin is hilarious and ultimately warm hearted. It sums up the strange Irish notion that you have to physically pummel a man before you can have his friendship and respect.There are big scenes and little scenes, but every scene is a delight.This is a movie that can't and won't ever be made again. It's a movie that everyone should enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exile dreams of Inishfree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not only the fact that I'm actually from County Mayo in Ireland where most of the outdoor scenes from The Quiet Man were filmed in the summer of 1951, that makes it my favorite movie of all time. This film has damn near everything for everyone in it without being offensive to anyone (Though the occasional hypersensitive Irish person or Feminist or "Yank" might take unfounded offense at the various pokes of fun that are made at various traditions!)For the romantics this has romance in abundance and probabaly some of the most famously erotic (and much copied - A further indication of how hight in esteem this movie is held) scenes ever put on celluoid (without ever more that an absolute minimum of bare flesh being exposed to satify the puritans). Steven Spielburg most famously gives the cottage kissing scene the nod in "ET" and it was said of the "Wet shirt" Graveyard kissing scene in the rain that, during the many takes it took to get it in the can, Director John Ford only got John Wayne to do everything he wanted to do to Maureen O'Hara himself.For the action brigade it has probabaly the longest and one of the most enthralling fight scenes of any movie.For the comics the entire film is laced with Irishisms and good humor and wild banter and loads of "craic"For the weepies it has tragedy and death and a haunting from the past.And for the pure sentimental including myself the film has my beautiful country lavishly and lovingly displayed in glorious technicholor compliments of Winston C Hoch amnd Archie Stout which deservedly won it an Oscar for cinematography.And it has all this and more...If one cares to delve deeper it touches on themes of Shakespeare (Taming of the Shrew) and the best traditions of Irish literature (JM Synge and WB Yeats).Testament to it's greatness are the many books and documentries that have been created about it in it's wake (Try Des McHales "The Complete Guide to the Quiet Man" or Gerry McEntees' "In the footsteps of the Quiet Man" for starters!) along with the many tourist that still visit Cong, County Mayo in search of their own dream Inishfree.I've lost count how many times I've seen this movie both in Ireland and in Exile both here in the US and in England, but suffice to say that at this stage I can now quote liberally from such classic lines as Feeney's: "Silence if you please, Parlimentary procedure, Squire Danagher has the floor" or Micheleen Og Flynn's "Homeric, impetious" upon viewing the marriage bed of Sean and Mary Kate and coming to his own conclusions on the events that may have occured in it.After owning a variety of VHS (both Pal and US versions) of the movie I've finally purchaced the DVD also which allows one (If one so wishes) to watch every frame of the movie digitally remastered - If you are a fanatic like me or Quiet Maniacs as we are sometimes known this allows you to catch a glimpse of such things as a fly landing on Maureen O'Hara cheek during one shot or (In a daring unintentionally risque scene for the 1950's) her momentarially exposing her underwear whilst jumping over a trunk.If you haven't seen this movie (and I'm increasing surprised how many of the younger Blockbuster New Release weaned movie viewers haven't) get yerself down to yer local video store now and look in the Classic Shelves for one of those classics that is sure to be there alongside Ben Hur, Gone with the Wind and Casablanca and rent it out for a great nights entertainment. Better still go and buy a copy 'cos once you've viewed it once like me you'll most likely be hooked and will want to watch it again and again (Even sometimes late at night, round Christmastime, sipping a hot Irish whiskey!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Archetypal John Ford comedy, as Irish as can be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Quiet Man" is an Irish village version of "The Taming of the Shrew," the tamer being an ex-pugilist Sean Thornton (John Wayne) retired to the land of his fathers where he purchases "that little place across the brook, that humble cottage." But no sooner does he arrives on a soft spring morning than he falls in love with Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara).Sean courts and weds her easily enough, but he has not worked out on the anger of her heavy and hard rich brother, the farmer Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) who holds an envy against him for having bought the very property that separates his spread from that of the wealthiest widow in Innisfree Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick) whom Danaher strongly desires...Danaher refuses to supply the traditional dowry, and Mary Kate accuses Sean for his apparent cowardice in not fighting for what is rightfully theirs...The battle that follows (considered to be the longest recorded on screen) has Sean and his strong brother-in-law engaging in a climatic fight the townsfolk have long been anticipating with effervescent...Maureen O'Hara is totally in her element as the fiery Irish girl whether as the bare-footed attractive woman looking after a number of sheep in the meadow, or as the troubled colleen trying to explain her problem to the devoted salmon-catching Catholic priest (War Bond) or as the proud beauty whom Wayne lets fall at her brother's feet... Maureen would play Wayne's love interest in four more features ("Rio Grande," "The Wings of Eagle," "McLintock," and "Big Jake"). Their screen relationship emphasized the strength of their chemistry...Barry Fitzerald is simply superb as Michaeleen Flynn, the village matchmaker and cart-driver who can't seem to tell anyone something without winning a black beer from them first...With an exciting Innisfree Races along the beach, a titanic fight from the farm, across the hillside, through a haystack and into a stream, and with emerald environments and great music, John Ford's romantic comedy is a marvelous entertaining film, painted beautifully, simply told with love and humor...With 7 Academy Award Nominations, the film earns Ford his 4th and last Oscar for Best Director establishing a record which is still unbeaten and won another Oscar for the outstanding Technicolor for Best Cinematography...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best directed by John Ford. An emotional, humorous look at an American, played by John Wayne, going back to his native Ireland and trying to fit in with the present culture. Sensational scenery and the grand music by Victor Young support this classic among classics. Breezy and rowdy. Too beautiful to turn your back on. A great illustration of romance. The interaction between Wayne and Maureen O'Hara is magical and hard to beat.Other classic performances are turned in by Victor McLaglen, Ward Bond and Barry Fitzgerald.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say I've ever seen a film of such beauty as The Quiet Man. It is whimsical from start to finish, literally never hitting a sour note. Presenting the Irish culture from the point of view of an Irish descendant reclaiming his heritage, this film was an obvious labor of love from director John Ford. It even pokes fun at wife-beating and the IRA with complete good taste. I can't give enough praise to this movie, but out of all the great films from the brilliant John Ford, it's definitely my favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ireland has never been portrayed as lovingly as in this film. John Ford's tribute to the land of his ancestors is about as good as a movie can get. Of course, Ford's vision is, by today's standards, a bit outdated. The Ireland of the time in the movie probably doesn't exist any more, but only in the minds of those who knew the Emerald Isle back then.The story is a bit passe, but we make excuses for seeing it once more whenever it plays on cable, as we take the journey to an ideal place that thanks to John Ford will live forever.The best thing in the film is Maureen O'Hara. This actress beauty was legendary. Having met her on a few occasions, I can only say, that she is as beautiful in person as she is in films. Miss O'Hara graced this movie by only being there. The camera loved her; she's perfect as Mary Kate Daneher, the spinster, as the locals call her.The other big assets of the film are the Irish actors that Ford entrusted key roles. Barry Fitzgerald, the impish Michaeleen Flynn, was delightful. Victor McLaglen, is excellent as Squire Will Danaher. John Wayne, as Sean Thornton, is a bit stiff, but maybe Ford's direction called for this actor to play himself in rural Ireland, who knows?This is a film to be treasured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic John Ford/John Wayne movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The QUIET MAN is like a good marriage and a fine wine. It has aged well and with each passing year the true movie buff appreciates the beauty of this once-in-a-lifetime-film. John Ford created this film as a tribute to his Irish heritage and surrounded himself with the familiar "Ford Players" (Wayne,Maureen O'Hara,Ward Bond,Victor McLaglen,Arthur Shields, Mildred Natwick) plus a galaxy of Irish players to liven up the action.Ford has Wayne cast as the brash(and somehow wealthy) Sean Thorton who is a bit confused with the Irish custom of courting. Sean has returned to the place of his birth because of a promise made to his mother years before and to hide a terrible secret which we learn of half-way through the movie. Sean spies the beautiful Kate and decides that she will be his bride. He also decides to purchase the humble cottage of his childhood from the widow who now owns it. He does win a bidding war with Will(McLaglen) who not only covets the land but the widow(Natwick). But Will exacts his revenge by refusing to allow Sean to court Will's sister, the beautiful Kate. Through a bit of Irish chicanery involving a horse race, a bonnet, a pact between the marraige broker(Barry Fitzgerald) and the parish priest(Bond), Sean is indeed able to court Kate and they eventually marry and all seems at peace until Will learns that the widow is not willing to marry him as he was led to believe through innuendo. Will brings the wedding reception to a halt by throwing Kate's dowry to the floor and knocking out Sean with one mighty blow. It's at this point we learn of Sean's reluctance to fight anyone because as a professional fighter he had killed a man in the ring; a secret only he and the local Protestant minister(Shields) share. The failure of Sean to fight for Kate's dowry makes her believe that she is married to a coward. On their wedding night she locks the door to their bedroom which Sean kicks open a roughly tosses Kate onto their conjugal bed. But Sean storms from the bedroom and sleeps the night in his sleeping bag. Moving ahead, Sean and Kate finally behave as man and wife one night but the next morning she leaves him because of her "shame". Retrieving Kate from a train waiting at the station he literally drags her "the whole way" back to Will's farm. There he confronts Will and demands the payment of Kate's dowry in full. When the tight-fisted Will refuses Sean throws Kate at Will's feet and announces, "The whole deal's off. It's your custom,not mine". Will grudgingly throws the money on the ground. Kate realizes Sean has stood up to Will and she opens the firebox of a steam engine and Sean deposits the money in the fire. All of this action is observed by most of the village's population who have been spoiling for a fight between the quiet American and the local bully. And what a fight ensues. From the farm into the village to the local pub with the villagers watching every blow. Bets are handled by the marraige broker with the odds about even. Even the parish priest and his young assistant are distant observers knowing full well they should be making an attempt to stop the fight. At the pub, Sean and Will decide to take a break from the fisticuffs and share a drink or two. Here the fight ends abruptly. The fact of who won the fight is not important but Ford makes it clear that these two mountains of men have fought and gained respect for the other. Will and Sean return to Sean's cottage with plenty of Irish cheer in their bellies and are greeted by the "woman of the house" who is relieved that her husband and brother have resolved their differences. The cast is introduced at the closing of the movie as Will and the widow ride off in a courting cart driven by the marraige broker with the entire village cheering them on. THE QUIET MAN is a movie that mere words fail to do justice. The music(Victor Young), the Technicolor photography and second unit direction(Archie Stout and Winton Hoch),the perfect supporting cast, the dialogue and the feel of this movie are of perfection with the director and stars reaching heights rare in a Republic Studio production. Its been nearly 47 years since I viewed this movie for the first time and it remains(as with many movie buffs) my favorite film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful Romantic Comedy by John Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Thornton (John Wayne) arrives by train in Castletown in Ireland coming from Pittsburgh and in the train station, he seeks direction to Inisfree. Michaleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) comes with his horse- drawn chaise and takes Sean to Inisfree. Along their way, Sean sees the red-haired Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) in the field and a cottage in White O'Morn that belongs to the widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). Sean tells to Michaleen that he was born in that cottage and he wants to buy the real-estate. The coachman recognizes him and then they meet Father Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond) that had known Sean's family and welcomes him.When Sean meets Ms. Tillane, her neighbor Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) that wants to buy the property and marry Tillane is very upset with her. When she sells the real-estate to Sean, Will becomes his declared enemy. Sean decides to get married with Mary Kate and he hires the service of the matchmaker Michaleen; however, he does not succeed since Mary Kate is the sister of Will Danaher. However, Michaleen, Father Peter Lonergan, and other locals lure Will and he consents the marriage of his sister expecting to marry the widow Tillane. When he finds that he was deceived, he does not pay the dowry for his sister. Mary Kate tries to force Sean to take her money by force from her brother, but Sean does not want to fight against Will Danaher. Mary Kate and the locals believe that he is a coward, but Sean actually wants to forget a fatal incident from his past and start a new life."A Quiet Man" is a delightful romantic comedy by John Ford. The Irish Maureen O'Hara is sensational in the role of a stubborn woman that wants her dowry no matter how. John Wayne is hilarious in the role of a man that wants to forget his past and start a new life. The situations are very funny in the small Irish village and I loved when a woman gives a stick to Sean to beat the lovely lady. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Depois do Vendaval" ("After the Windstorm")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintage and memorable film and one of Ford and Wayne's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This rip-roaring comedy-drama concerning about Sean Thorton (John Wayne) , an ex-boxer who returns from Pittsburg to the Irish village of his childhood and attempts to take a red-haired lass called Mary Kate (Mauren O'Hara who did her own singing) as his spouse , in spite of the objections of her corpulent brother Red Will (Victor McLagen) . Thornton's helped by an alcoholic old man (Barry Fitzgerard who plays the character of the Roman Catholic Michaleen Oge Flynn) , the Protestant vicar Cyril 'Snuffy' Playfair (Arthur Shields) , and the parish priest (War Bond) , among others .This hight-spirited tale is one of Ford's finest movies and his first love story with a marvelous fresh-air feeling . It's a special adaptation of 'Taming the shrewd' by William Shakespeare set on the west Ireland , dealing with an enjoyable romance , adding strong knuckles as well as punches for spectacular fight between Wayne -Ford's favourite leading man- against brawling Victor McLagen . Ford returns to Irishness in an evocative and idealized portrait , paintstakingly constructed , about life at a hamlet named ¨Innesfree¨ . Maurice Walsh wrote the story in the 'Saturday Evening Post (1933)' , then Ford asked the majors the film-making but they refused and the Republic Pictures took the production in low budget . Although made in 1951 , it was Republic's first production to be shot outside the United States . The story won the International prize of Venice (1952) and Oscar for the best movie and photography to Winton C Hoch and Archie Stout with glamorous and colorful landscapes . This was the fourth Academy Award for John Ford , though somewhat less deserved Oscar , previously was prized for 'The informer (35)', 'Grapes of wrath (1940)' ,'How green was my valley (41)'.The picture has family characters , as John Wayne's sons appear in a sequence surrounding to Mauren O'Hara ; the Irish Mauren O'Hara played along with her brother Charles Fitzsimmons as Forbes ; Irishmen Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields were brothers in real life , they were both Protestants born in Dublín , Ireland , Shields was the family name and they also appeared together in director John Ford's Long Voyage Home (1940) . Besides , Francis Ford , Ford's elder brother , despite longtime with no speaking , he played numerous films for John Ford ; Andrew McLagen , Victor McLagen's son , was director assistant , before becoming filmmaker ; John Wayne and Pat Ford , John's brother , directed partially the horse races but John Ford fell ill ; Ken Curtis married to Barbara , Ford's daughter , was edition assistant . Rating : Above average , well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful and misinterpreted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quiet Man is a wonderfully layered and at times hilariously ironic portrayal of Ireland as seen by an American.For those who doubt the film's sense of irony, just re-watch the scene where Sean (John Wayne) paints the door of his cottage. The Vicar's wife remarks on its beauty and in a deadpan manner suggests "only an American would have thought of Emerald Green". Only an American (or a foreigner), is the implication, would think that the picturebook Ireland they are seeing in this film is a realistic portrayal of a lived experience of the country. An Irish person would have painted the door red, she says. It weathers better that way.The film takes ideas of Irishness and exaggerates them to brilliant and comic effect. The drinking Mickaleen, the patriarchal rule, the idyllic countryside. But beneath the Oirish exterior is a sharp intelligence and a subversion of what the film at first glance seems to suggest.Beneath the idyllic countryside are elemental forces that are waiting to be disturbed, as we see in the two scenes where Sean and Mary-kate kiss. Storm clouds fill the sky and the wind whips about them. The countryside which previously seemed so welcoming is now tempestuous and threatening. Theirs are passions which do not fit in the comic book world which we have previously seen. Yet they exist.The portrayal of women, and particularly Sean's treatment of Mary-Kate when he drags her through the field is not so oppressive as it might seem. Remember that it is her who insists on receiving her dowry, who equates her possessions to her worth. It is she who forces Sean to act the way he does and fight Will Danaher. She indoctrinates him into her society by threatening to leave him. She withholds the marital bed. Sean eventually becomes the man she wants him to be.In short this is a portrayal of Irish, or more importantly, rural life that is very much from the point of view of the outsider. Of the city folk. Yet it always acknowledges that and has great fun playing with its stereotypes. Its funny, its romantic, it appeals to the part of us that yearns to live a simple life away from the complex world, much as we know that life does not exist. Enjoy it!</fullReview>

The Duke is perfectly paired with Maureen O'Hara and Victor McLaglen and the several other Irish actors who were members of John Ford's regulars. This is a GREAT film. My grandmother was born in Ireland and she always said "It's just like that my dear, and the people too."

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece that is sadly overlooked by the AFI and IMDB</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite simply, one of John Ford's greatest films, and one of the greatest films ever made. It is unconscionable that not only was this film overlooked by the American Film Institute, but also by IMDb voters. Only 900 have bothered to vote for this classic? And then give it only a rating of 8.0?Much better reviews of "The Quiet Man" have been written, so I won't waste time trying to outdo them. But I will say that I believe that this isn't the misogynist dream that some feminists believe this film to be. The worst thing that Sean Thornton does to Mary Kate is drag her back to her brother to demand the dowry. Remember, this comes AFTER she strands him in town and he is forced to walk home. But Thornton is a gentleman that refuses to beat a woman. When he comes back home from his long walk, Mary Kate offers him a stick, expecting Sean to beat her as punishment for leaving him in town. Instead he throws it in the fire. Later, when he is dragging Mary Kate along on the famous "good stretch of the legs" march, Sean meets a villager who gives him a stick to "beat the wife" with. Even though he is hopping mad, Sean throws away the stick. People who watch the entire movie know that Sean loves Mary Kate because of, not in spite of, her fiery spirit, and wants to be her partner, not her master. "The Quiet Man" is a wonderful romance that deserves to be seen more often than on St. Patrick's Day.</fullReview>

It was a firm favourite of my late father and we even thought about playing the music from the 'train station' at his funeral :-) While my father was in hospital, we remarked that if we played the fight scene to him, maybe he too would leap out of bed, like the old man being given the last rights and race down the lane to see what was going on. Great cast, wonderful scenery and good old fashioned story, that makes you want to re-visit the film every couple of months.

		<fullReview>It's astounding to read the posts, and have so many people play back so many lines. Were there any lines in the movie that weren't great? Seems unlikely. Along with "Casablanca", it's bursting with great dialog. As for Maureen O'Hara, it's difficult to think anyone else could have played her part. Hope Lindsay Louhan doesn't decide to remake this one. There are several movies which seem to defy any negative criticism (for me, Godfather I, Paths of Glory, Shawshank Redemption), and this film, which we all see regularly on cable, is certainly in that class. Kudos to John Ford, who seemed like a curmudgeon but was able to turn out touching scenes, none more so than in this classic. I went to Cong last year, and saw a number of places trading on the "Danaher" name, which is very understandable. Was surprised to read the shoot in the area only lasted two weeks, because there weren't enough rooms (What-- they couldn't put them all up in Ashford?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so there's no surprise on how much I'm going to praise it. It's a film which wonderfully combines drama and humor telling the story of Shaun Thornton. A retired prize boxer from Pittsburg USA, as he returns to his homeland of Ireland in the early part of the 1920's. During Shaun's last fight a horrible incident occurs to which he hangs up his boxing gloves for the last time.The enjoyment starts from the very beginning when Shaun Thornton arrives at the little train depot, asking for directions on how to get to Inisfree. The fun really starts when he falls for the beautiful Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), Shaun has to battle in more ways than one against Mary Kate's bully of a brother Red Will Danaher (played by Victor McLaglen). Featuring one of the classic fight scenes in cinema history and honored with two Academy Awards. John Ford's 'The Quiet Man' is one of Hollywood's most enduring and romantic epics.The entire cast brings this film together?.it was sort of a family affair really, seeing two of John Wayne's children in a scene. Then you have Maureen O'Hara's real life brother playing the part of Hugh Forbes (as Charles FitzSimons). Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields are also real life brothers. You will be in awe of the cinematography which captures some beautiful shots of Ireland's landscape. My rating 10/10 in all departments? I absolutely love it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in light of the performance, should be titled the Oscar Man?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up watching the Ford/Wayne movies that everyone else knows all too well. The other night I was intrigued by the TiVo information about a movie I had never even heard of starring Wayne and Directed by Ford. It sounded like quite a departure for both, especially Wayne in 1952.I just couldn't believe what I was viewing after about 15 minutes into the film. The sweeping and beautiful vistas, the development of a haunted and potentially troubled past of this American come home to the small village in Ireland where he was born...I began thinking of Hollywood's other leading actors of that time, and how this role would probably be better served by the likes of Grant, Gable, Stewart, etc., however...as the movie progressed, I began to see the Duke in a completely new light.Throughout much of the movie, the title aptly decribes Sean Thorton, at least his dialog. Few parts for much of the story involve John speaking more than a sentence or two, it seems often times just a few words at a time; and those were in scenes where the bulk of the dialog were from his co-stars and supportng actors. However this isn't really even noted except early on. But once you become absorbed in his screen presence, and as the plot develops, the charisma and presence of the actor are HUGE! Make no mistake, this movie magnificently illustrates how incredible Wayne was as a leading man in a superb drama. It's often times mentioned by the legendary actors who appear on Inside the Actors Studio, that movie magic is captured in many a scene where we just behold the actors in silence. This to me captures that very concept.I won't go into the plot or theme much more than I have. but I will say after one viewing, I have to place this movie in my personal top three of Wayne's body of work. My wife, who wasn't a big Wayne fan to begin with, but loves the romances from this period, simply fell in love with this movie.One a scale of 1-10, 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, the dopiness of many a poster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to believe that this harmless and witty little low comedy, John Ford' comic valentine to his birthplace, can engender any negativity amongst IMDB dwellers. But, perhaps I shouldn't be surprised. Among the negative comments are things like "John Wayne has never been in a movie that wasn't corny and hokey" (ahem -- "The Searchers" or "Stagecoach" to name but two), "the Irish accents were terrible" (with the exception of Wayne, almost all the principals were born in Ireland), "it's only funny if you think brutality to women is funny" (says nothing of the repeated right hooks aimed at Wayne's jaw by Maureen).This is a funny picture with, as another poster pointed out, a very Ford-esque subtext. Often beautifully photographed, it plays on Irish (and Irish-American) stereotypes knowingly and deliberately to achieve its effect -- which is to make us laugh. So lighten up, people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a film we could make today, for many reasons, but one I'm very glad WAS made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot has already been covered many times and so has most of the cast.One comment sticks in my craw...that The Quiet Man isn't really Irish and that the members of the cast, slip in and out of their accents in a careless manner. Whoa just a moment there folks.First of all this film was directed by John Ford, who was born in Ireland. Maureen O'Hara and her two brothers, who play secondary roles in The Quiet Man, were ALSO born in Ireland. So were Barry Fitzgerald and his brother, Arthur Shields, who plays the Episcopal priest against the Catholic priest of Ward Bond who is also Irish. Who would have the nerve to say that Victor McLaughlen's accent wasn't authentic? He was born in Ireland and won a Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Gipo Nolan in The Informer-a film about the early days of "The Troubles" that just happened to be directed by John Ford.The extras were chosen from The famed Abbey Players of Dublin and locals from the village of Cohn (sp), where the film was shot. The old man with the beard is the brother of the director, John Ford, himself a STAR in the silent days of film in Ireland.That leaves poor Mildred Natwick with her accent at sixes and sevens. She was impeccable as The Widow Trahern, the woman Big Red Danaher hopes to marry some day, when he gets up the nerve to ask her properly.To modern eyes, The Quiet Man IS sexist and brutal. No modern woman, outside Ireland, would stand for such treatment. The sad truth is though that a women in Ireland are STILL considered to be the property of the man she marries and of the Catholic Church. Both expect her to produce many children and have her husband's supper on the table when he gets home. If you don't believe me, just watch Daniel Day Lewis films-My Left Foot or In The Name of the Father.People who are offended by the social order outlined in The Quiet Man will ALSO be offended by MOST of the films of the 30's, 40's and 50's from every corner of the world.For the rest of us, The Quiet Man is a feast for the eyes and a tonic for the soul. It is FUN to watch John Wayne stride across a field dragging his recalcitrant wife along.The windy kiss is gorgeous and the kiss Wayne gives O'Hara AFTER he kicks down the door in great Rhett Butler form, is amazing. When John Wayne kissed a woman, she stayed kissed for hours. When he picks up O'Hara and tosses her on the bed, AFTER THAT kiss, HER reaction is marvelous! No woman should miss The Quiet Man for those scenes.And, when was the last time you saw anything about Ireland where the Catholic Priest and the Episcopal or Anglican Priests were FRIENDS who could attend parties together and where no one was shooting at each other because of the church they attended? For that alone, The Quiet Man is a marvelous film. I love it more every time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps once in a decade or so, a film is made that is so outstandingly good, so perfect in every way, that it defies categorisation and facile explanation, while continuing to occupy a very special place in the hearts of many people.One such a film is "The Quiet Man" - a mixture of gentle humour, romance, mystery - even violence - but without being offensive. While many films share some or all of these qualities, it is the way in which these themes are so skillfully woven together in the lives and personalities of a handful of people that helps to explain something of the charm of The Quiet Man.With the glorious scenery around Cong in the Irish Republic around the 1900s as the backdrop, we are introduced one by one to a variety of delightful characters and to a lifestyle that sadly is no more: pugilistic railwaymen who are ready to put up their fists at the slightest pretext; the fiery Mary Kate who "packs up wallop" and has "a tongue like an adder" and her equally fierce brother, Red Will Daneher; the cheery pipe-smoking old rogue, Michaeleen O'Flynn with his horse and cart; Father Lonnergan, who is not averse to making the occasional bet on the side; the proud Widow Tulane who helps the poor; a host of other delightful supporting cameo-roles; and of course, the quiet American himself - John Wayne, playing Sean Thornton, returning to his birthplace from the steel-mills of Pittsburgh.John Wayne must have really enjoyed making this film, which was such a departure from his more usual cowboy films. He fitted the part very well. Apparently he really was half-Irish, which must have given this film a special meaning for him. Anyway, he played Sean Thornton to the hilt, showing what a good actor he was.Maureen O'Hara is also a total delight and thoroughly believable: I shall always associate Maureen with this film, and I like to think that she enjoyed making it too! And when that much hoped-for fight between Sean Thornton and Red Will finally does take place, it gets even the dying on their feet and out on the streets to watch! This film is a total delight from start to finish, possessing a unique charm that the passage of years can never diminish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American boxer Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns to the village where he was born in Ireland. There he falls in love with beautiful redhead Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Sullivan). But things are complicated by her older brother Will (Victor McLaglen) and Sean's refusal to fight him for Mary Kate's dowry. What a gorgeous movie. Winton Hoch's cinematography is stunning and makes great use of the beautiful Irish locations. The actors are all wonderful. There isn't a single unlikable person in this movie. Even the supposed villain of the story is very likable and fun. The supporting cast is so good they nearly steal the movie from the leads. It's just a truly remarkable classic that I can't say enough good things about. I love this movie. Next to The Searchers, it's my favorite John Ford movie and I can watch it over and over. It's charming, sweet, and lovely. You cannot call yourself a fan of Ford or Wayne if you haven't seen this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, all of my family love this film, not only for the reason I shall reveal later but because, it really is a fantastic, well shot, lovely colour and produced piece of art/history. My claim to fame, well, it's my dear departed fathers claim is, he was in the "fight scene"by the corner of the "pub", which was actually a shop. But first, my dear Mother use to tell us, I'm the youngest of 6 boys and a sister, that, when the film crew came to West of Ireland, my mother, who was lovely young woman had her picture taken with one of her sisters, arm in arm with John Wayne, she would go on about this and I vaguely remember seeing the small en-print as they were called in them days, I think my sister has the photo but, what a photo. The main reason for my letter is my Dad, Frank, would tell us kids about the film etc, shot in Cong, and say, "oh yes, I was in that filim". But, with today's technology, we have the DVD and sure enough, you can stop-start the film and hold the still picture, and yes, he's in a couple of shots, just peering round the back of someone, while Wayne and the wonderful Victor McLaglen were knocking bits out of each other. We lived in GALWAY, and my dad use to deliver goods ( I think) to all over West of Ireland and he was there on the day of this shoot. Years later, my wife and I and my Brother John, at various occasions, visited Cong and walked the ruined Abby and bridge etc, but, our old Dad, well, when we first saw the DVD era film and stopped the action, and saw my Dad, it was such a shock because I am, the image of him, he was maybe late 20s then and it was just like looking at myself. All in all, a great film, great locations and a good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you thought that John Wayne cannot act this film proves you wrong. No gunfights, no posturing, no cattle drives and Rocky Mountain scenery to hide behind here. Just characters, .. Acting.If there is a bad performance in this film I just cannot see where. From Micheleen to the Station master, all spot on. Even the lady offering the stick to beat Maureen O'Hara with is just perfect.It is clichéd, I know. It is a "fantasy" Ireland I know. The characters are archetypal and exaggerated, .... again, I know. But, and it is a big but, no film I can think off gives me such an overwhelmingly good feeling. As it winds up I am immediately regretting its end, I just want it to go on and on. The constant, repetitive background music, (again, clichéd Irish fayre) is so spiritually uplifting, like the best ceilidh that you have ever heard. The whole film makes me feel like I did the first time I saw Riverdance.Oh, by the way, I am not Irish so you cannot lay that bias on me.I love Terminator 2, Dirty Harry films, Pulp Fiction and Star Wars/Trek et al. But they do not hold a candle to The Quiet Man". Best film of all time? Yes, I truly think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll spare you with the plot description (others on this page have done so), but there are reasons why I love this film.First, the performances. Wayne as the re-patriated Irish-American, O'Hara as the fiesty Mary Kate, Fitzgerald as the sly little old man, Bond as the strong-willed priest, and McLaglen as the blustering blow-hard. Directed by John Ford, they were unconquerable.Second, the cinematography. The landscapes are lush and rolling. The interior shots are filled with little details that add so much to the scene. You can almost imagine what the Cohen's pub must smell like ("Over here, we pronounce it, CO-han!"). And in almost every shot, there is the color green.Third, the writing and the lines. My family quotes the film like gospel. I was helping to move a bed into a house, and as I entered through the front door, I somberly spoke "God bless all here." We all got the joke.Fourth, the music. So perfectly chosen and composed. It adds to each and every scene.Fifth, the fight scene. A classic Irish donnybrook! So many things about this film I cherish. Also, it's one of the few films that John Wayne doesn't shoot a gun! A marvelous, marvelous film! In their book "The Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness", the Von Hoffman brothers called this film one of the "top 25 greatest guy movies of all time". Who am I to argue?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all-time favourite films, certainly my favourite Ford film I've now seen The Quiet Man for the 14th time in 33 years and still love it to bits. It depicted a fantasy world that surely couldn't have existed in Ireland even in the 1920's but it doesn't matter, you still wish that it could exist today. Such rustic charm and simple indulgences are in short supply nowadays at least in the West, and Hollywood long ago forgot the meaning of the word charm.Ex-boxer Wayne from Pittsburgh with a dark secret decides to return to olde Innisfree where he was born, makes friends and enemies and falls in love with barefoot shepherdess O'Hara. There's some glorious atmospheric photography on display throughout, such as of splinters of sunlight though tree branches or the undulating countryside under threatening skies. The outdoor scenes shot in the studio only detract from the overall beauty a little. Favourite bits (among so many): Wayne moving into his cottage in the storm to find O'Hara's swept it up neatly for him; the Homeric clutter in the bedroom after the wedding night; Wayne stretching his legs from Castlemaine with an enraged 5 mile grind home, and of course the Fight with McLaglen (giving Wayne 21 years too). The rousing end review and climax to bagpipe and orchestra must be viewed to the very end with the Republic Pictures logo fading ? to me this symbolises the end of an era, the energetic full stop to the Golden Age of Hollywood.A simple inconsequential tale, memorable in all departments, a classic that will still be shifting DVD's or whatever they have in the future (probably with all cigarettes, pipes and their smoke airbrushed) when the present "charming" movies are all forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the great movies of all time. The film is about a wonderful romance between an Irish-woman and an American returning home to Ireland, but it plays like a romance between the director and Ireland itself. The characters are unforgettable, led by Barry Fitzgerald as Michaleen, and the scenery is breath-taking. The whole cast seems to be engaged in a labor of love, and their happiness at filming the movie comes through in their performances. The story itself is entertaining and heart-warming, although the end is never in doubt. This is probably John Wayne's most genuine performance, it being so obvious he feels comfortable inhabiting the skin of Sean Thornton, his character. The whole cast were very good friends, indeed many of them were family, and their chemistry is quite real and vivid on screen. I highly recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Well then, I'll begin at the beginning..." Father Peter Lonergan narrates this tale of a "Yankee from Pittsburgh" who "..is a quiet, peace lovin' man come home to Ireland to forget his troubles..."John Wayne plays Sean Thorton the former boxer who moves back to the land of his birth when walking along the road he spots a beautiful redhead (Maureen Ohara) herding the sheep. The look she gives him back immediately lets you know how these two connect! When he asks his friend Michaleen (Barry Fitzgerald) "Hey is THAT real? she couldn't be!" He replies "Nonsense man, its only a mirage brought on by your terrible thirst!" and rushes him off to the pub.He later discovers that the object of his affection is Mary Kate Danaher...and also discovers that the big loudmouth in town is her brother Squire 'Red' Will Danaher. Well, Irish tempers get to flarin' and Irish passion can't be quelled and the Quiet Man...well...I don't want to spoil it...you know somethin' good is bound to happen!The cast is terrific: John Wayne, Maureen Ohara, Barry Fitzgerald, Victor MacLaglen, Ward Bond and many others. I've seen it so many times I know most of the lines by heart but I still watch it every St. Patty's Day. I love to here that theme song, it lets you know sometin good's comin' up:The Rakes of Mallow---dumdum...dumdum... dumdum...duta.lata... dumdum...dumdum... dumdum...duta.lata... dumdum...dumdum... dumduuuuuum... duta.lata...dada.lata...dumdumdum</fullReview>

Never has celluloid been used for so noble a purpose as to put John Ford's Classic together with an assembly of such luminaries as John Wayne, Barry Fitzgerald, and the beautiful Maureen O'Hara!As Sean Thornton (John Wayne) finds his Irish roots, he stumbles across the town spinster Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara). He soon aims to swoon her when he employs Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald), the town busy body, and certified match maker. An uprorious dramatic climax peaks when Sean Thornton and Ms Danaher's brother Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) finally come to punches.Watch for some cameo's by Mr. Wayne's son &amp; daughter, as well as John Ford's brother.

		<shortDescription>Idealized, Wife Beating Boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This is the only Ford movie I loathe mainly for moral reasons. The Searchers I consider to be the best Western ever made. How Green Was My Valley a work of brilliance including both the benefits and costs of traditional society. We will get to the silly idealization on the level of The Sound Of Mucus. First, as someone who picked up the pieces from my father beating my mother into a mental hospital; forgive me if I do not share the comedy of,"Here is a stick to beat the young lady with." I am a conservative yet the depiction of inter gender relations is on the level of the movie Caveman. The abuse is portrayed as funny and light hearted. Well, sorry, it is not, nor does it belong in any movie. Sorry, I witnessed my mother being drug by her hair while screaming, as a child, we did not find it amusing, forgive us. The idealization of both women beating and the culture of Ireland are quite symmetrically retarded. Evidently, Irish people sit about pubs all day, break into songs for no apparent reason and adore people beating each other. I am only part Irish and the movie offended me. Does anyone believe Ireland barely resembles this level of psychotic fantasy. Marriage brokers, laws of dating from the 5th century? The courtship is eternal, boring and stupid. The clever trick Wayne plays on the gorilla would not have fooled a four year old Down's Syndrome child. The syrupy music, the glazed over camera, the emetic dialog coupled with a courtship that seems as likely as my dating Scarlet Johansson is nauseating. The movie is boring above all things; it really has very little plot to speak of. Wayne's pants are blazing for O Hara's skirt; is this the movie you were looking for? Yes, the many obstacles in Wayne's pants way: Gorilla brother with a pet midget, mores from the dark ages, horse racing, an irritating priest with an effeminate Protestant: the poor man, how I weeped for him. Look I am part Irish and it made me sick. Our country really isn't filled with rustic, drunken, fighting ignoramuses, trust me. If you considering watching the film, which I wouldn't, ask yourself if you adore romances with the probability of our visiting Neptune soon? Ireland is presented at the level of insane idealizing that you find in the Sound Of Mucus. Boring like you will not believe, featuring the world's worst depicted horse race, drunken, illiterate, fighting Neanderthals with dialog at the second grade level. Their entire universe has been distilled to drinking, fighting and F'ing. The entire movie is Wayne trying to win O' Hara with the help of this inebriated drunken midget with an indecipherable accent. Thrown in with the psychotic idealization: wife beating modeled as funny and entertaining= one overrated piece of steaming poop. Every great director is entitled to a sink bomb, this is John Ford's. This movie makes Cheyenne Autumn look like Citizen Kane. Boring, stupid, insulting, racist, sexist and retarded. I am a conservative what does that tell you? The most non PC person on earth, this makes Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom look broad minded towards Indians. Terrible maudlin crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Thornton (John Wayne) is a former Pittsburg steel worker. He goes back to his birthplace in Inisfree to buy back his Irish ancestral home. He falls in love with the fiery flaming red haired Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) at first sight. He tries to buy the property from the wealthy Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick) but she only relents when brash Red Danaher (Victor McLaglen) barges in demanding the property. Sean tries to court Mary Kate but her brother Red refuses. Some of the townfolks conspire to suggest to Red that Widow Tillane is interest in him if he gets his sister out of his home. Sean eventually marries Mary Kate but Red is embarrassed when Widow Tillane rebuffs him in public. He refuses to give up Mary Kate's dowry. Sean doesn't care but Mary Kate continues to demand it. Sean was a boxer who accidentally killed his opponent and vowed never to fight again. Mary Kate refuses to let go and becomes angry at Sean.This is a hilarious John Wayne rom-com. Deal with it! Admittedly, most of it is due to the great character created by Maureen O'Hara. She is one of the best characters ever. She is stubborn, combative and utterly love-struck girlie girl for John Wayne. John Ford extends a little from his western comfort zone but it's not actually that far from a western. Although few female characters are as compelling as Mary Kate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who doesn't love John Wayne? And Maureen O'Hara? Wow! Those two had chemistry and no mistake.Good friends in life they paired on screen better than most. Funny, sometimes silly, this movie still stands as great entertainment in the battle of the sexes.Although a bit thin in plot you quickly catch on that Sean Thornton is home to stay and the amusing wrangling to buy back the family home play out in the most satisfying set up for brother "Squire Danaher" to be at loggerheads with Sean as he attempts to woo his darlin' Mary Kate Danaher, sister of the Squire himself.The sparks do fly but all too quickly the story is told and we are left only to smile as the ups and downs are sorted out "in no time at all".Truly a classic worth watching time and again if you find yerself feelin blue and missing thoughts of days gone by in happier times when the sun is shining most lovely on fields that seem always green and the troubles at present be too much for 'ye.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently visited many of the shooting locations of my favourite movie, The Quiet Man, in the west of Ireland and published a travel feature with photos (I'm a travel journalist). My Quiet Man blog can be read at tomsweeneytravels. blogspot. com I stayed at Ashford Castle where John Ford, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara stayed during the shoot, which was a perfect base for touring the area and reliving the magical moments seen on screen. Even if you're not a huge fan of the movie, a visit to this beautiful part of the world could easily send you rushing out to buy the DVD. My blog article is both informative and my personal tribute to a movie I first saw 40 years ago and have been in love with ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ireland meets Hollywood in classic style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A slice of the old country, the little people and the blarney is very much enjoyed in The Quiet Man. It's essentially a western set in Western Ireland but has all the beautiful detail one expects in Ford films. The plot follows that of the classic John Ford western meets Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. Stranger comes to town. Falls for the sister of the town's most powerful man who is also a tough fighting man. Conflict arises between stranger and local tough guy. A further conflict occurs between feisty femme and the stranger. The inevitable showdown happens. And the good guy wins the fight and tames the woman's spirit and thus wins her heart. The plot may sound basic, but the beauty of this film is in great locations, fine performances and a cracking script with plenty of the Irish craic. It's the humour and undeniable charm that really carries the movie along and is only interrupted by several beautiful pools of romance in the middle of the knockabout comedy. Director Ford may only have had one eye and glasses but seemed to see much more than most with two eyes and 20-20 vision. It's his eye for the detail that make this movie especially memorable. Throughout the movie you feel like you are in the west of Ireland, almost one of the locals of Innisfree as you go inside the pub, the humble cottage, the church, the farmhouses and join the locals in the rolling greenery of the Irish countryside. The first confrontation between Sean Thornton (superbly played by John Wayne) and Red Will Danaher(equally good stuff from Victor McLaglan) has almost everything. The romance of the quaint Irish pub, the friendliness of the locals once Sean Thornton's identity has been revealed and the music starts - Wild Colonial Boy sung by none other than country and western singer Ken Curtis - Ford's real life son in law as the accordion playing Dermot Fahy. It hardly gets more Irish than this. Enter Red Will looking for fight. The punchy dialogue follows "I said good morning" Sean declares. "Yeah but it was good night you had in your mind" Red Will accuses Sean of making an ungentlemanly pass at his sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara). The tension mounts. Ford's real life brother Francis Ford plays an old man in the pub and is central to this early scene - acting almost like a referee in between the two hulks of Sean and Red Will. In the end religious intervention in the form of the unlikely but convincing Ward Bond's Fr Lonnigan prevents a full-blown fistfight. But it is only delaying the inevitable. The tone is set. Ford assembled his usual supporting team to deliver this genuine movie treat. Maureen O'Hara who plays Mary Kate Danaher is at her radiant feisty best and probably never looked more beautiful in a movie. Then there is Barry Fitzgerald whose character is part leprechaun, part barfly and as the movie progresses he pops up as a jack of all trades - taxi service, matchmaker, bookmaker and even furniture removal man. He steals many scenes with his cheeky charm and his presence certainly adds to the myth that leprechauns may exist. It's certainly one of Ford's finest and has an epic fight at the end, which is not brutal, but merely cartoon violence that Tarantino would be proud of. So with wild Irish humour, accordion and loud piano music, jaunty Irish pub songs, meaty confrontations, flames of red haired Irish folk and a big village to village fight, you might ask why this film is called The Quiet Man? Well here's the real conflict and the great irony of the title. Sean Thornton is a retired boxer and has returned to his hometown of Innisfree from Pittsburgh to enjoy "the quiet life". He gets anything but tranquillity and has to emerge from his conscience, morals and indeed motives, to fight for the right to have a quiet life and a beautiful wife (Maureen O'Hara) who is a shrew needing tamed as she prods her man to fight for her pride. The Quiet Man is a classic and one of Ford's standouts among his amazing canon of great work. He shows us a vibrant post revolution Ireland at it's finest. A movie that never tires through repeat viewings, this is must for the DVD collection and whenever you're feeling down it is a perfect pick me up, just insert disc, press play and let the great John Ford take you to the Emerald Isle and all it's wonderful wild romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favourite films, although it can be disparaged for it Paddy whackery here in Ireland. Not by any feat of the imagination could this ever be called a factual representation of Ireland in the 1920's but it is the directors love letter to the country of his birth. John Wayne as Sean Thornton is superb, his presence, his swagger and of course Maureen O Hara as fiery Mary Kate just radiates throughout this film. The music is fabulous from the de-de-de-de of the Rakes of Mallow to the way the crowd bursts into The Wild Colonial Boy with such harmony in the bar. John Wayne also utters one of my favourites quotes from a movie in this film "There'll be no locks and bolts between us Mary Kate except those in your own mercenary little heart"-pure poetry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There was a wild colonial boy?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford, for all his merits, was what my Irish comrades call a "plastic paddy", that is, a second or third generation immigrant who wraps themselves in the heritage and romanticism of the old country they never really knew. If you did a phrenology chart of Ford's head, there'd be a large green section labelled "Oirishness". It's something that can be either endearing or cringeworthy by turns. The Quiet Man is Ford's ultimate plastic paddy movie. Just this once, let's allow him to indulge himself.When Ford filmed How Green Was My Valley a decade earlier, California stood in for the Welsh hills. For the Quiet Man, nothing less than the real thing would do, and all exteriors were shot on location in Ireland. Ford's aim seems to have been to capture the beauty of the emerald isle on celluloid and bring back it to the audiences at home. But the way he reveals this beauty is tentative and gradual, and bares much similarity to the way he uses the wild plains in his Westerns. In the opening scenes, the green of Ireland is something glimpsed through windows and doorways, just out of reach. As John Wayne and Barry Fitzgerald set off, the space slowly opens out, each shot becoming more exquisite. Ford never allows the landscape to have total dominance, but cleverly makes us miss it by showing the interiors as cramped and gloomy, to build things up before hitting us with another outdoor eyeball-pleaser.Speaking of the green, this is Ford's first really excellent use of colour. It's been stated that every shot has something green in it, which is incorrect, although it may be true that there is something green on every set. In fact Ford is very careful in controlling the colours and sometimes makes use of the complete absence of that particular shade. For example, in the shot where we see Sean looking out towards the cottage where he was born, there is no green, which gives a contrast to the overwhelming greenness of the sight he views which we see in the opposing shot. In the scene at the Danaher residence where the labourers are sitting down to eat, everything is composed in blues and greys, with a single splash of green to be viewed through a window when the camera pans to the far end of the room.Ford was well known for his stock company of actors. For this picture he has milked that company for every Irish type it held. The funny thing is, Ford regulars Barry Fitzgerald, Mildred Natwick and Arthur Shields may be playing their ultimate stereotype roles, but they are all doing a fine job of it, especially Natwick who gives one of her best performances. Victor MacLaglen was in fact English of Scotch descent, but he could do the accent. The character of Squire Danaher suits him well, being a villainous and slightly more intelligent variation on the blustering buffoon he played in Ford's cavalry Westerns. If nothing else it is good to see him out of the pure comic relief parts and into a role of some substance. However there are two very special honourable mentions I must make. The first is for Jack MacGowran in one of his earliest appearances. Now his is truly a comic relief part that has no bearing on the plot. In fact he may not even have been scripted, given all he really does is hover round and come out with little utterances (sometimes just repeating someone else's line) that would seem odd on paper, but are charmingly funny in his delivery. If it weren't for the fact he only has a line or two here and there he would be a regular scene-stealer. The second honourable mention is for Francis Ford, the director's big brother, who appeared as a mute drunk in dozens of Ford pictures. Here, for once, he gets a few lines of dialogue, as well as a very tender portrayal. Given that the old man would be dead a year or so later, the younger Ford's reverential treatment of his sibling is particularly poignant.I must admit, it took me a long time to like the Quiet Man. Its twee oirishness is absolutely done to death, and its apparent misogyny is grating to say the least. However, if you look closely, there are actually some clever twists in the battle of the sexes going on here ? just look at Maureen O'Hara's expression (which the camera catches, but the Duke's character wouldn't see) after their reconciliation at the end. As to the Irish stereotyping, you have to not take it too seriously (as Ford surely did) and to accept it in its touching naivety. You have to allow yourself to briefly enter a world of blarney, porter and men cracking each other in the jaw without leaving a mark. Of course this is not Ireland. This is John Ford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only have I seen the movie, I own the movie and just returned from Cong, Ireland where the outside scenes were filmed. In my heart the beauty of the story and Ireland are the same. Timeless. The people there are so proud to this day 53 years later of the movie and the notoriety it has brought to their town. The train station is in Ballyglunin, the bridge in Connemara, and the town in county Galway. It is a wonderful place and so is the movie and the story it tells. The castle where the actors stayed is now a grand hotel. The pasture where Mary Kate was seen herding her sheep is now a fairway on a golf course belonging to the castle. The river is the same with salmon fishing an everyday sport.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in a small Irish village, John Wayne plays a Yank boxer originally raised in Ireland who returns home after vowing never to fight again; he falls for a fiery local lass while butting heads with her brutish, imperious brother who refuses to hand over his sister's dowry when the two decide to marry. A labor of love for director John Ford, who won an Oscar for his work while getting award-worthy performances from leads Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, both of whom are clearly impassioned by this boisterous romantic comedy. Thick with Irish humor, which some may tag as cornball, the movie is nevertheless touched by sweet romance, and features one of the sexiest kisses-in-the-rain ever! O'Hara's mercurial bride--at once angry, lusty, insistent and chaste--is one of the lovely actress's most unforgettable characters, but don't count out the Duke. Handsome and lean, with rousing temperament on demand, Wayne is at his most likable here, providing one of his top three classic performances. The cinematography by Winton C. Hoch and Archie Stout (also Oscar winners) alternates between location shooting and studio-sets for a sometimes jarring appearance, and the film's pacing and narrative occasionally hit a prickly burr, but otherwise this is a wonderfully hearty, old-fashioned entertainment. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My dear Dad (the late Clement J.Ryan) took me to see this great film at our local theatre in Chicago. It was the OGDEN THEATRE on 63rd street near Ashland Avenue.It's now 53 years later.The old OGDEN is long gone,but so many of the magical moments that it has supplied to us are still here.None is finer than THE QUIET MAN.To this day,I am reminded of the one flashback sequence and viewing it as a 6 year old. It's just that powerful.No matter how many times that we view it in our household, it continues to hold a spell over its audiences. And thanks to VHS and DVD, we can and do view it often during the year. It seems that every viewing is fresh and brings out a new appreciation of its cinematic craft. We are always catching lines from the different characters or their actions that we sort of missed before.The setting of the story is Ireland, of course, but it really does not limit itself to any particular years. In short, THE QUIET MAN is timeless! It will surely remain so as we move deeper into the 21st Century and beyond,into the New Millennium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Quiet Man (1952): Dir: John Ford / Cast: John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Victor McLaglen, Barry Fitzgerald, Ward Bond: John Wayne is presented as someone with a past where a boxing match concluded with a death. As a result he pulls away from violence and this poises an issue when he returns to Ireland to reclaim his family's farm. Maureen O'Hara plays a local woman whom Wayne falls for but her brother is an overbearing bully who is angry at him after being out bid in the land auction. He becomes a divider in the relationship to come. John Ford and John Wayne have collaborated through numerous films, including Stagecoach, but here Wayne has a seemingly different role as someone who regrets a violent past yet is unfairly taking hits from O'Hara and her brother. She marries Wayne but becomes obsessed with the money that is owed her by her brother. She constantly berates him until he finally takes charge in what becomes a very long haul. Great supporting roles particularly by Victor McLaglen as the brother who ends up being dealt with through a fist fight that derails the film from greatness. This fight turns the drama into a corny showcase that doesn't fit the mode of the first two acts. Ward Bond plays a Catholic Priest who also gets involved in the scheme at hand. In any event Ford delivers a message loud and clear of pride and standing up for oneself. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

He made his movies a family affair. His brother, the amazing Francis Ford plays the feisty old man who gets up from his dying bed to watch the 'big' fight. John Wayne had 4 of his children, you can see them all in one scene, look at and near the cart Mary-Kate is in at the race. And I believe even Maureen O'Hara's newborn daughter has a cameo, being carried of course. John Ford's movie family is combined here also, all of the top performers were regulars in Ford's movies.

A well-told story with a great cast, strong characters, and great humor. The men are men and the women are women. Each having their own strengths and flaws. Every character is a character. Visually, intellectually and morally The Quiet Man is a treat. It has none of the gratuitous garbage that more recent films are burdened with, and holds it's own all the more for the difference. The Quiet Man is infinitely suitable for family viewing and can be heartily recommended for the young. A great movie to share with the next generation, particular with the advent of large screen televisions and front projectors. This is a timeless story and will be enjoyed for ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply one of the most entertaining movies of all time. We always watch as a family around St Patrick's Day. Great director, great cast, great scenery. The troupe of actors Ford uses in many of his movies only add to the interest the film generates. The supporting characters are so independent of Wayne and contribute to the depth of the film. And it is such a unique film for John Wayne - not a western or war venue --- but a love story. The scenery from the countryside adds so much to the flavor of the story. And especially the race alongside the seashore.There are so many lines that are memorable and quotable. But, the true genius of Ford lies in the footage between the lines. The looks that O'Hara and Wayne exchange are classic.This is one of the few films that gets better with age.</fullReview>

The look they give each other when they get wrapped around the post at the train station tells the entire story of love challenged by tradition. I look for it every time I watch this film.The supporting cast is delightfully led by Barry Fitzgerald as the local tippling matchmaker. Bound to observe the proprieties of his office - his horse's propensity for drawing up short at the local pub is his greatest challenge.

		<fullReview>What a great movie, so Green, well acted, well cast, fun, rough and tumble, idealistic--one of the Duke's best roles, and ditto Maureen O'hara too! The fight at the end is terrific. Definately a must see, should have been high up on the AFI's top 100; why this didn't get ranked is beyond me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming film with lots of interesting supporting performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie needs no introduction from me, but this is to indicate that there will be spoilers ahead:I love this movie and it's probably my favorite John Wayne film. But even as good as his performance is, Maureen O'Hara's is even better. Both leads are frequently upstaged by the character actors John Ford populated this film with from start to finish. Arthur Shields as Reverend Playfair, Mildred Natwick as the widow Tillane, Ward Bond as Father Lonergan Sean McClory as Owen Glynn, Jack MacGowran as Feeney and many others give wonderful performances here. Barry Fitzgerald chews the scenery as the matchmaker and sometimes treasonist Michaleen Flynn and Victor MacLaglen got an Academy Award nomination for an overdone performance as Will Danaher, O'Hara's brother.Wayne plays a retired prizefighter sworn off fighting who's returned to his birthplace for peace and a well-earned obscurity because of what happened in his last fight. He successfully buys his birthplace and its surrounding farm from the widow, making an enemy of Danaher in the process. He slowly wins over the people of the village, starting with Flynn, the two clerics and the local IRA man Glynn.Then he sees O'Hara and is struck by her, deciding he wants to marry her. Thus begins the central plot of the film-the clash of Irish ways with Sean Thornton's more relaxed and open approach, comparatively speaking. Mary Kate's "fortune" (dowry) becomes a sticking point when Thornton couldn't care less whether she gets it or not.By a subterfuge, Danaher is convinced to give consent and the couple are married, buy Mary Kate considers Sean a coward because he won't fight for her dowry. The film climaxes with a chase at the railway and a monumental fight between Thornton and Danaher.This film is on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth getting. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boorish but Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American boxer returns to his birthplace in Ireland and finds the woman of his dreams but clashes with her hot-headed brother. Wayne is terrific as the genial American, displaying easy charm and good humor. O'Hara not only turns in a wonderful performance as a fiery red-head, but also looks stunningly beautiful, as does the Technicolor cinematography in general. It is hard to buy McLaglen and O'Hara as brother and sister, given the 34-year age difference. Ford won his fourth Oscar for this comedy and he is definitely in his element, although he goes a bit overboard with the Irish humor, with Fitzgerald rather annoying. And wife abuse is not funny. Otherwise, it's good fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental Oirishness that works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair, the tears can well up watching this. It has emotion in spades, a lyricism that is almost fairytale like, excellent straight performances,and it works if you settle back to enjoy a big Hollywood romance that was the norm before the romcommers got started. John Wayne shows depth and timing, while Maureen O'Hara demonstrates to the likes of Jennifer Aniston what real acting ability, great looks and star quality are all about. John Ford directs with a sure hand for overplaying the ridiculous oirishness (even the IRA drink in the same bar as retired English generals!) and the lush portrayal of a mostly sunny West Coast of Ireland (with plenty of songs like 'Wild Colonial Boy!'). But it does go over the top, and the cynics will lambast its far too obvious wearing of its heart on its sleeve and sometimes lack of subtlety. But it works, mostly, and does unintentionally show how backward rural Ireland was under De Valera - it could almost pass for 1916 in 'Ryan's Daughter.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Power of the wills of Romance AND that "Irish" temper ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one my favorite movies for many reasons. One being the lovely, ongoing (from movie to movie) struggle between two of the most heard headed Actors' or Actress' that click together romantically, and otherwise that I know of, this team of Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne! I look forward to any movie outing where i see them together, but this movie "The Quiet Man" is my favorite!I almost died with laughter when in a VERY romantic and old-fashioned style, Sean aka John Wayne throws the hot-heated, single-minded " I want me about Sean, and I if I don't have your man at all!" as she weeps.Tensions build and much plotting in this wonderful little village of Innis free, Ireland, until finally Ms O'Hara hops on a train to leave.Well with tiny town precision the message travels to Sean and he finally loses his temper (there is a subplot of two as to why he didn't) and he Grabs Her directly out of the train with the townspeople following, one precocious old lade applauding him and saying "Can I get ye a good stick for the lady sir?!" I almost died laughing, as Maureen was terribly unhappily and Very much was over his shoulder and pinned, kicking a screaming in a rather risqué moment or so for kiddies, as swats, though endearing certainly threatened! limo.This tiny little movie is more than just a slice of life, it is full of life. I adore the movie even when I thought at fist "The Duke" as an Irish son coming home to his ancestry was more than a stretch, but He made it work. Maureen O'Hara wins my heart as the best actor/actress in this movie though that is a tough call. The characterization within a real Irish setting are almost fanciful, but nor.I give this movie 5stars out of five! I have worn out one VHS, now onto Cd's-Hope you enjoy this action, romantic and character of a fine and wonderful film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fist-fights and blarney! What more can you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Well, then. Now. I'll begin at the beginnin'. A fine soft day in the spring, it was, when the train pulled into Castletown, three hours late as usual, and himself got off. He didn't have the look of an American tourist at all about him. Not a camera on him; what was worse, not even a fishin' rod." So begins "The Quiet Man", John Fords labour of love that turned a twee tale of Irish blarney into one of cinema's most passionate romances. When the Irish-American boxer Sean Thornton (John Wayne) kills an opponent in the ring, he returns home to the small rural village of his birth where he immediately purchases his old family cottage... An act that leads to him incurring the wrath of local squire Red Danaher (Victor McLagen). Their feud is escalated when Sean meets Danahers feisty, beautiful sister Mary-Kate (Maureen O'Hara) and they quickly embark upon a tempestuous romance. The assorted locals conspire in this courtship but the stubborn Danaher continues to block the road to happiness. With such flamboyant stock character actors as Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald and Mildred Natwick on typically barnstorming form, what Ford presents here is a loving, charming depiction of the whimsical rural Ireland of his imagination. An idealised homeland full of larger than life characters, strong women, hard-drinking men and innocent parochial religion and a place where and all disputes can be happily resolved with a fistfight. And boy what a fistfight! Words such as "lyrical" and "mythic" are often applied to the directors work and this was probably never more apparent than here. From the first sighting of Mary-Kate in the tree encircled glade through to the final secretive whisper between man and wife, there can be few films as brimming with undiluted joie de vivre as "The Quiet Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Ford's best by far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of John Wayne.It's not surprising, then, that I really liked this film when I first watched it.John Ford received the Best Director Award for this movie, and it's my opinion that John Wayne should have received Best Actor. But Gary Cooper got that award, I think. (For "High Noon", which I haven't seen.) **Spoilers ahead**"The Quiet Man" is a story about Sean Thorton, a retired boxer (Wayne) who goes to Ireland, his birthplace. In a boxing match in America, he accidentally killed his opponent. Disgraced and shocked, he swears off fighting for life. However, his bride's brother is the town bully. He unwisely picks a fight with Sean. His wife (Mareen O'Hara) wants him to stay away from her brother. Sean would do it, but her brother (Barry Fitzgerald) won't stay away from her.This is a comedy, and comedies are almost always worth watching.It is John Ford's best movie by far. So sit back, relax, and enjoy "The Quiet Man"!My Score: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Change of Pace From Ford &amp; Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something of a change of pace from John Ford and John Wayne, this is an enjoyable film that works well. Ford seems to have enjoyed filming in Ireland as much as he enjoyed filming in the wide open spaces of the American West, and the scenery and cinematography are very pleasing. The story is generally interesting, aside from a few slower stretches.John Wayne does well in his role, which gives him the chance to do some things he could not always do in his more familiar kinds of roles. Maureen O'Hara's role is pretty much the kind of role with which she was usually associated, and she is effective. Barry Fitzgerald adds quite a bit to his scenes, in one of his many fine character parts.The story combines some good lighter moments with a thoughtful look at Wayne's character and at the community in which he has made his new home. While never particularly deep, it takes a worthwhile look both at the cultural adjustments that Wayne's character must make and at the internal struggles that the character faces from his past and his present. "The Quiet Man" works well, and it has also held up well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Quiet Man", beautifully filmed in the green hills of Ireland, is definitely one of John Wayne's greatest movies. It gave him the chance to show his versatility as an actor. Here, he wasn't playing the cowboy or the war hero. He could be funny, charming, and romantic as Sean Thornton. I love the part when he first sees Mary Kate, played by Maureen O'Hara, coming out of church. As she goes to dip her finger in the holy water, he gathers some up in his hand, and offers it to her. It's really a great moment!Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne once again create cinema magic in this fantastic movie. It won a Best Director Oscar for John Ford, and rightly so! Everyone has seen the famous windy kiss scene, but you should definitely see the whole movie! It's a classic that is just as great today as it was in 1952. See it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corny but wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few films cornier that The Quiet Man. It is sentimental, hokey, unrealistic (even for the time), and paints a portrait of an Oireland which never existed except in the imaginations of dewy-eyed Americans of Irish ancestry. It tells a story of huge improbability, and features caricatures of performances from virtually everyone in it except for Wayne and O'Hara.So why do I love it so much? One - it looks simply gorgeous. The location work glows.Two - the climactic sequence where Wayne hauls O'Hara back to Mclaglen, the wonderful moment when she skips happily off home after closing the boiler door on the money, and the epic (and daft) fist fight.Three - O'Hara and, especially, Wayne, seldom better than he is here.Four - the love and sincerity in every frame completely overpowers the corniness.A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derided by many, more often than not by the so-called Irish 'intelligensia', for what they see to one of the worst cases of 'stage oirishism' ever committed to film, Ford's great masterpiece is perhaps the most misunderstood entertainment in the history of the cinema, loved beyond boundaries by devotees, (count me in), and hated by po-faced critics who prefer Ford's westerns.The Ireland in which it is set may or may not have existed, (certainly it's bizarre rural customs and rituals are well documented), though the Cong that I visited and 'Cohan's Bar', (now a souvenir shop), bear little resemblance to the almost mystical village of the film. Nevertheless, it has a timeless quality that transcends mere 'imagery' and an emotional pull that is overwhelming, (and not just for teary-eyed Irishmen like myself; just look at Spielberg's great homage to it in "ET").Essentially a re-working of "The Taming of the Shrew" in an Irish setting, it represented probably the best screen work of almost everyone involved, Ford included, (he won his fourth Oscar for it). Certainly Wayne was never more likable in a role while Maureen O Hara was positively transcendent. And again to devotees, the dialogue remains endlessly quotable; (it has one of the great scripts, a vast improvement on Maurice Walsh's source material). The performers are so comfortable in their roles there is a wonderful improvisatory feel to their lines, (Barry Fitzgerald's '... Homeric' or Jack MacGowran's 'Your in-laws are coming to visit you, Squire darlin' and has MacGowran ever come close to emulating his work here?).One for the desert island and repeated viewings and no mistake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"No pettifingers, if you please! The proprieties at all times"It's lines like that courtesy of Frank Nugent (from "Green Rushes" by Maurice Walsh), spoken throughout this wonderful film by among others, Michaleen Oge Flynn, the town's tippling matchmaker &amp; bookmaker as played by the whimsical Barry Fitzgerald that help make John Ford's homage to his Irish homeland, "The Quiet Man" (1952)such a delightful classic! It's that by-now well-known-yet-simple story of an American fighter (John Wayne as Sean "Trooper Thorn" Thornton) retiring across the sea to the village of his ancestors awash in magical, mythical sentimentality and Irish tradition that also helps mightily. It's the astonishingly beautiful Technicolor cinematography of Winton Hoch and second unit director Archie Stout, who two decades earlier filmed most of the Duke's earliest two-reelers for Lone Star Productions up around Lone Pine at the foot of the High Sierras, that help make the film what it is. It's the John Ford Stock Company: Ward Bond as the priest, Arthur Shoelds as the Protestant minister, Mildred Natwick as the richest widow in town, Ken Curtis as the local with the tenor of gold, and of course, Victor McLaglen as the antagonist, the brother-in-law performing roles they were born to play. The characters, down to the smallest role, all magically come to life.And finally, it's the chemistry of two marvelous Irish actors, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara that are the icing on this cake. Does the Ireland of "The Quiet Man" exist anywhere over there anymore? In my heart, I sure hope so. This is a "must see" moment of thoroughly entertaining cinema.</fullReview>

I also enjoy Ms. O'Hara in all the "swashbuckling" movies she starred in (i.e. The Spanish Main, The Black Swan and Sinbad the Sailor). Also amongst my list of favorite classic Christmas movies, I loooooove Miracle on 34th Street it's right up there with It's a Wonderful Life.

		<fullReview>I'm glad that John Wayne got a chance to do "The Quiet Man" during his career. It proved to everyone that he could actually act without having a six-gun and a horse. (Okay, he still has the horse, but it's still not a Western.)Set in an indistinct period in rural Ireland, this movie is what movie making is all about... it's entertaining, funny, moving, and it let's you experience something you would likely never see without the help of film.John Wayne plays "Trooper" Thorne, a retired American prize-fighter come home to the "wee humble cottage" where he was born. He's returned to escape the memories of the tragic event which made him quit the ring, and Wayne does it better than ever. Maureen O'Hara is absolutely perfect in her portrayal of the Irish "spinster" sister of the town's squire. The supporting cast is priceless, and if you never get a chance to see Barry Fitzgerald in any other movie, watch him in this one... he's the epitome of everything you could hope for in a fine Irish character actor, and gets more mileage from one dram of blarney than a regiment of lesser actors.I won't give away the story if you've been unfortunate enough to never see this absolute jewel of a film. For those who have seen it, you already understand. For those of you who have not, no words can tell you... you need to see it yourself. Just do it. Go out to the video rental and track down a copy in the Classics section. You'll never regret it.This is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time... a gem... a jewel... a priceless piece of art.</fullReview>

There known to "Mary Kate" Donerhan (Maureen O'Hara), while for it must combat local customs, including the payment of a dowry and the opposition of temperamental brother promised the bully "Red" Will (Victor McLaglen). The enmity between them and will make it difficult courtship.It was the fourth and final Oscar of John Ford. Movie filmed in Ireland, is based on the story brief "Green Rushes", of Maurice Walsh, published (1933) in the "Saturday Evening Post". Obtained seven nominations to the Oscar and won two , best director and best photography.The film is set in the 1933, which allows expose the ancient customs on relations between the young lovers, dependent on authorizations family, the figure imperative of companion-carbine and dowry of women. The submission of women respect from the father or, failing that, of big brother and after the husband is dealt with precision narrative and a dose of good sense scoffer and critical; make the character in a figure respectable and seductive.It should be noted scenes as that of the two players in the cemetery, the spectacular horse race on the beach, or when "Mary Kate" while driving a flock of sheep.The music includes a vibrant sheet music original Celtic sounds and romantic. Incorporates, in addition, popular songs as nice as "Turalye Anne", "Galway Bay" and "The Isle Of Innisfree". The photography takes advantage of the natural beauty of the countryside and the Irish coast, develops with mastery scenes of action and get a tribute to the single Irish people, their traditional customs.The script is drama, romance and comedy, in the just proportions to create a work balanced, serious and delicious, with moments of humor that cause the laughing. Excellent Interpretations of Wayne and O'Hara that match for the second time as protagonist couple. The film is a warm tribute to Ireland; exalt the values of tolerance, solidarity, friendship and sincerity. It is a song of life, love and friendship. Delicious and indispensable, it's one of my favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of Maureen O'Hara's first color films, back when the colors still looked a bit "runny," but to be honest, that is one of the things I love best about "The Quiet Man": it looks and feels like a moving painted picture. The plot is simple enough: Sean Thornton (John Wayne), a disgraced Irish-American boxer retires to the hometown he was born in back in Ireland years ago and falls in love with a pretty maid, Mary Kate Danaher (O'Hara), whose regionally powerful brother is at pain to consent to the marriage. In overcoming this conflict, Thornton must come to grips with his past to move on to his future.It's nothing particularly groundbreaking or meaningful, but it is well-played and well-executed. The movie, however, is entirely dependent on the ambiance: the Ireland it shows us is, to steal from the words of Srdja Trifkovic, "pre-modern, almost annoyingly so." The community life and of course community conspiracies, the porter in the bars, the spontaneous singing, the resolving of disputes through fighting without maiming, the modesty and beauty of the women, the veneer submission of women to their husbands when it is actually the former who wield all the strings... it's all here, and it's all done well.Apparently Ireland was, once upon a time, like that, and memories of that Ireland live on strong with Irish-Americans. Indeed, "The Quiet Man" was a refreshing piece to see after I had already visited Ireland and experienced first-hand what it has become. True, Ireland was not the idyllic place Irish-Americans want to believe or that John Ford depicted, but even this latter seems conscious of the reality, for commentators of Sean's and Mary Kate's new home remark that, "Every Irish cottage should look like this!"I wouldn't call "The Quiet Man" a romantic work, per se; it doesn't quite have that expat nostalgia that would be required for a romantic piece on the subject of an Irish-American emigrating to Ireland. "Stylized realism" is perhaps more appropriate for what this is. In the era of mass, multinational deracination, such ambient films are essential to keep on the shelf to remind us how to recognize real soil and properly control our growth.Let us look to something higher, now...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true classic in every sense of the word. Why did it take me so long to watch it? This has to be one of Ford's best films, and certainly his most romantic. John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara make a wonderful couple in this tale of an Irish-American boxer (Wayne) who, full of nostalgia for Ireland and wanting to forget his past in America (he has accidentally killed another fighter), travels to his homeland Ireland, the place of his dreams. There he meets fiery Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), a feisty, independent-minded, gorgeous and red headed "spinster". But Wayne finds himself at odds with the brother of his dream woman, and with the Irish customs. Love wins out in the end, and the film is an utter delight to watch. It is at once funny, warm, passionate, light-hearted, serious, nostalgic, sentimental, uplifting. And filmed in location in Ireland in exquisite Technicolour- the green hills are as inviting as O'Hara's red mane of hair is. It is a wonderful film, and I have just added it to my "Favourites" list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a cliché to say, about a movie especially, that "they don't make 'em like that anymore." But in the case of The Quiet Man, a gentle comedy drama from John Ford, they really don't. If it was made today, this romantic tale set in the luscious green countryside of Ireland would no doubt star some square-jawed pretty-boy as the male lead, with the role of the leading lady going to some vacuous up-and-comer hoping to make the transition from TV into film before fading into utter obscurity. Back in 1952 they got two of cinema's Golden Age powerhouses, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, who sizzle with chemistry, charisma and charm, combining to help create one of the finest films of its time.Something of a departure for Ford and Wayne, who were most famous for delivering tough horse operas in the Old West, the film was only made by Republic Picture on the promise that Ford make a western for them first to make up for question mark looming over the box-office appeal of The Quiet Man. He obliged and made Rio Grande (1950), before setting off for Ireland to make the passion project he purchased the movie rights to back in the 1930's. He brought Wayne with him too, but he would kill no injuns and saddle no horses (although he does get to briefly ride one) here, but instead play Sean Thornton, the 'quiet man' of the title - a dashing, friendly American who retreats to his birthplace of Ireland carrying a dark secret on his shoulders.Soon upon arriving, Sean is struck by the beauty of the temperamental Mary Kate Danaher (O'Hara), the sister of landowner Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLagen). When Sean quickly purchases the cottage in which he was born, he finds himself immediately at odds with the loud-mouthed and brutish Will, who has had his eyes on the land for years. Sean and Mary Kate are soon in love, but Will stubbornly refuses to consent to the marriage. Local drunk and matchmaker Michaleen (Barry Fitzgerald), sympathising with the two lovers, hatches a plan with the other locals to manipulate Will into thinking the marriage is in his best interests, and they are soon wed. But when Will uncovers the plot and tries to sabotage the marriage, Sean must face the demons of his past and confront the bullying tyrant.Winner of 2 Academy Awards and nominated for 5 more, The Quiet Man was a roaring success and is loved by many to this day, but was undoubtedly a massive gamble by Ford. People paid to see John Wayne punch bad guys and get the girl, but this was a film about a man who makes an active decision not to fight and, although he gets the girl early on, he struggles to keep a hold of her. Funnily enough, this is one of Wayne's best performances, a rare opportunity to see his warmer, gentler side, and his interaction with O'Hara, who is also terrific, is one of the movie's main strengths. The slow pace pays off at the end, climaxing with one of the best fist-fights in cinema. It's played mainly for laughs and no one draws blood, but the absurdity and the sheer length of it is a hoot. Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alas, Wayne finds his match, a virtuous leading lady who can both physically and characteristically challenge him in a Ford picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford swooped his historically fourth BEST DIRECTOR win for THE QUIET MAN in the Oscars, a record very much likely will never be matched, to say nothing of being surpassed. But it was his only win from a Ford-Wayne picture, THE SEARCHERS (1956) was wholesomely snubbed, but it is not a conventional Ford-Wayne picture either, its locale is deviant from their usual Western landscape.Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an Irish-born American from Pittsburgh, returns to his homeland, a backwater town called Inisfree (a fictional place) in the 1920s, he reclaims his family land from widow Sarah Tillane (Natwick) and falls for an ardent ginger Mary-Kate Danaher (O'Hara), after locking horns with her eldest brother Squire Will Danaher (McLaglen), a loutish heavy who also sets his eyes on Thornton's farm, and according to the provincial tradition, Mary-Kate cannot marry without Squire's consent.With a little conspiracy from Sean's new local friends - yes, Sean is the new apple of the eye for this jerkwater town, who can easily gain trust and favour from denizens over the unwelcome Squire himself. - including the matchmaker Michaeleen Flynn (Fitzgerald), reverend Cyril Playfair's (Shields) and his wife (Crowe), who fabricate a quid pro quo to inveigle Squire to marry Mary-Kate to Sean, so himself in return could marry Ms. Tillane, and the plan works (for the first half), Sean and Mary-Kate ties the knot, but an unknowing Ms. Tillane refuses to take Squire for the team, after a bout of ruckus, Squire holds back Mary-Kate's dowry, which according to Sean's noble confession, doesn't mean anything to him, what he loves is her, not her fortune, but talking about different values, for Mary-Kate, her dowry is not just money, it is her own reputation at stake, that's something worth her husband to fight for, but Sean seems to be unmotivated.Sean's past in USA has been carefully veiled in the narrative, only his burly figure and the occasional attention from reverend Playfair, who is a fervent sport fan, knowingly suggest his vocation, a former prizefighter, who has sworn to abnegate boxing after accidentally knocking off an opponent during a match. Now, coerced by an obdurate Mary-Kate, Sean has to use his fists to earn back her respect and prove that he is not a coward, even though in his mind, it is plumb purposeless, but the point is, that's what husbands must do to defend his womenfolk, so a long- delayed close-range brawl between Sean and Squire arrives ebulliently with on-lookers betting their money on who is the last man standing.THE QUIET MAN adheres to the conventional criteria of a patriarchal society under the microcosm of Inisfree, machismo reeks of booze, smoke, gambles and sweat after a fist fight, even Mary-Kate, a perfect specimen of a fine lady, blindly hamstrings her pride in the shibboleth, which leaves the picture a smack outmoded in the eyes of a new viewer six decades later.Visually expansive, thanks to the sublime topography of the Irish countryside (in the sunny days only) and John Ford's discerning sense of aesthetics, THE QUIET MAN also elicits a more layered performance from John Wayne, not merely a macho bigot bogged in his own intransigence, he can also be a rose-loving, violence-relinquishing pacifist, paired with a strikingly zealous Ms. O'Hara, who is so ambidextrous both indoor and outdoor, whether she is playing harpsichord or playing rough against Wayne. Slas, Wayne finds his match, a virtuous leading lady who can both physically and characteristically challenge him in a Ford picture.Victor McLaglen, who is visibly too old to play big brother of O'Hara (34 years of her senior), is the only member in the cast rewarded with an Oscar nomination, but in retrospect, he chews the scenery a bit little. Yet, it is Barry Fitzgerald who almost single-handedly holds intact the film's comedic vibe as the booze-dependent Flynn, with gusto and impeccable foibles, and in truth, THE QUIET MAN aims to be a bubbly ethnographic study sending a more liberal message - there is no reason why Catholicism and Protestantism cannot co-exist harmoniously under the same roof, maybe not all roads can lead to Rome, but at least there are several of them can. A final nod to Victor Young's majestic score, utterly pertinent to accompany a jolly journey in that bygone era and faraway place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had John Wayne made more movies like "The Quiet Man" he might be viewed in an entirely different light today. Starring in a ton of Westerns and war films it's easy to get stereotyped as the guy who wins every battle he engages in without breaking a sweat. This picture moves Wayne out of his comfort zone and portrays him as a dashing ladies man, and the lady in question, Maureen O'Hara seemed like the ideal foil for Wayne's character Sean Thornton.Director John Ford owned this property for more than a decade but had a tough time attaining financing to film it until Herbert Yates at Republic Pictures delivered in a quid pro quo. Ford would have to produce a successful black and white Western with Wayne and O'Hara first, and when "Rio Grande" made a pile of money, Ford could insist on filming this picture on location and in color. The result not only produced one of Republic's highest grossing pictures, but it also earned a Best Director for the veteran Ford.I enjoyed the understated humor throughout the picture, particularly with the character of Michaleen Oge Flynn portrayed by Barry Fitzgerald. He had that great line about 'playing patty fingers with the holy water' and fairly bristled at the idea that America had a period of Prohibition. That his horse Napoleon automatically stopped at the door of Pat Cohan's pub was a very clever gimmick.Ward Bond was a surprise here, he's a trip as the parish priest Father Lonergan on a ten year mission to land the big one down at the fishing creek. Another Ford regular, Victor McLaglen also shows considerable range as the feisty brother of O'Hara's Mary Kate. I've generally seen him in more one dimensional roles, so his performance here garnered a well deserved Supporting Actor nomination.The film probably has a tough time finding support among modern day viewers considering it's subject matter and the way the main characters treat each other. I think the viewer ought to hold those thoughts to one side and consider the story from the vantage point of the era and the customs and mores of different cultures. Set among the sunny and vibrant colors of the Irish countryside, "The Quiet Man" is a genuine treat that movie fans can appreciate for it's fine acting and colorful characters coming to grips with the conflicts they seek to overcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It snuck up on me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend recommended this movie to me this week. I find the movie sort of snuck up on me... 50 minutes in I wasn't that into it, I found it cute but a bit meandering... but it was immersing me into a way of life and seeing the world... until I began to really understand these characters intimately and care about them, for good and bad, warts and all... So many great moments, I love when the man says "saddle his horse he says!" and starts humming the music to come in the very next scene... I saw another movie do that not long ago, but can't remember what it is, no matter, then Maureen jumps a little obstacle course on the way back home ;) Or during the fight at the end when the bucket just keeps getting bigger and bigger throughout the course of the fight until they look like they're fighting in a flood. Maureen O'hara truly is the best thing about this movie, her power as an actress was undeniable. John Wayne is more looks than great acting ability. What an extraordinarily brilliant film.</fullReview>

This collaboration started in 1951 with Rio Grande, and followed by this film, Wings of Eagles, McClintock, and Big Jake. These two made the perfect couple.The film was shot in Ireland for all the exterior shots.

		<shortDescription>Not such a quiet man or quiet performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally award such high praise, but this is the Duke at his finest. The Quiet Man is one of those fantastic movies that you have to watch every time it comes on TV. Duke is at his best in this movie and looks the part of the young boxer he plays with an iron jaw and rugged good looks. Maureen O'Hara, his love interest, is also at her best in this offering. She's a wonderful looking Irish red head who plays the hot tempered sister of local squire and land baron, Will Danaher, very convincingly. Danaher is played by the inimitable Victor McLaglen, a thespian seldom accorded the credit he deserves. Duke's character is Sean Thornton, an Irish American prize fighter who accidentally killed a man in the ring and retired from boxing. He moved to his family's old neighborhood in Ireland to escape the memory of the accident. Eventually he marries Mary Kate Danaher, Maureen O'Hara's character and the two settle into married life. Unfortunately, Squire Danaher does not pay the anticipated dowry to Thornton and, as a result, Mary Kate is absolutely humiliated. Sean chooses to ignore the insult rather than get into a physical battle with Danaher. His wife sees this refusal as cowardice (Sean won't tell anyone of the dead boxer in his past) and does not react in a loving and wifely way to her new spouse. To keep her, Sean approaches Will Danaher and demand payment of the dowry. A fight ensues between Danaher and Thornton and it no doubt qualifies as one of the finest and also longest battle sequences in film history, with the entire town, including resident and visiting clergy attending the spectacle. The film ends on a positive note with Sean, Mary Kate and Danaher having dinner together. John Wayne (The Duke) is an American icon. We won't see his likes again. Looking about, I don't see another actor with the stage presence and body of work to which Duke lays claim. I've watched him from his early work in Stagecoach all the way through to his final movies and believe that he is a uniquely American icon. He had to wait virtually all of the way through a fantastic career before he finally won a long overdue best actor Oscar. I don't think we'll ever get over this man. He represented the very best qualities that we expect of American heroes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of COURSE it's about violence - just be sure to get the whole message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say that this film "promotes wife-beating" is beyond preposterous. The worst thing John Wayne does to Maureen O'Hara is to give her a largely symbolic and clearly harmless 'boot in the backside' - something which by that point in the film her character has richly earned. This is no more violent nor misogynistic than, say, the opening scene in The Philadelphia Story. Or scenes in many, many other films that show men and women roughhousing with each other, essentially by mutual consent.Furthermore, to see this film as *promoting* violence, against women or anyone else, is to miss it's main point, by a country mile. This is a film about exactly that peculiar cultural norm, in which violence becomes sublimated into traditions of friendship and caring. It's a film that suggests how our violent natures and our violent past are evolving.Even the title should make this obvious. John Wayne's character is so appalled by violence that he's run as far away from it as he can, to what he views as a garden of Eden. But the seeds of violence remain in his nature, and in those around him. What makes the Ireland of this film an Eden indeed is how the culture has turned malicious violence into a formality, a sort of stylized ritual of friendship.One could say that this is a criticism of Ireland, and perhaps an unwarranted one. Of course, it's not. It could not be more obvious that Ford is using a mythic Ireland to make a point about all of human culture in the mid-20th Century. He suggests that perhaps we are violent animals, but that denying our nature isn't the right answer. He suggests that a healthy culture uses tradition to formalize conflict and allow it to play out in a benign and even creative way.Wayne at first fails to understand that this ritualized 'violence' is not the real thing. That it conveys love, not malice. That it's a peculiar but lively tradition, which acts as a conduit for the relationships of both men and women.Whether all this takes place in anything resembling the 'real' Ireland is obviously irrelevant. This Ireland of Ford's fond remembering is as real as Hilton and Capra's Shangri-La. It's a heaven that we all seek. In a way, Ford's Ireland is an answer to Hilton's. Ford asserts that a paradise that depends on humans acting like angels is unrealistic. We need a paradise where we can acknowledge our darker side, and turn it into a positive thing.Does Ford succeed in making that point? That's another question... But I would say that he does, brilliantly. The Quiet Man is a love story, a story of deep friendship - between the two supposed antagonists, Wayne and McLaglen, who are clearly destined to be devoted friends. Moreover, The Quiet Man is a brilliant evocation of every human's personal quest for a separate peace, a place where they can be themselves, only better.The Quiet Man is one of the greatest masterpieces of film, always in my own top five. It's also one of the most enjoyable, uplifting films of all time. If you emerged from it with any other feeling than joy, you brought that feeling in with you, and simply refused to let go of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I will admit that this is not the greatest film ever made, I would argue that it's one of the most entertaining. This, combined with lovely acting, nice directing from John Ford, a great script and fine location shooting make this a film you must see. On top of that, the film crosses several genres--with some fine romance, a bit of comedy and a lot of escapism.The film begins with an American (John Wayne) wandering into a small Irish town. It seems that his family was originally from there and he wants to settle there. However, from the very start, an obnoxious brute (Victor McLaglen) stands in his way to buy some property and then things heat up when Wayne begins dating McLaglen's sister (Maureen O'Hara). However, this version of John Wayne doesn't just slug McLaglen--he hates violence and is hiding a secret. What's next? See the film.Perhaps the best thing about the film is the wonderful cast of supporting characters--one of the best in Hollywood history. You have Barry Fitzgerald, Arthur Shields (Fiztgerald's real-life brother), Midred Natwick, Ward Bond and many others to provide color and a touch of the Old Country. It's thoroughly charming and sweet throughout--see this film. It's near perfection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Irish 'Western'....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With both the Duke, and Maureen O'Hara as his intended love interest plus John Ford returning to the land of his ancestors and directing in Technicolour, this has many ingredients of a decent Western. Whilst this isn't my favourite film to be filmed in - and about Ireland - David Lean's 'Ryan's Daughter' is, The Quiet Man remains one of the most loved, across all generations.With everything centred around the pub, the colourful characters and fights over women, this is has yet more Western ingredients. Winner of two Oscars (Ford as director and cinematography) plus two venerable and charismatic actors providing much of the irascible blarney - veteran Ford regular Victor McLaglen, though always playing Irish is actually from Kent, England and Barry Fitzgerald as the matchmaking tippler.If you've holidayed in Ireland, as I have, then that's a nice bonus as it brings back memories and, in for instance, the horse racing scene on the beach, the vast empty sands are a far cry to my jam-packed nearby beaches on the south coast. The scenery in this isn't always sunny and glossy - it's often a bit glum, with rain - this isn't a picture postcard from the Emerald Isle, but a rich slice of Irish life.John Wayne is measured and sedate as ex boxer Sean Thornton, who has some demons to conquer when he's continually goaded into a fight. Once he gets over them, the fisticuffs at the end are brilliantly - and amusingly staged and well worth waiting for. Maureen O'Hara is as radiant as ever and, dare I say it, the Duke actually looks comfortable as her suitor.My DVD copy (part of a 3 DVD set, with Rooster Cogburn and Stagecoach) is rather poor quality with a magenta fringe at times and rather a soft definition. I can't say whether transfer's differ for different releases. This does spoil one's enjoyment a bit but the strength of the film easily shines through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charm makes it work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne goes to Ireland, gets a look at Maureen O'Hara and quite understandably decides he's gotta have her. Unfortunately the peculiar 1930s Irish mating rituals make his pursuit of the young lass oh so very complicated. You can't just blow into town and sweep a girl off her feet. There are rules and procedures to be followed. And should he ultimately succeed in making this woman his wife? Well, again there will be more peculiar 1930s Irish customs to get in the way of the happily ever afters. But heck, it's Maureen O'Hara, she's worth the trouble.To appreciate and understand The Quiet Man one has to realize that this is a story set in a very specific place and time. The place is one of the best things the movie has going for it as director John Ford brilliantly captures the breathtaking Irish scenery. The film looks absolutely spectacular. But where the place works the time is a bit more problematic. The customs of the 1930s period in which the story unfolds are so antiquated, and often so bizarre, that there's a bit of an uneasy feeling for the modern viewer. Often the story just does not seem believable. But in that particular time in that particular place that's the way things were. Once you accept that you can embrace the story which certainly has its charms.For once John Wayne gets to play somebody other than, well, John Wayne. His character of Sean Thornton, an American returning to his Irish birthplace, is in many ways so different from the part Wayne typically played. John Wayne, the hopeless romantic? Well, maybe not to that extreme but it's certainly a departure for Duke. But there's still some John Wayne in Sean Thornton. Sean's tough and rugged and strong-minded. And in Mary Kate Danaher he meets his match. This is a woman who can give as good as she gets. Of course the fact that the character is played by Maureen O'Hara who is as talented as she is beautiful certainly helps. She can stand toe to toe with John Wayne and the relationship between their two characters is fascinating to watch. It's a relationship of fits and starts with obstacles constantly being thrown up in Sean and Mary Kate's way. The biggest obstacle coming in the personage of Mary Kate's brother Will who, in the 1930s Irish way, can stop this union dead in its tracks if he wants to. And he most definitely wants to do just that. That is the conflict which largely drives the movie forward. But if the relationship between our would-be lovers is one of fits and starts so often is the movie itself. There are times when it struggles to maintain its momentum, times when the old-fashioned story is a little too old-timey for its own good. But it's charming throughout, right up to the big climax which sadly is a bit of a letdown. The movie deserved a better ending than the final confrontation which goes on so long that it all becomes a bit silly. For whatever disappointments there may be though there is enough here to make you look back on the film fondly. Wayne and O'Hara are terrific, and ably supported by a fine cast around them. The story has its flaws but it holds your attention throughout. And the film is shot so beautifully. The only thing more breathtaking than the Irish countryside may well be the Irish woman who stars in this memorable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Ford's 1952 film classic, "The Quiet Man", speaks out as his directorial thank-you to his Irish background. Perhaps, the film could not be made today, because of its downplay of the place women hold in society, but be that as it may, it is a film classic, and meant to be enjoyed on days when one wishes to sit back nd take in the laid-back lifestyle of another land.John Wayne uses a good amount of acting talent to play the role of Sean Thorton, an Irish born native son who went to America, became a professional boxer, and during a bout, killed his opponent in the ring. This cloud hangs over him, he leaves America, and returns to his native town, Innisfree, where he vows to never fight in anger again.In his home town, he meets up with Mary Kate Dannaher, played by Maureen O'Hara. These two had an undeniable screen chemistry, and it certainly came out in this picture. Wayne wishes to marry Mary Kate, but he has riled her brother, Big Will Dannaher, played by Ford stalwart, Victor McLaglen, who refuses to permit such a union. In Ireland, the oldest brother, if there was no father, could take this action.Eventually, thanks to the efforts of the local matchmaker, played by Barry Fitzgerald, and the local priest, played by Ward Bond, Sean and Mary Kate are able to marry, but Will refuses to hand over her dowry, Sean refuses to fight for the dowry, and the Irish landscape begins to boil over.Eventually, matters do come to a head, or fist, between Sean and Dannaher, in a wild, woolly, brawl that starts in an open field on the Dannaher property, goes over the countryside, spills into the nearby town, and in typical Irish manner, ends up in a local pub. The final punches are thrown, and peace ultimately comes to White O'Mornin', the birth home of Sean.If one wishes to enjoy a film dedicated to the Irish, this classic is it. A good 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Irish taming of the shrew</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful movie, though not the typical western of actor John Wayne or director John Ford. Rather it's sort of an Irish rendition of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, as others have also noted. Here we have the idyllic green Irish countryside, lovely Irish brogues, traditional Irish melodies, an engaging story, a touching romance, and some very compelling characters. This film delightfully blends comedy, romance, and drama...all three.The tale revolves around a former prizefighter, Sean Thornton, who has retired from boxing after accidentally killing a man in the ring. He was born in Innisfree but moved to America as a toddler. Upon returning to Ireland to buy the cottage where he was born and hopefully find peace, he glimpses a beautiful woman herding sheep in a meadow. He soon falls in love with this fiery Irish lass, Mary Kate Danaher, the town spinster and younger sister of the village bully, Squire 'Red' Will Danaher. Sean and Mary Kate marry, though against the wishes of Kate's older brother who wanted Sean's land for himself. When Will refuses to provide her dowry, Mary Kate insists that her husband fight her brother, forcing him to bestow what is rightfully theirs. Sean refuses because of his past boxing experiences, causing wild havoc in his marriage with this feisty spitfire. Mary Kate wants Sean to fight for her and that's all there is to it. Of course she is unaware of his past traumatic experience in the ring and simply believes her husband is a coward. No spoilers here as to whether Sean agrees to fight in order to gain his wife's respect. Suffice it to say that meanwhile, the townsfolk are all spoiling to see a brawl between Sean and his new brother-in-law. This is surely one of John Wayne's most sympathetic and endearing roles, here playing Sean Thornton, the ex boxer with the troubled past. The Irish born Maureen O'Hara is perfectly cast as the barefoot Mary Kate, a spunky lass with a fierce determination of her own. Their courtship on screen is sensuous, a sight to behold with its legendary windy kiss scene. Yes indeed, John Wayne is a a man who knows how to kiss a woman!In my opinion, complaints about spousal mistreatment in this movie are a bit of nonsense. Remember that when a villager offers Sean a stick to beat his wife, he throws it away even though he is livid with her at the time. It's the wife who gets her way here! Sean has his work cut out dealing with this spirited, strong willed lady who insists that her husband adapt to her culture, not the other way around. This is really quite a whimsical, entertaining, and uplifting gem, a true classic. I heartily agree with another's comment that it would make great St. Patrick's Day viewing. Surely this is Ireland at its most Irish.</fullReview>

I have noticed that John Ford is very meticulous when it comes to location for all of his pictures. John Ford also loved to carry the same ensemble cast to various projects (Wayne and Bond).

		<shortDescription>My favorite film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers. This is such an old movie I figured it wouldn't matter too much. Read this after you've seen the movie for an avid fan's view of it.The Quiet Man is my favorite film because two major themes are the role of a woman in a traditional society and dealing with anger constructively.Mary Kate Danaher is not quite what we've come to think of as a "traditional" woman. She is fiery, not passive or submissive although she clearly understands her role as a woman and lives within it. She knows who she is and what she wants and resists being pushed around as much as she can within the limits that have sustained her culture for centuries. The dowry is the key to her role in society. It's a tradition that gives her dignity. Mary Kate delivers my favorite feminist speech in a film when she comes home after the wedding. The most memorable line in the speech for me is "Without my things about me, I'm still a servant dreaming amongst the things that aren't my own." Without the dowry she's been handed over from one man to another with nothing of her own, so she feels like a prostitute. Makes sense to me.The other theme, anger management, explains Sean Thornton's refusal to fight for the dowry. He believes he can't fight without being mad enough to kill. To keep his wife he has to find a way to get her dowry without fighting and possibly killing her brother. He finally figures it out. Play the Irish game. Call the brother-in-law's bluff. "It's your custom. No dowry, no marriage." he says to her brother. After the brother grudging hands over the dowry Sean _and_ Mary Kate burn it in front of the brother-in-law and the whole community. They all know it was never really about furniture or money. When there's no more reason to be angry the two men slug it out just to see who's the better fighter. And its a great fight scene. The fight scene alone is worth watching the movie.Technical aspects of the film are also wonderful in my opinion. I especially love the rich, beautiful technicolor images of Maureen O'Hara in Ireland. The role of Sean Thornton seems made for John Wayne. (It probably was.) But its what the film says to me that keeps me watching it over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree completely with the above reviewer's comments. But one of the other things that I enjoy watching is the new world versus old world conflict between Wayne's and O'Hara's characters. It's interesting to see that what he considers to be provincial and unimportant, she regards as part of the bedrock of her life. If I said anymore I'd give it away. It's one of the few films that I never tire of seeing. And it's not just Wayne and O'Hara, either. There are stellar performances from all the rest of the cast, too. The one that tickles me the most is by the one who plays the matchmaker. He also plays the lead role in "Darby O'Gill and the Little People" (a Disney film). Movie producers just don't seem to be able to assemble as solid a cast today as was for "The Quiet Man". Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the greatest of all American films,great cast and great cinematography.John Wayne was never better.John Ford,the director,apparently made this movie as a tribute to his ancestors.It is both a comedy, and a drama. It is also a love story. Perhaps even more than these, it is a character study.The year that it was made,1952,The Greatest Show On Earth won the academy award for best picture. This is probably the greatest injustice in the history of these awards.It is a very sentimental story,and it is an extremely beautiful movie visually.Fine performances from all the cast.It also contains what is usually regarded as the greatest fight scene in the history of movies. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Thornton, played by John Wayne, returns from America to claim his homestead in Ireland. He finds his bride in Mary Kate played by Maureen O'Hara, but is hampered by her brother, Victor McGlaglen who tries to keep them apart. This is a poignant beautiful story with lots of gay Irish songs sung by Barry Fitzgerald and company in fine voice. I had never seen this before and glad I did because it is a wonderful production directed by the illustrious John Ford. To some people it might seem too long, but the story and the photography is gorgeous. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This charming film is not only a feast for the eyes, but quite possibly John Ford and John Wayne's best collaboration.Filmed primarily in the lush green Irish countryside, this Technicolor masterpiece is a symbol of post-World War II Hollywood at its best. It may also have some deeper symbolism ? more on that, later!(CONTAINS SPOILERS)In one of his better performances, John Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an Irish-American, who returns to his childhood (and ancestral) home in a small Irish village. He falls in love with and marries a beautiful, but fiery-tempered redhead, Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), with the aid of town bookie and busybody Michaeleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald), who doubles as the traditional Irish `matchmaker.' The antagonist is Mary Kate's stubborn brother, Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), who has taken to having his henchmen call him `Squire Danaher.'The story is a familiar one: After winning Mary Kate's hand, the Americanized Thornton fails to understand the importance of his bride's dowry, which her brother refuses to give. A former heavyweight boxing contender, he had left the ring in horror after accidentally killing an opponent. He had vowed never to fight anyone again. Because of this vow, he allows the arrogant Will to taunt and bully him, not realizing that his bride is being equally humiliated. Finally realizing the situation, Thornton rides to the train station, reclaims his wife and drags her unceremoniously (through actual sheep dung, we are told in Leonard Maltin's trailer about the making of the film) back to her brothers' farm, to demand the money. Sean and Will square off in a rowdy fist fight that has the entire town watching and placing bets.The Quiet Man is an absolute joy to watch. Of course the Technicolor brilliance, under the hands of the master Ford and his Technicolor wizard Winton C. Hoch, captures the brilliance of the Irish countryside and O'Hara's untamed red-headed sex-appeal. The accents themselves add to the charm. One finds oneself thinking with an Irish brogue for hours afterward.Yet the real beauty of The Quiet Man is its combination of innocence and sex-appeal-or perhaps that should be phrased `innocence and romantic tension.' While the film's genteel innocence today makes it seem a bit precocious, we must remember that it was pushing the envelope just a tad for 1952. Ohio viewers, in fact, didn't get to see the brief but classic scene of Flynn shaking his head and muttering as he notices the broken wedding bed ? not knowing, of course, that it was broken by Sean angrily flinging Mary Kate onto it, rather than by the means he no doubt imagined. The bed, in fact, came into play more than once. When the huge bed was being delivered, Mary Kate and one of her younger brothers looked on. The brother remarked `Is that a bed or a fairground?' then added to his sisters' embarrassment, `A man would have to be quite a sprinter to catch his wife in that bed!'Wayne and O'Hara have wonderful chemistry. One of Wayne's children remarked (in the Maltin trailer) that his father was an actor who came off the screen, larger than life, and that O'Hara was one actress who could match him. Tough, hot-tempered and determined, yet inwardly fragile, she captures the complex Mary Kate as she battles warring emotions and tries to break through the cultural wall that threatens to permanently mar the new marriage. She also shows some real athleticism in the film.The writing and the cast are outstanding. Fitzgerald was already probably the best known Irish-American actor and he definitely delivers again as the busybody drunk, Flynn. His tipsy attempts to retain the dignity and decorum of the matchmaker while interceeding with Mary Kate, on Sean's behalf, is endearing.McLaglen, meanwhile, is the perfect spoil. A big, loud, rude, well-to-do farmer, he has had his own way in the small village too long to stand by and watch Sean Thornton march in and buy his ancestral home from the neighboring Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick). The fight scene is a classic.The various townspeople and saloon patrons give the picture a very authentic Irish feel. So do the two clergymen, Father Peter Longergan (Ward Bond), who doubles as the narrator, and the Protestant vicar, Reverend Playfair (Arthur Shields) and his devoted wife (Eileen Crowe). The Catholic priests' leadership in organizing a cheering crowd for the vicar, while his superior (whom he fears may transfer him) is visiting is a charming touch.At least I considered it merely a charming end to the film until a thought hit me. This WAS Ireland! This brings home another big question ? was Ford, whose blood went back to the Emerald Aisle, making any political/religious statements in the film? Throughout the story, the home rule crowd is depicted by Flynn and his younger saloon friends, as good-hearted drunks who provide neither danger to the crown, nor hope to its foes. Later, the Irish Republican Army is even mentioned, and even then, in somewhat good humor.Perhaps the ending gives a clue, though. Father Longergan not only leads the cheering for his Protestant rival, but momentarily hides his collar as the vicar and his superior ride past. Perhaps Ford, indeed, is suggesting that Ireland could be at peace ? or at least, that the political strife could be separated from religious differences, if all parties would swallow their pride (cover their collar) and lend a hand to those on the other side. Of course, this may be reading too much into Ford's work.Political meaning or not, The Quiet Man is one for the ages. This is probably my favorite John Wayne film and one of my all-time favorites. I cannot recommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Quiet Man, a movie centered in County Cork, Ireland is an older romance movie that took many twists and turns. Sean Thornton, the main character, moved to Ireland from Pittsburg, PA after killing a man. He then fell in love with his neighbor, Mary-Kate Danaher. Her brother, Red Will Danaher forbid the relationship because he wasn't fond of Sean because he out bid him for his land.I give this movie a 4 out of 5 star review because it was always exciting and it was just a great movie. There was adventure, romance,and it always kept you wondering what was going to happen next. So Does the guy get the girl? You'll have to see it to find out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more could one want? A to-die-for cast, fantastic scenery, a rich story abounding in romance and conflict, a superb script, generous doses of comedy, a great score, and topnotch directing. This should make anyone's 'desert island' list. It's a movie that stands up to repeated viewings, appearing richer each time. The cast must have had a ball making this movie. I wait with bated breath for this to be released in letterbox format on videocassette. My favorite moment: the conflicted tenderness of Sean and Kate's evening reunion after Sean has been told by Rev. Playfair that he must fight, and Kate, has been told by Father Lonergan that she must submit to her husband. It's a poignant moment with little dialogue, made powerful by O'Hara's and Wayne's acting skills. The fight scene is indeed a corker. They just don't make them like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wayne's best non-western movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, it mayn't be to everyone's tastes, it is quite leisurely and the picture-book view of Ireland may seem a bit rose-tinted and dated, but to me I love The Quiet Man and consider it John Wayne's best non-western movie. Wayne himself is splendid in his role, I don't think it is his best role but it is up there. In terms of acting, it isn't just Wayne who's good. Maureen O'Hara is both fiery and radiant while Barry Fitzgerald is just fantastic as the mischievous matchmaker who can't say no to a drink. The film also looks beautiful, not just the breathtaking scenery but the cosy cinematography does justice too. There's also a lovely lilting score from Victor Young, a good story, a well-above-average script and even better John Ford's wonderful direction. Overall, just wonderful, maybe not for all but it has certainly made a fan out of me. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a "silly Irish story", but a very well-told story all the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, the Emerald Isle, what bright wonders it can sometimes bestow, such as stories like the Quiet Man. It's a small wonder, a personal one from John Ford, and it's sometimes too schmaltzy and too goofy and too brawny for its own good. But this doesn't stop one from thoroughly enjoying the film, its actors, the as-a-given lush and vibrant and serene Irish landscapes, and how deftly Ford mixes comedy and tragedy and romance into a fine mixture. You may also need at least a little Irish in you to have an appreciation for it, if not an emotional attachment, with all of its "characters" that are sometimes blatant stereotypes (albeit joyful ones that are akin to the Taming of the Shrew premise and, as such, Shakespearean in vulgarity and lust-for-life). I know my 1/4 just got by barely in this lot.Ford starts simple and keeps it simple till the end, but there are strands and plot points that enrich the material: John Wayne is an ex-boxer who, unbeknownst to all except one priest, is back in Inishfree, his hometown and home to seven generations of Thorntons, to set up a little cottage and live peacefully, only to fall head over heels (in that Quiet way of course) for Maureen O'Hara's Mary-Kate and marry her, against the wishes of stubborn lummox/brother Red Danaher (Victor McLaglen, about as big and beefy and amazing as one could have in one 1/2-dimensional part). The bulk of the picture is about the fractured relationship between Mary Kate and Thornton, and how she can't completely be with him unless she can get the dowry from her brother which he's withholding... and Thornton can't bare to do if it means another murderous fight like in the states.The film has incredible color cinematography (albeit it's hard to always tell from the lack of a really well-transfered DVD print), the mood is often about as lively as the booze or just fiery and quirky personalities will allow, and the stars look handsome and beautiful in good measure. Sometimes Wayne can come off a little stiff or just plain overrated in certain performances, but this among other Ford performances act as a showcase for his unlikely appeal as a male lead (if only to me, not to many). O'Hara here also gives such a good performance, so spot-on moving between the Shrewish joy and self-righteous anger of Mary-Kate, it almost makes one forget how incorrigible her character can get; her beauty may also be a factor in this too, but it's mostly her timing, both comic and dramatic, that do it right. Ditto for Barry Fitzgerald who is a perfect old codger driving the cart and acting as an unofficial observer, along with Father Lonergan.Somehow the Quiet Man should be way too silly and crazy and something only out of Irish folk tales to fully work, like that final climactic bout where literally everyone in a ten-mile radius comes to see the fight between Thornton and brother Danaher go all over town and into the bar (as the coda to the fight, too, when the two men genially arrive back at the cottage drunk as hell and singing songs). But Ford surprised me with the film's classy and occasionally breathtaking film-making, the fun in the unlikely and obvious romance and and 'courtship', and its star power. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece akin to Searchers or Grapes of Wrath, but it's probably a breezier time to have than those on a nice weekend afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's because it wasn't a Western or a War film. In the day, that's all that was available to watch and that's what the public wanted. A western to take them out of their war-torn lives and war films to promote patriotism.To me, it was refreshing to see something else with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. They are a great screen couple that complimented each other.It's a wonderful tale of a man that goes to Ireland to start his life all over again after an awful boxing bout that brought the death of a man that he liked.He didn't expect to fall in love with an Irish girl but he did and what a time he had dealing with her brother. Will Danaher felt threatened because Sean Thornton was just as tall and as big as he was. Will thought that Sean was going to replace him as the "best man" of Inis Free. Sean Thornton was a peaceful man by nature but did what he had to do to survive at a young age. He had no intention of doing anything but living a peaceful life in the home he was born in.This film was light hearted and comical and dramatic in its own right. I've first taped the film from AMC Channel commercials and all but now I own the DVD. I will never part with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impetuous! Homeric!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been one of my favorite movies for many years. First saw it with my family. My father was so taken with it that we went to see it several times in first and second run theaters as well as drive-ins(remember them?). I can remember that during the scene where Michaeleen sees the broken bed the whole audience was laughing so hard that nobody could hear the line. When I saw it on TV many years later I was amazed at the "Impetuous! Homeric!" when I would have sworn it was "Holy Mother Of God!" I guess that wouldn't have gotten by the censors in 1952. How times have changed, and not necessarily for the better. I know that modern viewers probably are upset by the sexist treatment of women that goes on in the plot but even in 1952 we were not that bad. I think the plot was probably set in the early 1920's and not 1952. That isn't an apology but just an observation by an old fan of John Wayne and Ireland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not a lot of John Wayne fans in the world today, and that is a crying shame. It is my belief that if the nay-sayers of the world would give this film an honest viewing it would quickly change their minds. In this film Wayne plays not the angry cowboy who is quick with his iron, but instead plays a quiet retired man trying to make a peaceful life for himself in his mothers county in Ireland.This film shows the brilliance, of not only Wayne in choosing roles that could show his versatility, but also John Ford and his choices for location, colour, actors and story and how he weaves them together in a film that is sweeping in both its scope and its emotional grounds. I highly recommend this film to those who are fans of John Wayne and Ireland, or those that are discovering them for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Ford's masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A former boxer (John Wayne) returns to his birthplace in the genteel Irish village of Inisfree in John Ford's paean to his Irish heritage. Filmed in lush Technicolor, Ford's compositions are as redoubtable here as they were in How Green Was My Valley, which used a colliery as the point-of-focus in myriad long, deep-focus shots. Wayne is Sean Thornton, an expatriate American with uncertain difficulty in his past. He falls for Maureen O'Hara, and their courtship yields some of the most sensuous moments I've seen on film: Taking refuge from the rain in a graveyard, with their shirts soaked through, their embraces feel tactile and combustible 50 years later. It's a seductive affair that seems to belong as much to the young lovers as to Ford himself, his generous telling and detailing of people and events inviting us to fall in love, fully immersed temporally and spatially. I think more than anything else, this is what Ford seems to desire in his mise-en-scene and preference for long shots that surround his characters in inviting settings. He is a born storyteller, fascinated by the people who compose an ethnography, in their ways of relating to and coping with their chosen lives. The film also contains a satisfying collection of supporting characters who retain defining quirks and specific agencies. It all adds up to a highly idealized tribute to the resiliency and self-sufficiency of the Irish people, who live in pastoral bliss, where jails are obsolete because all grievances can be worked out with a good donnybrook. Its resonant message, that fighting for what one desires or believes in can redeem even the most hopeless of cases, is direct, sound, and refreshingly rewarding of virtuous intentions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally uplifting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few, if any harsh words can be put to describe The Quiet Man, one of the very best films John Wayne and John Ford ever made despite it not being set in Monument Valley. Instead, we are whisked away to the lush, green setting of Innisfree, Ireland and we find beautiful scenery as well as colorful and creative characters. Among them are Maureen O'Hara as the fiery, tempestuous Mary-Kate, Barry Fitzgerald as the matchmaker Flynn, and Ward Bond as the upright Father Lonergann.One of the many elements that make this a timeless and utterly enjoyable film is the fact that Ford includes many more issues than just a romance, which of course is the main focus here but not all. We also get much information on differences between cultures and how it is important to understand that one cannot come from one culture and force his way through another. We also see the sheer innocence of a small Irish town that has little to do but take care of their own land. These people paint their house, grow crops, raise cattle and sheep, go to mass every day, and otherwise take it easy. This is the good life.Among these great actors, Wayne gives the best performance perhaps because it is so anti-John Wayne. He isn't so macho and intimidating as he usually is. He has a dark side and secrets and hopes to forget it all when he leaves America. O'Hara is wonderful here, standing toe-to-toe with Wayne in every scene. Yet we feel genuine love between them. I also have to mention Victor McLaglen, one of Ford's Stock Company actors who won an Oscar in 1936 with Ford in The Informer and here is the stubborn but ultimately likable brother of O'Hara who tries to keep them apart then ends up in a fight. By the way, that fight lasts about 7 or 8 minutes and it is funny and joyful all the way. This could be considered a perfect film. Bad things happen but you just know these people will get through them. After all, they have all the time in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in the late sixties, I was already a big fan of John Wayne's westerns. I stumbled upon this gem during a snowstorm, sitting by the fire, on a Saturday afternoon. Still the best way to watch a movie at home. The film is pretty light-hearted without being too foolish and silly. You get to see the beautiful Irish countryside and a slower pace of life. I want to fish that stream where Father Lonergan was! The film slowly works up to its climax, the confrontation between Squire Danaher and Sean Thorton. The fight scene is pretty tame by today's standards but it was filmed in 1952. May not be everyone's taste, but if you like John Ford films, the Duke, or old movies, it may be worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific sense of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cross-cultural misunderstandings get examined in this movie known for its big ending. But forget the ending, and forget the Irish stereotypes... If you're a student of human behavior, the movie is full of little bits of business that are charming and amusing, and which allow viewers to recognize real life on the screen. The strong, silent man who refuses to raise his hand in violence is a trope that Hollywood can't get enough of... and I'm no John Wayne fan. But this movie (as opposed to the westerns) convinces me he could act. He's very appealing, embodying a forgiving, easy-going ruggedness. "Quiet Man" is neither the usual Ford sentiment, or a lesser Wayne vehicle. Barry Fitzgerald is fondly remembered for his very funny lines here (their delivery is so distinct and vivid) but he has some visual nonsense that's just as comic. I could turn down the volume and he'd still make me laugh. Victor McLaglen is also perfect as the brutish heavy. Every time I see this I find new things to chuckle over. It's very well-directed. One of the tenderest of love scenes in any movie is when John Wayne troops home after a blow-up and abandonment by O'Hara in town. Instead of the blow-up we expect, both characters choose to de-escalate; she wordlessly lights his cigarette and sits in his lap; both of them knowing that words get them into trouble. As they sit staring into the fire, in a chair that doesn't accommodate them too well, he pulls her arm around him. It's one of the loveliest, most enduring images of love I can think of in the movies. There are half a dozen detentes in the movie that are as affecting. The story is subtle and charming, an extremely well-written comic romance. Is is authentic to Ireland? Beats me... but it couldn't be truer to the long tradition of American humor if Mark Twain wrote it. I'm glad I own a copy of this despite the horrid color transfer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love and local traditions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Thornton, an American prizefighter, Irish-born, who accidentally killed an opponent, went back home to free his mind, and buy his family property in Ireland. On his trip to home, he met a girl, Mary Kate Danaher, and they both fall in love. Mary Kate's brother, Squire "Red" Will Danaher, opposed Sean decisions to buy the propriety and refused to marry him to Mary Kate. Using strategies, Sean finally buys back the family propriety and ends up marrying Mary Kate with no dowry. Ignorant of the local traditions, Sean did not want to fight for the dowry, but his wife forced to do so. The film's theme can be seen as the importance of local traditions, the place that money and influence have in Ireland. Sean used his money to get back the propriety at a price higher than the value of it. Red took advantage of his local influence to refuse to give the dowry. To get back the dowry, Sean had to fight him and accomplish what is seen a merit by the society. Like in John Ford's film, THE GRAPES of WRATH, this one too shows the power of money and local rules. In "The Grapes of Wrath", families are sent out of their proprieties for defaulting on payment; that's the law. The great lesson I've taken from the film is that we should learn local rules and traditions if we want to become inclusive in the new society we live in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" . . . if he ever lives that long," Victor McLaglen's "Red Will" says of John Wayne's "Sean Thornton" early on in John Ford's THE QUIET MAN. Few truer words were ever said, and they could apply to pretty much all the American cast and crew with whom McLaglen was hanging out. Though the UNHOLY THREE is the title of a Silent Classic, it's hard to think of a more apt umbrella to cover QUIET director Ford, star Wayne, and narrator Ward Bond. Few Americans have hurt more of their fellow citizens with Racist and Anti-Semitic outbursts. One of these men was involved with the mendacious Silent BIRTH OF A NATION. Another was on the Racists-Will-Rise-Again GONE WITH THE WIND payroll. The third led the Kill-the-Jews (often literally, as with John Garfield) Hollywood Witch Hunts immediately after World War Two (while enlisting the help of the first two for his pogrom). Eva Braun found out that History judged her by the company she kept. Watching THE QUIET MAN, one is torn between pity and contempt for its female lead, Maureen O'Hara. Of course, Bobby Darin sang that Mack the Knife could be as charming as he needed to be. But when you frolic and splash around in a blood-filled swimming pool, your judgment is open to question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very best of John Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to believe this film is the very best that John Wayne did in his long career. John Wayne was not an actor, and as a rule when he went outside the box of playing himself in film he usually got into trouble. ("The Barbarian and the Geisha," "The Conqueror" as examples." But this film put him in a better light than all of the war films and all of the westerns. And the pairing with Maurene O' Hara was fated, just like Gable and Lumbard, or Tracy and Hepburn. This pair was to go on and make a number of films together including his other gem "McClintock." Add to the outstanding cast with Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, Mildred Natwick and Victor Maclaghlan among others and the feature soars. To top it all off is the beautiful Irish countryside. (And yes, if you look on a map of Ireland you will find Innisfree in the northwest corner of the country. I can't say enough about this piste. Thumbs up, all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The color seems to "Pop" out. So it almost looks loud. I think it is too stereotypical. My Grandparents came over "On the boat" and they spoke the same way, so maybe not. The John Wayne movie, "Mc Clintock" seems like a similar movie in a Western motif. My Mrs. just loves the march back from the train. She's not supposed to, but a deeper side of women may be revealed. Regardless, this is a "Saint Patrick's Day" mainstay. I did not know that this movie was filmed in County Mayo, "God Help Us" as my relatives come from that very same place. The insider jokes are many. The Irish humor throughout shows that the writers really did their homework. The joke about the train running on time is at first confusing then way too simple until I realized it is just the Irish in me. I also dislike the Faux Irish that is seen in some other movies and such. I am still offended by the "Irish Spring" soap commercials. Not because of the name or anything like that, but the idea that they should have at least hired an Irishman to be the Irishman. The greatest export of Ireland is, Irishmen. In fact in the deep Amazon rain Forrest, they just uncovered a whole tribe of 'em! So, "The Quiet Man" having an American returning to his roots and without the brogue, is appropriate. It is almost always a good use of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen this film all the way through, only clips of it in film documentaries, but one afternoon TCM was playing it and I wasn't feeling well, so I snuggled into bed and said to myself: "I am going to sit through this whole movie this time and see what I think." I was glad I did. Never been a big John Wayne fan, but I DID enjoy this film. I was slow to warm to it at first but after the first half hour found myself smiling and laughing at some of the action and dialogue. Maureen O'Hara was a delight and beautiful as always, and John's character was more than one-dimensional, a problem that I find in many of his other films. Perhaps the passion he held for the film project contributed to his fine performance as the American who comes to Ireland to escape his tragic boxing past. I enjoyed all the side characters too and found it pretty realistic of small town life in Ireland, not stereotypical at all. One thing I would like to mention is that I enjoyed the musical soundtrack and the Irish folk songs I heard in the film. I wish someone who knows more about this type of music than I do would list the titles on the IMD someday. I definitely recommend this charming film classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is about an American who returns to his Irish ancestral homeland and buys his ancestral home for far more than it was worth. This happens to annoy a local man who wanted the land, and said man is more annoyed when the American falls in love with his sister, and she with him. The problem is presumably resolved when the American marries the sister, while the brother expects to marry the young widow who owned the land-but the widow refuses to marry the man, and the offended brother refuses to pay the promised dowry to his sister. The American tries to convince his new bride that the dowry is unimportant, but she is adamant as a matter of principle. Either he must fight his brother-in-law, or face contempt from both the townspeople and his wife.Yet there is one problem-the American turns out to be a former boxer who accidentally killed an opponent, and who in fact went to Ireland in the first place to leave this past behind him. Now instead of the happy quiet existence he hoped to have, he is forced to consider doing what he hoped never to do again. What to do? The answer is all too predictable, and admittedly the story has an overly happy Hollywood ending. But still the performers excel (even John Wayne, whom I don't usually like), and one sees what it is like to face an unwanted moral dilemma.</fullReview>

I had to do it by myself with my wife because she was busy elsewhere, which was no trouble because we even know the dialogs by heart. It was very exciting to find the places where some memorable scenes were shot: the "sleeping bag" episode, the bicycle escape from the match maker, the Cohan Bar, the church...It is one of my favorite movies.

		<fullReview>This is by far, the best John Wayne movie ever made. This movie showcases Wayne as an actor, not just an icon in a cowboy hat. The Quiet Man is the movie he should have won the Oscar for, not True Grit. He has tremendous presence in this film, not to mention a great supporting cast. Barry Fitzgerald, Maureen O'Hara, (the under-appreciated) Victor McLaughlan, and a cast of bit players make all watchers feel as if they are in the little town of Innisfree. John Ford uses the picturesque setting of Ireland to its fullest beauty and allows his characters to look at home. The Quiet Man is an Oscar worthy movie because of its writing, directing and cast that acts as if it was family.</fullReview>

To this day I still watch it almost every St. Pattricks day as a tradition. It makes me realize that John Wayne was an actor with a lot more skill and depth than most gave him credit for.

		<fullReview>An excellent John Ford Film set in Ireland. Sean Thorton (John Wayne) returns from America to his native town and is immediately taken by the feisty Irish lass, Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara). I knew I was going to like this movie from the opening scene when Sean gets off the train and asks for directions. A nice blend of comedy, drama, and romance...and the beautiful Irish countryside. Of course there is a bit of conflict between Sean and her brother which prohibits her from following her heart due to strict courting rules. The town match-maker helps to fix things up though...at least temporarily. Unfortunately Sean doesn't want to fight the brother due to a bad experience he had in the boxing ring. But of course it turns out he is willing to fight for one thing, the respect of his wife. This is the enjoyable, wholesome kind of movie that they don't seem to make anymore today.***1/2 (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is doubtful that the Idyllic Ireland represented in John Fords tribute to the homeland ever did exist but that in no way detracts from a glorious film. Great character performances from the likes of Barry Fitzgerald and Victor McLaglen complement the two leads and it is possible to watch this film and actually believe that John Wayne can act.There are themes here if you want to find them; sexual frustration, Old world versus the new but this is best viewed as simply a good story wonderfully shot and performed. If nothing else you should view this film for the best fist fight in cinema history lasting nearly 15 minutes of screen time and covering about two miles of beautifully photographed Irish countryside. One word of warning though. This film is probably best avoided by sensitive feminists.</fullReview>

'Birth of a Nation'? Lighten up! It's a semi-comedy about life in Ireland before World War ll. It's not supposed to reflect on life anywhere today. Values were different back when this movie was first proposed, so It couldn't possibly not be dated. The movie is a great romp through a peaceful town full of stereotypical characters shaken up by the arrival of an expatriate from America and stars some of the best actors of the period, all from John Ford's private troup. (It seems John Ford had all Irish character actors in his stable) Same characters, different names. If you didn't like 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' you won't like this movie. Finally, The movie is just fun. Not to be taken seriously, and not to be taken for more than it is: good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My, my, what can I say? As an American of Irish descent, I'm very weak for this movie. Whilst I understand that many may not appreciate this fine film (particularly women), many of us feel the tug towards home. I can't explain why Maureen O'Hara holds my libido in her palms, but she certainly does (although it helps that when I wrote her in '87, asking for an autographed picture, she graciously obliged me). Combine that with my love of John Wayne films, and my affection for John Ford's directorial skills, and I've got a movie that rates "classic" on all fronts.This is a movie that current-day American women can hate with gusto. But in old, "mythical" Ireland, this was the way things were. I try to be a liberal male, but I must admit, I'm weak for the circumstances depicted in this film (sorry, Sis). Mary Kate controls Sean and he never even knows it. This is not a film which depicts male power, but woman's intelligence. She OWNS that relationship. Let a woman try hitting a man in Saudi Arabia, even today, and she'll be killed or tossed onto the street for "religious police" to beat. In old Ireland, Sean just says, "You've got a wallop." Total respect for women... Yup, that's the way it should be.It can't be done better. One of the finest movies ever made, IMHO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is this film a wonderful display of cinematography and acting clout, it also brings to the screen a great story--what movie-making is all about. John Ford wasn't concerned with demographics, box office sales, or action figure revenues. He just wanted to tell some really good stories. And The Quiet Man does just that. With the on-screen chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara, the farcical comedy of Barry Fitzgerald and the breathtaking landscape on which they are filmed, Ford (who received an Oscar for Best Director for this project) draws you into his world of hard-work, good times and tremendous passion. Ireland has seldom been captured in such a beautiful or accurate way since and (seeing as it was the first American film to be shot in Ireland) displays a world that few have been privvy to see before.</fullReview>

Maureen and John give the movie romance that one won't forget. I liked this film. Seeing them fall in love, but also see the strength in the character that John Wayne displayed to hold on to Maureen a very strong willed girl. At times you will find yourself laughing as the tempers flare and none willing to give up their position for the other. Enjoy this Irish tale. It is wonderfully entertaining</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Italian father introduced me to "The Quiet Man" in the 1950's and I've been a fan ever since. It was the first movie I owned on VHS. It's a beautifully entertaining (and beautifully filmed) picture that has a sub plot to please everyone: romance, comedy, drama, and one of the best fight scenes of all time. It sits at the top of my 10 best list, just above "Citizen Kane."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Epic, Homeric": a cinematic comic poem by Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles ( Who Ford almost cast in the Spencer Tracy role in The Last Hurrah), got it right when he called John Ford " a comedian and a poet".All of Fords great films- with the noteworthy exception of The Informer- have comic undercurrents, even at their most tragic.However, his most overtly comic film, ( other than The Whole Towns Talking,which this reviewer knows only by reputation)is The Quiet Man. In some ways, this astonishingly beautiful, humane film stands as Ford's Chef de Ouvre.It is deeply misunderstood by those critics who decry its "unrealistic" picture of Ireland. Such criticism is misleading, and not simply because the fantastic elements of the films plot. In fact, the film conceals sharp ironies beneath its pastoral, romantic, surface. Yes, Ford does celebrate his pre-industrial Irish community-its rituals, celebrations, and lore. At the same time, he is fully aware of the human costs and limitations of the community he celebrates.Religious, economic, and sexual conflict simmers beneath the surface.In fact, the whole film centers on a complex problem of economic and sexual exchange-The Dowry. In addition, Waynes "quiet man" is a tormented, alienated figure, trying to recover his identity as a human being by returning to his native home.The conflicts however, are resolved comically, rather than tragically.The climactic fight between Wayne and McLaglen is one of the greatest scenes in all of world cinema, superbly shot and edited,and interspersed with comic vignettes( the bet between the two Protestant clergymen, the retired Colonel calmly reading his newspaper as the battle swirls around him, the Priest reading to the dying man, not from the Christian scriptures, but from an Irish pagan epic.)In short, this film is superb. Ford deserved his Oscar, and John Wayne surely should have been nominated for one,as well as the magnificent Maureen O'Hara.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This masterpiece is one of my all time favorites. It tells the story of Sean Thornton (John Wayne), "a quiet peace loving man come home from America", and the woman he falls in love with (Maureen O'Hara). The chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara is always magical, but is at its best here. The supporting cast, Barry Fitzgerald, Ward Bond, and Victor McLaglen, is one of the best I have ever seen. It represents some of John Ford's best work, and this is the movie for which John Wayne should have won his oscar. Beyond a doubt, this is his best performance. This movie is a must for anyone who loves movies, or is a John Wayne fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful and Authentic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I got to reply to some of the posters here who have stated they dislike John Wayne. Yea, I agree he was no Marlon Brando or William Holden and he never shed a tear(that I recall) but he was a real man. He never appeared to be acting, but merely being himself. That was the appeal of him. He never claimed nor acted like he was different from you or me. Not all caught up with being an enigma like James Dean or marlon Brando..just a regular guy who usually played the part of a man called upon to be courageous and brave. Now on to this gem of film! Too many great scenes and lines to write 'em all down! And the Michelinni character..the little guy who drives the buggy and gave JW the lift from the train station..he was a hoot! Irish folklore is among the richest and most interesting in this world. And finally, one can not understate the authentic and angelic beauty of Maureen O'Hara. She radiates such beauty and romance with her eyes alone that todays actresses can take off ALL their clothes and hardly come close to what she could with a mere glance! Simplistic? Today's world much to complex and sophisticated to ever put out a movie like this? I don't think it so much as sophistication as it that our minds have been dulled and polluted with seeing everything that was once held sacred. Kids today know more about sex at 10 y.o. than we did before we were 21! It is sad that a movie like this would not appeal to the youth of today because no one gets naked or there are no cuss words! Pity! Pity!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A retired American boxer (John Wayne) returns to the village where he was born in Ireland, where he finds love.Who can say anything bad about director John Ford? Or actor John Wayne? Surely not I. Though, there is some strange thing about Wayne's complete lack of accent. Sure, he spent his life in America, so that ought to explain it. But it is pretty funny to say he was born in Ireland and has absolutely nothing Irish in his voice to show for it.The story itself is generally good and it is fun to revisit these old classics. Of course movies today (2015) are bigger, but not always necessarily better. The old films bring us a sense of escapism that just no longer exists... bless them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a March 16, 19985 article in the "Irish Echo", Maureen O'Hara confirms that the film was indeed a 'family affair' and condition that the trilogy (or at least "Rio Grande") was a requisite in being allowed to do this film. It's well-known that John Wayne's kids had bit parts in the film. The guy on the deathbed was John Ford's elder brother. Maureen's brother Charlie played th IRA man an the other brother Jimmy played the young priest. Barry Fitzgerald's brother played the part of the vicar. Film is an 'institution'. I'm told that some Irish were offended that the film made them appear to be 'simple', but most that I'm acquainted with seem to be endeared to the film. I never knew of the Ken Curtis connection. Feel I know the script in and out, but still immensely enjoy watching the film anytime I can. A MUST SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Using stars to make an art film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has already pretty much said everything that could be said about this movie. The Leonard Maltin featurette on the DVD was also a great summary of what went into making this film. What strikes me as interesting about The Quiet Man is that it's an art film starring John Wayne (along with several other stars usually seen in popular films). I give most of the credit for pulling this off to Ford's inspired direction. To be able to take the most typecast Western actor and believably turn him into a washed up ex-pat boxer was a major feat.It brings to mind Fernandel, who churned out mediocre comedies at about the same pace as John Wayne churned out westerns. At the time The Quiet Man was being made, Fernandel was chewing up the scenery as Don Camillo the temperamental priest. But he had played key roles in several of Pagnol's classic films in the 30's and 40's, and occasionally played well later on, under directors such as Verneuil and Autant Lara. You wonder whether Wayne could have done a few more top notch films if he had spent more time out of the saddle - roles more like what Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster were playing at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Ford's best, but maybe worth watching all the same.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If you count to three you won't hear the man count to ten!"The story concerns Sean Thornton (John Wayne), a American boxer who returns to his birthplace; Insree in Ireland, to find peace and quiet, the very thing he doesn't find, as all the locals seem to treat his arrival as an event, even the station workers as he gets off the train. Within minutes everyone in the town knows who he is, including Will Danahar (Victor McLaglen), the boorish brother of a woman named Mary Kate, who he quickly takes a fancy to after seeing her run through a field. But Will doesn't like him and soon all sorts of hijinks ensue as he at first refuses his request to marry her, then keeps her fortune. I'm not where to start with this one. Very average, not very good at all, but with enough entertainment to stop me from calling it bad. As usual John Ford is a good storyteller, and the film is very picturesque. I wouldn't call the photography beautiful, more quaint and pretty. Seeing as the film is filled with the very hit-and-miss comic relief characteristic of John Ford films I'm just going to consider it a straight comedy. The comedy is old fashioned, and sometimes it's quite funny, and sometimes not, as in a scene in which a matchmaker repeatedly mispronounces the name Sean Thornton as "Thon Shornton." Get it. Because he's drunk. My real problem with the film comes from the unconvincing romance between Sean and Mary Kate. Maureen O'Hara is very good in places, as is Wayne, but Sean's behaviour seems to imply that he wants to get her in bed more than anything. He also seems to enjoy shoving her around as he pleases, and in one scene pushes her to the ground multiple times and kicks her in the butt. The film has a large cast of characters, most of whom appear in a scene for some comic relief, then disappear, then appear later, like in a cartoon. And that's another problem with the film for me; overkill, especially near the end. There are too many cartoonish Irish drunkards and the like, showing up for a scene to say a funny line then disappearing, and the main characters aren't well developed enough for me to really care about them. There's a promising and well done scene of Sean having a flashback to a boxing match that showed promise of making me care about the character, but that's quickly brushed aside for more hijinks.So I didn't dislike the film, but it didn't do anything for me either, and there's only so much I can take of crowds of loud, drunk Irishmen cheering and having antics, to a repetitive and annoying jig.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would Quentin do?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me by my relatives. And there is much to recommend it: Maureen O ' Hara's brother writing down people's names if they did something he did not like (is this an older version of kicking someone's butt and taking their name?); the courting rituals were great - takes me back to a time before even me - made me even more aware of our hedonistic society where people are mating like dogs in heat - 75% of their children out of wedlock; John Wayne trying to take control of his wedding night &amp; failing; and John Wayne dragging Maureen O' Hara home for miles (he'd be in jail today for that kind of treatment.)But the fight scene is the classic moment - John &amp; the brother fought seemingly from Innisfree to Dublin! This fell short of Rowdy Roddy Piper and Keith David in They LIve, but it was humorous - still not bad for 1952. I was wondering why I missed this film - but then I was only 4 years old &amp; my parents would not have let me see such violence - well, actually they would have.I guess my enduring thought as I watched this classic was: What would Quentin have done with this picture? Sorry for the sacrilege, Auntie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quiet Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recognised an iconic spinning and kissing featured and spoofed in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, so for that I am glad I watched this romantic comedy drama from Oscar winning and Golden Globe nominated John Ford (My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance). Basically Sean Thornton (John Wayne) is the disgraced boxer who has returned from America to his homeland of Ireland to escape his past. He catches the eye of beautiful, poor maiden Mary Kate Danaher (Miracle on 34th Street's Maureen O'Hara), and younger sister of nasty Squire 'Red' Will Danaher (Oscar nominated Victor McLaglen). Sean and Mary Kate's relationship builds, even with Will's attempts to keep them apart, but Sean's past does come to haunt him eventually. Also starring Barry Fitzgerald as Michaleen Flynn, Ward Bond as Father Peter Lonergan, Mildred Natwick as Mrs. Sarah Tillane - The Widow, Francis Ford as Dan Tobin, Eileen Crowe as Mrs. Elizabeth Playfair, May Craig as Fishwoman with Basket at Station, Arthur Shields as Rev. Dr. Cyril 'Snuffy' Playfair and Charles B. Fitzsimons as Hugh Forbes. Wayne is a good lead, and the on location filming in Ireland makes for some good sights, but the critics say that you have to be in a certain mood to watch this film, maybe I wasn't in it, because I can't see why they give it the full five out of five, I'm not saying it isn't good, I just don't think it's that good. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Score for Victor Young. John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and the film was number 76 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like some on the message board, I am not a big John Wayne fan. I am a huge Maureen O'Hara fan. Just so you know the boundaries.I think the chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara is magical. I'll agree that Wayne isn't the great speech maker, but like so many have said, it wasn't his style. I would encourage you to look at the scene where Wayne and O'Hara are trying to find cover from the rain. It looks like they found it, but they just stand there in the rain. What's great about this scene is the whole pace of the movie slows almost to a stop at this point (magnificent direction by John Ford), and O'Hara follows Wayne's lead. It is Wayne who begins to relax first in her physical comfort and then O'Hara follows and turns her head on Wayne's chest. One of the best love scenes I've ever seen played (better without a kiss).You've got to love Barry Fitzgerald, "There'll be no playin paddy fingers in the Holy water..." What a hoot! Maureen O'Hara at her best, and I feel the most vulnerable of all her roles (though some may argue her first with Laughton). I don't think we would have perceived Kate Danaher as vulnerable if it would not have been Wayne playing Sean. Just my opinion. O'Hara always seemed to be playing a losing hand to Wayne even when she was holding out for the dowery. Although a great acting job by Ms. O'Hara did give us some doubts as well they should.Moral of the story: Get Angry, Fight, Make Up, Kiss and drink plenty of Liquid Refreshments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In director John Ford's love letter about Ireland, we see stereotypes painted with broad brush strokes. His view is certainly a far cry from reality, but that is not the point. Forget the burdens of today, and journey back to a simpler time. This film is an escape to be sure, but the treasures captured herein are timeless in their simplicity. A spirited, titian-haired Maureen O'Hara will capture most masculine hearts as the woman your mother warned you about, and your father probably yearned for. John Wayne is a boxer running back to the only place he ever thought was peaceful only to find passions in love and yearning he never knew. The supporting cast is wonderful in roles which will never be seen again. I love most old movies; I am an anachronism when it comes right down to it. But give this one a chance. I watch it every so often, sometimes with a glass of Bushmills. Though I've seen a lot of this world, I find a little peace in this masterwork of John Ford. I hope you will, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am uncertain how to critique this film objectively. I will start by making a critique of some other critiques. One complaint is the 'stereotypes' of the Irish. These complaints reveal both the Political Correctness of the complainers ? and their ignorance. The Director, John Ford (real name Sean Aloysius O'Fearna) was born and raised in Ireland and was very much the moving force in producing this movie. Why? Because he liked the script. The leading lady, Maureen O'Hara (real name Maureen Fitzsimons) was also born and raised in Ireland. She also helped get the film produced. Why? Because she liked the script.Now, If these two Irish born participants in the picture don't find anything offensive, why should we? The greatest offense seems to be depicting the Irish as people who like to drink and fight. Having known many Irishmen I can say many do, in fact, like to drink and fight. Stereotypes usually originate in a firm foundation of fact.Secondly, they are horribly offended by the 'violence against women', blah, blah, blah. Now, the Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne characters in this movie were repeated pretty much hereafter in every picture they did together. It is, in fact, a very old theme. People who hate the idea of a fiery, strong willed female finally tamed by a confident, dominant male can find equal hatred for Shakespeare, just read 'Taming of the Shrew'. It was an old theme when Shakespeare wrote it.Sadly, they were so busy being offended they missed what a fine athletic performance Maureen O'Hara gave as John Wayne dragged her along. She was a real trooper. That bit of athletic performance was no mean feat.Now, back to the film. It seemed syrupy, smalzy and contrived. So bad, at times, it was cloying and annoying. The plot seemed paper thin and artificial, merely a threadbare artifice to generate false conflict. The characters were all stock characters and hence all wholly predictable as was the inevitable outcome. Thus, with no genuine tension and no real character development that drew you in; it was hard to sustain interest in this film.My difficulty is, as a boy, I use to love all of the John Ford/Maureen O'Hara/John Wayne pictures. Yet, I doubt most of them were any better than this. So why now do I find this so unengaging? I think because as a boy, as did the larger society, we believed these simple smarmy sentiments. I probably believed that when two men fought they would afterwards become friends ( a frequent theme in films of this era). I now know that the victor usually feels contempt for the loser and the loser has a burning hatred of the winner for the humiliation inflicted on him. And so it is with the other sentimental claptrap.However, it may also be the era in which we live. Now we live where every disgusting, evil human perversion is just a click of the mouse away. Where car jacking, once shocking, are now just accepted as normal life. Where terrorists kill by the thousands and drug dealers enslave by the tens of thousands. We live in an era that has grown callous and cynical. Simple, smarmy sentiments like mom, home and apple pie simply don't hold much water anymore.So, is impatience for the sugary sentiment in this picture merely a matter of growing up? Is it like the Bible says, "When I was a child I thought like a child and acted as a child, but now I am a man and have put aside childish ways".Or, is it because both I and the society at large have grown hard, callous and cynical? Perhaps a little of both.But remember, the generation that saw the release of this film loved this film. Even Hollywood did, giving it two Academy awards. And they were grown ups, having lived through a Great Depression and a World War. Certainly, they had no illusions..... So perhaps it is just us..... A newer generation without illusions, but also without faith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After accidentally killing an opponent in the ring, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), an Irish-born American heavyweight, hangs up the gloves and vows to never fight again. In an attempt to bury the past, he starts anew by going back to Ireland to reclaim his family farm, falling in love with Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara); however, after they marry, her brother Squire "Red" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) refuses to give her her dowry, leaving Thornton conflicted between staying out of trouble while failing to defend his wife or doing his part in righting a wrong while likely having to use his fists to end the feud. If you enjoy lush scenery that director John Ford and Winton Hoch are excellent at capturing, then this is by all means a must see for you. Also known for its comedic showdown brawl at the end. Not much else going for it though, and John Wayne is John Wayne.**? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hot! Hot! Hot! "The Quiet Man" is the greatest, and John Wayne is quite appealing as the 6'4 1/2" tall newlywed -- what a hunka man... I hate those John Wayne army movies, World War II, Indian fighting, boring guy-movies. But I have discovered that John Wayne could actually be quite a sexy man, and even quite handsome when dressed in civilized clothes that women would like. You can have all his old Army-helmet movies that bore me to tears. There was another one of his "romantic" movies (I don't remember the name, though), where he is on a passenger-or-cruise-ship, totally civilian. Somehow I am remembering that there is a lady involved in this one, too -- perhaps even Maureen O'Hara??? At any rate, score one again for John Wayne the real man. In that movie he is wearing a dark blazer, maybe navy blue, with a white dress shirt underneath. Now, there's the real John Wayne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a dark side to this classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although 'The Quiet Man' remains one of my favorites, there is a dark and angry underside in this beautiful fairytale. Like all of John Ford's movies, it's a study of manners. If you remember Ford's great film 'Fort Apache', with almost all of the major actors from 'The Quiet Man', it presents the tension between the Irish and the Anglo-aristocracy in the old army. Just watch the formality of the Post dance, or the confrontation between Henry Fonda and Ward Bond in the latter's house. If you watch Richard Harris's performance as Bull in 'The Field', you see Red Will's character in this film, but without any comic elements. What both films portray is greed for land, suspicion of outsiders, the appeal of self-destruction, and the resolution of conflict through violence. In 'The Quiet Man', the hero-stranger proves stronger than his local strong-man nemesis, and a happy ending is ordained. In 'The Field', the stranger is not stronger than the local land-owner, and is murdered. At the end, almost everyone is dead. I think 'The Field' is more honest in portraying those elements Greek tragedy which continue to underpin the realities of Irish life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Wayne is Sean Thornton who goes back to Ireland where he grew up to get away from his past as a boxer in America. He becomes smitten with beautiful Irish lass, Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara, who I never quite forgave for her slander of the late great John Ford) much to the chagrin of her older brother, Will. The rather simplistic plot isn't the reason that this film is great and has stood the test of time, but rather just the fact that it's a perfectly enchanting ode to Ireland in all her glory, the scenery is a sheer joy to behold, it's greatly acted by the cast, and brings a smile to anyone of Irish descent. A great little film on all accounts.My Grade: A DVD Extras: Commentary by Maureen O'Hara; "The Making Of The Quiet Man" 28 minute featurette from 1992; 30 minute "The Joys of Ireland" feauterette; Remembering the Quiet Man montage; Cast &amp; Crew bios; Theatrical Trailer; and Trailers for "High Noon" &amp; "Rio Grande"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who said this was a racist movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw remarks of this movie from people who said it was racists against Irish, women, etc. Well, I am for one, Irish, and that was the culture back then in the 1950's. It was a well thought out movie and light-hearted. No supreme political message, no nothing. Just a love story about an Irish-American and an Irish gal who's culture clash. It ends up that John Wayne and O'Hara go through troubles with their marriage due to money, culture difference, in-laws, etc. But it all works out at the end and no one dies, everyone is married/happy and no supreme political correctness to destroy the movie's atmosphere of love, laughter and humor. If you want to escape reality, and go back to 1950's Ireland, then watch this movie. If you want to watch a movie with political messages, and are offended by light heard Irish stereotypes (which are true because I am Irish) then this is not the movie for you. people who voted 1/10 for this movie 'cause it was "racists" against Irish should ask me first if it was racists because I AM IRISH</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything is magnificent in this classic (in every sense of the word) masterpiece. The cinematography, the dialogue, the interplay, every last detail is perfect. But, the chemistry between Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne is totally electric. (I was so disappointed when Casablanca was pitched to me as a romance because the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman was forced and more-or-less non-existent. See Bogie in To Have and Have Not or Key Largo to see how he can effect romantic chemistry.) So when the romantic chemistry was pitched to me for this John Wayne movie, I said "Sure, right." And that's what most of my friends say before I get them to watch it. But once watched, everyone appreciates it for what it is, one of the most romantic movies of all time in all the best meanings of the word "romantic." Since then I watched Wayne in Angel and the Badman and Wake of the Red Witch, two in which he also quite good, but nothing touches the Quiet Man. 11/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have though that this move would be at least an 8.5 or 9. One of the all time great American movies, this is a work of love for John Ford, which also in a way acts as a pean to the great unrequited love of his life, Katherine Hepburn (in the character played by Maureen Sullivan). Height of their career performances by all involved, especially Sullivan, Barry Fitzgerald and John Wayne. The movie is especially worth watching for fans of Wayne &amp; Ford's Fort Apache movies (She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, etc), since all of these movies have almost the same core cast of the usual John Ford regulars. All in all, a brilliantly heartfelt film that can be watched at any time of the year, Irish or not. It's about heart, it's about family and it's about how a man and a woman sometimes just have to stand up for themselves. That, and it has the best use of a foreign language in a film: "Father, can I say it in the Irish?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie quite incredible, but at the same time, it was also one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. In the movie, Sean must prove his love to his wife by fighting another man to show her that he is not a coward. Earlier in the movie, a man had told Mary Kate that Sean was a better man than she thought because he thought that he did not have to prove himself in that manner. Would Mary Kate only love Sean if she felt he had proven himself by fighting her own brother? I think that is what makes the film so disturbing. These people have grown up through tradition of proving themselves strong through physical force. I think Sean was a much stronger man in the beginning of the movie, when he would not fight than in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A World On The Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't help feel nostalgia and mild dismay as I watched this film realizing that the albeit highly romanticized pastoral life depicted so warmly here is essentially extinct not only in Ireland but all over the "developed" world. The movie is set in the mid-twentieth century but might as well have been put a hundred years earlier. No radio, no TV, no computers, few cars, just one phone(!) and a regularly late train. Instead, horse and buggies, plows, fireplaces, and a community with shared values and vibrant social intercourse . How politically incorrect such a world now seems with its caste structure, all-pervasive religion and subjugation of women. In the end, Thornton (Wayne) although smitten by this world tries to resist its essential ways but is absorbed into it and by it, and thus transformed from American to Irishman. Hard to imagine that such a world has disappeared so rapidly and completely and in so short a time : the transformation has thus worked the opposite way, with Irishmen now becoming Americans, metaphorically speaking. This for me lends a somewhat tragic sense to an otherwise comic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm still a bit thorn between what to think about this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the one hand this is a beautiful looking movie, with some great actors and also potentially entertaining and good characters in it but due to its story and the storytelling I feel that this movie isn't really as great and classic as it potentially could had been.To be honest, the storytelling of the movie just seemed silly to me at times. The movie does some surprising and unexpected things and I don't mean that in a positive way. Here we have two persons desperately trying to get married but once they have they never allow themselves to be happy with each other and complain and means like a couple that have been married for 15 years to each other. I had a hard time figuring out the different characters and what they exactly wanted. The one moment they are angry and fighting each and the other they are laughing and drinking together. And no, I'm of course not just talking about the John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara characters.The treatment of women in this story is also hardly complimentary. Sure, it's about the Irish somewhat old fashioned culture but seeing John Wayne dragging around his wife for 5 miles and slapping her on the butt for comedy effect just seems wrong to me.It's still not really hard to see why this is being regarded an 'Irish' classic, despite being an American, Republic Pictures, movie. It's a movie that shows the beauty of Ireland, I mean I've never seen John Wayne so colorful and in such a beautiful environment before and it's also really a movie that is all about Irish culture. They seem to have some strange customs and of course there are some of the stereotyped Irish characters here but overall this really seems like a great advertisement for the country and for that purpose the movie and it's franchise is still being used today. There even is a The Quiet Man tour to take, that makes you visit some of the locations at which this movie was shot.To me the movie didn't really started off as a comedy and it seemed more to be a dramatic/romance movie. However as it progressed the movie become more and more fun and entertaining to watch, which was also really due to the entertaining characters of the movie, that inhabit the small town the movie got set in. They however never really went all the way with this and it seems to me that if this movie wasn't holding back with this it could had really been a very entertaining and classic movie.A good movie that suffers from some incoherent storytelling and the choice to not make this movie entertaining all throughout.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

This simple but poignant story of a time long lost is addictive and mesmerizing. Only Ford, Wayne, O'Hara, Fitzgerald and McLaglen could have pulled it off so smoothly.

		<fullReview>Putting a secretive American past behind him, "The Quiet Man" John Wayne (as Sean Thornton) returns to Innisfree, Ireland, his ancestral home. There, Mr. Wayne is immediately attracted to comely red-haired beauty Maureen O'Hara (as Mary Kate Danaher). Ms. O'Hara plays hard to get by sparring with Mr. Wayne, but her passionate desire for him is evident in director John Ford's close-ups. The couple must deal with O'Hara's burly brother Victor McLaglen (as Squire "Red" Will Danaher), who is against the marriage and got off on the wrong track with Wayne by being outbid on his property. Eventually, Wayne's dark secret surfaces...Acting like an alcoholic leprechaun, Barry Fitzgerald (as Michaleen Oge Flynn) and Mr. Ford's regulars make up a boozy supporting cast. "The Quiet Man" is beautifully shot, in Ireland. It was a milestone for the "Republic" production studio, and a shimmering success. The film won much critical approval and some big awards - including "Best Picture" from the "National Board of Review", top director (Ford) at the "Academy Awards", and "Best Supporting Actor" (Mr. McLaglen) from the "Film Daily"."The Quiet Man" can best be described as an Irish version of Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew". When viewed in this light, the violent interplay between Wayne and O'Hara can arguably be taken with a big grain of Blarney Stone. There is also a hint of sadomasochist sex play in the looks exchanged by the couple around the time O'Hara tells Wayne, "I'll be going home now, and have the supper ready for ye." What passes for art can sometimes taken as a celebration of violence. Aye, she likes it.****** The Quiet Man (6/6/52) John Ford ~ John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Barry Fitzgerald, Victor McLaglen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never understood people who profess to enjoy fighting.The few fights I've been in have been nasty and brutish and very painful,and,thankfully,very short.It may have been OK for Bob Cherry and Harry Wharton &amp; Co to have a "rag" then all end up at the Tuckshop enjoying a sticky bun but they were never kicked in the balls or head - butted as far as I can recall.Not that Messrs Wayne and McClaglen do any such low thing of course.They have a "fair fight" for 15 minutes whereas in reality after about 90 seconds they would both have been too exhausted to carry on."The Quiet Man" is,of course,just a Western set in Ireland - or at least John Ford's rose - coloured vision of Ireland. In Mr Ford's Utopian neverland the inhabitants indulge in fisticuffs at the drop of a hat,blacksmiths drop their tools and rush from their anvils,priests drop their fishing rods,shopkeepers wipe their hands on their aprons and rush out into the street to watch a "Donnybrook" - usually preceded by the adjective "grand".Just like in Dodge City then. The IRA,resting between campaigns,gave its members time to wander into pubs with their collars turned up proclaiming "God Bless all here" rather like the Pope.Well,it's a harmless enough fantasy I suppose. The movie is arguably beyond criticism because it is impossible to take seriously,although I have a horrible suspicion that Mr Ford meant it.A stranger comes into town,falls in love with the beautiful sister of the big rancher - sorry,landowner who thinks the stranger a coward because he won't fight etc etc,the scriptwriters were hardly stretching themselves were they?That fiery colleen Maureen O'Hara flashes her eyes a lot when Himself exercises what Mr Ford presumably considered to be every Irishman's right to beat the crap out of his wife.You begin to wonder exactly what sort of fantasy he had in mind. I know that Mr Ford,like his contemporary Mr Hitchcock was a bit of a weird bloke,the humiliation of Jefffrey Hunter's Indian "bride" in the otherwise masterful "The Searchers" is painful to watch,but his treatment of Ms O' Hara is deeply offensive. So,to sum up,if you like movies set in some "Brigadoon"- like country where they treat their chickens better than they treat their women, where the slightest dispute is settled by violence and where the people are in total subservience to the church and the land owners, "The Quiet Man" is right up your street.If,however,you live on the Planet Earth in the 21st century you may more profitably spend your time watching paint dry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just come back from seeing this film at the movies, and I had a heated discussion with my friends about it. I have to say that I found it really dated and offensive towards women. It's not only the fact that violence generally and specifically against women is glorified. I just couldn't stand the fact that the woman was expecting her husband to be violent against her. She doesn't respect him and thinks he's a coward until he finally gets all macho and treats her really rough, which is greeted by applause and cheers from the whole village. My friend argued that this was just how things were those days, but I think it's one thing to show how things are in society, and another to take a quite dubious custom and transform it into supposedly light entertainment. Although this was my main complaint about the movie, there were other aspects I didn't like: This seems to be more an American fantasy of idyllic Ireland than a remotely realistic portrait, and most of the actors do not even have an Irish accent, as far as I can judge. John Wayne's acting is quite bad, and the film is much too long for my taste. I liked the beautiful landscape though, and Maureen O'Hara is absolutely stunning. Also there were some funny moments that made me chuckle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Quiet Man", set in 1930s Ireland, was an unusual departure for John Ford, best known as a director of Westerns, Ford, however, was himself of Irish descent and had long cherished the ambition to make a film based on the original short story by Maurice Walsh, first published in 1933. Eventually, Republic Pictures agreed to finance the film provided that Ford agreed to make a Western for them with the same stars, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. (The result was "Rio Grande"). Wayne was, of course, a frequent collaborator with Ford, and the film also features two other such collaborators, Victor McLaglen and Ward Bond.Sean Thornton an Irish-American from Pittsburgh, returns to his native village of Innisfree (a fictional village named after the real island featured in Yeats' poem) and purchases the farmhouse in which he was born. Thornton also falls in love with a local girl, Mary Kate Danaher, but unfortunately she is the sister of the local squire, who dislikes Thornton because he wanted to buy the farmhouse himself but was outbid. Thornton and Mary Kate eventually marry, but a further dispute arises when Mary Kate's brother, Will, refuses to give his sister the dowry to which she is entitled by custom and makes it clear that, if she wants it, Thornton will have to fight him for it.This leads to a clash between husband and wife. Thornton is not short of money and cares nothing about the dowry, which he does not need, and refuses to fight Danaher. Mary Kate does not need the money either, but for her it is a matter of principle and she brands him a coward for failing to confront her brother. He in turn brands her obsession with obtaining the dowry as greedy and materialistic. Unknown to her he has another reason for not wanting to fight. In America he was a boxer, but quit the sport after accidentally killing an opponent in the ring, vowing never to fight again.This scenario could have been the basis for a serious film, even a tragedy. Thornton does, after all, face a potentially tragic dilemma, the choice between the love of his wife and loyalty to his pacific principles (which have earned him the nickname of the "quiet man"). The film is, however, broadly a comedy, although it occasionally veers towards greater seriousness. Ford and McLaglen, for example, are never quite sure how Will Danaher should be played; at times he seems like a comic braggart, all bluff and bluster, while at others he comes across as a nasty bully and genuine villain.The best acting performance is probably from Maureen O'Hara; at least her Irish accent, unlike some of the others, is genuine. Wayne seems a bit outside his comfort zone, and Victor McLaglen seems miscast as Will Danaher, being more than thirty years older than his supposed sister O'Hara. It also seems unlikely that someone in his mid-sixties could have held his own in a fist-fight with a man twenty years younger who once fought as a professional heavyweight boxer. (Will is referred to as "Red Will", even though McLaglen did not have red hair. Given Will's capitalist greed this is unlikely to be a reference to his politics).The film is ostensibly set in the post-independence Irish Free State, but the real location of the action is Hollywood's own version of Ye Olde Merrie Ireland, a timeless never-never land of thatched cottages, of pints of Guinness, of fiery red-haired colleens, of happy peasants who speak in accents so thick that you expect every other word to be "begorrah!" or "bejasus!". It is a place quite untouched by the religious conflicts which bedevil the real Ireland; both the local Catholic priest and (perhaps more surprisingly) the local Protestant vicar play important roles in the story. The only allusion to the civil war which had only recently torn the country apart is a single gratuitous reference to the IRA. It is a place of happy endings, where two grown men can beat seven bells out of each other for about ten minutes without either of them suffering a bruise or a scratch and then sit down happily together to sip their Guinness, best friends forever.This sort of idealised ethnic stereotyping is not necessarily a bad thing in a film, at least not in a comedy. Moreover, it is not necessarily confined to Hollywood. The picture of England painted in Ealing comedies like "The Titfield Thunderbolt", also from the early fifties, can be equally idealised. Yet "The Quiet Man" is not a film I really care for. Too often its genial Oirishry serves as a cloak for some unpleasant behaviour. The scene where Thornton physically forces Mary Kate to walk back to the village with him from the station indicates that he is at best a bully and at worst guilty of domestic violence. I thought that he gave up his pacifist principles far too easily; his reasons for refusing to fight were honourable ones and his wife only wants him to fight over an empty point of principle. (When Thornton finally gets the money he throws it, with Mary Kate's full approval, into the fire). "A Man's Gotta Do What a Man's Gotta Do" might be an appropriate moral code for the lawless Old West. In an otherwise peaceful Irish village it just seems like a recipe for pointless brawling. Perhaps Ford's Ireland is not so idealised after all. For an Irish-American he is surprisingly ready to rely upon Anglo-Saxon prejudices about the Irish being hard-drinking, talkative and quarrelsome. 4/10</fullReview>

Of course, running off and leaving your husband to walk home miles and miles, while in a snit, is enough provocation. It's a good thing she learns her lesson and goes home to cook before the movie's only interesting scene: the fight. The Irish fight a lot, did you know that? They drink and smoke and fight. There's almost nothing else to do in Ireland. The scenery is pretty enough, but the Irish don't seem to enjoy it unless they're...um...drinking, smoking and fighting. Oh, and it's so hilarious to see them fighting with HAYSTACKS. All that hay, flying everywhere. What a hoot. As John Wayne himself said, "A John Wayne movie is the same thing as a Bad Review..." But some people like 'em. The drunken priest is supposed to be hilarious, you know, I should mention that. Drunken priest falling in the water while fishing, high hilarity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mostly-dull soap opera with great scenery. Started off interestingly enough but quickly degenerated into a backwards and forwards game of romantic intrigues, many of which don't make sense. They might have made sense in a different day and age, but today they just seem very weird and old-fashioned, and like intrigues for the sake of intrigues.Scenery is great, of course. Cinematography doesn't do it all the justice it deserves though, by today's standards. Resolution and focus are not that great. Might be a function of being made in 1953. A bit of remastering will go a long way.Role of romantic lead is a bit of a departure for John Wayne and he performs it well. Maureen O'Hara is great in the female lead. Good supporting cast.Certainly no issues with the performances. It's the plot that lets this movie down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable - yet questionable subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is time that this film attracted a spot of revisionist criticism. I enjoy it every time .. and yet there's much to object to, beyond the stereotypical portrayal of the Irish. Sean Thornton is only a hero in our own terms. He wades into a community, conveniently getting to buy his childhood home, then flouts every cultural rule of the place: behaving improperly outside church, running away from the chaperone during courtship, tricking his fiance's brother in order to marry her, misunderstanding the importance to his wife of her dowry, and grossly mistreating her in public. Yet it all ends happily. It would be nice to conclude that this film is an ironic comment on stereotypes and the behaviour of a brutal, culturally insensitive man in the grip of a fantasy about his Irish roots Unfortunately, I'm sure Ford meant it straight. The vigour and the scenery add a gloss that makes a very questionable story highly watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps people who have loved this classic movie would like to be introduced to my work: Innkeeper's Fire (Feb. 2008).It has been said of the celebrated Russian soprano Anna Netrebko that even if she were to learn many more new parts, the role of Natasha Rostov in War and Peace will remain one of the chief roles in her life. I could possible say the same of myself in that even if I am to write many more books, the role of Risteard Mac Grailt in Innkeeper's Fire will remain one of the chief male character roles in my life. That's because this type of calm, wise, bright, joyous, courteous, warm voiced, nuptial hermit and family man; this rural philosopher-poet of Eire who tells mythic stories and engages in homely conversations perfectly fits my imaginative, writing, and poetic possibilities.There is the quiet man and his lady of the valley of Ballylee, the quiet man and his lady of the lake isle of Innisfree, and now here the quiet man and his lady of the hill country of Deisi Mumhan.Innkeeper's Fire is a keeper; a fascinating piece of literary art.With my compliments, Richard of Eire</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong cast, wrong mood and wrong directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was adapted from Maurice Walsh's short story. If you have read it, then you'd immediately have found out that the whole movie was cast with absolutely wrong cast, John Wayne was not in the least as what the short story had portrayed as the man, Sean Thornton, not even close in 100 miles.Sean Thornton, in the story, was indeed a very quiet man, a professional boxer retired from New York boxing ring, seeking an even quieter retirement life back to his hometown in Ireland. He was a tough guy, very reserved and at the same time very humble but with a very strong mind and will.But the screenplay writer and the director, John Ford, had messed up the whole lot and changed it into a farce-like light-heart comedy. It lost the depth of the great short story with a very deep and profound atmosphere which made the short story kind of memorable and an instant classic."The Quiet Man" and "The Most Dangerous Game" are the two most famous and modern classic, the reasons why both of these two short stories had become so great was the unbelievable and unbearable tension in both. Yet the movie of "The Quiet Man" was a loud, noisy, skin-deep shallow comedy without essence at all.Victor McLaglen who played the Squire 'Red' Will Danaher, was definitely another wrong cast. In the story, the guy was a very tough, dark, stubborn, self-righteous, and dangerous, an egoist and willful strong minded tough guy. But the movie had transformed him into a half wit redneck-like thug. So with both important and memorable characters that made the short story so great had been molested into two shallow guys, Sean Thornton had become a loud mouth, always with an ironic sneering smile on his face guy, also a bit too old for the leading role. Squire 'Red', just a countryside rustic roughneck. Neither of them got something special.Maureen O'Hara, who played Mary Kate Danaher, was the only cast that was kinda close to what portrayed in the short story. But in the messy shallow movie, totally ruined by the two wrong male characters, lousy directing and a deep drama-like great storyline messed up into a half farce, half comedy, only one of the cast was barely okay, would not turned this pathetic movie around into a much greater and more memorable one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Wayne embarks on a quest for sex in "The Quiet Man", a 1952 film by director John Ford. Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American boxer who journeys to Ireland, the land of his birth. Here he attempts to woo the voluptuous Kate Danagher, played by Maureen O'Hara.Like most films "about" Ireland, "The Quiet Man's" packed to the brim with stereotypes. All Ford's townsfolk are staggering drunks, fiery redheads, rambunctious Catholics or uncouth brutes. His women, meanwhile, exist to be widows, virgins or young wives comically beaten by intoxicated louts. The film ends with a band of Irish folk granting Kate's hand in marriage to Sean; they're impressed with his manly boxing abilities. She loves being knocked around too.Ford clearly loves his band of Irish rascals, but this is Ireland as filtered through fantasy and clichés. No Irish Troubles or religious conflict, just fields of green and bottles of gin. Wayne, meanwhile, is one of the most bizarre romantic leads in movie history. His scenes of courtship are awkward, frequently giving way to slaps, threats, condescending sexism and "humorous" wife "beatings".Like most Ford films, "Quiet" ends with regenerative violence, Wayne breaking skulls in the name of "family". It's not as insidious as some of Ford's other pictures, but almost.4/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good classic, but it didn't really capture me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a little bit of The Quiet Man, mostly from my film books, how it was one of the greatest movies of all time. Now this sounds crazy, after all the movies I have seen, I never thought of it, but I never saw a movie with John Wayne. One of the most famous icons of our time, how could I not know at least one of his films? Now despite the fact that it may not be a "John Wayne" film, no western action, Irish in fact, but I didn't mind. While I would agree that this movie is a classic in itself, I didn't really get into it. It was pretty clichéd, but I think this was the film that made clichés before there was any type of movie cliché, so that's not my complaint. The story just really didn't get to me like I thought it would.Sean moves to his home land of Ireland from America, he has a life he would like to settle down too. His eyes are captured by a young but fiesty Mary Kate who becomes betrothed to him, but her brother Will won't have of it since he has a bad feeling of Sean's past and presence. Mary Kate grows to love Sean, but loves her brother and wants his blessing with their marriage, but Will is definitely going to give them a hard time before he does that.It has action and romance, not to mention a great and strong cast that worked very well together. I would recommend this film for any classic film lovers, it's one to check out. It just didn't keep my interest, but I would never deny in a million years that it was a good movie. John Wayne is a terrific actor and really kept the film going with Maureen, they had good chemistry, loved how they had their first kissing scene with the dramatic wind, always a crowd pleaser.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why this film is considered a romantic classic is beyond me. Ohara and Wayne both greatly overact to create a silly and contrived love/hate relationship built mainly on Wayne's brutal treatment of her. O'hara plays the role of the typical feisty love interest whose attraction to Wayne seems to be based more on a sadistic relationship than anything else. Throwing her violently on a bed or dragging her by her arm, Wayne is portrayed as a gentle giant of sorts...a gentle giant whose only way of solving problems is through physical force. A longer-than-necessary brutal fight between two men, passed off as a playful bout,is evidence enough that a better title for this film would be "The Cave Man".Aside from the socio-political implications of this film, the storyline was uneven and vastly uninteresting. Although this film was made at a time when audiences drooled wide-eyed over foreign accents, the intricacy of the Irish brogue and wit is lost to the confining framework of Hollywood dialogue. Character development (aside from Wayne) is week. The Priest and constant flow of old Irish guys makes for an interchangeable cast and scene list.O'hara's character is so one dimensional that she seems barely human. Her constant worries concerning the terms of her rushed marriage only add to this. If this story is supposed to be about love, then why does O'hara seem to put everything before it? I couldn't help but wonder why exactly Wayne like this woman so much. Their relationship seemed quite empty and unexplained, as if most of their courtship took place off screen.I found this film trite, boring, meaningless, and regressive in its view of women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be churlish to say anything negative about such a proved crowd-pleaser as this. Okay, it's totally unrealistic that someone as gorgeous as Maureen O'Hara wouldn't have suitors coming from miles around and would be so totally available even if this is a low-rent version of The Taming Of The Shrew but we can look the other way for a couple of hours and bask in the feel-good elements that range from the scenery to the Central Casting 'Irish Whimsy' types that run through the film like 'Blackpool' through a stick of rock. The surprise is that a movie like this was made by Poverty Row's Republic but apparently the majors turned down Ford's pitch flat. The hokey element of the boxer who killed a man in the ring and is reluctant to fight again has also been done to death (ouch) but again we're happy to overlook it - though even as the film was in release James Jones was using the same cliché in his best-selling novel From Here To Eternity when the character in question, Robert E Lee Prewit, merely blinded an opponent. These cavils aside this is a great enjoyable romp and the only jarring note was the faded color on the print screened today by Film 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot to be admired in this movie, especially the magnificent scenery and its photography. The color is spectacular for its time and this movie is worth viewing for the photography alone. The story has a lot going for it, even though the theme is rather cliché. An American returns to his birth place in a small Irish town where he promptly falls in love with a local girl. He has returned to live in the place he was born. This plot develops nicely, but unfortunately the story becomes entrenched in stale Irish stereotypes that are manifestly fictional. The movie ends in a long fist fight with everybody from the local priest to a dying old man betting on the outcome. Wife beating also turns up as a quaint and amusing custom.I am not Irish, but at the same time I'm somewhat enchanted by Irish folk life and its music. I was delighted to hear some familiar music being performed. One might imagine I would not be sensitive to Irish stereotypes. Still, I do not enjoy cartoons being passed off as real characters and our characters frequently skirt the edges of being cartoons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to study abroad for a term in Ireland during the fall of 2001. University in that former British colony doesn't begin until October, but, because starting at that time would not afford me enough credits, I chose to take part in an "early semester," which meant starting school at the same time as my friends in America--early September. I chose the early semester in Irish literature because, obviously, I was a literature major. One component of this six-week, intensive course was a film unit during which we planned on watching among other things, Carol Reed's Odd Man Out. Then the Twin Towers fell and the professor overseeing the film unit thought Odd Man Out might be a bit too distressful for us. I'm not sure why, though, as I've still yet to see that film. In any event, the prof announced a replacement--the Quiet Man. My guess is because most of the films we saw during that section were fairly heavy, dealing with the Troubles and whatnot, they instructors thought it best to tone down the violence a bit. So, here was a lighthearted romp with the powerful John and Beautiful Maureen. Perfect. Sort of. It was perfectly atrocious. I adore John Ford and could find very little to recommend about this movie. It's misogynistic, even by the standards of 1950s American cinema (hey, John, is it really acceptable for a man to drag a woman by her hair in any era? Didn't that sort of fall by the wayside after the closing of the Frontier?), and it's not terribly moving. O'Hara and Wayne have no chemistry whatsoever and the story itself is banal. The Irish countryside should offer Ford a chance to show his cinematographic chops, but he doesn't. The greens are rich (thank you technicolor), but the images are uninspiring on the whole. Having lived in Ireland for nearly half of a year, I can safely say it's a hundred times more beautiful than this movie would have you believe. Then there are the Irish stereotypes. Was it entirely necessary to trot them out again? Yes, John, I know your ancestors come from this land and that this film was a dream of yours for many a year, but you seem so completely out of touch with the surroundings. It's amazing that a man who has such a feel for unique environments could transform Ireland into something to uninteresting. (Maybe it's because, as I've just learned, some of the film was made on soundstages in Hollywood.)Ford could make great non-Westerns--The Grapes of Wrath is among the greatest socially conscious films to this day--but they were his forte. He may have loved the Quiet Man and placed it among his greatest achievements. I doubt many others would do the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Violent Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspite of being directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, "The Quiet Man," fails to live up to its potential. First of all, I cannot tell whether it is supposed to be a comedy or a drama."The Quiet Man" is a reference to Wayne's character, Sean Thorton, an ex-boxer who swears off violence against men (but not against women) following the tragic death of his opponent in the ring. Thorton decides to return to his birthplace in Ireland, where he hopes to live in anonymity in the house where he was born.Within minutes of arriving, he meets Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) and her brother, William Dahaher (Victor McLaglen). Mary Kate is the local spitfire, the kind of woman who drives both men and women away from her with her sharp tongue. Will Danaher is also interested in Thorton's birth home, as well as in the widow who currently owns it. However, Thorton wins out in the bid for the home, and Danaher takes his revenge on Thorton by forbidding him from courting Mary Kate (he later changes his mind when the local matchmaker assures him that the widow will accept Will's marriage proposal as soon as Will moves Mary Kate out of his house). After establishing the tragic circumstances under which Thorton returns to Ireland, and allowing the audience to share in Mary Kate's frustration at being denied a husband by her brother, the movie seems to be trying to evolve into a comedy. After a very brief courting period, during which Thorton and Mary Kate show their shared rebellious streaks by escaping their chaperon, our hero and heroine are married. However, Will, having now realized the trick played by the matchmaker, refuses to give the couple Mary Kate's dowry. Thorton, who is determined not to confront anyone and provoke a fight, takes the position that the dowry is not important, but Mary Kate wants what rightfully belongs to her. When Thorton refuses to fight for her, she decides to leave him. Rather than see his wife's point of view, Thorton decides to "assert himself" by throwing Mary Kate around like a sack of potatoes, first around their bedroom, then around the Irish countryside. Mary Kate's response to his rough treatment is to develop a new found respect for him; evidence that Neanderthal behavior sometimes gets the girl. After all, if it worked for Rhett Butler, why not for Sean Thorton.Of course, in defense of John Ford's treatment of this "love story", the idea that violence against certain women is acceptable still prevails in film. The female protagonist who can take anything that a man can dish out still finds her way on to the screen. Back then, like now, tough girls like Mary Kate Danaher Thorton take the blows with little sympathy. The message that Wayne's character and Ford's direction convey is the message evidently present in many of Wayne's pictures, nonviolence gets you nowhere, and what women respect is a strong, domineering man. While I am not one of those women who is offended by every film that shows a woman doing "traditional" work or having a soft-spoken personality, I think that the message that this film gives overrides any charming qualities that Ford thought the film might possess. This may have been a love letter to Ireland, which some have suggested, but it was written with a poison pen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet Men Finish Last: Dated Movie Promotes Wife Beating, and other kinds of violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the other Ford pictures i've seen, it looks very nice - but its content is unwittingly cruel and unusual - made even more so by the fact that these scenes are accompanied by happy, triumphant music - which tells us the filmmaker's opinions of the feelings behind these scenes, at least in this era. The first hour and a bit may be enjoyed as a sweet but simple fish-out-of-water romance. But after that the movie's themes become too prominent, which leads to an unusual, uncomfortable feeling in any honest viewer.O'Hara fans be warned: i've fallen out of love with her just as quickly as a fell in love. Here she appears as a luminous beauty for a few scenes, then quickly turns into a hoary nagging fishwife.(SPOILERS)Wayne is escaping a history of violence in the US - he killed a man while boxing - but he isn't being wise when he refuses to fight again, and thinks that his new bride's dowry isn't worth fighting for - he's being cowardly. The progression of his character involves his finally accepting "the irish culture", in which two men may beat each other to a pulp and turn out the best of friends.Its conception of irish values is rather superficial and frivolous.The "resolution" is ridiculous: O'Hara is completely in her rights in that culture expecting her dowry, and Wayne should have confronted her brother about it - so why does he trample all over her, even when he's doing what she asks, and then throws the damn dowry in the incinerator, thus cancelling the entire dramatic tension of the movie.So while the Quiet Man, like Gone with the Wind, comes across as happy, due to colourful cinematography and swirling, romantic music, these trimmings are used to disguise some objectionable notions of its filmmakers (and, i suppose, the entire era, which saw women as subordinate to men, and men in their rights to throw them around). The moral of the story is that a man will assert himself like a Yankee pig, aggressing physically against anyone who stands in his way, if he's a good man. The underscore composer went nuts with swirling romantic music as soon as Wayne started throwing his wife around: throwing her on the bed, dragging her across the countryside like a dog (the same treatment often afforded to African-Americans in movies of the period by Southern White Men). If this is how they treat women in Ireland, i think WE're in our rights to look down on them.As soon as a villager handed John Wayne a stick and said "for beating your wife with" I knew I and this movie were suffering from a major generation gap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of John Ford's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although The Quiet Man has traditionally had a place on the top of John Ford's career, I found it to be second, or maybe even third tier Ford. I've seen more than a dozen that I prefer to it, with only two that are on its low level, none really below (however, I like them all). The story here is uninteresting. John Wayne moves to his homeland of Ireland from the U.S., buys back his family home, and courts a young woman (Maureen O'Hara). Her brother (Victor McLaglen) must approve of the marriage, but he refuses. Later in the film townspeople trick him into giving his siter to Wayne in marriage, which starts a bitter feud. The film is played for romance and comedy, and only moderately succeeds in both sectors. It begins very romantically, but as soon as O'Hara's part expands, she immediately becomes overbearing, annoying, and somewhat psychotic. I sure as hell wouldn't want anything to do with that woman. And John Wayne does little with his character. The role is underwritten, with a particularly flimsy backstory. Wayne is generally a very good actor in Ford's films, but he has little to do and, more or less, just stumbles through the entire film. He actually gets pretty mean to O'Hara late in the film, but I disliked her character so much that I almost approved of the scene where Wayne drags her over the landscape on her butt.The supporting cast has better luck. Barry Fitzgerald especially shines, and Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, and many others whose names I didn't catch were good, too.Perhaps the best reason to watch the film is for the beautiful color cinematography. It catches the country of Ireland well. The music is also quite beautiful.Overall, The Quiet Man does have some great scenes, but there's generally little of interest happening. It's rather overlong at 2 hours and 9 minutes. A lot of other Ford films are more worthy, The Grapes of Wrath, My Darling Clementine, The Searchers, The Wagon Master, the list could go on for nearly a mile. The Quiet Man gets a 7/10, which is quite unimpressive for such a beloved film from such a wonderful director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In good fun but artificial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always felt a strange mystical connection to Ireland that I've never quite been able to explain and have often dreamed about Connemara, a place I have never visited. Even when I was a boy, my favorite songs were not those on the Hit Parade but ballads such as Danny Boy (okay, it's not Irish), and the more obscure Eileen, Tumble Down Shack in Athlone, and Rose of Arranmore. Given that connection, it is odd that I never saw John Ford's The Quiet Man until this week, perhaps because I thought John Wayne was a wooden and unconvincing actor and did not think that the film would bring me any closer to the Ireland of my dreams.Based on Frank Nugent's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's Saturday Evening Post 1933 short story Green Rushes, The Quiet Man was produced by Republic Pictures, not a major studio at the time but the only one willing to take a chance on a film about the Irish. They were well rewarded with a film that won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography as well as four other nominations. Wayne plays Sean Thornton, a boxer from Pittsburgh who gave up the ring after he accidentally killed a man in a fight. The ex-prize fighter returns to Innisfree to buy the Irish cottage in which he was born and sets his eyes on Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), a redhead with an infamous temper.Mary Kate's older brother, 'Red' Will Danaher (Victor McLagen), a town bully refuses to consent to his sister's marriage and it is left to alcoholic Matchmaker Michaleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) and the local pastor Father Lonergan (Ward Bond) to trick Danaher into changing his mind. When brother Will realizes he's been tricked, however, he refuses to pay the dowry that includes family treasures, furniture, and 350 gold coins and Mary Kate refuses to consummate the marriage. This leads to an inevitable confrontation with Thornton and a barroom brawl that clocks in at nine minutes.Though partly filmed in Ireland with scenery that is verdant and beautiful, The Quiet Man has an artificial quality to it that all the Barry Fitzgerald colloquialisms do not change. Though it was a personal favorite of Ford and is all in good fun, it is an overly romanticized film complete with Hollywood stars, quaint Irish brogues, horses and carts, and balladeers ready to burst into song at every tavern. The brogues, however, are not the only quaint items in the film. There is also the macho attitude that makes it imperative that a man has to physically confront a bully regardless of the odds.It also brings the audience to applause as they watch a man drag and kick his wife five miles by her hair, then receive a stick by a villager with which to "beat yer lovely wife with". I realize the scene is played for laughs and maybe Mary Kate deserved such treatment for her materialistic obsessions, but it still resonates poorly with this twenty-first century viewer. I think those with a strong feeling for Ireland would be better off avoiding the blarney of The Quiet Man and reading James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, or simply listening to the exquisite Danny Boy, a song that never fails to bring tears to my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of John Wayne, or even John Ford; their notion of film is dramatic at the cost of extreme simplicity, even simplemindedness. Ford knows how to frame, but all is in service to that simple dramatic value of Griffith. I am especially unattracted to Irish films dominated by the overbearing romanticism of Irish Americans. This film is as patronizing as 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People' of only a couple years later. One wouldn't have a glimmer from this that the Irish are the best storytellers in the world and their stories are characterized less by the broad childish sweeps shown here, but subtlety, ambiguity and self-reference - in short all the things that the Welles tradition followed in reaction to the traditions of Ford. Not until 'Barry Lyndon' do we in the world of film get Ireland back.But I do appreciate Ms O'Hara. Not as an actress, but as an icon. She owes her fame to Technicolor, which exaggerated her red hair. As she was one of the first big redhead stars in color, she helped established a film archetype. Together with Katherine Hepburn, she defined a notion of independent strength, sex suborned to character, unexpected wisdom, a red mother earth of sorts. This also defined one of the prefabbed pigeonholes we snap to in our own personal relationships. So revisiting these films is a visit into our own history and selves.Until the last 15 minutes, she is one character: proud, independent, sexy. In that last fifteen minutes she asserts her independence and is violently interrupted by her Yankee thug husband, beaten, dragged roughly through sheep dung in front of the entire village (no small insult). He then extorts the money which forms the one plot thread, burns it in contempt, beats her brother (shown as a noble, even admired contest), and then comes home drunk with the brother and rudely demands dinner. She submits, and we ate it up.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie really shocking.The main topic may be interesting, i.e. the clash between the liberal American culture and the very catholic and traditional Irish one. In the beginning, this seems so work; the humor is not exactly sophisticated, but you can smile at a couple of jokes. Of course, you notice from the beginning the really bad performance of nearly all the actors; some second roles are interesting however.But with the progression of the movie, it looks more like a promotion of violence against women disguised by thick and rough so called "humor", rather than a romantic comedy. In my opinion, this is not funny at all; the perspective of the movie clearly is to play down sexism and violence against women; women in this movie even seem to like this kind of masculinity. The last thing to mention is the unbearable music: however, it goes well with the rest of the movie.</fullReview>
