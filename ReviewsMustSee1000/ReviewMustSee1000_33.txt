		<shortDescription>Engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An engaging sci-fi drama about a man who awakens to find himself, seemingly, the last person alive on earth. What does he do? What would you do? Everything's free. You could drive what you want. Wear what you want. Live in the fanciest hotel or simply pick a house to move in to. No laws to obey except those imposed by reality.But might it not get lonely? And what if you did find someone else?I plucked this movie off the rental rack on a whim, not expecting much really, but I was pleasantly surprised. By no means was it a 'great' movie, but I think virtually anyone would find it interesting--certainly more so than the claptrap currently being churned out by Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a science fiction flick that has nothing to do with little green aliens or intergalactic civil war, check out this film. A terrific story about a man waking up to find out that everybody in the world is gone. Vanished! He is the only one on Earth. A great part of the film deals with the struggle of having to be alone. Very original, very interesting, and very entertaining. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quiet Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sticks in your mind for days. The opening scenes immediately pull you into this eerie, lifeless world as we see our hero driving around ghost towns, looking for signs of life. A terrifying concept that hooks you. There are classic moments throughout the first half of the movie as we witness the various states of madness our hero goes through before he accepts his situation and takes control. It's this part of the movie that made it a cult classic. As soon as the plot starts to thicken and the focus is taken away from his desolate existence, the magic starts to ebb. However, you are still left on the edge of your seat until you get an answer to any of the questions the story line produced. The end scene, is beautiful, perplexing but I've got to say, a bit of a cop-out. However, its' lack of answers keep you guessing. A superb, off the wall film, that stays inside you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inbalanced Rationale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should begin by stating that I LOVE this film, which may explain, if not justify the following comments.This is an excellent exploration of the human mind in a fantastic situation, but more simply just a damn good science fiction thriller.I would agree that the first half is the better part, but to those who criticise the second half as being cliched and unstructured I would argue that a new impetus is needed by the time Zac has lived out his various fantasies and flirted with insanity.Where many appear to feel the film is confused and leaves many matters unresolved, that very ambiguity and bewilderment was what I enjoyed most. For most of the film you DON'T know where the characters have found themselves, whether they are actually alive or dead, or what reality they're living in.In accordance with this fascination I found the ending superb, accompanied as it was by that haunting theme music. Maybe it came as a result of the writer not knowing how to end the thing but it was never going to be a film where everything fell into place by a few cunningly worded lines at the conclusion! Therefore I liked the fact things were left unexplained, unsatisfying though it may be.In short, I would definitely recommend this film, which seems to be dusted off and screened late at night on a regular basis by BBC 2 (English terrestrial channel). I know it won't appeal to everyone, but there will be those surrealists who do love it, if only as a fun and bizarre Sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Always Liked This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "The Quiet Earth" on Cinemax in the late-1980's (every Wednesday night, Cinemax would show foreign films). Yeah...as many other users have pointed out, this isn't your typical sci-fi flick (no monsters, no extended action scenes). But this movie is unique in that way -- it's a sci-fi flick without much sci-fi in it.Don't get me wrong -- I'm a huge sci-fi geek -- but the thing that kept my interest while I was watching this movie the first time (and what makes it stick in my mind to this day) is the realistic way this movie deals with a totally unrealistic subject. Bruno Lawrence's reactions to his situation were not your usual Hollywood teen flick "Hey, there's nobody else in the world...let's party!" reaction. Instead, you see Zac (Lawrence) change from a man who couldn't care less about people into someone so desperate for companionship that it drives him temporarily insane (to the point of where he thinks that he's God).Yeah...strangely enough, the addition of other characters into the picture actually hurts the story a bit, but it also allows Zac to explain to everyone what may have caused the world's population to disappear. It also gives Zac a reason to try to right a wrong that he had a hand in (thus redeeming himself).The amazing beach/planet-rise visual at the very end of the movie is an image that has stuck in my head for all of these years. It's one of the few actual sci-fi elements in the film, and it has a great look to it (almost a modernized version of those classic "Forbidden Planet" backdrops). As enigmatic as the ending is, I always felt that it was a perfect ending for a movie that had an enigmatic beginning -- it basically brings the movie full-circle.Sure, "The Quiet Earth" isn't your classic sci-fi movie...and it definitely is NOT for all sci-fi fans, but if you're looking for something different without all of the overdone Hollywood flash, you may want to check it out. I'm on a bit of a search thru my local DVD stores to find a copy of it, myself (I'm sure I'll find it in one of the bargain bins...because I doubt any video store manager will appreciate the quality of this forgotten gem).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope over Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Instead of being yet another it's-the-end-of-the-world-so-let's-kill-everyone-left movie it beautifully illustrates human hope, self-realization and sacrifice.We begin with Zac in his depressed, selfish self. On day one, we get a taste of how Zac must have treated the world when people were in it. Now that the people are gone a happier Zac moves through the Kubler-Ross stages, to the audience's amusement. Eventually he meets another person, a woman - Joanne. Joanne is the embodiment of nurturing, femininity and compromise, herself having been alone as long as Zac. Once they find each other, Joanne and Zac form an alliance that quickly becomes romantic, quirky and easy. Then the third player arrives, Api, who seems far better prepared for living after the world has gone empty.Two men and one woman - from the moment they all meet it's strained with only Joanne bridging the distance. Jealousy and suspicion begin, there are poignant examples of human frailty and attempts to reach out to each other, except with Zac. Zac knows something that neither Joanne or Api could possibly know and eventually, he has to tell them. The tension of the living situation builds and hits an apex when Zac finally tells the truth, the horrifying secret that is not only the answer to how the people vanished, but to what is about to happen. The ending, Zac's decision to change who he was, to love Joanne and Api enough to put himself aside turns weirdly mystical in the final scenes. Overall, the story is an allegory of what we do to ourselves, how we can overcome our tendencies for base, selfish behavior and learn to love. It's one movie I walked away from thinking about so much more then when I began it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for action fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has little action, instead focussing on the realities of being put in a situation where you are the last person on Earth. It deals with the mental problems that might arise and one man's descent into, and ascent out of, madness.The science behind the disappearance of the whole human population is best ignored as complete nonsense, but otherwise the movie is solid enough fare.Likewise the non-Hollywood ending appealed to me, even if I haven't the faintest idea what happened, or why.And if you find yourself sneering at what the hero gets up to on screen ask yourself this - What would you do if you were the last person on Earth?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WARNING! SPOILER! Explanation of ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see in the comments a few people did not like / understand the ending. I'd like to rectify this if possible. Due to the first effect when the planetary energy grid was set up, the survivors "either died or were shifted sideways into a parallel dimension" (where things are slightly different) according to Zack. The question before you is "What is death?" When Zack blows up the grid (dying in the process) he finds himself on what looks like a normal Earth beach. The beach is significant because it is where Zack goes to heal after his bout of madness. He emerges from the water in the earlier scene much like a rebirth. Again in the final scene you notice the clouds are very odd, and then a ringed planet rises over the water. Is this another parallel Earth, an alien world, or heaven? This ties in with another question in the movie, whether Zack and the other scientists are responsible for the effect, or if "God just blinked, and the human race was wiped out". All this can be summarized as: What is our place in the Universe, where are we heading, and do we have any control over it? Don't reject The Quiet Earth because it leaves you with questions; this is it's best quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How would you handle it if you were the last person alive on the earth? This is the question posed by the Quiet Earth, also beyond this how would react knowing that an action or lack of one on your part had wiped out every living person on the face of the earth. Scientist Zack Hobson must deal with this reality when he wakes from his suicide attempt to find himself on the other side of an altered reality, alone. He at first goes quite insane, blaming himself for the accident because it was caused by the malfunction of a project that he was heading up. Later when he discovers two other "survivors" he formulates a plan that will reunite the two separated realities. The ending is one that will keep you thinking long after the credits have rolled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite A Quiet Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a lost gem.Not many (or not nearly enough) have seen it and those who have mostly love it. Director Geoff Murphy's film career has gone right into the proverbial john since making this. Oh, he's still working, sure, but his later works (some of them) can't compare to this masterwork.But if you like Last Man On Earth type movies this celluloid slice of sci-fi cherry pie is for you! It has one of those endings that will leave you dazzled and puzzled. It doesn't try and tie up all the loose ends and questions like a lot of films do. Its much like a Kubrick film in that respect.Hopefully The Talented Mr. Murphy will make a film as good as this again someday. Here's hoping! And I loved the ass shot of the beautiful, milky skinned redhead (Alison Routledge) as well. Talk about cherry pie. Yum.You will like the aforementioned shot too. If you swing that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>film with apocalyptic atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love films with an apocalyptic theme. And this is definitely one of the better ones. Even though the basic story has been around quite a few times, e.g. "Omega Man, The (1971)", it is always interesting to see what has happened before and how it ends. Here, the emphasis is put on human relations, not so much on action. The scientific explanation for the "effect" is also somewhat implausible, but due to that rather authentic scientist Hobson I believed it anyways. And fortunately, the authors chose a non Hollywood-style ending for the movie!</fullReview>

Although it has some flaws such as cheap special effects and a less-than-perfect premise, it is a captivating and frightening story about being alone. The power play between the two men in the 2nd half is outstanding.Many people are turned off by the very ambiguous ending. Personally, I loved the ending.

		<shortDescription>Great movie, until a stumble...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some truly magnificent moments in this film, but unfortunately, most of them occur near the beginning. When Zac believes that he may very well be the last living human on earth, this film is powerful and absorbing. His behaviour quickly changes as the initial freedom of being alone transforms into loneliness, and eventually he becomes desperate to find another person. Sadly, once he finally finds that he is not alone, the film staggers badly, and in some ways it takes on a routine storyline, but staged in a less-than-routine setting. This film flirts with greatness, but the unsatisfying second half leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. It's still a pretty good film, but there is no question that it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm another person who saw this movie in a small art theater on Balboa Island, CA, in 1985. "Quiet Earth" was so haunting that, while channel surfing 15 years later, I saw just a flash of the image of Zac awakening and recognized the film instantly. I settled in to watch the film again--even knowing the ending--and its impact was still incredible.Maybe it's not for serious sci-fi fans but definitely for people who like movies with apocalyptic themes, such as "A Boy and His Dog".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this in 85, two things really pulled me in: the first portion of the movie when Zac discovered he was completely alone and began exploring an empty world, and the idea that he was living in a universe where very basic things (like the charge of an electron) were starting to change. It seemed to open up all sorts of possibilities. Spoiling the purity of that concept, Zac's descent into madness seemed predictable and grimly uninteresting. The arrival of another survivor, and the disappointingly unconvincing human dynamic that followed, seemed like a cheap diversion, and I wondered if a studio or rewrite had forced a change in the movie's core concept. (I've never been able to track down a copy of the book on which this movie was based, so I don't know how much the movie branched away from that book.) A number of things didn't ring true. The proposition that the moment of death was the key to survival. The convoluted, poorly explained concept of a 'high tech' military power distribution project and the idea that it could somehow have changed the universe. The hackneyed statements about patriarchy and militarism, combined with painful stereotypes about male rivalry. There were a lot of unexplored ideas too, like what happens to a world suddenly abandoned by humankind (industrial pollution and fire would be rampant), or stripped of animal life.Explanations for the 'effect' were murky and unsatisfying, too. The last seconds of the movie confirm what the earlier portions suggest -- and strangely, what never occurs to Zac as he struggles to explain the mystery -- that the world had not in fact changed, but that Zac (and the other survivors) were simply in a nearly parallel existence. Perhaps the world was intact and undamaged, but no longer accessible. Perhaps Zac actually did die in the original universe, leaving the entire storyline in ambiguity. Is it purgatory, a dream, or some quantum multiverse? The movie's end keeps all these possibilities open. Do Joanne and Api survive? You're left with the sense that they do, trapped alone together in the second universe. Zac finds himself in a third universe that is beautiful and unrecognizable. The last scene is breathtaking but lonely, as Zac stares in awe at the landscape, and then at his now useless tape recorder. Wherever Zac is, you know he's completely alone.This is one of my favourite movies, despite its many flaws. The questions it raises stay with you long after the irritating inconsistencies fade. In it you will see the seeds of what might have been a great, lasting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is another way to look at the Quiet Earth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Consider Zac Hobson. He was working on a project which he knew was potentially dangerous. He didn't say anything, so he condemned himself to death and tried to kill himself... or was he already dead?Suppose that he had really died, that the effect was not the result of the project he was working on, but was a half-way point between life and death? He ended up alone because he felt guilty and couldn't leave knowing that he didn't do anything to stop that project. So the effect gave him that chance. It gave him time to explore, go insane, and eventually recover. Then, someone shows up, just after he gets better.Then, after Zac and Joanne become lovers, the effect intervenes again, by throwing another one into the mix to force Zac to face the truth of why he died and to tell the truth, to at least someone, about the project he was working on and to try to stop it.What made me come to this conclusion what was Zac said when he was in the truck with Joanne talking. He said he had strange feelings, that he was the victim of a huge conspiracy, and that she and Api were sent to be his Guardians. Maybe they were. If so, then this story wasn't about the last man on earth, but about a man who is given a chance to fix a mistake he made, if only to himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie on a low budget.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film many years ago and have been looking for it ever since - just bought it on DVD for 6 quid! (10 dollars).I love these post-Apocalypse movies and suspect that this one was made on a virtually non-existent budget. The storyline is very cleverly unfolded as the film progresses - no boring preamble required - and Bruno Lawrence is excellent in the lead role. I especially enjoyed the scenes of excess once he realises that he is alone and do as he pleases.Once he is joined by Alison Routledge at around the halfway mark, the whole film changes and Bruno's character becomes far more serious and sensible. We are now prepared for the fact that, if there are two of them, there may be more. Enter Api, the third survivor.I feel that the film loses it a little from here on but I just love the ending. It makes no sense but allows you to put your own interpretation on it.Favourite bits? When I realised that Zac had actually committed suicide just as Flashlight occurred - hasn't suspected that at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* SPOILER EMBEDDED AND SIGN POSTED HALF WAY DOWN *A sci-fi film from New Zealand, a country not renowned for such things but nevertheless, Quiet Earth soon addresses all that.Zac, a scientist, or astronomer, wakes up one morning to find himself very much on his todd. The neighbourhood, the town, the country and probably the world is all his.After the initial rush of being able to do whatever he wants he begins to realise that materialism counts for nought without some form of human interaction. By the time we reach the middle of the film Zac is on the way to being 4 beers short of a six-pack!So far so good. The film intrigues us, fascinates us, and makes us wonder what it would be like if we were in Zac's shoes. However, the second reel is somewhat of a disappointment.Zac finally meets two other adults - a man &amp; woman, and all three try to comprehend what has happened to the world, but also how the two men try to win the affections of the woman.For about 40 minutes not a lot happens apart from lots of psycho babble, male posturing &amp; bickering. Only at the very end does it really "hit" you, especially after Zac decides to blow up his research lab to see if it will cure Earth's problem.******* SPOILER - MISS THE NEXT SECTION *********The explosion is timed perfectly with a massive surge of solar energy from the Sun, which may have triggered the initial problem right at the beginning of the film when Zac and his scientists did some experimental work of their own against the Sun.The explosion coupled with the Solar Surge seems to have created a wormhole - which is a cosmological possibility in reality - that sucks Zac through a space/time event horizon and dumps him on what seems to be another habitable planet on a differnt solar system -the scene on the beach is truly inspired!!!!******** END OF SPOILER PLEASE CONTINUE *********For some the ending seemed vague, misleading, confusing; I suspect the director assumed the audience would be suitably aquainted with the surge towards the unknown when deciding to shoot this scene - justifiably so when you consider most of us were brought up on Star Wars &amp; Star Trek films where wormholes &amp; blackholes are taken for granted.However, with the exception of the very last scene, the second half ruins the film - from what began as a promising adventure/mystery it ends up like a soap opera and we really don't care very much for the other two characters since they don't offer us anything of interest anyway.However, its a film to watch for all its shortfalls - and there's always the fast forward button if it gets too abstract.***/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly the beginning of this movie is great. I really liked Bruno Lawrence, and his travel through dubious sanity was hysterical and yet relatable. I know I'd wander around on a deserted earth finding better houses to live in and deciding how to live off the land and, yes, probably going slightly mad in the process. He did that very well. His balcony speech is delicious. But the instant other people begin to show up the whole movie stalls and never starts again. There are only two other people. They are uninteresting. The love triangle is uninteresting. The finale is ... sudden, and quiet honestly I haven't got the slightest freaking clue what that final scene is about. I read the summary of the book and I feel like it did a much better job of an ending. For the movie, it felt like they started with a great script about one man waking up alone in an empty world, then ran out of creative juices as soon as they had to focus on more than one character and just kept writing anything, *anything at all* for the remainder of the film. Then they hit the hour and thirty minute mark and went "thank god, I can end this!" and just slapped an ending on to what had been happening for the last 90 minutes. A highly disappointing end to a promising beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Should Only Be Seen Once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that after seeing you'll be thinking hey what a great movie . It's a film that lingers long in the memory then when you see it again you're left thinking , oh I wonder why I liked it so much ? There's little dispute as to why I thought it so good first time I saw it and that's because of the very memorable ending which overwhelmed all the other elements of the film that came before itTQE has a very old fashioned attitude to science as in " These nasty scientists have just gone and destroyed the human race again " which was common in 1950s sci-fi where nearly every alien menace was a metaphor for the atomic bomb . Yes science might have given humanity the power to destroy itself but it's also given us medicine , electricity and the internet so the good outweighs the bad It's a film that has three distinct acts with one being Zac waking up to find himself alone and flirting with madness caused by his loneliness , the second act featuring Zac finding a fellow survivor Joanne and the third act dealing with sexual rivalries caused by a third protagonist Api joining the duo . It's not often you see all the men in the world fighting over a ginger and this is probably the first and last film you'll see this as a premise In this type of film which concentrates on character instead of action and spectacle it's important that the casting is perfect but unfortunately I wasn't compelled by the acting . Bruno Lawrence is merely okay , Alison Routledge is bland and Pete Smith lacks the dangerous edge his character cries out for . I read online that Jack Nicolson was asked to play Zac but wanted too much money and perhaps the producers would have been better getting a well known bad boy actor to play Api The film ends with a great image which makes the film . Of course when you're left to ask what it means in both he context of the film and a possible future for Zac you'll be be left scratching your chin . In effect this is one of these movies that is remembered for its imagery or rather one final image at the end . Everything leading up to it isn't all that good except perhaps for the deserted streets sequences</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worth a watch, but patchy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, I saw this film at the cinema when it first came out. I think I might have been attracted by the classic S.F. poster, with the ringed planet rising behind a city. Well - I remember being intrigued by the film, but a little disappointed, and on watching it again on DVD all these years later, I feel just the same way.It's worth a watch, and in many ways it's a neat and original little film. It's much more effective in the first half, when the narrative is driven by the main character's discovery of the disaster that has occurred.The reaction of the protagonist to his new found "freedom" is well handled, believable and treads just the right line between comedy and tragedy. But when the other characters start to appear, the rot sets in, and I felt the film lost its way. Also - the basic film-making began to creak. Some really bad acting began to be noticeable, and the director seemed to be grabbing at Hollywood action clichés to bulk out his film (eg the narrow squeeze driving the lorry through the gap, the pointless and unresolved stand-off between the two guys over the girl etc).In science fiction terms, the basic premise was neat and interesting, but not really explored at all. And the more that was revealed, the worse it got - disbelief was NOT suspended!But - I still like the film, would recommend it, and might even watch it again myself in another 20 or so years!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie after a long search, and I can tell you this was worth the wait! Reading the other comments on this film, I think the film neither has bad acting or a bad second half. The scenario is set up to be very creepy, and I loved watching the three characters interact. I must say I enjoyed the first half better when Zak is alone because watching his descent into madness is fascinating. My favorite scene is when he's preaching to cardboard cutouts of the likes of Hitler and Nixon off his balcony using remote controlled canned crowd noise. But the movie would've gotten boring if he hadn't met anyone else, like Omega Man would've gotten boring for the same reason. The only thing I didn't like was the hurried and confused ending. I loved the concept and the 3 leads. I'm glad I own it now. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with many sci-fi films, it is best to ignore the science in The Quiet Earth. It makes little or no sense. Partly that is due to the very poor script, which is the weakest part of the film. That weakness is ironic, because in many ways the film relies on the script to carry the action forward.Bruno Lawrence's performance has been well-rated, though his diction is rather poor for a scientist- in fact he really doesn't sound - or look - the part at all.It isn't explained how it is so easy to fix meals while travelling south. The absence of power and fresh food would make such mundane matters rather difficult.Generally an intriguing film, and sure to be remembered for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ambitious Concept That Sputters to a Vague Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Straightforward New Zealand science fiction from the mid 1980s with more interest in concept than storytelling. Zac Hobson, a balding government lab grunt, wakes up one morning to discover every other human being on the planet has suddenly, spontaneously, vanished into thin air. Naturally the first place he goes is the office, where it quickly becomes clear that the project he'd been working on - a large-scale theoretical WMD - was successfully deployed while he slept. Given the quality and costs of special effects at the time, the film's decision to focus on the eerie aftermath is prescient, but for that kind of direction to work requires an engaging, interesting thread or two as compensation. Instead, this is basically an exercise in pointless wheel spinning. Like a kid in a candy store, Zac lives the high life for the next hour, aimlessly enjoying the remnants of society and doing everything he was too polite to imagine when the streets were still busy. Even the grand finale, in which he finally decides to get up and do something of consequence, is ultimately pointless and harshly under-explained. I really shouldn't have been surprised, but it's always disappointing when a premise with promise sputters out before going anywhere.</fullReview>

This movie though has lot more to offer, interpersonal dynamics, a much smarter approach and the characters are intensely portrayed. The film focuses more on the human condition of a status quo, which is given from the first minute as a sudden introduction of the situation the protagonist has found himself. Although the climax and ending of the movie might seem controversial it is a worthwhile highly enjoyable portrait of human psyche when faced with inevitable circumstances which can live without costly special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sci fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1985 sci fi film from New Zealand, The Quiet Earth, is one of the best of the 'Last Man/Woman On Earth' apocalyptic films. That said, since that is a sub-subgenre of film (subgenre being Apocalyptic films in the genre sci fi), it's merely a good film overall, for it progressively gets weaker as it goes on, as do all films in that vein. Like most films in this sub-subgenre, it falls prey to tropes that undermine it- the first being the predictability of sexual or racial conflict (two for two), and the second being following the Dumbest Possible Action, wherein characters do really dumb things no one would do in real life, just so the film can move along.Of course, some slack must be given to films like this re: their scientific explanations for the depopulation of the world. In this film, it is ascribed to a Project Flashlight that the New Zealand government was working on in concert with the United States of America. It seems that a worldwide power grid was to be established via airplanes or satellites (it's never made clear- as it should be, lest the science bog down in irreality) and something goes wrong at 6:12 am, New Zealand time. The universe changes to the point that only those people who were near death at 'the effect' survive. The rest all vanish- save a few corpses who were likewise near death, then died slowly afterwards. Perhaps it was a quantum shift in reality, but it's clearly a stand-in for nuclear power- something that New Zealand banned around the time of the film. A thin vein of Anti-American Big Brotherism thus hangs over the film. The film owes much to prior Last Man films- such as the obligatory scenes of a shopping spree at a shopping mall (Dawn Of The Dead), the scenes in the church (The Last Man On Earth), sexual tensions between two men over the last woman (The Last Woman On Earth), racial tensions (The World, The Flesh, And The Devil), political brinksmanship backfiring (On The Beach), the Earth changed, but still the Earth (Planet Of The Apes), and there are also some great scenes unique to it- such as an airplane that seemingly fell from the sky and crashed into a building. But, the Dumbest Possible Action tropes- such as Api almost killing Zac in a car chase, or Zac simply not telling Api of Project Flashlight, and their shared assumptions that they alone are the survivors, is simply untenable- even if one suspends much disbelief. After all, if there are at least three survivors in Auckland alone, there would likely be dozens in New Zealand, and several thousand around the world- more than enough to repopulate the world; and worth seeking out. This is yet another unredeemed cliché of the Last Man genre.Yet, despite all its flaws, I like this film more than I should, in relation to its artistic quality; possibly because in its flaws are the possibilities of what might have been a great sci fi film, in the hands of a better director with a better screenplay. As it is, though, The Quiet Earth is merely a satisfactory entry in the Last Man On Earth sub-subgenre. But, in a medium where even mere satisfaction is so rare, why complain too much?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intellectually Satisfying Cyberpunk Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many of its contemporary post-apocalyptic films, Quiet Earth does not involve a nuclear holocaust. In fact, what has happened, how and why remain somewhat mysterious throughout most of the film. And unlike most cyberpunk films, Quiet Earth does not give our intrepid survivors hordes of cannibalistic zombies, marauding motorcycle gangs or clear cut answers to contend with.Shot on location in New Zealand, with a New Zealand/UK cast, this relatively low budget sci fi epic adapts a very good Craig Harrison novel of the same name. The cinematography is very good - especially considering the ca. $1,000,000 budget. Economically and skillfully directed by under-appreciated Geoff Murphy, the film borrows from genre classics such as The Omega Man just a little bit, but is mostly an original and engaging story about people trying to piece together what has happened to the world around them, and why they seem to be the only survivors.The film starts out with Zac (Bruno Lawrence), preparing to go to work and finding, along the way, that all of the people he shares the earth with, and apparently the animals too, have simply disappeared. He arrives at the top secret research facility at which he works and confirms his fear that the facility's technology may have been in part responsible for what has occurred. But there are one or two inexplicable inconsistencies. One of these, Joanne (Alison Routledge) is about to enter his life.Zac's character is well-developed, and Joanne's is as well, but not so clearly. Unfortunately, Api, who arrives relatively late in the film, doesn't get enough screen time or script to become a truly effective character.To enjoy this film, you will need to bring along an attention span. there is relatively little action in this film, and although it is a thinking-person's film, most of the truly thought-inspiring moments occur within a relatively short span of time and would be easy to miss by those with little patience.Recommended for fans of intelligent sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendidly singular &amp; often stimulating sci-fi end-of-the-world sleeper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fiercely self-reliant ordinary chap scientist Zac Hobson (a marvelously vivid and vibrant performance by Bruno Lawrence) wakes one one fateful morning to discover that a top secret experiment he's been working on called Operation Flashlight has created a lethal tear in the universe that in turn has caused every living creature except Zac to completely disappear. The opening third of this smart, witty, wholly absorbing and wonderfully idiosyncratic science fiction end-of-the-world thriller ingeniously mines a fresh and inspired line in surprising off-center humor. At first the resourceful Zac makes the best of a bad situation by residing in a swanky palatial abode, eating exquisite expensive cuisine and joyfully pillaging an abandoned shopping mall of its choicest material products. Eventually the hopelessness of Zac's wretchedly lonely plight makes him go gloriously off the wall bonkers. Zac talks to himself while playing a solitary game of pool, resorts to wearing a woman's half-slip as his sole article of clothing, declares himself ruler of the planet, blows up a gas station, and, in the film's single most sublimely audacious scene, storms into a derelict church toting a shotgun and threatens to blast a statue of Christ to pieces unless God manifests himself in the flesh for a face-to-face confrontation ("Come out or I'll shoot the kid!").Alas, this divinely fruitcake nuttiness dissipates when Zac discovers plucky redhead Joanne (radiantly played by the lovely Allison Rutledge) and intimidating mystical Maori native Abi (the commanding Peter Smith). Zac and Abi engage in a predictable mano-a-mano competition to be the sole recipient of Joanne's affections and have an immediate distrust of each other due to racial differences. Fortunately, the plot gets back on suspenseful track when a second possibly more disastrous catastrophe looms on the gloomy horizon, thus forcing our beleaguered trio to take action to prevent this holocaust from wiping out the human race altogether. Geoff Murphy's bang-up direction skillfully creates a potently troubled sense of compelling mystery, places marked emphasis on the engaging characters, makes wisely judicious use of special effects, shifts the tone from playfully funny to grimly serious with remarkable adroitness, and concludes the feature with an unforgettably haunting final image. The bright, wryly preceptive script by Lawrence, Sam Pillsbury and Bill Baer thoughtfully explores man's poignant need for the company of other people in order to retain both sanity and humanity, the human race's deep-seated will to survive no matter what, and the dire consequences beget by mankind's arrogant tampering in delicate areas where he quite frankly does not belong. A splendidly singular and oftentimes stimulating sleeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction the way it was meant to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays, most people are so "wowed" by the special effects surrounding science fiction films that they've forgotten what makes science fiction (or any fiction, for that matter) great ... human interaction. This low budget film from New Zealand delivers.Zac Hobson wakes up one morning and, as the day progresses, discovers the unthinkable ... that he might be the only human being surviving on Earth. And, he begins to suspect that the secret government project he's working on might be at the heart of the problem. Zac's portrayal of the changes one might go through in such a situation are, in my opinion, of Oscar caliber.Later, he discovers Joanne ... and later, Api. Together, the three rationalize their situations in their own unique ways and try to come to grips with two realities. First, they may be the only three people left alive on the planet. Secondly, that without action on their part, their lives and the very fabric of the universe may be extinguished in a single pulse of the Sun.Bruno Lawrence, Allison Rutledge, and Pete Smith made this fiction come to life. And the film has deservedly become a cult classic that will be watched (and discovered) for years to come.S P O I L E R =============It took me about 3 or 4 views of this film before I realized exactly what Operation Flashlight had actually done. And the final clue wasn't delivered until just as the ending credits began to roll. The government project had NOT destroyed all human life on Earth. It merely transported at least three people to a parallel reality in which "things" remained the same but life did not follow. And at the end, Zac Hobson found himself transported to yet another parallel reality ... if not a parallel universe. And the real bugger? While the grid had been destroyed in "their" reality, it may still be operating in their "original" reality. This film was ripe for a sequel. Too bad it never happened. An image of that last scene in the film is a permanent part of my computer desktop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first this seems like a very intriguing movie. In fact, for most of the movie I just kept wondering and wondering, "Where are they going with this? How can this be explained? Man, this took some imagination. I am really enjoying this." I gave this movie a 3 because the lack of explanation, ambiguity, and the very lame ending. For me the ending totally ruined it. I felt betrayed by the writer. Maybe I have a preference towards sci-fi movies that try a little harder to explain things. To me, the ending of this movie seemed like one of those movies such as 2001 Space Odyssey or Solaris, but without having read the books. If you have seen either of these movies you may get my analogy. Or maybe I just didn't understand it... it's possible.This movie got high ratings from other people, so chances are you will like it. However, keep my warning in the back of your mind before you run out and get this movie.The best aspect of this movie: Pretty unique conceptually. As you watch, your desire to know more grows (if you like Sci-Fi).The worst aspect of this movie: Lack of in-depth explanation. The worthless ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first half hour had me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a fascinating premise and started out well enough. It held my interest and engaged my imagination. And, it made me truly interested in what had actually happened to create this situation. So, it had great potential, despite its obvious low budget.But, this movie basically ruined an otherwise decent science fiction premise by presenting us with what I will term as a "lazy" ending. It is as if the author started out with an inspiration for the story, but then lost it before he could complete it. The final scene scarcely seemed as though it actually belonged to this film - like it should have been tacked onto the end of another low budget science fiction film, but not this one. We are left with a non-ending. We do not know what happened to everyone else on Earth or whether they were restored to their previous realities. We do not know what happened to any of the characters presented in the story, with the exception of this bizarre notion that Zac Hobson, somehow, ended up on an entirely different planet - but we have no idea how or why, or whether he was alone there, too. And, the final image for the movie is also the one they associate with the film. Why? What does that image have to do with the story or Earth, or anything, for that matter? It quite plainly does not belong with this film, period. What were they thinking?Apart from Bruno Lawrence's performance in the first half-hour of the movie, the acting was bad, the characters uninteresting, and their interactions unrealistic. But, there is plenty of blame for this to be shared with the director.The budget was too low for the visual effects to be of any interest. And, while the venue, New Zealand, is a spectacularly beautiful country, the cinematography was so mediocre as to bring everything within the camera's view right down into mediocrity with it. They desperately needed a visual effects department that truly had an appreciation of where they were.I give it a five out of ten - only because I have seen much worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant believe I'd never heard of this before, and it took so much digging around to find! A nice, original, apocalypse movie, about the last man on earth. It captures the loneliness so well, but doesn't overdo it. My only complaint might be its management of time. It feels like the time it takes for things to get a little odd might be a bit short, and so, while in hindsight I realise there probably was a gap, while watching it I felt a little like it just tried to skip the slow progression to it. To avoid spoilers, I'll tell that that by a little odd, I don't mean a shift in the plot. I mean for the affects of loneliness to take its toll. And to top it all off, an amazing OST to match. I really cannot recommend this movie more, and it is terribly underrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on TV years ago and although I couldn't really figure out what was going on or even what the point of it was, I was drawn to it's weirdness. The ending stuck in my mind the most. It actually frustrated me because you were left hanging, wondering, what just happened? I saw it on DVD not too long ago and enjoyed it even more the second time around. I recommend watching it twice. The bonus features on the DVD help you appreciate the film even more, and to grasp the concepts better, without spoiling it.Sophisticated sci-fi, it is not. Little in the way of special effects or action scenes. It was more of a study of the downward spiral of the mind if one were suddenly completely alone. Given the subject matter, the film does not illicit despair from the viewer. It's just fascinating to watch.The event leading up to the final scene in the movie, mirrors a similar event that happened in a particular cliffhanger episode of "Lost" and also, as with the series ending of "Lost", the viewer is left to come to their own conclusions about the ending.The mindset that this movie put me in was very similar to the original made for TV "The Lathe of Heaven". If you liked that film, you'll love "The Quiet Earth." Same moodiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years before Peter Jackson's movies brought New Zealand cinema to the fore, Geoff Murphy's adaptation of Craig Harrison's novel was an interesting release from the tiny country. "The Quiet Earth" is not really a post-apocalyptic tale, per se. It seems to be posing the question to the viewer of what you might do if thrown into this absolutely bizarre situation. The late Bruno Lawrence plays a man who wakes up to find out that everyone else on the planet has simply vanished. But it turns out that a project on which he has been working holds the answer to this.Without a doubt, the end scene is up for interpretation, in the same way that the end of Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" is. But most importantly, "The Quiet Earth" is not an action movie. It's very much about the characters, and I really liked it. Also starring Alison Routledge and Pete Smith (an Orc in "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King", on which Geoff Murphy served as 2nd Unit Director).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent &amp; Thought-Provoking Film Stands The Test Of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Quiet Earth' shows that a film needn't have a budget the size of the Hebrides to realise a good story effectively. It contains very few stereotypically sci-fi trappings, yet is firmly rooted in the genre with a really though-provoking 'What if?'-type premise at its centre. What if you woke up to discover you were the only person on Earth? What if you may have been responsible? Although 'The Quiet Earth' has a three person cast, this is Bruno Lawrence's film by a mile. He proves that not only can he carry a film as its star, but he can do so on his own, and your eyes won't leave the screen throughout. Naturally, a sole survivor would run the gamut of emotions as they come to terms with such a plight, and Lawrence can produce them all perfectly. While the performance of his co-stars who appear later on are quite competent, they don't match the brilliance of this great man, unfortunately no longer with us.Nonetheless, co-stars are needed with such a mind-boggling premise, if only to vocalise the central character's internal dialogue so that we have some idea of what has transpired. It may seem at times obvious that conversations are there deliberately to explain the script, but I honestly didn't feel it grated for a moment. Besides which, the predicament they're in is far too interesting, and you are continually made to feel that not only is it not over, but the worst is yet to come. There is an element of the classic sci-fi/horror movie, where despite continual warnings of doom, the character of a scientific background is never taken completely seriously by the others. They are quicker to succumb to their instincts, while said scientific character is torn between the two, but is ultimately fated to take one path.As to the central plot, observations are made regarding what is transpiring, and theories as to the outcome are offered, but at no time does the script give firm conclusions, leaving the viewer to make up their own mind. This leads to a truly jaw-dropping ending, which continues to be debated to this day. Concept-wise, it is this plus the fascinating thought as to what it would be like if any one of us were in the same situation that keep the film alive decades later with vigour.Beyond that, it's the excellent acting, pacing, direction, and lack of any cheap thrills that make 'The Quiet Earth' just as good today as it was when first released. The New Zealand landscape really heightens the dramatic mood (especially the beach scenes). To cap it off, a wonderfully-appropriate score heightens the aural experience. A really solid effort all round has been made to produce such an intelligent film, and I heartily recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been a while since I've seen the film, but something which occurred to me is that "the Effect" is really only incidental to explaining what is happening. At one point, the main character tells the story of the boy who was playing with the stick and thought he caused a blackout. Perhaps "the Effect" is like the stick and the film is simply about portraying what happens when people die... You go to a parallel world with all the people who died at the same time (perhaps plus or minus some amount) and you get another chance to work out your issues before going on to the next stage. For example, one of the main character's issues was obviously jealousy but he manages to overcome that by the end.</fullReview>

I can go back to this film again and again and find more in it to ponder over every time, personally I just love the 'unfinished' ending, it's open to the viewer's interpretation, something I just love. Also, there is a great night shot of Lawrence playing soul-full sax while walking down Auckland's Queen Street at night, and the blue and shadowy photoghraphy matches the mood of this scene beautifully. The 'man alone' theme is very compelling, but I love this movie as a whole, and I think the addition of the other two characters add an extra and more human dimension to it. The only disappointment for me was the boring DVD (English) cover, so unlike the original and atomospheric cinema posters with the rings of Saturn amid the blue/purple background.

Having just watched it again on video, I found myself as moved as I had been before. In fact the scene where Zac first meets another person is almost unbearably poignant. And the original score is truly beautiful, as someone else has remarked. The scientific explanations for "the Effect" doubtless don't add up to a whole lot, but for me that doesn't really matter. This is a very human film at its heart.Bruno Lawrence is superb as Zac, holding the screen alone for the first 40 minutes or so, and portraying the lurches of mood vividly, even if the "rally" scene stretched credulity a bit too far (where on earth did he get all those cardboard cut-outs??). Alison Routledge and Pete Smith were fine, although maybe not quite up to his standard.I'm not a big sci-fi fan; this is definitely one of my favourite films in that genre, along with The Day The Earth Stood Still. Both are about human issues and set in the present, on earth; the science part is part of the context, not the subject itself, which is what makes these films so watchable to a non-devotee.Watch it and wonder at the extraordinary final scene.</fullReview>

I wasn't able to find a copy of the video to buy until about 8 years ago in a video store used section. But I agree with other comments I've read regarding the ending. Where did Zac wind up? Since the movie is based on Harrison's book, I thought a comparison of the book and the movie might shed some light on just what did happen at the end. From research I did some years back, I found that the book was probably from New Zealand, at least from what I recall. Its never been published in the United States, at least as of a couple years ago. I could never find a reference for it anywhere though. If anyone has read the book or, even better, knows where I could purchase a copy of it, that would end a quest for over a decade and maybe answer the question of what did happen to Zac. There may be an inconsistency that maybe the book can clear up. Since the moment of Zac's second death was at the moment of "the effect," shouldn't he have still been on earth as he was in the start of the movie after the first effect or did the screen play writer take a little artistic license when writing the screen play??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite its preposterous premise and its flawed second half, "The Quiet Earth" is a low-key, under-rated gem from New Zealand, a country still not known for its film-making. The unaccountable ending and the general ambiguity of the entire film actually helps, rather than hinders, its classic qualities; the lack of spark among the characters in the last half detracts from its excellence elsewhere. Zac Hobson awakens from a dream at the exact moment his supervisor at a top secret facility tests an abominable experiment which instantly vaporises all animal life (but strangely leaves plants, structures, clothing, vehicles and everything else completely untouched), and hence finds himself utterly alone in the world. The almost documentary-like portrayal of his indulgence in now meaningless excesses and his descent into madness are--along with its inexplicable ending--the highlights of the film. The rest of "The Quiet Earth", involving Hobson's interactions with two other survivors, is a relative disappointment. Considering the attention given to the scientist's mental breakdown at the start of the film, the conflict resolution in the second half happens too quickly. In spite of Hobson's insistence that the future effects of the experiment are too difficult to explain, Api figures it out while listening to a tape recorder during a car chase! Nevertheless, the blurring of dream and reality and the uncertainty of just which is which is played out right to the very end. Even then the viewer is left without any clear notion of whether Hobson's choice (sorry--it was too good to resist!) has absolved him of his guilt, or even if the whole thing was nothing more than a suicidal dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most credible sole survivor film made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The notion of waking up and finding that everyone else appears to have just disappeared is an idea repeated often in science fiction, and has an almost dream-like appeal. The brilliance in this film is how it takes such a simple premise and runs with the idea - at all times remaining interesting and credible.A convoluted science fiction plot is mixed in gradually through out the film to explain what happens - but it never threatens to overwhelm the film with cliche, instead the film takes numerous twists but never lets the credibility flag even with the final brilliant ending shot that you will not see coming.All in all, a perfect reminder that you do not need budgets to make credible science fiction films just imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like 2001, Quiet Earth requires that you figure out for yourself what happened at the end.... a movie requiring you to think!The general premise of the movie is that human experimentation with a world wide power grid has lead to unanticipated consequences; the charge of the electron has been changed. The power of this system seems to lead to sporadic pulses of unanticipated change. The most immediate consequence was that all persons alive have disappeared, only those that were in the process of death at the time of the initial pulse are alive and well... ironic. The process is still in effect thought and the surviving scientist tries to interrupt the power grid by destroying it. Moments before he destroys the grid though, another pulse happens, just at the moment the scientist himself is "killed". The result is similar but more profound than the initial pulse resulting in not only the changing of much of the earth's appearance (multiple moons), but the fact that now the scientist is the only one left alive. The other survivors of the original pulse are not in the process of death this time and therefore are not spared this time.Anyway that is how I interpret the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe daydreaming about being the last one alive on Earth is pretty common. The Quiet Earth is a great movie which explores this idea. I like Zak's exploration of his city, his "losing it" in the middle and I love the ending. The ending I believe is open ended on purpose. It's for you to fill in. But, there are some clues. The light at the end of the tunnel is common in near-death experiences, so perhaps it is heaven he has reached.Me, I'm satisfied that Zak still exists at the end, and that he is looking with awe at the universe, as we should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The New Zealand film industry is not a big one. On average, they make three or four movies a year, and they're often co-funded by the government. It says something for the New Zealand government that they decided to sink their cash into a science fiction movie about the "last man on earth". If it was Britain's Film Council, it would be about a postal worker named George and his adventures in Coronation Street.Bruno Lawrence plays Zac Dobson. Zac has created the ultimate weapon to wipe out countries, a clear reference to nuclear weapons. Incidentally, since the movie New Zealand has become completely nuclear free... a campaign supported by THE QUIET EARTH's writer/producer Sam Pillsbury. In line with Pillsbury's beliefs, Zac is disgusted by his own creation. The story begins after he's taken bunch of pills to try and kill himself. When he wakes up - PHOOM - no-one is there. Someone's set off his bomb and everyone's been vaporised - except for him. Cue some mesmerising shots of empty New Zealand streets. Filmmaker Geoff Murphy went on to direct such "classics" as FREEJACK and UNDER Siege 2, but he's on top form here with some beautiful shots.I like a lot of last people of Earth movies. OMEGA MAN, I AM LEGEND, DAY OF THE DEAD... even NIGHT OF THE COMET is fun if you have a vagina. The isolation of the movies gives you time to know and then understand the lead characters. The character of Zac is utterly fascinating as a result. He feels guilty over creating the weapon that kills the world, yet he doesn't want to kill himself any more. In an odd way, finally, he's free.But Zac's fleeting freedom comes at a cost to his sanity. He dresses up in women's clothes, makes life sized cut-outs of world leaders, and then gives passionate speeches about how he's killed everyone. These scenes are completely engrossing. In fact, the first forty minutes of THE QUIET EARTH - when Bruno Lawrence is the only guy on screen - are incredible. There's many facets to Zac's character, and you feel annoyed yet hugely empathetic towards the guy.Eventually Zac does find a couple of survivors - a Maori guy (Pete Smith, who appears in EVERY movie that feature Maori) and what appears to be Nicole Kidman's paler, even more ginger, sister. Briefly Zac holds hopes of repopulating the world with bald, pale skinned children with his new woman... but you know the whole time it isn't going to work out.Bruno Lawrence also teamed up on UTU and GOODBYE PORK PIE with Geoff Murphy, but this is the pick of the bunch... partly because Lawrence gets so much more screen time in THE QUIET EARTH. In real-life, Lawrence was a hard drinker and partier, and he has that 'rough diamond' charisma that takes over scenes in his movies. At one stage in THE QUIET EARTH, he confronts God with a sawn-off shotgun and if you listen carefully you can just hear God shitting himself. For THE QUIET EARTH to succeed, Zac Dobson has to be damn interesting. Luckily, he is.One note - try to avoid the British DVD release, which is a pan and scan one. Get the American widescreen version and see if you're equally astonished by the final shots of THE QUIET EARTH. Like so many elements of a great - yet largely unknown - movie, it really sticks in the brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeed, 23 years later, people still thinking about this movie and what it means. Ending? Several people can't decide if it's supernatural, alternate universe, shifting reality. Zac is the scientific morph, Joanne the physical, sensual, Api the spiritual ghostlike creature.Well really, a science-fiction movie with the emphasis on the science. Follow the science or fall behind. A rare film that requires the viewer to keep up and intuit. That is the kiss of death in American films.Low budget? Exploding aircraft, entire city blocks turning their lights off? It's so easy it's scary. The essence of great film making.Just made two friends of mine watch it, and then thirty minutes of debate about what happens to Zac. He went towards the light, and ended up in a new universe, Joanne and Api never existed, and he manufactured them, he is dead, they are dead, the fabulous images at the end are his own paranoid concoction of the scientific, the sensual, and the spiritual. Why not? Again, a fabulists and ambiguous ending, in the world of modern film, kiss of death, it is the nature of this beautifully constructed movie that it survived, and is still being watched. My favorite science-fiction movie of all time.</fullReview>

It turned out to be one of the best movies I had seen in a very long time. I haven't seen it since so I don't know how good it would be now but the story completely drew me in. I was really interested in what was going to happen with each of the characters and how that would handle being in that situation.This is not a blockbuster, this is a film that will make you think about things from 3 different perspectives.Here's the problem. If you want to see this movie, you will probably have to buy it. I have never seen it rented anywhere and if you do find it, it will be on VHS. I doubt very seriously that it has been made to a DVD.This may not be an accurate description seeing that I haven't seen the movie in 22 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, minor sci-fi classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Quiet Earth" is a film from New Zealand of mid 1980's vintage. I saw it theatrically when first released, for which I count myself lucky. According to the IMDb, this movie only played in seven US theaters in its initial run. Who'd have thought that Pensacola, Florida, of all places, would be one of them? All I knew about the film was what I saw on the one-sheet: A lone man stands on a beach. Near the horizon, strangely shaped clouds (trees? termite mounds?) partly block the view of a huge ringed planet (Saturn?). I had little idea what I was going to see when my mom and I bought our tickets and settled in; this was in the era before websites that publish shooting scripts during production, before trailers that give away the entire plot.Imagine my surprise when the plot turned out to involve a "last man on Earth" scenario. Bruno Lawrence deftly plays a fellow in New Zealand who wakes up and realizes nobody else is around. Anywhere. We don't know it yet, but he doesn't know why he woke up that morning... and this provides an interesting twist of sorts later in the film.He goes to the lab where he had been working and comes to suspect that the project he was working on was responsible for the... whatever happened to everyone. Imagine the guilt of the men who worked on the Manhattan Project when Hiroshima became a famous, unforgettable place name.He quickly unravels as the loneliness and isolation get to him. And then, he discovers he is not the only person left after all...Rather than recount the rest of the plot, I'll point out specifics. The writing is great; it is by turns a study of despair, isolation, madness, jealousy, bullheadedness, competition... all while convincingly answering the question, "What would happen if you woke up and were the only person on Earth? And it was your fault." Bruno Lawrence does a great job of letting us inside the skull of a man who is perhaps not the most likable fellow, but with whom the audience can identify as he settles into the idea that he is the only person left on Earth. And then, of course, he realizes he's not the only one...The other major cast members also create fleshed out, believable people that, while not who you might have chosen to live on the quiet Earth with, have facets that are agreeable.The production values on this film are top notch. There are few special effects; when you see empty city streets for blocks on end, the remains of a plane crash, a semi truck dropping through the ceiling of an underground lab or said lab exploding in a giant fireball, these are on-set. The only optical effect I can see is the final beach scene, which of course everyone who has seen the poster or video box recognizes.Best of all, even though this movie has passed the 20 year vintage, it neither looks nor feels dated. It is just as easy and engrossing to watch today as it was the day it was completed. My memory has been kind on the past to older films that have turned out, upon recent re-inspection, to be abominable ("Lifeforce", anyone? "Damnation Alley"? "Superman II"?) Not many movies hold up this well after this much time has passed. It is a testament to all of the key people involved that "The Quiet Earth", that rare sci-fi movie of wit, people and ideas (as opposed to bug-eyed monsters, techno-babble or stifling pretension), is one of the all-time greats. That it has finally been granted a proper DVD release in the USA is a blessing from Anchor Bay; perhaps more people will now see this modest film of such great quality that so impressed way back in 1985 when I sat in a darkened theater with my mom, waiting to be shown something I hadn't seen before. I was. This little gem of a movie deserves to be seen by a wider audience, but even as a cult movie, "The Quiet Earth" will always be a minor classic to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Zeeland's response to Silent Running, Original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am glad I saw Silent Running so I can compare it with this film. The feeling, the message, even the music are very similar. They also have haunting last scenes. I can't possibly believe that whoever imagined this movie didn't have Silent Running on the back of his head. The fact that the whole film has 6 actors in all, and 3 are extras, also reminds me of that movie.Basic story: some guy wakes up to find himself the last man on Earth. Apparently some science project went awry and messed up the fabric of the Universe. Obviously a "don't play God" type of message. But who is playing? And is that experiment at fault? Because the film doesn't clearly state it, and I think that was a good thing.Anyway, the atmosphere can be pretty slow, yet the script is original and worth the watch. The actors are rather weird, but I think anybody would be in those circumstances :) Makes you wonder... what would you do? The last scene is a bit confusing and a tad mystical, yet it clearly belongs to the story.Bottom line: if you liked Silent Running, you will love this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you man enough for a "Quiet" Earth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one thinks of New Zealand film making, one probably assumes that it was Peter Jackson that put them on the map ? that he could be the only filmmaker out of that region. Alas, one should realize that New Zealand has been releasing films for many years, and have even put their stamp on American cinema as well. I recently had the opportunity to watch a little film that probably wouldn't attract too much attention today, but in 1985the rumor is that it was the second highest grossing foreign film in our country. One can only applaud New Zealand for their creative effort, and for me, I will be applauding them for more. "The Quiet Earth" was a fresh slice of science fiction delight. It was a unique premise, based of a bestselling New Zealand book, that has seen several transformations in American cinema throughout the years. Most recently I witnessed a mediocre adaptation in the film "The Last Man", but must express my excitement more towards this film due in part to the ability to grow the characters, the attention to detail, and expressionism of the unknown. "The Quiet Earth" is one of those films that interweave religion, science, and human existence together so well that it will leave you lapping for more by the end.To be brief, "The Quiet Earth" poses the question of what emotions one would feel if discovered they were the last man on the planet. Would it be the hypothetical "kid in the candy shop" experience, or be driven to the brink of madness due to boredom, or would one invest time in ones self ? rediscovering why, who, and how the world transformed into the desolate Earth it became? All great questions that are explored greatly by director Geoff Murphy and demonstrated through the ingenious acting abilities of one Bruno Lawrence. It would be tough to handle the first act of a film solo, using no language outside of the sheer insanity of being alone, he gracefully pulls it of with ease. In fact, it was the beginning act of this film that immediately grabbed me. I could watch Zac (Bruno) over and over again as he engulfs himself in his new environment. Just as we think we are about to loose him, others are brought into the picture, not as confusion, but as a moment of hope and inspiration. While they seem threatening, Zac learns what he must do to ensure that they survive to rebirth the Earth ? leaving us with an ending that makes us glad to have such a thought provoking genre.I do not want to use this as a platform to compare and contrast this miraculous film and that of "The Last Man", though it was through the latter film that I was introduced to this one. They are two separate films, and I will leave it as that. "The Quiet Earth" will evoke laughter, tears, and at times, the genuine scare tactic to bring about the story. Director Murphy does what I thought only Danny Boyle could have done in "28 Days Later" with empty streets, unpopulated towns, and streets as urban mazes. While the tricks are simple, the effect is tremendous. Again, I cannot state the Bruno Lawrence is amazing, both alone as well as his interaction with the others as they arrive. Instead of focusing on lust, insecurity, and neediness, he continues with his research to find a cure for the effect that he, or his team, may have brought to the world. The concept of death playing a big part of their existence now is mind-challenging. It really places a different perspective on "where" these survivors really are. Is it the Earth that they once knew, or some parallel universe as seen in "Sliders"? Then, just as you think you know the answer, Murphy throws in the final moments of the film and any guesses that you may have are out.The cinematography, besides what I said above, is amazing. It really captures the film, and for the 80s budget pre-CGI, I have to applaud this team. While listening to the commentary, the effects were done with no budget, but with imagination ? something you find lacking when computers become too much of a staple to the film (ie see the newer "Star Wars" films). The acting, as already said, is 1980s acting. Sometimes wooden, sometimes stagnate, but overall exactly what I wanted from this film. It fit the tone and low-budget-y of the film, but it was perfect. This is what I miss from films that were released in the 80s. Sure, they didn't have the money, but they were creative and imaginative ? a crucial feature I miss in today's cinema.Overall, I must admit, that this is a film that will definitely be added to my collection. It is one that I can watch time and time again, continually questioning the facts, the unknowns, and the opportunities. Don't be afraid of 80s foreign films ? they may surprise you ... greatly! What if you were the last person on Earth, with an endless supply of everything, what would you do? Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many good sci-fi films. Since the late 60's I've read a lot of hard-core sci-fi (not the fantasy genre) as well. Most, if not all, of the sci-fi classics."The Quiet Earth" amazed me with it's highly effective compact story rendering. No big budget sets or stars needed - the actors did a fine job. The directorial and photographic artistry of the production really shines through. Very appropriate sound track as well.The main character's emotions and situation are turned upside down in more ways than one. I won't spoil it for you but the ending was awesome, in a cosmologically contemplative way. Students of high-energy physics will view this as a cautionary tale.If you liked "Contact", "2001: A Space Odyssey", "Childhood's End", or "Stranger in a Strange Land" you'll enjoy this production.To put things in perspective I thought "Demon Seed", "Forbidden Planet", and "Colossus: The Forbin Project", to name a few, were also wonderful but under-rated films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had Potential, But Failed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! This story is about a man who wakes up and finds himself all alone on the Earth, at least for a few days until he meets a young woman.The first part of the film was very interesting and kept my attention held just to see what new adventures Zac (the main character) would get into each day and night. This character study allowed me to compare what I may do in such a hypothetical situation.Later, Zac discovers the female (Joanne) and realizes he is not the only person left on Earth. This had the potential to be quite an "Adam &amp; Eve"-type beginning much like the old Twilight Zone episode "Probe 7, Over &amp; Out." In a way it was, if you consider the third character introduced as a sort of Serpent figure. I did not.Api (the third character)is portrayed at first as a violent, murderer and then later as a sacrificial, loyal friend who'd never betray his friends. I was happy when Zac discovered Joanne. Not so much after Api came into the fold.The unique, existential "love story" that could've unfolded between Zac and Joanne is interrupted and instead we get sort of a low budget cuckold-type flick. Joanne seemed to have issues with Zac sexually, but no problem hopping in the sack with the much less likable character, Api. The character is so unlikable, that I hoped for Api's demise. Yet, it is Zac who met his demise and right after Joanne (potential Eve, who became Lilith) quickly consummated what should've been her love for Zac with Api.I found the film could've been a great existential, love story, but it took a quick turn for the worst. Taking a page out of Sartre's "No Exit" and the Twilight Zone, this one fell flat. One redeeming quality was the final scene where Zac ends up on a beautiful earth? (or some planet) alone again, without the interference of his female friend and her bull.Nausea? Yes, but not necessarily the existential kind.Four stars, and I'm being generous for the good first part and ending scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is possible that I reviewed this title already once. I will do it again because I am so intrigued by this movie. Zac wakes up finding everybody dead except himself...the reason why this is so fascinating is because there would indeed be some advantages to having the earth all by yourself. In fact there would be more advantages than disadvantages, although some things would also be harder to manage.And isn't it the truth that we all are alone to some degree - despite being so many? Zac Hobson is a man who probably didn't treat people that well in general when they were still alive. This time by himself did also give him the chance to rethink his attitude and his general behavior towards people.These days it is the opposite of it: too many people and an overpopulation, which actually can be and IS the reason for a lot of problems. These days having the world all for yourself wouldn't be such a bad idea and would make some things a lot more easy. Zac Hobson possibly doesn't see this aspect at the beginning of the movie. There would be a lot more to say but I will make it somewhat short: I'm a huge fan of the story itself and could see it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Quiet Earth (1985): Dir: Geoff Murphy / Cast: Bruno Lawrence, Alison Routledge, Peter Smith: Intriguing futuristic science fiction film set in the future. It seems to be addressing those activities we pursue when eyes are not upon us. Plot regards a government experiment that goes wrong leaving the earth bare of human life. Bruno Lawrence awakens to the quiet and everything seems fine until he notices no traffic on the roads. He believes that he knows what happened but unable to turn it back. Then the film has fun with carefree scenes where Lawrence enters a house and toils with lingerie. He also goes shopping, loading up with every unnecessary item possible but will realize that human conduct is needed. Soon a woman and a soldier surface. Conclusion doesn't satisfy but the plot is intriguing and directed by Geoff Murphy who is backed with decent production. We see a convincing futuristic worldview that is barren and nearly void completely of life. Besides Lawrence there is Alison Routledge and Peter Smith. Lawrence certainly has fun in his gradually sanity tested venture. Routledge and Smith add another level of emotion but not much leads to satisfaction. It plays like a fine idea with little character to explore it but for what it is, it seems intriguing enough to inspire thought. It fails to answer questions but argues the need for human conduct.

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable Science Fiction Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Geoff Russell, this is one of the most visionary and imaginative science fiction films ever produced. Years ago on a Saturday night, this movie served as my introduction to the SciFi Channel. That was back before SyFy and when great science fiction films were shown instead of schlock and reality junk. This was a terrific introduction and one I've never forgotten. Featuring an outstanding and memorable performance by Bruno Lawrence, it is that rare combination of an intelligent script and superb direction fulfilling the true potential of science fiction to tell a meaningful story. The existential power of this film is realized in a stunning closing sequence of incredibly haunting imagery, beautifully scored by composer John Charles, with special effects that are simple yet breathtaking. It may be one of the most moving, breathtaking, and thought provoking motion picture climaxes ever filmed. It is certainly one you will never forget. This is science fiction at its finest and deserves to be recognized as nothing less than a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start by saying I enjoyed this film very much. While I cannot say it is a great movie, it is certainly entertaining, interesting, and watchable. The cast do quite well in their respective roles, and the section on the effects of isolation on the main character is both funny and quite sad. The introduction of the other characters and the consequent tension is quite believable under the circumstances.However, I did find myself rather frustrated by the plot. I felt it hid behind vagueness and lack of explanation about what was going on. I especially found myself rather flummoxed by the ending. It was interesting, but it left too many questions about what the viewer was supposed to conclude had happened. I don't necessarily dislike ambiguity in a film, but I couldn't help but wonder if the scriptwriter was hiding behind lack of explanation because he didn't quite know how to end it.The effects are cheap, but the movie is older, low budget, and the effects were not particularly vital to the plot. It didn't really affect my enjoyment of the movie.So overall I would say 'The Quiet Earth' is no classic, but is a watchable, entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Quiet EarthThe worst thing about a near death experience is you already told everyone off.Luckily for the suicidal man in this sci-fi movie, there's no one left to apologize to.Zac (Bruno Lawrence), a scientist who designed a singular electrical grid, awakens to find all of the world's clocks have stopped at precisely 6:12 A.M.What's more, he appears to be the only person left alive.Fortunately that assumption is proved wrong when he encounters Joanne (Alison Routledge) and Api (Pete Smith).With the sun endangered by Zac's ongoing electrical experiment, the three most decide who'll helm a suicide mission to destroy the device.A believable doomsday scenario colonized by a progressive love-triangle and philosophical ideas on death, this 1985 New Zealand import ends as inexplicably as it begins.Furthermore, when you are one of the three humans alive on Earth, it makes remembering your social insurance number so easy.Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the first time in 2012 and it promptly became my favorite movie of all time. It starts with a man waking into the world alone. It explores themes of existential questioning, rebirth, and love/betrayal. By the end of the movie, this film leaves you questioning these very things but in your own vastly populated world. I'm a huge movie fan and it's rare I ever get to discover a movie that stops me in my tracks. There is just no movie I can compare this to, except maybe Moon, or Silent Running, just in that they make you question the futility of existence and happen to be in the sci-fi genre. I cannot recommend this film enough, there's nothing like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe I'm now the third reviewer (here on IMDb) who caught this film at the old, wonderful Balboa Theater back in 1985. I haven't viewed the film since and, not being a sci-fi fan, I don't believe that I'm qualified to say if it's among the best of the genre; however, I still have strong memories of enjoying this production and of it being very entertaining. In other words, it grabbed my attention quickly and kept it throughout via an intriguing and beguiling storyline. Too bad that old theater is long gone--they showed so many terrific art-house and classic films (but that's another story for another time). "The Quiet Earth" is definitely worth a look-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Quiet Earth" has some good moments, especially the ending. At other times, it either drags along or else fails to be really convincing. The scientific aspects of it are handled well, if ambiguously.Lawrence, who is alone and going nutty because of it for the first part of the movie, eventually happens upon a woman and a Maori. The story seems to become more mundane at that point.Anyway, the main aspect of this movie is that it is impenetrable. The book from which it is drawn is very different in plot, which one can read on Wikipedia, but is also impenetrable. That is, you will never be able to figure out what it means. Unless an author provides more structure to parallel universes and transmutations of DNA (in the book) and electrons (in the movie), no one can figure out what's going on or what the ending means. In that case, one is along purely for the ride.The ride could conceivably have been a lot more poetic and/or mysterious, given the notion of an Effect happening. I felt that the directing and acting let us viewers down significantly. They just didn't create the proper visual sense of the mysteries involved. These include the mystery of the hero's mind, his actions relating to the Effect, where he is, and also a proper sense of the mystery that's supposed to be in the Maori man. I felt too much of the hero's madness was contrived and his acting not convincing in those sequences.I realize that I disagree with the IMDb consensus and with the more laudatory reviews. The film is not a disaster, but it is no master work either. At best, it is average, which is a 6 for me, but my disappointment in it is registered in my 5 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PRE-SPOILER : If you have that sort of fantasies it is worth watching the movie, but beware, when the female comes, the fun ends.SPOILER ALERT: I have the understanding that many people have fantasies about being the only person left on earth. I know i do, thats what made me watch this movie in the first place. The fist part was quite enjoyable. The protagonist does exactly the same things that i would imagine doing if i was in his place, which only fueled my imagination. Of course, i wouldn't imagine that i would have a mental brake down so soon, but still, what do i know. Maybe this is in the order of things. I was getting quite content with my choice of movie, but then... She came... Thats where the downfall begins for me. With every minute passed the amount of cheesiness increased. I was still interested, but i felt the first wave of repulsion. Then HE came. Tsunami of repulsion fell upon me. One would expect some kind of denouement. The males would fight for the woman, bullets would be fired, tears would be shred, that meant the end of the fun for me. I got kinda what i expected. Battle between male, a kind of battle that is as old as the world. A battle for a woman. Tension, actually. Series of tension for a woman. But drowned with cheese whiz. There was nothing present worth calling a battle. At the very end, to amend for his sin ( parting in the annihilation of men kind) altruistically ( not really) the protagonist sacrifices himself so that the others could live on. The guy went to a wondrous place (heaven probably, for he amended his sin) , and the romantic Latino guy was left freely to reproduce with a female that has mated with every single living man on earth. The future of mankind now is possibly in the hands of half Latino, half Caucasian incest beings. A bright future awaits earth. P.S.The fact that they were all "dead" puzzled me a bit, i should probably watch it again. But i rather not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice and original sci-fi, and weird too.The movie has an atmosphere of strangeness all around it, and the protagonist question himself if he is alive, and that's a logic question, because the earth without people it's just another thing, some unknown piece of land. And above that, what we are It's a LOT based on what people think and judge about what we are, so without the "judges", we have to face the question to discover that we just don't know the answer.For me I felt the protagonist's loneness, specially when he finds another "survivor", a very attractive woman (for a 80's perspective) and he starts feeling attracted by her when he finds another survivor, and the girl fall in love with this other guy and they stay together.Besides, the protagonist do what is right in the end, forgetting about himself in the name of humanity.

		<fullReview>This is a great little Sci-Fi from the eighties. A guy wakes up one day and it appears every other human on the planet has disappeared.In some ways it is a little bit dated with its 80's obligatory dream sequence and dodgy sound track; but coming from a time when censors actually censored stuff there is hardly any gore and sex. So unlike its modern counterparts it has to rely quite a lot on character, story, and setting.It hits all these areas easily. The 'quiet' sequences are very well done.The story is fairly linear compared to modern films so if you are used to things exploding every few seconds or expect a deviously clever twist at the end you may be disappointed.Otherwise this is a great movie and I am sure movie fans will be watching it 50 years from now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched The Quiet Earth, I was expecting another run-of-the- mill post-apocalyptic tale. What I got was a whole lot more. The three main actors are convincing and the depiction of a world devoid of people is eerie to say the least. The story of a man waking up in an empty world after a walk on the flat- line, it is gripping to see him discover what might have happened to cause all this. The scenes may get a bit boring for a while since there is no action whatsoever but the characters and the above average acting makes it a worthwhile watch. And the end, which doesn't explain enough and kind of raises more questions, makes it all worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man wakes up to find himself all alone.

He moves "up" in society, drinks the best wines, shops at the best places, dresses up like women and begins playing God. The movie, based on the book by the same name written by Craig Harrison, is better than I am Legend in the sense that Legend moves offtrack from the great book by Richard Matheson in the second half. here the movie stays faithful but could have done with some tinkering with the end. the direction is spot on with eerily deserted locales. the special effects are caught in a time warp and are dated. the acting is generally competent but could have been better by the second actor. the movie is very gripping in the first two acts. it is the conclusion and the manner in which it is reached which leaves something to be desired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Numerous little powerful moments don't amount to a great powerful moment. It's probably a pity that director Geoff Murphy did not make a one-person-journey out of it; instead he developed a pulpy threesome story. In short: The strong philosophic content, which inheres in the idea of a deserted Earth inflicted by the only survivor, is frivolously given away by the second half of the film. I don't know the novel, but it doesn't seem as if the script was a victim of radical changes. So, within its own premises, 'The Quiet Earth' works quite well; a seemingly low-budget production, that does not rely on overdone sci-fi-effects or action sequences, but focuses all the more on the performances of the three prota-/antagonists, who are not to blame for the one or the other sappy line. All in all, it's a pleasing matter, with a sublime final shot that will keel you over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will stay with you for a long, long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this magnificent film on terrestrial UK TV some time ago, and on buying the DVD I was pleasantly surprised to find that it has lost none of its original impact.Scientist Zac Hobson (Bruno Lawrence) wakes up on an apparently normal day, to find that all living things on earth have simply vanished from the face of the planet. It transpires that the secret project that he has been working on, called Operation Flashlight, has backfired, and somehow altered the state of the universe. Pretty hard to swallow? Well, stick with it - you are in for a cinematic treat.The first 45 minutes of running time are all about Zac; the discovery that he is all alone, the documenting of his decline from resigned sole survivor to near-madman as the realisation of his total solitude bites hard, and how he eventually turns this around in his efforts to contact another living soul. The second part is in my opinion less effective, as two more survivors (Joanne, played by Alison Routledge, and burly Maori Api, played by Peter Smith) come into play.The movie has flaws (for example, the explanation given by Zac as to the origin of the "effect" is not very convincing, and the second half of the film comes across as a little laboured in parts as the eternal triangle of characters inter-react) but these disadvantages are vastly outweighed by the movie's sheer atmosphere, brought about by the unfamiliar New Zealand locations, the director's refreshing vision, and the haunting and unusual music score (of which more later).Because the character of Zac has such a common touch, it is very easy for the audience to identify with him and sympathise with the terrible situations he faces. What would YOU do if you had the freedom to do exactly what you want without penalty? Zac takes full advantage of his unique situation, eating and drinking to excess, wearing the finest clothes, and "moving up in the world" to a swanky, expansive house. But the frivolity soon turns sour as he realises that he has the whole world at his feet, but nobody to share his joy with - and the prospect of living out the rest of his days in a downward spiral of madness, assuming he does not do away with himself first.I think that the untimely death of lead actor Bruno Lawrence has given this movie an even greater power to move an audience. In his life, Lawrence was a multi-talented, complex, ebullient man, and his performance here is a joy to behold - he runs through a shed-load of emotions in his portrayal of the apparent Last Man on Earth, and his acting talents are tested to the very limit - particularly in the scenes in which he gradually loses the balance of his mind. One can only imagine how he could have developed as an actor had he lived.The ending has been criticised by many as being unsatisfactory. I personally think it is perfect. We are left yearning to know what has transpired, in the same way we were bewildered by Kubrick's "astronaut-in-a-hotel-room" ending of 2001. Has Zac been transported to another planet? Been whisked away to a parallel dimension? And most important to us as a sympathetic audience, is he totally alone this time? Only we ourselves can provide the answer. Listen carefully to the many clues given in the dialogue, you will find more there than you might at first think.It is impossible to comment on the film without mentioning John Charles' exquisite musical score, which complements the images on screen to perfection. The moving main theme, which recurs throughout the piece in several key places, is incredibly beautiful, and as soon as it is heard over the main title sequence, it becomes obvious that this film is not going to be a run-of-the-mill sci-fi shoot-'em-up. I defy anyone to watch this movie and not feel a lump in their throat, as the music swells and the end titles roll.This film deserves to be a cult classic, and I have no doubt that as film fans spread the word following the DVD release, its stature will only grow as the years go by. In common with my all-time favourite "2001: A Space Odyssey", this movie has the power to alter your perceptions of the world, the universe, and your place in both. If you see it on the shelf at your local store, don't hesitate to buy it - you will want to watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zac Hobson is a scientist working on an internal investigation in to 'Project Flashlight' a joint operation between America and New Zealand to use the solar energy of the sun and keep planes in the air indefinitely without the need for refuelling. But Zack is finding holes in the reports from the American scientists, they are hiding information from him, are they using 'Project Flashlight' for more sinister purposes?. He awakes from a horrible dream nauseated, gulping down water he finds his radio is broadcasting static, later in his car he sees deserted streets,and a starkly empty garage with a toilet locked from the inside. With panic setting in he breaks in to a cottage, bellowing through the smashed window 'Is there anybody here?' More is to come, amid the myriad empty vehicles alongside the roads he spots a crashed jumbo jet, making his way through the rubble he finds seats with the seat belts locked but no passengers.He heads to Project Flashlight and discovers some uncomfortable truths, it appears he is the last person alive on Earth and the project he has been working on may have something to do with it. Alone and guilt ridden Zack turns to the bottle, but his tiny hotel room sinks him in to a depression and so he moves in a mansion, along the way he dresses like a millionaire and begins to talk to himself. But the expensive clothes and beautiful surroundings cant compete with simple human contact and, continuing to drink heavily, he sinks in to a psychosis. Dressing in a woman's slip he addresses an army of silent worshippers ( cardboard cut outs of history's famous and infamous) and proclaims himself God. God of a 'silent earth'. Luckily Zack manages to find a way out of his growing insanity, by reaching a kind of epiphany just before the point of suicide.But not before running in to a church with a shotgun, taking aim at a statue of Jesus Christ and demanding God change things back or 'the kid gets it'. We find Zack later clean shaven and setting up a generator to power his computer he has turned the corner and has become more positive about his situation. In to this new calm comes the bewitching Joanne a beautiful and young red headed woman. After the initial shock at finally seeing someone, they hug deeply, this warmest of physical contact cuts all barriers and cultures and immediately puts them at ease with each other. They develop a friendship which turns periodically sexual as they search the country for anyone else . They do in fact find someone else the intimidating Api a Maori and a somewhat shady character. Dressed in military gear and with a quick temper Api rubs up against Zack, fighting for the attentions of Joanne. Yet Api is no mindless thug cliché, he is spiritual and his Maori culture informs him that he may be a ghost. They share information about how they could have survived and discover that they were all at the point of death before 'The Effect' as Zack refers to what happened to everyone else. Zack also has more, disturbing news, the effect wasn't just a 'one-off' it will happen again and soon. And the only way to possibly stop it is to destroy the Flashlight project.But the building is now irradiated and if anyone gets too close it means death Zack detonates a truck full of Dynamite at the exact moment The Effect occurs again. This time he is transported to a plant much like earth but with a beautiful horizon and a ringed planet where our moon should be. Where is Zack, another universe, a parallel earth or Heaven?. This is an interesting film about many themes. How we need human contact, even Api and Zack need each other. How materialism, no matter how luxurious, doesn't mean anything if we cant share the experience with others. Api's spiritual approach to his situation contrasts with Zacks scientific rationals.The characterisation is well fleshed out in this film particularly Bruno Larewnce as the pitiable Zack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the best SF films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Quiet Earth is a classic science fiction film, of a type that is rarely produced by Hollywood or anywhere else for that matter. But there are no spaceships, aliens, mutants, or big battles. There are a couple of explosions, but those are pretty obligatory for any movie, so they don't count.Seriously speaking, The Quiet Earth is a masterwork of performance, understatement, and dialogue that is just as timely and potent today as it was back in 1985. An Oscar-worthy (but incredibly unnominated) performance by Bruno Lawrence dominate the film -- literally; the first half of the movie is a one-man show as he plays a haunted scientist who wakes up one morning to discover that a secret government project he'd been working on -- indeed had just resigned in disgust from -- had been tested. And he finds himself, apparently, the only man left alive on the planet. (Watching this film again some 20 years after I last saw it, I was reminded of the current controversy over HAARP stations which, on the surface, sound not too much different from Quiet Earth's "Project Flashlight").The first half of the film offers a series of vignettes showing Lawrence's character slowly going mad - declaring himself president of earth, making friends with department store mannequins, and playing late-night saxophone solos on the deserted city streets. This part of the film clearly borrows from Charlton Heston's The Omega Man -- the DVD liner notes all but confirm this -- but it does so in a way that gives it its own unique voice. The resolution is also unique as our hero finally pulls himself back from the abyss of madness.The second half of the film (and herein lies the real spoiler) in which our hero discovers a young redheaded woman still alive, gives viewers a chance to grasp at some normalcy, and actress Alison Routledge provides a vivacious and headstrong performance. Her chemistry with Bruno Lawrence is terrific, to the point where you actually share Lawrence's resentment when a third survivor is located. I'm disappointed that her film career never seemed to take off as evidenced by the rather short IMDb film list for her.What I like about The Quiet Earth is there are so many opportunities for it to fall into cliché, but it manages to come up with fresh approaches almost every time. Even the unavoidable romantic triangle that forms among the survivors is handled with style and originality.The unfortunate thing that has annoyed me for the last 22 years is that the very poster art for the film -- and, now, the DVD case -- is a huge spoiler for the end of the film. Yes, it's one of the most spectacular special effects shots in motion picture history, yet I wonder if anyone has ever managed to see this film without having already seen the poster art? What an impact those final images (coupled with a awe-inspiring theme score) must have on the unspoiled.Like most truly good SF films, The Quiet Earth doesn't explain everything. And as such it may not be for everybody. But if you want a smart, occasionally surprisingly funny, and always challenging film guaranteed to spark discussion and repeated viewings, this is it.</fullReview>

I have watched this movie only a few times, as it used to be only in VHS format, and if you were lucky to find a copy (at a store that rents VHS tapes still) it was beat-up pretty bad.

		<fullReview>Zac Hobson, a research scientist, wakes up to find himself literally alone in the world, and goes about trying to find other survivors, as well as to find out what happened. Finding no one else alive, he succumbs to a brief period of despair, megalomania and self-indulgence, but eventually reason returns and he resumes his quest.He soon finds Joanne, a pretty young woman, and later Api, a Maori warrior. Hobson suspects that a government research project in which he was involved had something to do with the everyone's disappearance. Only those people who were on the verge of dying at that very moment of the Event - be it through attempted suicide or whatever - have been spared.His scientific observations lead him to conclude that certain usually constant and fundamental aspects of the physical world are changing. These, with strange "tremors" in the very fabric of reality itself, lead him to suspect that what is left of the world will soon be completely destroyed. The three-cornered relationship produces disruptions of its own, but nonetheless the group formulate a plan to destroy the research laboratory, in hope of averting impending destruction. Joanne and Api feel a bit guilty for getting it on while Zac heads off to get a TNT laden semi-trailer and save the world. He succeeds in destroying the laboratory in a colossal explosion, but as for saving the world...Intelligent science fiction, thoroughly entertaining and engrossing to the thoughtful mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New Zealand surely isn't that illustrious, but this film is an incredible work that is begging to be rediscovered. It isn't a science- fiction in the way of aliens and action; despite it's meager budget, it uses mood, suggestion and great storytelling. The protagonist doesn't fight bloodthirsty monsters, but human nature.Zac wakes one morning to find himself alone; the entire human race has seemingly disappeared overnight during a phenomena known as "The Effect". As his mental state begins deteriorating, he meets two other survivors, but it isn't long before problems in their relationships begin to happen.For an inexperienced director, inexperienced cast, and probably inexperienced crew, the movie is surprisingly professional. At a time when other sci-fi movies like Back to the Future and Brazil, The Quiet Earth unfortunately and undeservedly faded into obscurity. Plus, dare I say, this movie features the greatest ending ever put to film (Think Planet of the Apes x10). Please do your best to find this movie, you will surely enjoy the wonders of filmmaking outside of Hollywood once you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a simple premise comes a possible reality for all of us, with a gut wrenching final</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply "Quiet Earth" is the best Sci-Film ever made, with the best sci- fi music ever written. "Seriously".The last few minutes will knock your socks off, you will find yourself wanting more.When the film ended I hoped they would make a sequel.What I liked about Quiet Earth was it's simplicity. No gadgets, no gore, or other special effects.Just a simple story of something that could easily happen, and what happens to the man in the centre of it all, and the gut wrenching final John Charles scores "The Quiet Earth", and his music hits the spot. His music lends to the imagination.Quite simply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FANTASTIC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good watch with a seemingly satisfying climax.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I had no idea this movie was filmed in New Zealand, and as a resident of the country myself; I know all too well the kind of productions that are delivered. Most of them unfortunately are a crap-fest. However, with The Quiet Earth, I was very pleasantly surprised. The plot is original, it has never (in my geeky, sci-fi junkie knowledge) been done before. The camera work is superb, the way the movie is set out on a striking background makes this film all the more beautiful.The plot is surprisingly simple, it does not involve a lot of consideration, which in my particular case, allowed me to enjoy what was happening visually. A man wakes up only to find civilization has vanished, and he is the sole remaining species.I'm sure we have all fantasized about this, and what we would do. The main character relates to his imagination, and to ours, he takes a small advantage and delivers it with such passion and comedic structure. Of course however, this would drive anyone insane if they weren't used to living a life of recluse and complete solitude, and he eventually does dance along the rope of reality, slipping momentarily until the plot drives forward. It is an entertaining movie, it has it's thrills, it certainly has a tad suspense and a slight nudge of bad acting, however in saying that; the movie makes up for this tedious flaw with a terrific script, and a most peculiar story-line which will leave the viewers wondering what on Earth will happen (ignore the pun).I enjoyed this movie a great deal, it was a fun way to spend an evening watching the well adapted characters explore the possibilities of their flawed world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film, but a remake of another movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting and stunning visual effects - especially the ending - are great. I cannot help but wonder if this is a remake of "The World, the flesh and the devil" with Harry Belafonte, Inger Stevens and Mel Ferrer. Also an excellent movie, the plot seems similar, the world ends due to nuclear war - so the government{s} is responsible - and the survivors are a black man, white woman and a white man.A few more similarities can probably be found, and should not keep any viewer from watching this or both films. In fact, given the nature of the story with the tensions, sexual and racial, I am surprised here have not been several versions of this made into film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hasn't dated well, but still a good example of what good science fiction used to look like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scientist named Zac Hobson wakes up to discover what is probably either most people's worst nightmare or biggest fantasy, that he is that last man alive on earth. The emptiness of the post-apocalyptic world is the result of a top-secret energy project gone horribly wrong (don't stories where everyone in the world has died or disappeared usually result from some top-secret project or another gone wrong?). For a while Zac basks in the denial that there's no one else in the world, and indulges in his materialistic fantasies until reality, as it were, sets in, and he begins to search in earnest for other survivors. Ultimately he discovers two others, a man and a woman, and the resulting love triangle is strangely interesting although awkwardly portrayed. The three characters, however awkward, propel the rest of the story in the direction of the bizarre but truly memorable ending. The performances in the film are much better than you might expect from mid 1980s science fiction, and the atmosphere of emptiness and desolation is startlingly convincing. The film hasn't dated well, but it's still good fun. For some reason I have grouped this movie in my mind with Soylent Green, another old science fiction film memorable for its uniqueness and unexpectedness. Both are good for an evening of unusual entertainment. Science fiction fans are sure to eat it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-budget brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here's a strange little film. I hadn't even heard of it until my dad recommended it to me a few days ago, so I decided to give it a go. It's very low-budget, very weird, and very memorable. The concept is nothing new - a guy wakes up and discovers he's (apparently) the last person on earth. It's been done in a hundred short stories, several episodes of The Twilight Zone, and, recently, 28 Days Later. But this version is wholly different.The first half or so is pretty much the lead character - Zac - attempting to live by himself, basically hoarding anything he wants, quickly going mad - it's not action-packed, but it is interesting. While watching the scene where he bursts into a church, armed with a shotgun, wearing a woman's dress, screaming at the heavens, shooting at a statue of Jesus on the crucifix, I was struck by the notion that this is actually what would happen if someone was left all alone on the planet. They would do whatever the hell they wanted. Some brief suggestions of the cause, as linked to the protagonist's shady job, are thrown aside in favour of odd little scenes, such as where he gives a speech to an audience of historical leader cut-outs (ranging from Hitler to Nixon) and proclaims himself "President of this quiet Earth". It really is quite frightening.The second half deals with Zac finding two others - a woman named Joanne and a man named Api - and the love triangle that invariably forms between them. I found this plot realistic but rather tiresome; I actually kinda felt bad for Zac for literally finding the one woman in the world for him and then having to fight for her, but I got tired of the competitiveness between the two men. This is the only area in which the script falters, as it pulls down the main story, which is slowly answered; both the reason for the trio's survival as well as a possible cause is uncovered. Clues as to the nature of the reality in which they live are given, but nothing is concrete, and it all leads up to an ending that is, at once, both stunningly beautiful and frustratingly enigmatic. It really has to be seen to be believed, though, as the poster really can't do it justice.It very much feels like a low-budget film, with the simple direction, amateurish actors, and fake effects. Even the aforementioned ending doesn't look as good as it could. But the questions that the story raises and the brilliant finish make this a film well worth watching. It's written very well - apart from the silly romance - with some dark humour and a clear knowledge of science, and the images are definitely memorable. If anything, just see it for the ending, which could either be seen as the most brilliant twist in cinematic history or the biggest cop-out ever. It really is that stunning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>End of the movie thought!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously the ending can be interpreted several ways. Is the "Effect" a jump into another dimension, a leap into a parallel universe or a warp across space time, to another planet in another galaxy? Or did the "Effect simply kill everyone on Earth, leaving the Dead/Dying behind? Perhaps all four happening at the same time...Who really knows for sure? But to help scramble your noodles a bit more, try pondering this... It is already known that you get transferred by the "Effect" at your time of death. So, after the "Effect", it took Zac a few weeks to find Joanne and Api. If given more time, they may have found maybe 7 more survivors. Since there are 6 billion people on Earth, how many would have survived the "Effect"? Obviously, a place like America would have a larger population than New Zealand thus, having more survivors. There are approximately 192 countries in the world, so if 10 people died in every country during the first "Effect" that leaves a minimum of 1920 total survivors world wide. Out of 6 billion people, this is a very conservative number, considering thousands of people die every second, somewhere in the world. So when Zack died a second time and got sent to that strange planet, how many survivors died a second time and went with him? Is Zac really alone? (Final Thought) Its too bad Zac didn't think of going to a Television station and used a "Via Satellite" transmission before the power went out to find other survivors. Perhaps he would have found a better Hottie that wouldn't have screwed him over.</fullReview>

Great concept, fascinating build up, haunting music and best ending of all time.

		<shortDescription>Incredible display of film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that takes what is an interesting notion - that of there being no-one left on earth at all (for reasons never fully explained) and does wonderful things with it.Zach, the main character, spends the first half of the film almost enjoying his freedom, as he drives trains and lives in large mansions. However he starts to crack up after a while, leading to a memorable scene as he delivers a resounding speech to a bunch of cardboard cut-outs. The film opens up with new characters, but I believe it did not loose anything in doing so, the characters react to each other in a believable way.The conclusion is stunning and dramatic.In all this is a superb film, made on a low budget, with no big names - but is probably my favourite film of all time. It is the kind of film you wish would go on forever.R-T-C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So I liked it (Some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel sorry for that poor bugger who shut off the VCR during the "Cardboard crowd" scene. If s/he'd just held on for another 5 minutes, s/he would have been in for a treat.The first time I saw this movie would have been around 1987 or so, on the now-defunct cable channel "SelectTV". (Mom and Dad had a satellite dish in the days when they were fiberglass monstrosities 10 feet across.) They showed Swarzenegger vehicles like "Commando" during the day, soft-core porn at night (which, in the late 80s, was merely edited-down hardcore porn from the late 70s), and then they'd throw in the odd film gem like "The Quiet Earth." I guess you could say that it was my first foray into "foreign" films.Having been a sci-fi fan from the very day I first saw "Star Wars" at the tender age of 5, I found this to be a very intriguing movie. No warp drives, BEM's (Bug-Eyed Monsters), laser cannons, or annoyingly cute robots (see "Silent Running"...&lt;&lt;shudder&gt;&gt;). Just an end of the world story about a man who may have contributed to the end of the world. Things get spicy when he meets one other survivor, a plucky redhead who appears to be attracted to balding, paunchy scientist-nerds. Oh what the hell, it led to the greatest bare-bum scene in filmdom, until it was surpASSed by "Braveheart".Another guy shows up, a Maori warrior, and the triangle is in motion. Amazingly enough, plucky redheads prefer big black men over shlumpy white men. (And if I were her, so would I.) Then the solution to the "What happened to the whole world?" problem appears to fling the scientist-nerd to a far-off world that orbits around a Saturn-like ringed planted. You can see it in his face in the last scene: NOW what the hell will he do to get home?The first half is excellent, the second half is, as many here have opined, somewhat weak. But the whole is better that the sum of its parts. Look carefully at the SciFi section of your local video store, you may be lucky enough to find that they have a copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been very few "Last person alive" films made. The only other one I can think of is "The World, the Flesh and The Devil" (1959). This film is, in many ways, a remake. It has, at first, one man alone, trying to find out what has happened to the rest of the planet. Then, he is joined by a female, before another man turns up, and they fight over the female.The film is very good, and deals with the characters well, especially Zac's insanity in the middle of the film. However, the film is a little open ended. It attempts to provide an explanation as to what happened, and the ending scene, when Zac blows up the research lab doesn't properly provide an explanation as to what happened. Is he in heaven, or has he too been transported to wherever the rest of the planet went?However, overall, a good film worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most excruciatingly boring movies ever made. You would find it more interesting to buy a video of grass growing (in real time). The pretense of the story had some promise, but the plot was poorly executed. Too much time was spent on the psychological degradation of the main character. The female lead (if you want to call her that) might just as well have been played by a mannequin. Even the one scene of intimacy in the movie might just as well have been left out for the shear lack of real emotion portrayed. If you are looking for a good move ... look elsewhere. This one doesn't even qualify as Campy ... it is just boring, bad, and should be kept only as an example of how not to make a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While many people seem to have fond memories of this 1985 film (based on the high ratings), I am baffled as to why.Watching for the first time this year (2008), Quiet Earth comes off as campy, over-dramatic, and just flat out cheesy. The special effects seem like something out of a 60's movie, the actors do things relational-wise that are on a whim, without showing motivation. And the ending is muddled and doesn't explain the last 90 minutes. As the credits role, we are presented with an image that leaves us completely baffled as to what happened. Is the actor in Heaven, or an alternate reality? Who knows? ...but better yet, who cares.Frankly, the best part of the movie was Alison Routledge revealing her perfect backside in scene 10. Other than this, not much to remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To watch or not to watch. You decide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that what most people postulate as to the meaning (what really happened at the end) is, for the most part, wrong. Since the movie is not only not based on much science to begin with, and since what took place during the movie is not well explained at all, it leaves every possibility possible. My take on the movie is probably different than most people - and that is that they could not come up with a good ending so they left it hanging big time. Sort of what they do with special effects when the monster is not very good, they shoot it dark and or with strobe lights, and or fast, and or at angles that leave a lot to be desired. That is not to say that any of these methods cover up a good special effect as certain methods actually enhance the effect such as in Alien. I was giving the movie an 8 plus until the ending. It is now a 6. It's a shame they did not do a good ending as literally all aspects of the movie were great including music scores, special effects, acting, basic story line and so on. I will say this though - the movie is interesting. It was probably shot on a small budget with unknown actors (and very few of those)and in a limited time frame. So for that, the movie is actually a 9 under those conditions if I take the ending out. Since it is not trying to be the great SCI-FI movie of the year I would recommend it to SCI-FI fans that may want something different and are not concerned with any real logic of science or even speculation. If endings that leave one with the basic thought of "what the hey", bother you, then this movie is not for you. However, if you like movies that move slow yet hold your interest like "I had to keep watching to see what was going to happen next", then this one will do that.</fullReview>

I can still see why, but it was not the film I first thought it would be. Any film that has as a plot the fact a chap wakes up and there is nobody left in the world is OK by me. It's a favourite plot line and gets the imagination running in every direction. Sadly this film doesn't live-up to the high expectations, though there may not be any film that could. The mumbling performance of Bruno Lawrence isn't the best and the promising start crumbles somewhat as he goes mad then meets a, surprise, surprise, young girl whose also survived the 'effect'. The silly science doesn't help matters and heaven knows what the ending is all about. I can cope with a thoughtful, puzzling finish but this was too daft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one of the most thought-provoking cinematic pieces I have ever seen that tackled one of the largest and oldest of the metaphysical realities that face our self-awareness.....control. This movie goes everywhere with this underlying theme and wraps it with an interesting science-fiction shell the likes of a Philip K. Dick short without the government. Movies like this can't have sequels nor documentaries, and for good reason. What you walk away with is something that can't be necessarily explained, but every logical mind that bothers to watch this film will be intrigued for years with its material.The film goes in several directions and spears into dozens of emotions while maintaining the plot. It is with this fantastic subtle effort that allows it be approachable by just about every intellectual profession from psychology to molecular chemistry. Without explaining the entire story through, a scientist awakes to find he's the last human on an otherwise unchanged earth. After the subsequent adventures of living without order or social consequence his sanity and logic are challenged through his solitude. During his investigations of the "quiet earth" event that he finds himself in he uncovers the unweaving of scientific constants such as the properties of electrons and space/time in a showcase that creates an atmospheric combination of rational fear and uneasy dread. In the midst of the loneliness and confusion from his findings he finds two fellow "survivors" and establishes to this very day what could only be considered one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. It's flawless and you will spend hours trying to figure out how to react.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed Sci-Fi plot filled with drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is way over-rated (7.1/10 as of this writing). I read several reviews hailing this a out-of-the-ordinary science fiction movie, without involving green aliens, laser blasts, space ships, etc. Well, despite doing away with all the usual sci-fi clichés of Hollywood, its plot has way too many gaping holes.For one thing, it intends to emphasize the atmosphere of solitude experienced by the main characters, especially by Zac, and to achieve this it relies on the severely mistaken notion that the world can come to a stand-still when 99.999999% of the human population simply vanishes. Anybody ever read Stephen King's "The Stand"? Or seen the depiction of post-apocalyptic chaos in TV series like "Babylon 5"? When people vanish, ovens don't turn themselves off, cars don't come to orderly halt, nuclear power plants don't just shut down gracefully. Huge fires would burn up the cities, most roads would be blocked by massive accidents and pile-ups, all food would rot; in short, all hell should break loose. And yet, in "The quiet Earth", the characters seem to have no trouble driving around town, picking up groceries and hardware supplies, and use electronic devices anywhere anytime they feel inclined to.Some may argue that story is based on the premise that these characters were "transported" to a parallel universe, where the normal laws of physics don't apply. Well, if that is the case, it is just too convenient to twist the Universe to provide for the needs of three human beings at every twist and turn, and the film makes no substantiable effort in showing how this parallel universe is different from ours, except for a few vague hints here and there about how the "charge of the electron is now different", etc.The only redeeming quality of this film is its study into the human psyche, in portraying the effects of isolation and boredom on individuals. Even then, this is based on the hypothetical premise that these individuals have all their physical needs met, and only have to contend with the fact that they have no sense of purpose, and no good idea of what had happened to their world. Api got introduced into the story line way too late, and his interactions and relationship with the other two characters had to be developed in such a hurry that the behavior of these characters became far too irrational in the second-half of the movie. Then add a pointless sex scene, and we find ourselves gravitating back towards Hollywood clichés, for lack of a better way to make the ending interesting.As for the final scene, the scenery was beautiful, but they just had to strike another chop to the already dead credibility of this movie. Couldn't they at least get one thing right, i.e. show Zac freezing to death on the surface of Titan, the only moon of Saturn with a sea... of liquid methane?My score: 4 out of 10, and I'm being generous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've ever seen "On the Beach" then you'll immediately know that this film is about the end of the world. Of course both have different story lines. With this you'll get some kind of Global US run Science experiment has gone wrong. With "On the Beach" you get a Nuclear explosion has happened and they're waiting for it to reach Australia.Oddly enough both of these films are based in Australia but this one needed a lot of script work. To make it interesting. It didn't happen. My guess is that this was suppose to be similar to the aforementioned film but they disguised the premise as a Global Science experiment gone wrong instead of Nuclear War. This film didn't have the star power to carry it off. You'll sit and watch the only 3 people left in Australia sitting around talking about life and wondering what happened. The one lead is a scientist on the Science project and knows what needs to be done to reverse the effect. During all this we get the 3 people left on earth looking back on how they got there or what they were doing before this happened.I wished I would have come across another title to fill my time but this was what was around. If your looking for a Nuclear End of the World scenario type of film then try Threads or On the Beach or the Miracle Mile. All of these are way more effective and have a far superior cast than this low budget Australian flick.</fullReview>

Fruitlessly, he scours the land for others only to find there is simply no one else. He slowly starts to piece the mystery together (disease, nuclear holocaust, science experiment gone haywire). Then a wrinkle is added, the hero finds there are other survivors, and alliances are made to fend off ghastly mutants or each other. Further wrinkles come into play when those alliances shift and betrayals start, and it becomes a last-ditch effort for survival for the protagonist(s).We've seen this scenario plenty of times in the sci-fi genre, but not quite like "The Quiet Earth," New Zealand's answer to the apocalyptic last-man-on-earth nightmare. The film opens with a long shot into a rising yellow sun before settling in on the naked cadaver of Zac Hobson (the late Bruno Lawrence), a New Zealand-bred computer techie who had been working on "Project Flashlight," an American-financed experiment to build an energy grid that would allow war planes to circle the globe indefinitely without the need to refuel.Only thing is, at 6:12 A.M. on a clear July morning, everybody and every living thing on earth simply disappears. So when poor Zac Hobson gets himself together and toots his car's horn in futility trying to get an answer, he finally realizes after much contemplation of the implications of his actions in science that he really is the last man on earth. So for about 45 minutes, it's the Bruno Lawrence show, live and uncut, as he takes up residence in New Zealand's Playboy Mansion, tries on expensive wardrobe he could never afford in his previous life, gives Caesar-like speeches to cardboard cut-outs of famous people (Adolf Hitler, the late Pope John Paul II, Queen Elizabeth) and proclaiming himself God, and takes time out to go skinny-dipping in the Pacific Ocean.Zac still feels he's not alone, however, like somebody is just lurking in the shadows watching his every move. So even though there are no flesh-hungry mutants chasing him, he instead finds lovely Joanne (Alison Routledge) and the two strike up a friendship that seems to never blossom into something more. The two go about trying to find other survivors and never luck out, and sleep in other people's houses as they travel the countryside and pondering what to do in a world where there is no one else.A third person is found, a paranoid Maori trucker named Api (Pete Smith), who's secretly got an arsenal. Zac, using his computer and technological skills to his personal benefit, deduces that the experiment he'd been working on somehow backfired, causing a rift in the universe that fundamentally altered space and time and ultimately wiped out every living organism on the planet, and the end of the world is only the beginning of something much more grave.This is a chilling and engaging sci-fi thriller. While not a splash in the United States, it is obvious that this movie has a strong allegorical subtext about the place of man. Our hero played by Bruno Lawrence gives the best performance of the three leads. We see his despair over living alone in a world and it is only through his extended bout of isolation that he starts to learn the meaning of companionship. We see his longing for more human contact, his contemplation of suicide once or twice, and his ultimate descent into going bonkers. There are also some slight comedic moments with Lawrence, but mostly only lead to some other tragic elements. It's one of the great performances from an actor who would never know fame in his lifetime.The director is Geoff Murphy, working from the novel of the same title by Craig Harrison. Murphy keeps a nice pace for the first two acts but lets things slip a little when we realize that Zac Hobson is not the only man alive. I guess that's the problem with end-of-the-world-and-am-I-the-last-man-alive movies, you just can't let the hero be the last man on earth. Murphy does have a strong visual sense, including a number of wide-angle shots of the exotic New Zealand landscape, and there is one particularly spooky sequence where Hobson searches through the wreckage of a downed airliner only to find seat-belts wrapped around the waists of bodies that aren't there.Apparently, "The Quiet Earth" is slowly building up a nice afterlife on home video and DVD. It is clear that it's working from a limited budget but those limitations do give rise to an impressive first half of a gloomy movie. It was obviously influenced by films such as "The Omega Man" (1971) and there is even a slight gag riff from "Dawn of the Dead" (1978). I can also see its influence on more recent films as well, including "28 Days Later..." in 2002. My only gripe with these movies is as follows: I only wish that in the next movie, the last man alive could really be the last man alive for once.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a crappy "sci-fi" movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I thought that I could enjoy nice "lost gem" type of old school sci- fi movie but instead I got bucket of s**t. 7.1 on IMDb? People have totally lost their senses. I'd say that I have somewhat good taste in movies but this was total crap at all levels. One of the worst acting I've ever encountered, unlikable stupid characters, bad script, bad effects, boring story, and a cherry on the cake: no sci-fi at all! No, talking about electrons to a tape recorder doesn't count as a sci-fi! There is absolutely nothing sci-fi in this movie. I checked out the that nice cover image with a blue eerie landscape and some Saturn kind of planet popping up from horizon but damn, that's a hoax to let you believe there is actually something sci-fi happening. Sorry if I "spoiled" your wishes about this movie.The main character, "doctor" the baldie, is The dumbest "doctor/scientist" ever. He seems to be like truck driver in a suit. The way he speaks, behaves and even looks like doesn't hint any kind of intelligence that should be required from a man of science. A total miscast. The girl, the token black dude, both horrible actors too. You haven't seen bad acting until you see these guys in action I tell you that much. Perhaps some actor students can use this material to learn how NOT to act.Why is this turd getting such a high rates? All the cast and their relatives and their relatives have visited here to throw 10? I downloaded this crap for free and still feel ripped off. I give this 2/10 instead of 1/10 because this painful borefest lasts under two hours. Can't think anything else positive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's okay, I guess...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, basically a man wakes up and gradually realizes he's the only one left around his area, possibly the world. Well, turns out he's not alone and befriends a woman and later a man (no haven't given away anything). Anyway, it's a story about that relationship (one woman, two men, see some tension?). That's fine, I guess (although I really didn't feel a strong connection with any of the characters). However, I come from a scientific background and I just don't like it when a movie does less than a quarter-assed attempt at matching situation with science. At least throw some scientific explanation out there. They really didn't. Science fiction should at least hold some plausibility and this didn't.This story could have been about three stranded people and it would have been about the same story. Because of that, I felt cheated that it was made out to be sci-fi. Watch Gattaca for, IMO, the *best* example of true science-fiction -- where you simply cannot have the story without the scifi. 6-7/10-Mark</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less than meets the eye.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&lt;**SPOILERS**&gt; As there is really not much to spoil.What is worse? A sci-fi movie that let's you know that it is junk early on (so it can be turned off) or one that starts out well, meanders for an hour or so, then finally comes to nothing (luring its victim into watching the whole thing)? This movie is the the latter category. It looks good. It's not major big budget effects but the modest effects it does have are not tacky. Good not great. The story concerns three characters (Old Smart Guy, Young Woman, Hunky Young Ethnic) that are the only three left in the world. The first, OSG, wakes up (in that cinema rarity, full frontal male nudity) to find that he seems to be the only person on a undamaged earth (except where planes crash etc). I mean the ONLY person, living or dead, as there are very few bodies or little piles of white dust or anything. There also appears to be no living things other than humans either, the earth is indeed quiet. OSG does the usual last man on earth things, looks for survivors, gets on the radio (sure to reach everyone who scans the police bands all day), gathers up useful and delicious things, gets drunk, makes speeches to cut-outs of famous people, tries on women's clothes, the usual. So far so good. Then YM turns up. OK. Not much happens as OSG investigates what happened, and YM investigates the empty stores. There is a little (very little, and that's good) sex segment with OSG in bed (another full frontal), and YM going bottomless behind her maid/nurse/whatever outfit (crotch gag goes here, comic relief?). Next, enter HYE, as he cunningly traps OSG at machine gun point but turns out to be OK after he sees YM soon after. (Good news: no automatic sex, no violence, no rape etc) Now we are on "Five" and "World, Flesh and the Devil" territory but not much develops. OSG turns out to have been a scientist involved in the program that did all this and he determines that the device involved will make it happen again soon. Perhaps you are wondering why these lucky people are still here? Turns out that being near death at the critical instant is the key. I am not impressed but at least it does go easy on the well-worn "long tunnel into the light" stuff. Action with trucks to get explosives to blow up the machine fills up the next few minutes. OSG goes forward to suicide bomb the building where the device is. So what else? (I guess the tension is just too much...) HYE and YM (finally) rip off their draperies for a little perfunctory leg-over (perfunctory apart from the interracial angle perhaps, another edgy element to complement the nudity?)just in case the world ends (as if Jay in "Dogma" HAD gotten his wish). OSG blows the thing up, lights flash, OSG is on a beach (is he On The Beach?) on a dark earth with a Saturn-like object in the sky looking much bigger than the moon. THE END. What happened? Where did HYE and YM go? Is the earth out by Saturn now? (If so shouldn't OSG be flash frozen along with the waves offshore?) Is Saturn near the earth? (The gravitational issues here boggle the mind) Is there any prospect at all of a future humanity? Your guess is as good as mine. In short we have another one of those "leave it up to the viewer", BS, cop-out, non-ending with what is supposed to be an impressive visual.This movie is a major disappointment as it starts out looking like the real thing, meanders becoming neither really interesting, nor steamy, nor real trash to finally peter out into mush. No message, no moral, no point and nowhere near enough "oh, Wow!" to compensate with mindless entertainment for what is lacking as literature. It is mercifully brief at 90 minutes. It would have been REALLY annoying have sat through a "Solaris" sized epic for what this delivers.The movie is based on a novel. I wonder if the novel is really much better but, as so often happens, not much more than its title got into the movie. (This was the case with the sorry movie "Freejack" "based on" the fine novel "Immortality Inc". In that case it was a spectacular car crash not a title that was only thing that made it into the movie.) I recommend that you flip it once on Netflix if you must, but it is definitely no masterpiece and, for me at least, a long way from a keeper. Three for the movie, one more for looking good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lunchtime Quiz... (spoilers within)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would agree with another contributing viewer who wrote in their review for this movie that this movie can be split into parts with the first being when we see Zac's experiences as the only person left on earth, and second, when he finds surviving companionship from a young girl and a burly man. Likewise, I would agree that the first half is indeed better, that the story detracts once more characters and situations encumber the plot, and that the ending is horribly confusing. Otherwise, it could've been the making of a great movie.You can get an idea what this movie is about if you have ever seen 'Night of the Comet.' Scientific endeavors have gone horribly wrong and wiped out the human race. We are left to share the experiences of the last remaining people on the earth who must come to grips with their lot. What are they to do? How are they to survive? Loot the stores. Stay where you like. Do whatever it is you want to. For Zac, our leading man (at least initially), this may seem like fun at first, but the isolation becomes very desperating, forcing him into an almost caveman kind of existence. This is interesting as we start to see Zac break down and try to figure everything. While still trying to maintain some semblence of sanity, Zac tries to figure out what went wrong with the scientist's experiment, as the effects are far from over. Of course, we get distracted from this when Zac finds companionship. First from a young girl who soon enough, also comes to be his love interest. They go scouring the country for other survivors and Zac is working on plans to test the atmosphere and so forth in the meantime. That is, until they come upon yet another survivor, although they are more violently approached. And they all start to form a reluctant bond, tested by their suspicions of each other's loyalty because of course, Zac liked having a loving friend all to himself (especially a girl). This becomes an awful power struggle. This is where it gets confusing. In the first place, it is hard to figure out what the heck has happened, because we are thrown back and forth between explanations of what impending doom is still lurking in the atmosphere (and how to remedy that) and the building distrust of each other. Suddenly living alone looked pretty good. And it gets to be confusing to the point that I started to wish we were just sticking to the story of Zac alone as the last person on Earth. ***********************************************************************THERE ARE DEFINITELY SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT-YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! There are two major things that I had trouble figuring out in this story. The first is how the three companions came to survive the disaster. It wasn't simple like Night of the Comet, where whoever was standing outside at the time to watch the comet were the ones who were wiped out. But, in Quiet Earth, things aren't so simple. At first it seemed that those who felt super depressed got a second chance at life, but then I would expect a whole lot more than three survivors. I still can't figure out why they were the three that made it. Or how exactly everyone died. And the second problem I have is with the ending. I can't figure out how, if Zac strapped explosives on the truck he was driving and rammed it into the lab, why was he the only survivor? Or was this some sort of dream state?********************************************************************** NO MORE SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!So I would definitely agree with the other viewer who wrote that this movie could've been good if they had only stuck to the part of Zac being the last living survivor.It would be so cool to just go through the psyche and everything else of a person faced with such isolation. How long would they wish to go on living that way?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE QUIET EARTH (Geoff Murphy, 1985) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the runaway box-office success of the Australian &#x201c;Mad Max&#x201d; films, it was time for New Zealand to jump on the Apocalyptic Sci-Fi bandwagon. However, what they (or, more precisely, director Murphy) came up with was quite different &#x2013; being closer to Art-house than Exploitation&#x2026;which is why one is surprised to see it released as a &#x201c;Special Edition&#x201d; DVD by Blue Underground.The film is highlighted by an evocative score and, of course, the splendid cinematography of the awesomely desolate locations &#x2013; perfect for this type of parable (best of all, perhaps, is the image of a crashed plane in the town center). For the first 35 minutes or so of this eerie and thoughtful work, Bruno Lawrence (who also co-wrote the script) is the only on-screen character: this segment (necessarily slow-moving but enjoyable since, in order to take his mind off the sheer loneliness of his situation, Lawrence is able to indulge his every whim &#x2013; which he sometimes does with childish glee) actually constitutes the core of THE QUIET EARTH. Hence, we listen to his endlessly looped radio pleas for other survivors to contact him &#x2013; as well as watch him enact a Nazi-like mass rally in a massive garden, wear feminine garb (for the hell of it), and even witness his desperate (if uproarious for those in the mood!) challenge to God inside a church: appear before him (as if to provide answers to his myriad questions), or else he&#x2019;ll &#x201c;shoot the kid&#x201d;&#x2026;which he promptly does by repeatedly blasting through a huge crucifix! Eventually, the hero&#x2019;s joined by a red-headed woman and a Maori (a New Zealand native akin to the Australian aborigine) &#x2013; sparking inevitable comparison with the similar racial theme running through the much earlier THE WORLD, THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1959); for the record, I also own a copy of the latter but have yet to watch it. The last half-hour, then, is taken up by some conventional love-triangle confrontations but this doesn&#x2019;t detract from the film&#x2019;s overall sobriety (especially since it becomes apparent that the catastrophe that had devastated the earth was apt to be repeated). Incidentally, the belated revelation of just why the trio came to survive the end of the world is most ironic (and, in the case of Lawrence, quite moving &#x2013; since he&#x2019;s a scientist who was actually at work on the project which doomed our planet in the first place)! He&#x2019;s determined to atone for the folly he was party to &#x2013; which leads to the abrupt, somewhat puzzling yet beautiful conclusion&#x2026; By the way, Murphy &#x2013; who had previously directed the acclaimed UTU (1983) &#x2013; would subsequently go mainstream in Hollywood with such films as YOUNG GUNS II (1990) and FREEJACK (1992; which followed this viewing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing happens in this movie, I mean nothing. A lot of chit chat about nothing and then that is followed but a whole lot more nothing. I don't mean to be harsh of the country that brought us Lucy Lawless. But this is a real crapper and a snooze fest. First of all, what was the purpose of the insane experiment? What did it really do, they never explain that. Second, if it didn't effect people who were sleeping, then why weren't there more people alive? After all half the world is asleep while the other half is awake, that's how it works and if it wasn't that. Then why were these people spared while the rest of the world was destroyed? If they all were sent to that strange alien world like Zac is at the end when he tries and fails to fix his mistake. Then where were they? Exploring that would have been more interesting story then the story they try to tell and fail to do. THE NOOSE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing Storyline, Poor Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The scientist Zac Hobson (Bruno Lawrence) wakes up in the morning and sooner he finds that he seems to be alone in the world. He drives around unsuccessfully seeking out other survivors and tries to figure out what might have happened. After a few days, he shows traces of insanity due to the loneliness.Out of the blue, Zac finds Joanne (Alison Routledge) and they stay together looking for survivors. Zac meets the distrustful black Api (Peter Smith) and Zac explains that he believes that the project that he was researching in the government laboratory might have caused the phenomenon. Now the trio decides to blow-up the laboratory to stop the experiment.The overrated "The Quiet Earth" has an intriguing storyline, but unfortunately with poor execution. The plot is a sort of "The Last Man on Earth" or "The Omega Man" without the threatening creatures. The lead actor never convinces as a scientist and the director could be bolder regarding the relationship of Joanne with Zac and Api. Further, the writer and the director seem to be completely lost with the premise and do not know how to end their mess; so they use a beautiful image to end the film and the viewer does not really get the meaning of the ending. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "Terra Tranquila" ("Calm Esrth")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this probably is one of the worst movies ever made and I generally love sci-fi movies. It's a big waste of time and should only be seen if you like independent low budget "talk" movies. It's more like a drama then anything else. The idea for the movie could be made good and believable but the result is terrible. The acting ain't something to cheer for and the scenery looks like something ripped right out of Mad Max but with out the specific touch from the above mentioned movie. This put together makes it hard to believe that this scenario is possible and there for the whole movie fails.

On the other hand if you like sci-fi with a plot, likable characters, and logic, then stay away by all means. The movie explains nothing, and is quiet to the extreme. Boring, with boring characters. If you want intelligent sci-fi that is entertaining, "Enemy Mine" is you film. Three aimless wanderers, uttering nonsense for ninety minutes is what you get with "The Quiet Earth". To make matters worse there is a love triangle thrown in also. Perhaps this would have worked as a "Twilight Zone" episode, but as a feature film, it is totally unacceptable. - MERK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zac Is Legend?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A mans awakens to find himself alone in the world"... When you read the one-sentence summary of "The Quiet Earth", you can't help getting reminded of Richard Matheson's famous novel "I Am Legend" which also received no less than three major cinema adaptations already. This movie does indeed also revolve on the last man on earth and his desperate search for fellow survivors, but that's pretty much where the comparisons stop. Right from the opening credits sequence ? which shows the sun rising very sloooooowly ? you promptly realize that the content and particularly the style of this movie will be a lot more sober, serious, depressing and intellectual than for example "The Omega Man" starring Charlton Heston. This story doesn't feature post-apocalyptic zombie monsters or albino mutants, but the pseudo-scientific script is nonetheless equally compelling and disturbing ? if not even more so. Zac Hobson is the inexplicable and rather reluctant sole survivor of an ecological disaster that seemingly caused all people to vaporize. He then comes to the painful conclusion that a miscalculation in the secretive energy-project he was working on for the government caused mankind's extinction and subsequently goes mad. Hope returns when he finally encounters two other survivors ? first a woman, then another man ? and the trio attempts to pick up their lives again together. However, jealously, greed and the continuous fear of another ecological disaster put a lot of pressure on their life-style. "The Quiet Earth" is quite an unusual outing in the Sci-Fi genre, especially since it got released during the mid-80's when the genre was dominated by excessively violent movies stuffed with hideous monsters and immensely fancy space-ships. This is a story and atmosphere driven accomplishment with smooth dialogs, witty oppressed humor and complex character drawings. Multiple elements in the script are unique and downright brilliant, like for example Zac's long period of isolation (where he declares himself ruler of the world, dresses up in women's clothes and has conversations with a cardboard statue of Adolf Hitler) and the clarification of how exactly the three managed to survive. Unfortunately the production's biggest trumps are eventually also what degenerates the wholesome a little. The ultimately slow pacing make it difficult to remain focused constantly and the complexity becomes so immense that I didn't even understand what the whole ending was all about. Bruno Lawrence gives a stellar performance as Zac, the Auckland filming locations are deeply impressive and the sad musical score adds extra moodiness to the film. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sort of like a boring reworking of two prior films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Quiet Earth" is a lot like a reworking of two movies--"The World, The Flesh and The Devil" and "The Last Woman on Earth". All three films concern the sudden disappearance of most people from the planet and concerns three (a woman and two men) who try to eek out survival in this post-apocalyptic world. Because the idea has been done twice before, you can't give "The Quiet Earth" kudos for originality.The film begins with a very ordinary looking man (Bruno Lawrence) awakening and finding everyone seems to be gone. He spends much of his time looking for other people but very soon despairs and starts to lose his mind. However, he's pulled out of his madness when he discovers a lady (Alison Routledge) and together they continue looking for more survivors. Eventually they meet up with Pete Smith--who seems even more unstable than they are. In fact, I never really understood his character--as he wavered from seeming normal to being a bit of a psycho. Of course, Bruno did the same thing...just not quite as badly. Regardless, later in the film Bruno announces he knows what has happened to everyone--and his answer truly sounds bizarre and confusing. Ultimately the film ends...and I have absolutely no idea whatsoever what exactly happened at the end...or why.So, the plot is VERY confusing and seemed a bit slapped together and the characters were just plain weird. All in all, I was initially bored and then irritated at the film's brain-bleeding finale. I wanted to like this but just couldn't. I say see either of the other two films instead--especially "The World, The Flesh and The Devil".</fullReview>
