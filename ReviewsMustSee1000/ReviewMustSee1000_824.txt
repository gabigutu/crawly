		<shortDescription>Once timely, now timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great films of the 60s, "In the Heat of the Night" hasn't aged a bit in the four decades since its release and now deserves to be ranked with the great films of all time. Beautifully atmospheric, Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography and Norman Jewison's first rate direction make you feel the humidity of the small Mississippi town in which a black detective teams with the redneck sheriff to solve the murder of an important industrialist.As sheriff Bill Gillespie, Rod Steiger is superb in his Oscar winning role, and this film provides Sidney Poitier with some of his greatest screen moments, including his famous admonition to Steiger that became the title of the less impressive 1970 spin off: "They call me MISTER Tibbs!" This is one of the few politically correct films to make its point without resorting to heavy-handed, sanctimonious preaching. Stirling Silliphant's Oscar winning screenplay never hits a false note, and the change that occurs in the relationship between the leading characters is subtle, and, therefore, believable. The two stars are ably supported by an outstanding cast of both veterans (Lee Grant, Warren Oates, Beah Richards) and newcomers (Scott Wilson, Quentin Dean, and the delightfully creepy Anthony James). The score by Quincy Jones, featuring Ray Charles' rendition of the title song, captures the proper mood throughout. In a year when the odds-makers were predicting an Oscar victory for "Bonnie and Clyde" or "The Graduate," "In the Heat of the Night" surprised the prognosticators by taking the Best Picture prize and four other Oscars. Considering its theme of racial tolerance, it seemed an appropriate choice at an Oscar ceremony that was postponed following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The film's theme made it timely, but its artistry makes it timeless. The Academy made the right choice.Brian W. Fairbanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>flawless movie, deserved Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many bad "issues" movies out there, but this is not one of them. In a bad movie, all of the racist characters would be one dimensional and one hundred percent evil; here, Steiger is allowed to play a prejudiced man who is actually sympathetic and capable of growth (hence the Oscar). In a great twist, Virgil Tibbs himself is shown to be capable of prejudice, as he pursues Endicott without sufficient evidence. It's refreshing to see a movie that portrays the entire spectrum of racism, from the crazy extremists (and there are plenty of those on hand here) to the more subtly prejudiced. "Mississippi Burning," a weaker effort, is not only more tediously didactic, but also less progressive; that film doesn't feature a protagonist like Virgil Tibbs, and instead focuses on the actions of two white federal agents. In this case, the old movie really is the better movie; produced at the height of the civil rights struggle, "In the Heat of the Night" feels more immediate and passionate than preachy films on the subject that were made years later, after the tension had died down. Some reviewers complain that the mystery segments of the film are confusing, but I follow them without much trouble. Tibbs does a great Sherlock Holmes routine throughout, as he pieces together the solution based on clues that are also available to viewers. Sure, the ending is surprising, but it doesn't come entirely out of left field; I actually admire the subtle ways that clues are sewn throughout the film. If you're not used to mysteries, the barrage of red herrings and dead-end clues might surprise you, but it's pretty standard stuff for the genre.I knew about the classic line "They call me Mr. Tibbs!" long before I actually saw this movie. I used to wonder why the line was so famous; it doesn't sound that exciting, does it? But when I finally heard Poitier say it in context, I asked my brother to pause the tape so I could cheer without missing any of the subsequent dialog. That's how excited I get during this movie. The performances are so naturalistic, and the racial conflict so vividly drawn, that I get pulled into the action completely. Though 1967 was a strong year for films, I still think that the right one got Best Picture, and not just because it was topical; "In the Heat of the Night" is a well-directed, superb character study, populated by some of the most vivid characters I've ever encountered in a movie. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They call me Mister Tibbs!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether he likes it or not, Sidney Poitier will always be remembered first and foremost as the first black actor to continuously star alongside and above his white counterparts. Just look at the opening credits to "In the Heat of the Night" and you will see that not only does he get an above the title starring credit with method maniac Rod Steiger, but his name also appears first. Something that could have easily been switched around and overlooked considering the importance of each character. But for this socially aware thriller born of the turbulent sixties, it had to be, most definitely, a conscious choice.For Poitier, this film, along with "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?", marks the last of his civil rights driven roles in which his character's race is an all important plot element. From "Edge of the City" to "The Defiant Ones", Poitier excelled in bringing intelligent and commanding three dimensional characters to life. A feat he had to succeed at if his films were to gain the trust of a predominantly white audience and push for racial equality. Call him the Jackie Robinson of Hollywood.When we first see Poitier as Virgil Tibbs, he is stepping off the train in the small Mississippi town of Sparta. Although we can only see him from the waist down, we do get a quick glimpse of his hand and from that we are aware of his race. An important fact for the audience to dwell on later when Rod Steiger as sheriff Gillespie, standing over a dead body on Main Street, and calls for his deputy to round up any strangers for questioning. From that moment on, director Norman Jewison establishes the racial tension that will only grow more and more intense as the film goes on.Sometimes, the film is far from subtle in exploring the issue of racism. Endicott's plantation, complete with tall white pillars and a black jockey lawn ornament to guard them, is a perfect example. What starts off as a surprisingly civil conversation between Tibbs and Endicott quickly turns heated and unpredictable. From that moment on, the experience will serve to cloud Tibbs' judgment and bring his own flaws to the surface, making him almost as complex a character as Gillespie. And it is the complexity of Gillespie that got Steiger the Best Actor Oscar over Poitier in 1968. This man has heart, but not made of gold, and his motivations are far from pure. He is simply a man who believes in doing his job, and doing it as just as possible - even if it means arresting a friend for murder. Take for an example the scene in which Tibbs is surrounded by a gang of blood thirsty locals. When Gillespie arrives to save the day, he simply gives them a warning and tells them to go home. It is only when they insult him personally that he becomes angry and takes a swing. His action is just - his motivation almost vain.In the end, after the murder is solved and racial injustice is swept back under the rug, Tibbs and Gillespie say their farewells and continue on with their very different lives. Each one better off for knowing the other.Rating [on a 5 star system] : 5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sun Has Set -- And You're Still Here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pauline Kael remarked at the time of the release of this movie that Hollywood seemed to have divided the United States into three parts. There was New York. There was The South. And then there was everything else. This is a story of "The South," circa 1968, with African-Americans as a second and much lower caste in the cotton-picking, sweltering South. The story is well known. Sidney Poitier is Virgil Tibbs, an expert homicide detective from Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) who is told by his Chief of Police (Rizzo, no friend of blacks, as I know from living in Philadelphia at the time) to assist the local cops in the solution of an economically important murder. Tibbs' identity as a homicide cop is only revealed, in a funny scene, after he has been arrested for the murder by the pragmatic and inept local constabulary. Thereafter, he is nudged into helping them by their wheedling encouragement and his own arrogance. Lo! He solves the murder! Well, in truth, the solution isn't really important. Something to do with abortion and who's responsible, but it's a minor matter. And actually the final scene is unbelievable. Poitier, about to be slaughtered by a gang of murderous and thoroughly organized rednecks who have all kinds of guns pointed at him, stymies them all by simply saying, "Look in her purse." In a Faulkner short story, the movie would have ended right there. There are three things that make this movie worth repeated viewing. One is the ethos of the film. The second is the acting. And the third is the production itself. The ethos of the film, by which I mean the values it examines, are locked into the 1960s, and even earlier. I recall hitchhiking through the South (Maryland, actually) and still seeing signs at the time reading "Colored Only" over the rest rooms. And an African-American friend who took pictures of such arrangements being followed out of town by a short string of local cars and stopped for questioning. The film reflects a dangerous and hate-filled time which Southerners have finally overcome, thank God. And yet this same ethos lives on in the minds of some Southern whites and even more African-Americans, not reflected in on-the-ground behavioral reality, but in beliefs. I taught for years in a Southern mostly African-American university before I came to realize how important this myth is to blacks. To ask them, or anyone else, to give up that history of persecution is to ask them to sacrifice a solidarity that is otherwise unattainable. There is "us" and then there is "them". And "they" are the enemy which draws us together and from which we gain support and succor. There is not much segregation in the South or elsewhere (although it still exists), but there might as well be. From the point of view of any cohesive group, there almost NEEDS to be. Don't human organizations need a history of persecution? The Christians have Nero, Jews have four thousand years of it, including the holocaust, Irish have the British occupation, Moslems have the hejira, Mormons have the assassination of Smith. We -- who have once been treated unjustly -- have Victim Power. You can't understand us unless you've walked a mile in our moccasins.The acting. Rod Steiger deserved his academy award. He's often dismissible but not here. Standing around the initial dead body, worried, he's furiously chewing gum and trying to think of somebody to pin it on. Then he suddenly stops chewing, darts his eyes around, and says, "Couldda been a hitch-hiker." A well-conveyed dramatic moment. Poitier is at least equally good. He was lambasted in some of the press for playing a super-black, a kind of white guy in blackface. The fact is that Poitier was one of the best dramatic actors who has ever appeared on screen, and this is one of his best performances. Oh -- he's put upon, true, but once he gets his transmission in the proper gear he becomes all too human. Showing off in a subtle way, wrong about the town's big time racist being responsible, and Gillespie has his number. "Boy, you're just like the rest of us, ain't you." Warren Oates adds some much-needed comedy. The bad guy has a face that could clear a room without using a gun. The succulent young woman who is spied upon by the Oates' character should be squirted all over with whipped cream spray and eaten alive. Perhaps the funniest scene in the move is when she describes Oates taking her down to the cemetery and rolling around together on the cool marble slabs. Steiger stops chewing again, looks up in amazement, and asks, "Sam did THAT?" Not so much that he's shocked at his deputy's depravity, just surprised at his imagination!To end this quickly, okay, it was shot in Illinois. But does it capture the small-town South of the time! Two cars racing towards an empty garage and the camera shows us the squealing tires stirring up dust -- and a pile of burning, smoking garbage, which is what it's all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Crafted Murder Mystery With A Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is a well-crafted murder mystery with a twist. Sidney Poitier is a big city detective wrongfully arrested by a racist small police detachment after the brutal murder of the town's would-be financial savior. Once the matter is resolved and Poitier released, he finds himself aiding his former captors, including Police Chief Rod Steiger, in their quest to get to the bottom of the crime.An Academy Award winner for Best Picture, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT works on so many levels. It's a solid, unpredictable whodunit with beautiful cinematography and crisp direction from Norman Jewison. All the actors are on top of their games, particularly Steiger, whose not-entirely-likable chief gradually looks past his prejudices to warm up to Poitier. Poitier is his usual superb self, once again maintaining his vast dignity as the target of bigotry, much like he did in THE DEFIANT ONES.And like THE DEFIANT ONES, a key theme in IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is racism. In fact the racism on display here is so fierce and perverse that it's almost hard to believe (though I'm sure it didn't stretch a thing). You can't help but feel an emotional attachment to Poitier as he's subjected to taunts, attempted attacks, and off-color remarks from those who either don't realize the power of their words or don't care. Poitier proves again why he is perhaps the finest African-American actor ever to grace the screen.IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is one of those movies that, while not perfect, is impossible to dislike. It's classic, though still relevant, entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deserved to win the Academy Award for best picture of 1967 -- just as Rod Steiger deserved to win Best Actor. In the Heat of the Night has it all though. What seems like a relatively simple case, turns into a complex murder mystery. I defy you to solve the mystery before the final minutes!As if the mystery wasn't enough, the film is a sociologists' text book example on prejudice and privilege. This movie hasn't aged a bit -- one of the classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect American Murder Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rod Steiger won best actor, deserved it, and was matched eyebrow for eyebrow by Sidney Poitier's Unforgettable Creation of Mr. Virgil Tibbs, police detective. The supporting cast is perfect, with Beah Richards, William Prince, and Scott Wilson as special standouts. The dialogue by Siliphant is crisply written, the direction by Jewison is non-pareil, and the mystery is difficult and resolves things perfectly. As an overall American mystery, I must vote for this even over the Maltese Falcon (which of course is also great). Forget the hit-and-miss TV spin-off and treat yourself to the real thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The essence of modern-day film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best films of all time, a Best Picture Oscar winner, and a highly deserved one at that. After reading a plot summary, it would be easy for someone to classify Norman Jewison's IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT as a simple buddy-cop movie, but it is so much more - this is film-making at it's finest. An absolutely merciless mystery, NIGHT contains some incredibly intense scenes that might make some viewers uncomfortable (the garage confrontation comes immediately to mind).The film is expertly put together, with the feel of heady film noir. The performances are first rate: both Poitier and Rod Steiger were nominated for Best Actor, with the Oscar actually going home to Steiger (the film won four other Oscars as well). The Poitier-Steiger pairing is one of the most potent in film history, and their slowly growing friendship is one of the most touching. is a glowing example of what happens when an excellent cast, director, and screenplay combine to make an exceptional film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through The Mississippi Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gritty realism and a strong performance by Rod Steiger rev up the technical quality of this taut drama about a visiting Northern Black detective named Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) who gets nailed as a suspect, foolishly, in the murder of a local VIP, in a small town in Mississippi. Eventually, the town's White police chief, the gum chewing Gillespie (Rod Steiger), accepts Tibbs' innocence. And the two of them then work together, reluctantly, to solve the case.Forty years after the film was made, the racial themes seem just a tad heavy-handed. Whites are always backward and racist. And Tibbs is smart, urbane, and sophisticated. But back in the 1960s, the filmmaker probably did need to be blunt. And the point is made that Blacks and Whites, working together, can accomplish worthy aims, even though old Black Joe is still pickin' cotton at the Endicott Cotton Company.As a whodunit, the story is fairly good, convenient coincidences notwithstanding. The clue to the killer's identity is pleasantly subtle.The film's cinematography and production design are terrific. Many scenes take place at night. And the opaque lighting makes for a moody, slightly dangerous look and feel. Loved how they photographed that train moving down the tracks in the Mississippi darkness, a metaphor related to the film's theme. And the sound of a train whistle adds to the mournful realism.Interiors look authentic. The masking tape that covers rips in a big leather chair in Gillespie's shabby office is so true to life. A single white light bulb hangs down from the ceiling in a small neighborhood grocery store, where the shelves are filled with empty fruit jars. And that greasy spoon called Comptons reeks of 1960's Southern rural reality.My only complaint with this film is the background music. Some of the jukebox songs are not consistent with the film's overall tone."In The Heat Of The Night" is a technically well made, and quite interesting, murder mystery. Yet, it will always be remembered, rightfully, as the film that offered hope of racial harmony, during a decade in which there was none. Its "Best Picture" Oscar award is thus explained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Growing Pains of the New South</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to understand what's happening in In the Heat of the Night you have to realize that it is set in a very specific time period. The Civil Rights Act had been passed in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. But the impact of those laws was only beginning to be felt.Especially the Voting Rights Act. The town of Sparta, Mississippi where William Schallert was Mayor and Rod Steiger was sheriff now has a significant new voting population and blacks might be a majority in that county. But even if they aren't, they know have a voice in the electoral process. Someone like Steiger has to take that into account now. Of course some of his deputies might not yet be with the program which explains why when a murder/robbery is committed of a very prominent northern businessman, Warren Oates sees fit to roust Sidney Poitier who's an unfamiliar black face in that town.What a surprise they all get when they find out he's a top Philadelphia, Pennsylvania homicide detective and when his identity is established, his boss in Philly offers his services.Poitier and Steiger both have to work through their prejudices, how each sees the other to solve this mystery which writer Stirling Silliphant gives us several red herrings before we learn the truth. Though Steiger got the Oscar for Best Actor, it should really have been a joint award. Their conflict and growing respect for each other drives the film. Steiger needs his expertise and respects him for that and Poitier comes to respect Steiger for his honesty.Norman Jewison got great performances from his stars and the supporting cast of whom Warren Oates as the dimwit redneck deputy really shines.Though set in a very narrow period of our history, In the Heat of the Night holds up very well with some eternal truths in its story. And it's the story of times that were a changing as one spokesman of the sixties put it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Landmark Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1967 was a turbulent year in the U S. Civil rights marches and demonstrations, anti-war rallies, the summer of love,psychedelic music and backlash against the previously noted, 1967 had it all. And this great movie came out, about a small Mississippi town embroiled in a steaming hot summer and a sizzling murder case. The movie diverges from the book on many aspects, mostly for the better. This is a serious look at a nation and a community in turmoil. The acting is first rate, from Sidney Poitier (one of the greatest American actors of this generation, regardless of race), Rod Steiger, Lee Grant, Warren Oates and the whole passel of townsfolk. The plot has been well outlined in previous posts, so I won't belabor it. My favorite scene is when Virgil examines the deceased, looking for clues in discoloration, type of wound, etc., while the sheriff looks on with his jaw practically on the floor in amazement. You can plainly see that he wanted to pin the crime on a hitch-hiker or one of the town's less desirable inhabitants. While some may see the film as preachy or presenting Virgil as a superior to the hicks, seen in the context of its time, it really tells a lot about race relations of the time. The movie is well filmed with lots of atmospheric detail of the time and region (even though it was filmed in Illinois, some areas of Illinois and Indiana were very Southern in their feel and outlook). Great acting, a good mystery, fine cinematography and an important theme make this a must-see movie. 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>provocative then, still dramatic now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's ironic that a decades-old feature should remind us how best to conduct a murder investigation in the redneck, rural South. Without losing sight of the important peripheral issues (namely bigotry and discrimination), the film concentrates on what ought to be (but usually isn't) the primary concern of any murder mystery: the mystery itself, revealed here in a compelling series of puzzling clues. It's too bad the resolution is weakened by so many plot twists, and by the anti-climactic final unmasking of the killer (in a throwaway gesture resembling a white trash variation of "the butler did it"). But any narrative gaps are well covered by the pair of dynamic star performances. The salt-and-pepper pairing of racial opposites on the same side of the law has long since become a tired cliché, but nothing about the roles is black and white: not Rod Steiger's jaundiced perceptions, nor Sidney Poitier's obsession with solving a crime which has nothing to do with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The White Man's Eunuch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gradualism may have some value in politics. But in art, it just represent a stale, hackneyed period, to be forgotten as soon as we can get on to the real work at hand." - Clifford Mason It's hard to watch Sidney Poitier's "classic" movies these days. In the 50s and 60s he became Hollywood's token black man. The new, upstanding, righteous, handsome, dignified, strangely sex-less, African American, symbolic of progressivism, Civil Rights movements and back-patting, liberal film-makers. Poitier wasn't just an actor, he was a flag bearer, smuggling all that was good and just about "The Negro" into Hollywood. White audiences loved him. Blacks thought he was a joke. Ironically, Poitier got into acting because he was ashamed of his Afro-Caribbean roots, and worked frantically to disguise his West Indian accent. He wanted to be a proper speaking white man. Others used him because they believed that the "Negro image" is best served or rehabilitated by a black version of a white man in grey flannel suits, who takes on white problems and inherits a white man's sense of what's wrong in the world.Most of Poitier's films during this period followed a pattern. Director Stanley Kramer, not one to shy away from middle-brow message movies, had him tied to a white guy in "The Deviant Ones", audience and co-star Tony Curtis learning that "useful black men are our friends too". Meanwhile, "The Bedford Incident" saw Poitier turn his nose up to war mongering white boys whilst snidely calling them "sir". Later, "Duel at Diablo" proved that the black man can also be an Indian killing cowboy, whilst dressed in slick, suave, grey suits of course, and the inspirational "To Sir With Love" saw Poitier playing a sex-less London school teacher whose students learn that "hey, black people are great and make good teachers in white schools". And don't forget "A Patch of Blue", in which Poitier plays a reporter who falls in love with a blind white girl. Typical of Poitier-film reversals, he's well off, suited and suave looking, while she's a dirty white girl from the slums. Their romance is sterile - white audiences weren't ready for interracial smooching - Poitier rescuing the girl and then politely sending her off to a camp for the blind, never to see her again. Then there's "Guess Who's Coming To Diner?", in which Poitier finally gets to kiss a white girl (it's more of a peck), after which he proves he's a better white man than her family of arrogant Caucasians.These films are all entertaining in a sleazy, salacious sort of way, but the fact is that they trade entirely in countercliches and do not, as they proudly claim, change the stereotypes that black actors are subjected to. They are contrivances, art-less, in which Poitier is reduced to a showcase Negro who exists only in the white man's view of him. Always in clean suits, pure of motivation, dignified, surrounded by stupid, mean whites, the Poitier Hero, antiseptic and one-dimensional, always finds himself in a totally white world, with no wife, no sweetheart, no woman, no black friends, and tasked with using his innate goodness to solve white problems for whites. Such "Black Saviour" tales are resurfacing today. Think "Blind Side", "Precious", "The Legend of Bagger Vance", anything with Morgan Freeman and Obama mania.And so "In The Heat of the Night" stars Sidney Poitier as a grey suited, angelic white man in black-face who finds himself trapped in the Deep South. Surrounded by racist, stupid, redneck cops, Poitier spends the first half of the film schooling white boys and proving that blacks are superior to whites at police work, medical examinations, manners, looks and speech. He's an African American Ubermensch.The film was directed by Norman Jewison, though, a director who makes comedies when he's not bludgeoning us with message movies. So "Night" has a sense of humour which your typical Poitier movie doesn't, Poitier's superiority played for laughs, and red-neck inferiority treated as a joke (see "Watermellon Man"). Other good moments include passing shots of workers in fields (alluding, briefly, to the South's reliance on the slave trade) and Poitier's stand-off with a wealthy local. Indeed, though the film is oft touted as being "progressive" for highlighting "white on black" racism, the only thing it deals believably with is "black on white" racism, Poitier learning to check his aggression, stop instinctively blaming wealthy whites, and to work with lug headed whites for a better tomorrow. In contrast, "white on black" racism is treated ridiculously. The film pretends to be progressive but amounts to odious titillation, playing like a lynch mob lynching whites while blacks are schooled on the dangers of stereotyping rich folk with less melanin. It's the kind of film where audiences snicker because a black man slaps the face of a rich, pampered, arrogant, locally powerful white man...but not before he slapped our hero, of course.Aesthetically the film is effective, Jewison capturing the heat, gentle winds and lazy atmosphere of the Deep South, and occasionally treating us to some moody night-time photography. The film's acting garnered awards but is mostly caricatural; a collection of tics. Rod Steiger's a mean curmudgeon, and Poitier does his Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart in black-face routine. Quincey Jones, Hollywood's go-to black-composer, did the score.7.9/10 ? Peep-show sensationalism, diluted by some moments of humour. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outrageously handsome Sidney Poitier plays Negro cop, Virgil Tibbs, stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time.There's murder afoot in the deep south. Tibbs finds himself arrested for audaciously being black and a stranger. He is hauled before the bigoted town sheriff, expertly played by Rod Steiger.Even those good ol' boys can't frame a black detective. But what's more; his speciality is homicide. Desperate to clear-up the crime, Steiger's man is doomed to swallow his pride and plead assistance from this 'niggra'.Every scene is played to perfection. Every confrontation between the two polarised psyches is beautifully presented. You find yourself longing for every next scene in which they appear together. There's a very creditable supporting cast featuring Warren Oates, but they're completely eclipsed by Poitier &amp; Steiger.There's so many nicely presented details of small-town USA, as well as imaginative use of lighting, camera and editing. This movie won 5 Oscars including 'Best Picture'; even the later and more flamboyant 'Mississipi Burning' cannot trump Norman Jewison's thriller.I've docked a star because I don't think the sheer brutality of racism is adequately depicted, though it probably went about as far as sensibilities would allow at the time. Even so; it's a cracking bit of drama.Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Race, Crime, and Ignorance in the Late '60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Heat of the Night is as powerful a topical film as Do the Right Thing, The Intruder, and Boyz n tha Hood, but more entertaining. Set in the volatile southern USA during the racially charged late 1960s, the story brings a brilliant black homicide investigator (Poitier) from Philadelphia and a southern white good 'ol boy police chief (Steiger) together to investigate a mysterious murder. These two men appear to have three things in common: 1 - They are police officers2 - They are investigating a murder3 - They are both racistsIn the hands of a less intelligent writing team (John Ball novel, Stirling Silliphant screenplay) and director (Norman Jewison), the major question might have become "can they overcome their differences and work together to solve the crime?". but this question would eschew the entire point and value of the film. In the Heat of the Night took home 5 well-deserved Academy Awards. Unfortunately, the great director Jewison missed best director because of the Academy' inexplicable love affair with Mike Nichol's The Graduate. Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier are, as you might expect, amazing. And the support cast and casting are remarkable as well. In the commented version of the film on the DVD, Jewison explains that he does not believe that any role is small. The meaning of this statement comes across very nicely in his films, especially In the Heat of the Night. Every character in the film is well developed and consistently played. Setting plays a major role in the Heat of the Night as well, and the film's perfect cinematography and soundtrack help contextualize the very nicely selected locations. Camera-work is essential to this film. See this film, then see it again with Jewison, Steiger and Lee Grant's comments turned on. The audio commentary is a retrospective and remarkably - almost startlingly - candid. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Heat of the Night is a groundbreaking film that brings forward the issue of racism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the late 1960's, in a small southern town, In the Heat of the Night suggests a look at racism during a very turbulent time in American history.Sydney Poitier is brilliant as Virgil Tibbs, a no nonsense, Philadelphia police officer who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. As Virgil Tibbs is waiting at a train depot, in a town in the Deep South, the murder of Mr. Colbert, a wealthy businessman, takes place. Bumbling officer, Sam Wood, (portrayed by Warren Oats), out on the lookout for a potential suspect, spots Tibbs at the train depot. In a scene reminiscent from Boys in the Hood, Tibbs is harassed and immediately placed under arrest, solely based upon the color of his skin.Tibbs is subsequently cleared of any wrong doing by the town's constable Gillespie, played by the very talented Rod Steiger. However, as the film progresses it is clear that even though Tibbs is no longer a suspect, he is not welcome in the town.Eventually Tibbs is brought on to help the Sparta police department solve the murder but as Gillespie and Tibbs try to work together they are met with the bigotry of the townsfolk. A key scene involved Tibbs informing Mrs Colbert (Lee Remick) of her husband's untimely death. In an effort to console her Tibbs reaches out to touch her arm and Mrs. Colbert immediately pulls away, this occurred again moments later as Tibbs made another effort at contact. Throughout the film Tibbs is treated in a discriminatory manor by almost every white person he encounters. Even the low-life counter boy at the diner refuses to serve Tibbs a meal.With the use of different camera angles, such as a subjective point of view when officer Woods is driving his squad car, the audience is made to feel a part of the action. Low key lighting is brought into play during the interrogation scene between Tibbs and Gillespie and then again when Tibbs is sitting in the local jail. This lighting suggests a darkness or moodiness to the film that would not be there had it been filmed in full light.In the end, the racist views of the people don't change just because Mr. Tibbs has proved himself to be an intelligent, sophisticated man of another race. They go back to their lives and Tibbs goes back to his and really the only thing that is resolved is the murder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poitier and Steiger make this a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The central mystery in Norman Jewison's exploration of racial tension is irrelevant to the importance of this film. While most of its other elements I could take or leave, the central relationship between Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) and Gillespie (Rod Steiger) is still riveting and manages to not be heavy-handed but subtle in its development and progress. Seeing Tibbs push down his anger whilst everyone in the town treats him with anger and violence is wonderfully portrayed by Poitier. On the other hand, seeing Steiger grapple with his morals with Poitier's arrival is a treat as well. Each has their own complexities to deal with and when they are together, it adds an additional dynamic to the proceedings. Not only does the film hold important historic relevance but the racial issues still hold meaning today. The two lead performances are electric and are the main reason for seeing the film although all of it is well done.www.cinemaenthusiast.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's solid enough for a Best Picture winner. The characterizations are deep and fleshed-out, and this is only enhanced by the two great lead performances (I would've given the Oscar to both of them), but I found myself wanting a bit more meat on the actual story. The whodunit mystery lacks real interest, and I wanted something more engaging and intriguing for these characters to do. I also found myself perplexed by the solution at the end - far too confusing a mystery to be an effective one. This may seem like a contradiction, but what I really wanted was a meaningful, layered story, not a twisted, confounding one.It's got a great sense of style about it, helped by that great score and Jewison's often flashy direction. But, in the grand ol' year of 1967, it's got nothing on Bonnie and Clyde or even The Graduate. So, a solid enough BP winner, if not a deserving one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, intelligent film. (Possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood isn't as liberal as it likes to think. Too often its message movies are behind the times they condemn, trailing behind the trailblazers who have the nerve to speak out when it matters. In The Heat of the Night is something of an exception. Beyond that, it's simply a great film.Principally a detective story, the murder of a wealthy businessman in small-town Mississippi is, for the most part, only a framework around which the real story can be told. This is a battle-of-wills between Detective Tibbs and Chief Gillespie, a struggle for power between black and white, a contest for acting honours between Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. While there is no doubt as to which character is the victor, and which race is the most shamed, the actors are absolute equals. Both give superb, layered performances. Steiger's Gillespie is racist, proud, but lets us feel a degree of pity; Poitier's Tibbs is intelligent, thoughtful, but shows a degree of arrogance. These are not simply characters, but people.Some have complained that its message is far from subtle, that the lines are too clearly defined, that the racism is too overt. Such criticism comes from those with little understanding of history and little appreciation for context. This was 1967, this was the south; this was how it was. Remember, this film came only four years after Martin Luther King told us his dream, only three years after amendments to The Civil Rights Bill were passed, only two years after the murder of Malcolm X, and only one year before the murder of Dr King. Its message certainly was not subtle, it had no need to be. Its delivery, however, is subtle enough that even today's audience can appreciate it.Beyond the superb performances, and the dignified message they contain, there are details that give the film a greater depth. When Poitier is being frisked by Officer Wood, he's told to spread his fingers apart, so that he can `see all ten'. Poitier doesn't move them; they're apart enough already. That non-reaction is a great moment, showing that he's been here before, that he knows the drill, that'll he'll tolerate it because for now he has to, but that he won't take orders without reason.There is so much to praise here. The slow pace of the film should kill its tension, but instead it reflects the sticky heat and the leisurely pace of life in the town. Never is it too slow. The scene where Steiger would rather condemn one of his own officers than lose another point to Poitier's big-city detective skills is a high point, as is the gentle yet vicious racism from Endicott. The conversation between the leads in Steiger's house is surprisingly touching; its brief moment of bonding never seems patronising or contrived, and is expertly ruined by the crudeness of Steiger's racism. The characters' growth is slight, uneven, and without any real payoff. And that's by no means a criticism.In the Heat of the Night is a film that simply has to be seen, one that soars despite all that could have brought it down. It should be preachy but it isn't; it should have dated but it hasn't; its slow pace should be leaden but it's perfect. This is a rare kind of a film, and one that after a run of terrible movies has helped to remind me why I love cinema in the first place. I'm grateful for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Still-Relevant Social Commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sparta, Mississippi is a homely little town. It's small, desolate, and drenched with unbearable heat. The citizens are self-serving. The picturesque advertisements that paint the faces of the middling businesses are deceiving. At times, the town resembles something out of a '60s teen romance film, a quaint but calm setting that lets love grown on trees. But like in Twin Peaks, there is a labyrinth of an underground that takes the wholesome Coca-Cola posters and white swing-sets and knots them into a dirty, unsightly torrent of dust and hatred.When a prominent entrepreneur is murdered, his body discarded in an alleyway, the town's police force doesn't know what to do with the case. Most people have mutually decided to mind their own business, only to join forces when an unwanted visitor makes their way into the isolated bubble that is Sparta. Murder was hush hush before. Bodies being dumped in the middle of the street is something completely new to the citizens. Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) orders his staff to search the area, looking for anyone who may have seen or heard something, or, simply looks guilty. One officer finds an African-American man (Sidney Poitier) sitting alone in a train station; Sparta, being the brewery of racial tension that it is, doesn't ask any questions when he is arrested purely on the basis of his skin color.But once he arrives at the police station, he makes a fool out of everyone; he introduces himself as Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphian homicide detective that is merely passing through the town to catch an upcoming train to Memphis. He wants nothing more than to leave, but his chief orders him to stay and aid the investigation. Gillespie has never known anything other than bigotry, but he is suddenly forced to push his personal views aside and follow the duties of a policeman. Tibbs, meanwhile, has to continuously defend himself from the prejudiced people of Sparta, some of whom are viciously violent when it comes to keeping the status quo in check.In 1967, the social climate of America was drastically changing. After years of fighting for equality, blacks were finally getting the respect they deserved, even if that process was more gradual than it should have been. Varying cultures were beginning to have more opportunity than ever.But then, there were towns like Sparta, buried in the deep South. In the middle-of-nowhere and completely separated from the open-mindedness of the big cities, the Spartas of America didn't want and perhaps weren't aware of the changes that were being made in society. In the Heat of the Night remains so important because it's both a steadfast look into the ugliness of prejudice and a snapshot of a transitioning world.Beneath all the sweat, snarling animosity, and tumbleweeds, there is a triumphant truth to every single scene. All his life, Bill Gillespie was taught that African-Americans were underneath him, him being a superior, mighty being. But when Tibbs comes onto the scene, we can see a newfound flicker in his eyes. He wants to scream and shout the most appalling things imaginable and put down his newfound colleague in the same way he has treated the black citizens of Sparta. Yet, he can't. Tibbs is a better man and a better detective. He's a hell of a lot smarter than he is, too. In just a matter of days, a realization hits Gillespie unexpectedly. Maybe, just maybe, no race is more sophisticated than the other. Maybe. The fact that, less than 50 years ago, cities were still as racist as Sparta is stunningly maddening. But Tibbs and Gillespie's relationship represents something more than just two guys attempting to get along. The film represents something more too. Take away the mystery, the formal vocations, and the suits, and you get a full view of a predominantly white society finally understanding the wrongs of their past. As hesitant as they may be in terms of correcting them automatically, there's a knowledge that going on with such discrimination will be venomous, a severe death wish on every person in the room.Poitier and Steiger are absolutely excellent. They are capable foils that bounce off each other with ceaseless energy. Poitier is electric, stoic and utterly powerful; the scene in which he slaps a small-minded plantation owner is totally sensational. Steiger is extremely fascinating to watch ? he isn't your average movie bigot, as there is a lurking variable that fuels his hate more than mere racism. In the Heat of the Night is Southern-fried and completely without boundaries. It's an above average detective film, but beneath its whodunit tropes lays a scathing commentary that still remains relevant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poitier and Steiger Turn Up the Heat in this Knockout Cop Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the sleepy, bigoted town of Sparta, Mississippi, where they roll up the sidewalks at night, a police officer on a routine, boring nighttime patrol through the downtown stumbles across a dead body, that of a rich, white Chicago industrialist who was building a controversial factory in the town. The primary suspect, at least to this cop's black-and-white eye, is a lone black man, well dressed and carrying a wad of cash, whom the cop discovers waiting at the deserted train station. The 'suspect' turns out to be Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), a Philadelphia cop who just happens to be an expert on homicide. Local Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) is the gum-chewing arrogant white Southerner with as much bluff as brains. He walks with a cocky swagger, spits venom at black men, snorts sarcastic remarks at his subordinates and is too quick to pick up suspects and forcibly wring confessions from them. Disgusted with Gillespie's arrogance, he can't get out of town soon enough but gets interested in the solution of the murder when Gillespie jails a second suspect, a frightened young man whom Tibbs proves to be innocent. At the urging of the victim's widow, Gillespie grudgingly asks for Tibbs' help in solving the murder. Reluctantly Tibbs obliges and under such unusual circumstances, the two find themselves working together at cross purposes, each following the wrong clues but, in the long run, each contributing to the apprehension of the killer.'In the Heat of the Night' turns out to be an absorbing contemporary drama, expertly straddling the line by relating an old-fashioned murder-mystery in a jazzy style. A great deal of the credit goes to the director, Normal Jewison, for creating the right atmosphere and for running the story off with no waste motion. His direction is crisp and invigorating, and the minimal use of stylistic flourishes that often date other films of the late 1960s gives the film an ageless look.What makes the film compelling today for reasons beyond its unconventional style, is the guarded relationship between Tibbs and Gillespie, which begins in almost comical hostility and ends in mutual admiration. Poitier and Steiger have such strong chemistry together that their relationship comes alive and grabs you on a gut level. It grabs you most of all because each actor is excellent in portraying that slow evolution of his character's world-view. As Tibbs, Poitier swallows his anger until he nearly chokes on it, letting his eyes say words he's barely able to keep from speaking. As Gillespie, Steiger similarly has to hide his feelings, particularly the professional respect that's making him question a lifetime of ingrained racist ideas, overcoming his prejudices in spite of himself. It's a pleasure, all too rare, to watch two splendid actors pitted against each other with such dynamism!In the Heat of the Night is a detective yarn of the highest order, crowned with two knockout central performances that makes this a sensational murder mystery!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is the killer...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the Heat of the Night" is a crime - mystery movie in which we watch an African American police detective trying to solve the mystery behind a murder. In his path he finds many difficulties and of course on of them is racism because he is an African American and the town is a racially hostile southern town. After some investigations that he makes he finds out some very interesting results but he has some problems with the local police chief of this town and things are getting more complicated.I really liked this movie because of the plot which I found very interesting with many swifts and in many times I found myself considering that one person in the killer and after some minutes I changed my opinion about it and I could not be sure for anything. I also liked the direction which made by Norman Jewison and it was very good. About the interpretations I have to say that I liked the interpretation of Rod Steiger who played as local police chief Gillespie (won the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role). Another interpretation that I have to mention is Sidney Poitier's who played as detective Virgil Tibbs and he was simply outstanding on it.To sum up I have to say that "In the Heat of the Night" is a very good movie and you should watch it because it represents a period of time with many racial issues as many other movies but with a very specific difference. This difference is that we have racial issues and racism even when an African American is considered the best on what he does. I strongly recommend it because it has much of suspense and I am sure that you will like it very much also because it combines very well the mystery behind a murder with many social problems of those times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very solid combination of mystery and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only does this film keep us guessing as to the identity of the murderer, as any good mystery should do, but it keeps us in dramatic suspense as we see 2 parallel stories unfolding -- the murder investigation and the friendship between Sidney Poitier's big-city black cop and Rod Steiger's country white cop. The story begins, appropriately enough, with Poitier as a suspect in the murder -- the deputy (played with the usual low-key precision by Warren Oates) brings him in because he's a large black man who's a stranger in town. When Steiger discovers he's a fellow-cop, it's one of the funniest and also more poignant moments in the film.Poitier becomes infatuated with the idea of tying the murder in to the racist cotton plantation owner (Larry Gates), and risks his life at the hands of the angry rednecks who just don't want him around at all. there's more tension and drama surrounding the question of whether Poitier will escape town without being lynched than there is regarding the solution to the murder itself. That's what makes this film so compelling. It's still effective, unlike most of the other "race consciousness" films that Poitier made around that time. Steiger's character is carefully handled so that we're not sure how racist he was, or is... the point of the film isn't that Stieger is becoming less of a racist because he met an intelligent black man. It's that they become friends, or at least have respect for each other, regardless of race. He might still be just as much of a racist in general at the end. Racism isn't going to be cleaned up overnight because Poitier shows up. Special note should also be given to Quincy Jones' excellent soundtrack music highlighted by the title song sung by Ray Charles. It lends the film the right aural atmosphere to go along with Haskell Wexler's saturated "hot night" photography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what this movie could have been about, but I think it was racism. A few things tipped me off. The first one is that the protagonist, played by Sidney Poitier, is black. All that is well and good, but hey, nobody in town likes him! They're all calling him bad names and disrespecting him, and he even almost gets beaten once! Virgil Tibbs really is a nice guy, and he's very intelligent and does his job well, but no one will listen to him just because of the colour of his skin. to be more serious for a moment, In the Heat of the Night is an engaging crime drama with well-shot scenes and stellar performances by Poitier and Rod Steiger. The movie does beat you over the head with an anti-racism theme, but that aside you're gonna have a good time watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For being a person that isn't all that into mysteries I actually loved this movie. The beginning scene draws you in and makes you wonder what is going to be happening for the rest of the plot. The director uses the camera angles and lighting of the street lights and on the actors and actresses faces just right to intensify everything. The plot is thought out very well, and you get frustrated for the main character on the struggle he has to deal with in this racist town. The actors portray their parts well, and know how to make everything seem so intense and keep you pulled in the story. It gives you a good sense of what it was like to live back in this time period and what African Americans had to deal with, even if they were of good standing and had outstanding jobs. The actors make you feel like you're in the story and facing what they have to face and take you step by step on how they solve this mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie proved the imbalance of race especially when it came to high profiled jobs such as being a police officer or detective. A white man is found murdered in the middle of the road while a black man is found sitting in a train station waiting for a train to get back home.The police take the black man into custody automatically thinking he is guilty based solely on his color and being in that area. After it comes about of who he actually is, a detective from another state, he is made to stay to help the local police solve the murder.Throughout the film you are made to assume that different people could actually be the murderer and then you are surprised that they are not. There are a lot of twists and turns within the movie but the movie is based on racial issues that were and still are present.The police officer never gives up although he is treated so differently and at a few points his life is in severe danger. He is asked to leave town for his safety but refuses until the case is solved.Even though many people are thought to be the suspect of the murder, watching the film solve a complicated murder in a complicated situation was entertaining and enjoyable.</fullReview>

The story was very engaging throughout and you feel like your right there with them trying to figure out the crime but towards the middle it gets repetitive with the cops bringing in three different people who are said to have done it and shortly after are wrong that was one of my dislikes with the film was parts dragged on. Along with the films story the has other themes to the story like don't judge someone you don't know and letting your ego go and these both happen between Virgil and the head sheriff in putting things aside and working on the case together after they wrongfully arrest Virgil for the crime and find out he is a cop. That is what I thought of In the Heat of the Night, it had a engaging story with interesting characters, but at some parts dragged on. That is why it gets a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important film is not necessarily a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand how important the subject matter of this film was when it was made, but if you put aside the 'if only we could all get along' message, what you left with is a highly flawed film. The film has long drawn-out scenes like when the first suspect is being chased through the woods, while other important scenes are quickly cut to and from so fast that you can't understand how the plot advanced with so little said. The threat over whether Poitier's character is going to stay to solve the murder flip flops so many times I lost track. First Steiger wants him to go, then he wants him to stay, then go, then stay, then go. Steiger is supposed to be a racist, not necessarily stupid, so you have to wonder why he is willing to hang the first suspect he finds when he doesn't even know all the facts, especially when it's not even established if the suspect has an alibi or where or how he discovered the wallet. These are big plot holes and only one of several throughout the film. Aside from holes in the writing and directing, there are egregious goofs like the deciduous forest in late autumn during what we are lead to believe is supposed to be a sultry summer heat wave. Alongside goofs there are unclear story lines, like why the boy in the café hates the cop.The makers of this film were so intent on breaking a barrier they forgot to make a good film. I don't believe Steiger character's change of heart n the final scene, when he exhibited no softening of his own racist views throughout the story. In the Heat of the Night may have been an important film when it was made, but that doesn't make it a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be very clear on one point. Let's be crystal. Many of the top-rated IMDb films on racism in the US are fairly recent, and, as such are essentially delivering to the viewer a nostalgic or "re-imagined" vicarious peek at the cultural phenomena. But this astounding one-of-a-kind film was made in the 1960s. In the 1960s racism, discrimination, and violence were neither theoretical nor nostalgic. They were on the TV new every night. Against that backdrop, this film parachutes onto the screen two of the greatest actors of their generation, Poitier (who, history will record, left the industry much too early, given his great talent) and Steiger who was so adept at his craft he could play a washing machine if you gave me a place to stand and an electric cord. Keep in mind also that many of the audience members who enjoyed this film at the time of release had never been in the rural deep south, nor did they ever want to be. So, now that I have set the stage, imagine what it must have been like to be sitting in the theatre when Poitier gets off the train on a hot steamy southern night, only be manhandled by the local deputy (for being the wrong color in the wrong place at the wrong time) only to reveal that he is in the law business himself, and then offers to help the locals deal with a crime beyond their ability ... the subtle looks, glances and grimaces in Steiger's facial expressions as, through the movie, he comes to see Poitier less as a racial stereotype and more as an associate is simply wondrous to behold, and reflected on a broader level the process that American itself was going through, collectively. One of the greatest movies ever made, hypnotic, powerful, can be watched over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Film On Racism And Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Heat of the Night is a mystery film based on the John Ball novel of the same title that tells the story of Virgil Tibbs, a black police detective from Philadelphia, who becomes involved in a murder investigation in a racist small town in Mississippi.IT features Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger together with Warren Oates and Lee Grant.It was directed by Norman Jewison.The movie is set in a small Mississippi town where an unusual murder has been committed. Rod Steiger plays sheriff Bill Gillespie, a good lawman despite his racial prejudices. When Virgil Tibbs, a well-dressed northern African-American, comes to town, Gillespie instinctively puts him under arrest as a murder suspect. Tibbs reveals himself to be a Philadelphia police detective; after he and Gillespie come to a grudging understanding of one another, Tibbs offers to help in Gillespie's investigation. As the case progresses, both Gillespie and Tibbs betray a tendency to jump to culture-dictated conclusions. Still, the case is solved thanks to the informal teamwork of the two law officers. Tense, funny, and thought-provoking all at once, and lifted by strong performances from Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger, director Norman Jewison's look at murder and racism in small-town America continues to resonate today.Both riveting murder mystery and classic fish-out-of- water yarn, Norman Jewison's Oscar-winning In the Heat of the Night represents Hollywood at its wiliest, cloaking exposé in the most entertaining trappings. Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger prove the decade's most formidable antagonists.In addition to that,the brilliant widescreen cinematography is by Haskell Wexler, and the scat-music score is by Quincy Jones with Ray Charles wails the blues theme song makes it even more compelling and it elevates it into a classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film opens with a black man in a suit getting off a train in Sparta in the State of Mississippi; we don't learn any more about him at this point as the action moves to show a police man driving through town; he stops briefly as he passes a house where a naked woman is visible through the window; he then proceeds to the centre of town where he discovers a body. The victim is a Chicago businessman who was planning to build a factory in Sparta; fearing that his wife will cancel the plans the police are understandably very keen to wrap the case up quickly.The police chief orders his men to search for vagrants and anybody passing through town; one of the first men brought in is the black man on the train. It soon becomes apparent that he isn't guilty; in fact he is Virgil Tibbs, a police officer from Philadelphia? a homicide expert. This being Mississippi in 1967 Chief Gillespie isn't keen on working with a black man but he comes to realise that he will have to bury his prejudices, shallow his pride and ask for Virgil's help. As the story proceeds; a variety of suspects appear and Virgil's presence soon attracts the attention of bigoted locals who intend to give him a beating or worse.If this film had been made recently it would still have been good but the fact that it was made in 1967 when the Civil Rights struggle was still ongoing makes it particularly important. It isn't just a political film though; it is a good mystery and could even be considered a 'buddy movie' as the racist southern police chief and the black northern detective come to understand each other. Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger put in career defining performances as Tibbs and Gillespie. There is not much real action but things frequently get very tense as Virgil gets into very dangerous situations with the locals who are clearly bothered by the idea of a black man in a position of authority; especially one who is clearly more intelligent than they are. Anybody interested in film should watch this and it is both a gripping story and a film with an important message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film takes place in Sparta, Mississippi in 1967.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film takes place in Sparta, Mississippi in 1967. Sydney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs an African-American detective from Philadelphia, Pa. He is suspected in the murder of a wealthy business developer from Chicago, IL named Philip Colbert. The film portrays the racism in 1967 Mississippi as the murder investigation develops. Tibbs is faced with a significant amount of racism which is overtly displayed throughout the film. Rod Steiger who plays Police Chief Bill Gillespie is faced with a significant dilemma. He and his officers are untrained and unprepared to investigate a murder of any kind; however, especially the murder of a wealthy businessman who has promised to build a factory which will employ approximately 800 people of Sparta. The dilemma is when Tibbs is brought into the police station by Officer Wood who is played by Warren Oates and it is discovered Tibbs is a police officer and a homicide expert. Gillespie has to decide whether to go it alone regarding the investigation or utilize Tibbs to assist in solving the crime. The story continues with Gillespie and his officers accusing several people who are eventually discovered to be innocent. The investigation continues and Tibbs continues to face death threats, attempts to kill him, and overt racism. Tibbs eventually turns up the killer in an intense scene toward the end of the film.The theme of the film takes on two different paths. A significant theme is the racism which is directed toward Tibbs. Some of the racism appears to be stemming from Tibbs obviously being the smartest and most educated person attempting to solve the crime. However, and underlying theme begins to emerge which depicts how a friendship can develop between two people, regardless of how different they are when they recognize a common goal. Therefore, the main theme appears to be geared toward education about differences and racism which is dramatized through a criminal investigation.A significant theme in the film regarding how Gillespie has begun to change his view and opinion of Tibbs is when Tibbs and Gillespie go to the rich plantation owner's home, Eric Endicott, who is played by Larry Gates and is against the factory Colbert is proposing. Tibbs begins to question Endicott and Endicott recognizes they are not there for a friendly call. Endicott becomes upset when Tibbs questions him about his whereabouts from the night before. Endicott slaps Tibbs across the face and Tibbs immediately slaps him back. Endicott forces Gillespie into the encounter by asking him what he is going to do about Tibbs slapping him and Gillespie hesitates. However, eventually Gillespie only ask Tibbs if he is crazy after they have left the plantation. This is a significant moment in the film which portrays Gillespie's changing opinion of Tibbs. This scene appears to support the theme regarding education about racism and how it can be overcome when people recognize common goals.A film which has common theme regarding racism and education is Guess Who's Coming to Dinner 1967. This film causes a man who is a supporter of liberal agenda having to face the reforms he supports within his own family. However, this film maintains the theme of education and how people can overcome their beliefs when they recognize a common goal. The common goal in this film was maintaining the happiness of everyone involved.Lighting was significant to maintain the setting of this film. Lighting was typically low in the film. This supported the lack of education and wealth which appeared to be common in Sparta at the time of the film. This also supported the low opinion most of the community of Sparta appeared to have of Tibbs. Overall the low dim lighting supported the overall theme and plot of the film by making a large portion of the film to appear as if it is taking place at night when it is commonly thought inappropriate things typically occur. The camera angles deployed in the film also captured the intensity of the racism and the desperateness of the people wrongly accused of killing Mr. Colbert. The angles sometimes appear to be looking down from white people on to Mr. Tibbs, regardless that he is a tall man. This affect appeared to be used to make the racism more intense. The camera angles which captured the desperateness of wrongly accused individuals maintained a close up on their faces when necessary to capture the intensity of them portraying their innocence Overall the theme of the film is portrayed well. The film appears to focus on something everyone can relate to which is solving a common problem which benefits everyone involved. With the Civil Rights movement still pushing forward at the time of the film the theme appeared to provide relevance to how all people can live together without racism when everyone respects each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walter Mirisch thought that Sidney Poitier won an Oscar for Virgil Tibbs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best crime dramas of any era, period. Here is a movie that I can watch over and over again, and it still feels fresh.Rod Steiger gives his absolute best Oscarwinning performance here. Go ahead, and argue, but that's my opinion. For a man that tried virtually every part and any genre imaginable, that may be hard to swallow. It's funny that the producer of this film, Walter Mirisch, who presented an honorary Oscar to Sidney Poitier, said that he won too. That's almost comical and the audience, who knew better, shook their heads. Maybe it was just an honest mistake, but I was actually shocked. That's a producer for you. Poitier had won two times before but for different parts.Poitier's career went a totally different way after he completed his work here. He went on to be a director of comedies and also acted in a few with Bill Cosby. When he was presented with the honorary Oscar, his work from the 70s onward were mysteriously missing from the montage of clips.That was a real digression from what I was going to write. As all know, this movie was spun into TV series, which was surprisingly good until the racial thing was abandoned and it dealt with more mainstream story lines, like murder and drug addiction.Let's remember this movie for what it was. A searing indictment of the unjust society, which still exists, sadly. Wouldn't you like that prejudice didn't exist? Sadly it does and not just hidden. To a certain degree, prejudice is justified. Just remember what happened after 9/11. Not just in the USA but all over the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They call me Mister Tibbs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Heat of The Night is directed by Norman Jewison, is based on the novel by John Ball,has a screenplay by Stirling Silliphant, has music by Quincy Jones and stars Sidney Poitier, Rod Steiger and Lee Grant. Virgil Tibbs(Sidney Poitier)is arrested for a murder he did not commit, simply because he is an unknown person in the town of Sparta Mississippi. Tibbs was found at the train station waiting for a late evening train and brought in as a suspect.Tibbs manages to shock the officers especially the prejudiced,gum chewing and world weary Police Chief Gillespie(Rod Steiger),when it is discovered that Virgil is a Police detective from Philadelphia. Tibbs and Gillespie investigate the murder together and together face racial prejudice and hostility from the townsfolk.The heart of this film is the growing relationship between Tibbs and the Chief as they have to work together, as time goes on the Chief comes to value Tibbs as a man and is not bothered by the colour of his skin.A thrilling and at times touching film about two men struggling to get to the bottom of a murder and overcome the racism that is all around them.Poitier gives one of his best performances as the dedicated and fearless Tibbs, he will stop at nothing to get to the truth. It's interesting how Tibbs deals with the racism directed at him, he mostly ignores it and goes about his business, he can rise above it and appears to not let the cruel and stupid words affect him. One of the few times we see him resort to violence is when a wealthy racist plantation owner called Endicott slaps him, Tibbs doesn't take that and slaps him right back. It's a pivotal moment in the film and makes you cheer for Tibbs as he gives Endicott a taste of his own medicine. The film makes you really think about racism, why should one human being think they can treat another with cruelty just because of the colour of their skin? Steiger is equally excellent as Chief Gillespie, he won the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance here and it's a very well deserved. Lee Grant is also memorable as the young widow of the murdered man.An important film about racism, with an interesting and thrilling story and superb performances from the entire cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviewers here seem to think that this movie is showing such exaggerated stereotypes about the south back in the 1960's. I was in that general area not long after the movie was made and I observed some of that for myself. This movie is great at showing none of the characters in a truly favorable light. I love the end of the movie when Gillespie says, "You take care...". It's shows that even older people, who've lived their entire lives surrounded by a culture that's set in it's ways, racist beliefs, discomfort around those who are so different, etc., can still learn and grow. And I've got news that a few here need to know. I've lived in many areas of this country, excluding the north northeast, and I can assure you that racism is not dead. It's just slightly better hidden (not always) and it can rear it's UGLY face at times you'd least expect it. Sometimes it can be dreadfully disgusting even in places that are considered more Left-leaning and Progressive. Slightly alter the dialog in this movie, change the setting to anywhere you want, fit into the story the appropriate minority (even whites in some places), and you've got a timeless tension filled drama set in today's world. The story's not over. The problems are not gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A socially conscious, brilliantly acted, important film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few movies that have won the Best Picture Oscar that I have any respect for or that I think are truly great, but IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is one of the very few. Coming out in 1967, it beat out some serious competition for the coveted prize including BONNIE AND CLYDE and THE GRADUATE, 2 films that to this day are considered landmarks of American film, and deservedly so. But that shouldn't take away from how special and great IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is in and of itself.The film stars the legendary, groundbreaking actor Sidney Poitier in one his great roles as Philadelphia police Det. Virgil Tibbs, who is passing through the sleepy, small town of Sparta, Mississippi in 1967. While waiting for his train back home to Philly, Virgil is falsely arrested by a Sparta policeman who mistakenly brings him in for a murder of a prominent businessman earlier that night. Virgil is taken to the police station and questioned by Sparta Chief of Police Bill Gillespie, played by the great actor Rod Steiger in a performance that won him an overdue Best Actor Oscar. Steiger beat out some SERIOUS competition that year in Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty, Paul Newman, and Spencer Tracy: what a list of actors! Poitier and Steiger are brilliant in this film and each time I see it, I pick out another nuance in their legendary performances. This has got to be one of the great pairings in film history. The 2 actors play brilliantly off each other and there is not a false note in either performance. It's a shame that Mr. Poitier was not also recognized in the Best Actor category that year himself. It would have been great if there had been a tie and both men could have shared the award. I wasn't born at the time, but I saw an old clip of Steiger accepting the award and graciously acknowledging Poitier in his speech. Of course Poitier had won Best Actor a few years earlier, but for me, this may be my favorite performance and film of his.I'm not an expert, but anyone who wants a class in Acting 101 should pay close attention to these 2 stars of this film. Poitier is 100% believable as a police detective from a big city, not just in classy look and appearance, but also in his mannerisms and the dignified way that he carries himself. He is totally professional at all times and has a constant inquisitive nature. Steiger plays the middle-aged, burly, handpicked small-town chief to perfection. Although he reigns in his boisterous acting style and gives a much more controlled performance than appears on the surface, he imbibes Gillespie with old school toughness and when he lets loose and loses his temper, it is always done to great effect. He is totally believable as a Southern lawman.The murder victim was a rich man from Chicago who was building a factory in Sparta that would bring prosperity to the town, but in order to keep it going, his widow (played by Lee Grant in a brief but memorable performance) demands that his murder be solved or she will not go ahead with her late husband's plans. Gillespie, in order to keep his job and to satisfy the leading denizens of Sparta, asks Virgil to stay to solve the crime.Virgil reluctantly helps Gillespie with the murder investigation and goes through the typical rigmarole of being a black man in a racist Southern town that you would expect in the late 60s, but because of his guile, toughness, and self-respect, he carefully and methodically navigates through all the crap that he must take along the way to solving the murder and with Gillespie's support and help, does just that.Although the murder itself would seem to be a MacGuffin and the focus on the film is obviously on race relations and prejudice, it is actually an interesting and complex plot that holds the viewers attention to the very end. Even though I've seen it several times and know how it ends, I still find myself wrapped up in the mystery and thinking along with Virgil in trying to solve the crime. It's a great whodunit. But most importantly, it is a groundbreaking film about racism and its effects on the black man and how much extra he had (and still has) to go through in order to exist in a white man's world.With a fine supporting cast, an extremely solid script, a great story, and a socially conscious theme, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is recommended viewing for many reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>aka Guess Who's Coming to Investigate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must have been something of a slightly odd experience for Sidney Potier to act in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner right after or around the same time he starred in In the Heat of the Night. Mostly because, frankly, he was in THE definitive film about the condition of racism that was pretty much a matter of fact in the deep south (i.e. Mississippi) not just of 1967, but maybe of the whole late 60s (maybe To Kill a Mockingbird tops it for the decade as a whole, but it's close). Because it's not a story that seems kind of creaky by today's standards like 'Dinner', but it's seems like something that could still happen, to a certain extent, in the deep south. And what's doubly impressive is the nature of the town, the primitive attitude and defacto ignorance that makes this murder mystery story extra gritty. I'm not surprised it was Potier's favorite of his body of work.But to give credit where it's due, Jewison and his screenwriter, as well as DP Haskell Wexler and editor Hal Hashby, crafted an already compelling story that all they needed were the right people. Rod Steiger may not be quite as astounding as he was in the Pawnbroker, but it's probably a more accessible performance (a rightful Oscar winer), as the Chief of the town of Sparta where the murder of the main fat cat is killed and dumped in an alley. Only Tibbs (Potier), a Philadelphia homicide detective, can really solve the crime as a true expert, but is up against, well, pretty much the entire town save for Lee Grant's window of the fat cat who insists Tibbs stays. It won't be an easy case by any means, and not simply cause of the convoluted steps in the case; everyone, including Chief, hates and fears him from the get-go (which includes another officer, who is just more so an idiot, played greatly by Warren Oates).While it's a wide range of choices to see how honestly and even subtly racism is depicted in In the Heat of the night, one of the key points in the story for me is when Potier and Steiger go to see the Endicot character (only in one scene with Larry Gates), who treats him faux nice at first, then that "smack heard round the world" where he smacks Tibbs and Tibbs sends one right back, followed by a line that is pretty much 'I should have you shot.' As Tibbs and Gillespie walk out, Jewison stays for just a moment on Endicot as he starts to cry. Is it fear, or provocation, or just something internal that is just being tapped when confronted by someone who is strong and and intelligent and 'wont-take-s***' as opposed to beaten and broken down by the man?There's also the transformation, if only in the most crucial means, of Gillespie as someone who doesn't shy from dropping the 'n' bomb (he arises the iconic "They call me Mr. Tibbs!" line) or, in a way, the more stinging "boy". We see the rednecks chasing Tibbs around and almost beating him to a pulp, only to be stopped by Gillespie at the last minute. One might think that this won't change, this attitude of racist violence in the south (or, for that matter, the topic of abortion that comes up in the last quarter of the picture, which helps to enrichen the scope of Sparta), but then Gillespie is the most hope that there is in this circumstance. At best, perhaps cynically, we can only hope for a "you take care" line before Tibbs, or whomever a minority might be to a white person, can get, which is in essence basic civility. Maybe that's the message, of the long road ahead with facing true and ugly racism that pervades small towns with very little contact in their rural quarters.This may make In the Heat of the Night sound like a "message" film, which it may be, but it's a great one because it focuses on what propels the story forward and keeping it entertaining for an audience wanting their murder mystery story. Unlike something like the recent Paul Haggis Crash, which also goes for the topic of racism head-on, we don't mind Jewison's targets as they're not pounded over the audience in an unrealistic manner, and the mechanics of plot, the daring of the performances, and the dynamic music from Quincy Jones, feel honest for the plot. It's a thriller with brains and it holds up very well 40 years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Characters, Insightful messages but a poor mystery movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie, however if this movie recieved an oscar for best picture in 1967 the competition must have been pretty poor! I could be mistaken, The selectors that year may have accurately reasoned that the movie wasn't really meant to be a murder mystery at all but more a commentary of race relations in 1960s USA.The performances and acting are superb especially from Sydney Poitier who plays a mysteriously high class but at the same time ruthless character (who seems to hold his own stereotypes about people in the South) but in the end the Sheriff takes the part of the day as the bigoted sheriff who [SPOILER AHEAD - Though it's pretty predictable anyway] by the end of the movie gains a liking towards the black homicide cop [SPOILER FINISHED].The way the film is directed and the insightful messages that the film offers are also very good but we must also remember that this movie is styled as a murder mystery. In that section it fails miserably. A good murder mystery should see you able to connect the dots between different events and hold you by making you guess different people along the way. The murder mystery in this movie offers little "dots" as such and the mystery is solved by Sydney Poitier's character seemingly picking out a character at random and suddenly twisting all the facts so that he suddenly becomes the killer. In the end the murder mystery doesn't really leave you with a finished connect-the-dot picture at all, rather an outline of one with half the dots unconnected.However for top notch entertainment and insight value you should definately hire this film and it is much better than the race relations rubbish that hollywood churns out now on a regular basis (which seems to be a race to see how many people can film movies involving the ku klux klan burning crosses on the property of an african american activist no one has heard of, and in most cases is made up).Just don't expect Sherlock Holmes.</fullReview>

The mistreatment of a black homicide detective in the deep South is still cuttingly dreadful. And the sweltering atmosphere here is something else.But the real selling point is seeing Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier slowly come together as policemen, after all of the prejudices have finished colliding. Steiger's is a subtle performance despite his outsized presence, and Poitier barely contains the animosity. Their tenuous partnership is what makes this so worthwhile, and I'm sure it helps things being couched in a crime movie.A riveting one, at that.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They call me Mister Tibbs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easy to dismiss Sidney Poitier as a kind of counter-cliché; the well spoken and mannered black man entering the southern town of racists to set them right and win the day. He emerged as a response to the still raging civil rights movement but there is no doubt that a modern viewer expects him to be the most dignified, composed and knowledgeable character of the film and for him to be victorious, to bring about change. Just as easy as it is to dismiss the residents of Sparta, Mississippi as easy, caricatured targets, obnoxious racists to be made an example of. But this film is important, and you can testify the response of the infamous slapping scene to that - even as a sensationalised hoot for audiences to holler and gasp it paved the way for a more respectful black screen presence, and then beyond into the public's consciousness. This is why we need one-note characters like Henshaw, under suspicion of murder but with such a strong case of tunnel vision that he ignores the police chief entering his diner to brashly insult the black man and refuse to serve him. This is why we need the hooligans to brandish their crude weapons and creep towards Tibbs like they are hunting an animal (not far off from what they might have thought of him). And it is why nearly every character at one point refers to him with a condescension in 'boy!' (and worse) as though he is inferior, for some even the guise of being a policeman not wavering their bigotry. Then we have change, most primarily through Gillespie, whom acts as a measuring stick. If even one viewer could be swayed by the film after entering with a racist mindset, then job well done. Actually it seems that the modern consensus is more favourable of Steiger than Poitier. Whilst the latter was a little more complex than some have dismissed him (we see how even he admits his racial biases have clouded his judgement, and how Gillespie is able to appeal to his ego), Gillespie has emerged as the clear standout of the film. He is the police chief of the town and as such must act in a way that does not alarm even when someone as important as Colbert is murdered. So we see how his tough, grumpy exterior persona is put on even as he begins to warm to Tibbs because he cannot afford to be soft when a murdered is on the loose. Even more, he uses his anger as a way of filtering his growing admiration and respect for Tibbs not just as a policeman but as a human being - he momentarily cracks while he drinks, then snaps at him and quickly recovers. Steiger does not want to easily betray this change, so he chews furiously and only cracks a brief smile at the end. It is all we will get from him, but this film is the difference between this chief and the last, who may have shot Tibbs right on the spot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introduction to Poitier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure I had even heard of the 1967 Best Picture winner starring Sidney Poitier, directed by Norman Jewison until this year's Oscar month. It was an unremarkable film before I saw it, that didn't turn into much else after my viewing. There were so many remarkable films released in 1967, and films that have stood the test of time, it was difficult to accept that In the Heat of the Night took home Oscar's top prize. An important film dealing with huge issues, In the Heat of the Night, is a film that everyone should see once.What started as an innocent visit to his mother, Philadelphia Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) found himself arrested in a small town in Mississippi. the police chief assumed guilt because Tibbs was a black man in a suit that had money in his pockets. Only after contacting Tibbs chief, was he released from custody. Upon his release, and the realization that Tibbs is the number 1 homicide detective in his precinct, chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) of Mississippi P.D. reluctantly asks Tibbs for assistance in solving the case. The murdered man, Mr. Colbert (Jack Teter) had traveled from the north to Mississippi to break ground on a new factory bringing immense job growth to the small town of Sparta, Mississippi. After Virgil endures a tense run-in with Mr. Endicott, (Larry Gates) the most powerful man in the county, he turns his sights to him as the guilty party; as he would have the most to lose by the factory opening. As the racial tension mounts, Virgil's life becomes endangered, and he humbly realizes he was going after Endicott for selfish reasons. As the evidence mounts, Virgil redirects his efforts towards justice and apprehending the true guilty party.In the Heat of the Night told an intricate story about a town where becoming a police officer means everything. This attitude was best exposed when Sam (Warren Oates) was sitting at the diner indulging on a pie, and refused to be addressed by his first name, demanding he is called Officer Wood. The title of police officer was so important, yet, police work was done so inefficiently, and seemingly without effort. It seems to me that In the Heat of the Night took home Oscar's top prize due to its cultural relevance. The intense racial issues shown in the film, in which Virgil Tibbs has to fight for every ounce of respect he is eventually shown, only because of the color of his skin are important still today, nearly 50 years later as racism still exists. I am of the belief that the other Poitier film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, nominated for Best Picture tells the story better, in a bit of a more relatable way.Sidney Poitier is excellent in every role I have ever seen him play; the role of Virgil Tibbs was no different. He was eclipsed, in this film by the acting of his co-star Rod Steiger. In what was perhaps the most stacked category every for Best Actor Oscar, Steiger took top honors, beating out Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Newman, and Spencer Tracy. Steiger embodied the nuances of a small town police chief, subtly going against the grain and responding to a town that hated him for doing it. The camera work in this film was phenomenal, using the zoom shot exceptionally well, deservingly taking home an Oscar for Best Film Editing. In the Heat of the Night has possibly the best film soundtrack from any 60's film, and made the film all the more engaging.I would recommend In the Heat of the Night to any fans of the 60's as the film has the distinctive feel of a movie from that decade. I would also recommend this film to any fans of Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger's without question as the pair really make the audience feel what good acting is. Although I maintain that the Academy misjudged the Best Picture of 1967, it remains true that In the Heat of the Night is a good, important film; and one I was happy to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Film. MUST SEE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have this title in my personal movie collection, and don't regret it one bit.The cast is a very well put together combination of people that bring you into a 'lifelike' feel while watching this film.The local police chief, a man that is on edge over something that happened in his area, leans in the direction of getting the help of an out of town police officer.A great story that is very easy to follow. You won't want to get out of your chair during this one. It's not a bang-bang shoot-em' up film, ...but a very good movie.Oh, ...a message to other movie collectors out there who don't have this movie. CHECK THIS OUT! I highly recommend seeing this one, folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great detective film about acceptance and tolerance of one another. This film gives us the raw truth of the south during the 1960's, its portrayal of the south is vivid and chilling. This film ties racism and justice together in a great way. We have a homicide detective from up north and a police department from the south joining forces that are trying to find the killer. The actors/ actresses portrayal of their characters were great. They definitely made me believe that those characters were in fact them. I though that was great, I find it difficult to find acting like this today. This film had a nice pace to it. I was not bored watching the film, it kept me entertained. Sidney Poitier was outstanding, his character was so believable. I think he, himself is what made the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Heat of the Night Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film's whole underlying message! Yes, this is a murder mystery film but, it has a more in depth and true meaning of racial equality. The Chief, Gillespie (Rod Steiger) from Sparta, Mississippi grows to actually have respect and grow to care for his fellow visiting "partner's" general well being Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier).But, for the actual murder mystery itself it did bother me a great deal that Gillespie was so willing to pin the murder on a perfectly innocent guy every single time, just to have the case off his hands. Mrs. Colbert's reaction didn't seem quite as harsh as mine would have been when all the policemen were arguing about who was to have custody of the evidence in front of her. I think this should have been more surreal. I think the use of method acting by Rod Steiger was great, yet kind of annoying, with regards to the gum chewing. It seemed so natural to him which was the scary part!The slapping scene between Virgil Tibbs and Endicott was absolutely perfect! I don't think it would have had the same affect if Virgil was the only one who got slapped. Tibbs had that very stern, do what is right for myself persona about him. AND the reaction from Gillespie and the African American house keeper was even more perfect! The end when Gillespie and Tibbs say their farewells at the train and they share that last look they both know that they are going off to somewhere better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one is NOT in the top 250?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of those weird times when the forces of the universe come together and make a great movie, how is it that time one was overlooked by the IMDb rating community? Seriously, WALL-E makes the top 250 and a real film doesn't? A wealthy northern white man is found murdered in the middle of the summer heat wave. A lone black man is arrested at the train station a short time later, and quickly apprehended. But all is not as it seems, since the black man is on his way home to Pennsylvania where he is the top homicide detective for a big city police force. When his boss offers assistance to the racist southern town, a fantastic plot is born.This film has everything a movie needs. Fantastic acting all around, believable characters, an intriguing murder mystery, fast paced action, perfect editing, and writing that today's screenplays just don't seem to have. The direction is spot on, particularly reaction shots as dialog is heard off screen, and set up scenes. (E.g., the police chief is summoned to the mayor, who then visits the mayor's car dealership, complete with the sound of ratchets and welding, where important policy decisions are made in the service bay."What kind of people are you; what kind of place is this?" the widow says. Timeless questions that can arise in any of today's murder mysteries or police dramas, but without anything close to the drama or mystery here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rod Steiger terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the town of Sparta, Mississippi, businessman Mr. Colbert who had come to town to build a factory is found dead. Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) is arrested waiting at the train station. He's the best homicide detective from Philadelphia. His superior back home pushes the reluctant Tibbs to help the local police chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger). The cops arrest a low-life local Harvey Oberst but Tibbs disagrees. Tibbs is arrested for withholding evidence. Mrs. Colbert (Lee Grant) complains to the mayor forcing Gillespie to keep Tibbs on the investigation. Suspicion falls on the most powerful man in the county Endicott.The racial tension in the old south is well done. It's not too cartoonish but it's pervasive everywhere. Of course, there is the slap. One can dissect it to death. It is movie history. Sidney Poitier is a little tight. He is holding in too much anger. He needs to loosen up especially with the black folks. Rod Steiger hits the exact right note. He makes this the truly great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One remarkable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one remarkable movie.It starts with a first-rate script. There is no attempt at "nice" here. Steiger's character has terrible problems dealing with Tibb's qualifications as a specialist in homicide detection. It rankles him terribly that a Black man has knowledge he needs to solve this murder, and he simply does not know how to deal with that. The script never tries to soft-soap that. Nor can you see what's coming. Nothing is obvious. You have to pay attention all the way through.Then there's the acting, which is also first rate. All of it is good, but Poitier and Steiger give spectacular performances. With Poitier, as in some of his other best movies, it's all in the face and the body movement. With Steiger, it's in the voice and the body movement, more than the face. Either way, they give superlative performances.My one question: what are we to make of the one clue that ends up leading no where, the fact that Tibbs finds in the murdered man's car, on the accelerator, the potting material used for the orchids in Endicott's green house?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"They call me Mister Tibbs" the most memorable words in Norman Jewison's 1967 police murder mystery In the Heat of the Night based on the John Ball novel about a black police detective named Virgil Tibbs (played by Sidney Poitier) who is hired to investigate a murder in a racial town in Mississippi with the help of Chief Bill Gillespie (played by Rod Steiger). Director Norman Jewison and producer Walter Mirisch have created the best police movie of it's decade. The performances are top notch, the story is interesting, the photography is great. Of which to me is better than the show because the movie goes more in depth into th story more than the show does but they are both still good in their own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Way Of Looking At Race Relations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mississippi in the 1960's was not a friendly place for blacks. This movie confronts that reality head-on. Sidney Poitier put on a magnificent performance as Virgil Tibbs - a Philadelphia police homicide detective who's in the state visiting his mother when he finds himself unwillingly drawn into a local murder investigation, giving assistance to Sparta Police Chief Gillespie, played by Rod Steiger. Gillespie really doesn't want Tibbs' help - all else aside, him accepting help from a black man wouldn't look too good to the rest of the town - but under pressure from the victim's wife, he has no choice. Part of the movie deals with the development of the relationship between the two. Tense at first, there develops a grudging respect eventually, and possibly even a bit of a friendship. Gillespie knows he needs the help. Tibbs knows it too. But the two have to work this out in the context of the era, and it's fascinating to watch as they slowly learn to trust each other. The other part of the story revolves around Tibbs acceptance by the townsfolk of Sparta. Frankly put, he's not very welcome, and there are a number of scenes (especially one in a garage as Tibbs is confronted by a gang of rednecks carrying chains and lead pipes) that are downright uncomfortable, if not a little bit scary. I thought Poitier captured his character well. Tibbs is confident and even a little bit arrogant about his abilities. But, confronted by this environment, he also comes across as cautious, and at times even nervous or a little bit afraid - which would have been natural enough. Poitier did well with the role, but it was Steiger who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Gillespie. One can't quibble too much with the choice. Both put on very strong performances (Poitier was nominated for a Golden Globe) but I'd have frankly given an edge to Poitier. The actual murder mystery (the victim was a local businessman, and the suspects were several) isn't central to the movie. It's the study of race relations that's far more important, and I found this an interesting way to approach that subject. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1967, a trio of films starring Sidney Poitier were released: "To Sir with Love", "In the Heat of the Night", and "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." It was a remarkable year for a leading actor--an iconic year that has seldom been matched--and it should be noted that he portrayed a high school teacher, a homicide detective, and a doctor. Those who would criticize Hollywood for the roles it bestows on actors of color should remember those roles in the acting life of Mr. Poitier at a time when the studios could not even count on a large portion of the country--the South--to support, or even show, the films.In each case, the stories revolved around race issues, and Mr. Poitier was up to the task. "In the Heat of the Night" won the Oscar for Best Film.The film centers on Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), a young professional from Philadelphia who changes trains in a small Mississippi town on his way back north. A murder has been committed in the town of Sparta and the police chief has ordered his men to comb the town for anyone who might look suspicious. Virgil is "suspicious" by virtue of being a stranger and a black man. Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) is quick to arrest the first possible suspect, mostly because the murdered man is a man of importance to the city.Gillespie finds that Virgil is acclaimed as the best homicide detective in Philadelphia, a fact that burns in Gillespie's craw. Not only does he lose his suspect, but it seems this young black man might upstage and embarrass the Chief.Steiger plays Gillespie as a gum-chewing cracker whose power is tenuous. Poitier plays Virgil as a proud man, sure of his own competency and, perhaps, somewhat out of touch with the way of things in the South. During the course of the film, they develop a reluctant reliance on each other, forged by the political exigencies of the situation and some common goals.So much could be written about this film. The script is one of the best. The acting is superb--by the leads and the supporting cast. The photography really captures the setting with a sometimes foreboding tone (with danger in the darkness, the demeanor and the décor). The soundtrack (by Quincy Jones) is, surprisingly, jazz-themed, but it totally works, as jazz is the musical connection between the deep South and the urban black centers of Philadelphia and Chicago, in particular.Virgil disturbs the balance of power in Sparta just by being there, and things heat up as Virgil uses his talents to solve the crime. As suspects and witnesses are interviewed, we find that race plays a tangible part in the testimonies. As a sidebar, let me mention that I found a commonality of themes in the way this film and "To Kill a Mockingbird" (1962) dealt with its female victims. "Anatomy of a Murder" (1959) also reflected a similar tone, though race was not the prevalent issue.The only spoiler I will include here is a recognition of the ending being nearly the same as that originated in the movie "Picnic", where an aerial view shows the protagonist leaving town on a train and reveals the "world" of the film to be but a small community in a much larger world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Showdown In Sparta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Sidney Poitier go at it with a town full of hotheads and murderers is to force a change in judgment regarding his legacy as mere civil-rights avatar. Sure, the skin color was important, but wow, is he cool or what?Poitier's Virgil Tibbs has the bad luck of being in the wrong train station with too much money in his wallet when a rich man turns up dead in another part of the same town. Sparta police chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) would like nothing better to pin the killing on an outsider, and a black one would make for less trouble in this blinkered Mississippi community. Yet Gillespie's not a bad cop, and soon finds himself not just clearing Tibbs but leaning on him for support. It's not an easy match for either man.Steiger won the Oscar that year, even if Poitier was the man of the year in terms of starring roles ("Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" and "To Sir With Love" also were released in 1967.) Generally I enjoy Steiger more myself, but no one could have made "In The Heat Of The Night" work as well as Poitier does.Sure, he has a raft of terrific supporting performers, but Poitier does fantastic work with them all. He is sympathetic yet cagey with the victim's widow (Lee Grant), ingratiating with a hyper young suspect (Scott Wilson), smoothly confrontational with a bigoted fat cat (Larry Gates), and most importantly, rationally argumentative with Gillespie.I find Steiger a hoot, and I love the turn Gillespie takes in this movie. He's got the motive which is money and the body which is dead, and runs it all the way to the end zone. But everything good in the film comes back to the way Poitier plays it, or them. It's his journey we follow, and Poitier presents a marvel of subtlety and economy, his reactions played small for the most part.His first scene with Lee Grant shows what I mean. We see him tell her plainly, rather coldly, that her husband is dead, and then watch as she pushes off his attempts at offering correct comfort. Is it because she's white and he's black? That's how I viewed the scene for a while, until I heard Grant in a DVD commentary explain how she channeled the loss of her real-life husband in her scene. Her character isn't hung up on race; she just doesn't want to accept the truth. Tibbs, knowing this, is persistent in offering his hand until she accepts it, I think because Tibbs wants to know she is legitimately trembling and thus can be eliminated as a suspect. He's a good guy, yes, but he has a case to solve.The racial aspect of the film can't be ignored, but "In The Heat Of The Night" has a lot else on offer. Director Norman Jewison and his ace support staff (editor Hal Ashby, cinematographer Haskell Wexler, screenwriter Sterling Silliphant) knew how to keep a story moving, with a flowing narrative, tracking shots, and cool lighting tricks. You really feel the heat in this town in the way the neon lights flicker against the sweaty streets, the forlorn dog that looks for scraps in the railway station, and yes, that pretty girl who stands naked in her lit kitchen.Quincy Jones' music is easy to overlook, because it feels so at one with the movie's aesthetic. It's not soul or jazz, but country-pop, with one song, "It Sure Is Groovy!", which we hear when the victim is discovered, sounding like a great Charlie Rich single from his Smash Records days (it's not Charlie, though, apparently).Ultimately, this is Poitier's film, and a classic whodunit wrapped in a social issues drama that never forgets to keep you on your toes. It's a liberal film that never slips into empty pieties, and makes you really care about the outcome even if the people of Sparta seem pretty worthless on the whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Culturally incredibly significant, and simply a great movie too. In the Heat of the Night is a movie of great social and cultural importance. It laid bare the prejudices of the South and helped set about mending those racial divides. One of the first Hollywood movies to have a black person as the hero, and probably the first black-white "buddy" movie.The scene where Sidney Poitier slaps the white plantation owner may be one of the most important scenes in movie history.Cultural significance aside, it is a great movie in its own right. If it wasn't, it wouldn't still be as watchable and revered today as it was in 1967. A great whodunnit, complete with blind alleys, races-against- time and good detective work.Solid performance by Sidney Poitier in the his co-lead role. However, it was Rod Steiger who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and deservedly so. Good supporting cast.A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great characters in this Hollywood classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re-watched this movie for the first time since its release so I forgot much of the plot. Also, with the passage of time, I felt it was dated and probably even a bit boring. Well, I can safely say that this movie is still a very entertaining murder mystery and while the take on black-white relations delivers a stinging stereotype of the Southern white male that wouldn't make sense after the 1960's, the characters and acting hold up well and the story can still keep our attention. To me Rod Steiger is the star of this movie as the blatantly bigoted and unprofessional town sheriff. Steiger's character is pitted against Virgil Tibbs, played by Sidney Poitier, a well-trained and smart as a whip police officer who is visiting from the north. Tibbs becomes a magnet for the town's potent and dangerous racism. Steiger's hatred brings a series of clever rebuttals from Poitier that are probably wasted on the rather stunted mind of the sheriff. Lee Grant, as the widow of the murdered man, insists on Poitier being kept on the case or she will take her husband's company and payroll out of the town. This is the only voice of reason that this town can understand. Poitier must fight off attempts to hurt and humiliate him and Steiger does his best to get the black upstart outsider to take his leave. If you haven't seen the movie, I would recommend seeing how it all plays out. Norman Jewison has directed a classic movie on the black-white divide that whacked the 1960's with such force. In The Heat of the Night stands as great movie and represents one of Hollywood's best efforts to entertain and inform audiences of the 1960's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although it's lost its impact since 1967, this is still a very good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with a rookie cop who is having a dessert in a diner and later discovers a body in the middle of the street. Once word gets out, the Mississippi police start looking for a man and by the nearby station they discover Virgil Tibbs (Poitier) who is trying to get home to see his mother. Using the stereotypical motion, that a black man (in a pre-dominantly white neighbourhood) has committed the crime, a police officer brings him in for the crime. However, it transpires that the black man (Poitier) that they have captured is a police officer from Pennsylvania who happens to be an expert in homicide. Tibbs offers to help the Mississippi police under the orders of his Chief (within a state that hates black people) to try and discover the perpertrator .There are several things that we need to be aware of; first of all there is the surface level theme of this film and that is the 'who dunnit', but then there is the deeper subtext which is the scenario of 'black man entering racist state and trying to help them bring a felon down'.- The people and police officers in Mississippi don't want him to help initially, but they soon realise that Tibbs is the key to solving the crime( those police officers that live in Mississippi are clearly not accustomed to the way that Tibbs and co solve crimes in his home state of Pennsylvania). The thing I really love about this film is that Poitier's character Mr Tibbs doesn't take any crap from anyone. I also liked that Rod Steiger's character Gillespie clearly cared about him and slowly warmed toward him towards the end. Poitier's character was also the smart 'black' cop which was ground breaking in 1967, he is the one that pieces the puzzle together and figures out what has truly happened rather than the pathetic Mississippi police officers (they use primitive skills to try to bring people to justice, whereas Tibbs uses actual police skills). I'm not going to reveal plot points, but let's just say that Tibbs gets his man. The way I see this film is that it is ground breaking as far as 'racial equality' is concerned and for me the 'who dunnit aspect' is a secondary factor.Summary; brilliant film, with great performances by Steiger and Poitier. A ground breaking and important film that is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They call him Mister Tibbs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Norman Jewison has made a gem of a movie that depicts the lives of black people in the US. 'Virgil' Tibbs is convicted of murder, mocked at his first name, discriminated for the color of his skin, ignored for his expertise, and is threatened by white-people of a southern town. He solves the case of a murdered businessman, the identity of the kingpin behind the murder is well-known to the residents of the county, and yet no one wants the case to be solved by a 'colored' visitor who's in the town to call on his mother. Virgil Tibbs visits the abode of the man behind the crime, accuses him of murder, and slaps him right across his face in the presence of the Chief of Police who could do nothing but remain a silent spectator. Sombre Sidney symbolizes the educated, well-paid 'colored' man, who despite the discrimination, makes you say he's a true Hero at the end of the movie. The time in which the movie was made- during the civil rights movement- is much appreciated.The review is incomplete without mentioning the wonderful song by Ray Charles Robinson, who, like Sidney, is a 'colored' man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never judge a book by its cover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Heat of the Night is a film about a black cop in the south in the sixties. Playing the lead role is Sidney Poitier as Mr.Tibbs playing his typical role of a Black man breaking down stereotypes who has a little bit of a chip on his shoulder. Mr. Tibbs helps Chief Bill Gillespie played by Rod Steiger solve the murder of a prominent citizen.It could be said that the central insight or "theme" of this movie is "racism". However this generalization does not do the film justice. The idea is bigger and older than that, In the Heat of the Night shows that you should never judge a book by its cover. Some of what made this a great film at the time is dated. The shock value of a black man being more intelligent than a white man doesn't work with modern audiences. However the bigger theme of prejudice does. This theme goes much deeper than racism in the 1960's south. The movie shows how prejudice blinds not only those who are racists, but how it can blind those on the receiving end. In this context the theme is and always will be relevant. Its influence reverberates in modern films such as "American History X" and "Crash".The film utilized some motif's to illustrate its point. A cotton field is used as a visual symbol, of southern slavery, to show that in some ways little has changed in the south. The mood is well set by utilizing blues music, which effectively sets a melancholy mood.While on the surface this seems to be a movie about racism. If this were the case this would not still be a great film. This is a film that is bigger than the American racism of the post civil war south. It is a film about how everyone in anytime period can be blinded by prejudice. It reminds us how such ideas can cloud our judgment, even when these prejudices seem justified, such as Mr.Tibbs prejudice against racists. We are left with the idea we should not judge a book by its cover. It is this theme that makes what would be a good murder mystery film, a classic film that makes us question our own beliefs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of America's most defining films ... in the groundbreaking year of 1967 ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally speaking, a great script foreshadows three great scenes, even Howard Hawks refers to this trinity in the following equation: a great movie feature three good scenes and no bad scene. Well, regardless of the validity of these assumptions, I can clearly find in Norman Jewison "In The Heat of the Night" three great scenes that make the movie worth to watch, each one representing a crucial step in the narrative process.The first one occurs briefly after the murder of a local businessman, when Officer Sam Wood (Warren Oates) from the police of Sparta, a racist small Southern town, arrests a black man about to leave by the train station: Virgil Tibbs, played by Sidney Poitier. Tibbs is therefore confronted to the Chief of Police Gillespie, Rod Steiger, who quickly jumps to the conclusion that he's the killer: a black man who leaves the town the night of a murder, let alone with a wallet full of money, is immediately guilty by pure assumption. The genius of the scene comes with the realization that Tibbs is a Police Detective from Philadelphia. Gillespie arrested a colleague and not only the look on Steiger's face is priceless (if only for his mimics, he fully deserved his Best Actor Oscar) but this moment alone sets the premise of a film which echoes another Poitier classic "The Defiant Ones". Tibbs and Gillespie investigate the murder together, both under hierarchical pressure, with their sense of duty as symbolic handcuffs until a mutual respect would graduate create the real bonding between the two men.The second scene, in the middle of the film, is probably the emotional highlight, the crucial moment that places "In the Heat of the Night" among the greatest classics. While the investigation lead to many wrong tracks, avoided thanks to Tibbs' expertise, it is especially undermined by a clear non-cooperation from Gillespie whose attitude flirts sometimes with racial prejudice, but less meant to express a true feeling than to destabilize Tibbs' self-confidence, until he's rightfully put in his place by the iconic "They call Mister Tibbs!" line with the emphasis on 'Mister'. In fact, we need to see another confrontation to understand that Gillespie was never truly racist. The encounter with the wealthy land owner Endigott, a name curiously rhyming with bigot, unveils the hideous face of racism hidden beneath the mask of hypocrisy. Understanding that he's being interrogated, Endicott brutally slaps Tibbs who retorts by an immediate slap and a piercing look of defiance. The timing of this exchange is so quick and unexpected that the looks on the other actors' faces (especially the butler) feel like genuine reactions.In that groundbreaking year of 1967, Cinema followed the steps paved by Rosa Parks when Sidney Poitier slapped the bigot. This scene alone justifies why "In the Heat of the Night" is highly regarded, ranked in the American Film Institute's Top 100 list, and winner of the Best Picture Oscar over other landmarks like "The Graduate" or "Bonnie and Clyde". Norman Jewison film bravely breaks the ultimate taboos in terms of racial depictions because the thought-provoking aspect is less in the slap than the way it is shown. For us viewers, Tibbs acts as the spokesperson of a whole community, while Tibbs only reacts as a man whose dignity was offended. This mirrors the line he said to his father in the other 1967 Best Picture nominee "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner": 'You see yourself as a colored man, I see myself as a man' Tibbs is not the perfect man, and he's not portrayed with the kind of angelic indulgence owed to the poor victim.Indeed, "In the Heat of the Night" never falls in the trap of reverse racism and more than once, we happen to agree with Gillespie. The slap's aftermath is a strike of genius, as Tibbs clearly wants to arrest Endicott for the simple basis that he's a racist extremist. Gillespie delivers then a sober but powerful "You're just like us", as if he realized how heinous they were, and how sometimes violence calls for violence with the same negation of justice. The film is already excellent as a mystery and a crime investigation, but it works essentially thanks to its emotional core: the relationship between Gillespie and Tibbs. There's an interesting moment when reluctant to help Gillespie, Tibbs tells his boss "No Sir, I'm not prejudiced", which is already funny in an ironic way. The film powerfully portrays the evolution of two flawed persons who'll overcome their own prejudices, before working together efficiently. The step for mutual respect is empathy.Throughout his journey, Tibbs experiences the ordinary racism that poison people's lives and realize that although he doesn't picture himself as a member of a community, people in town will, which nourishes his sentiment of belonging. Gillespie experiences the racism endured by Virgil and redeems himself while protecting him against a bunch of hooligans coming to avenge Endicott. Understanding one's condition is the necessary step to overcome the adversity and it's only by fighting their personal demons that both of them efficiently combine their efforts, this is not the key of the film's resolution, but it drives the dynamic of the story following a very positive trajectory. This leads to what I believe to be the third great scene of the film, the simple but powerful farewell and what makes it so inspiring is the way one simple smile from Gillespie while saying "Take care" inspire another smile from Tibbs before he gets on the train with a cool and bad-ass "Yeah".Their expressions show how sincere they are about each other's feelings, mutual respect as another step for friendship. The film concludes like it opened, with the song of Ray Charles which conveys both the hotness and darkness of an era of which "In the Heat of the Night" is the most defining, back then when America's motto was: "We shall overcome!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>racism is no match for goodness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They call me Mr. Tibbs", why those words pack so much power I don't know but they just do. Those words can be found in Norman Jewison's Oscar winning creation from 1967 called "In the heat of the night." So is this movie a classic well I say, I reckon ya'll. This movie has bad unbelievable plot twists right from the beginning that go all the way to the end but none of that matters. What does matter is what was at the heart of this movie, the acting and the message. This movie came about at a time when overt racism was still prevalent in southern culture. This movie shows us every stereotype associated with this blemish on American history, including cotton picking on the plantation and lawn jockeys, the only possible exception is the absence of white hooded KKK members though they are there just not in robes. Why this movie works is not the plot which is about solving a murder, but the struggles of both blacks and whites to get past racism following the civil rights movement. In this regard it not only works but deserves to be called a classic because of what people, who are growing up now in America with a mixed race President, can take from a time not too long ago when things were much different in this country. The acting especially by Rod Steiger is phenomenal, and he was rewarded with the academy award for best acting that year. So if you get the chance check out this flick, unless you can't get past the obvious plot flaws it is a great viewing experience. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about a black police detective played by Sydney Poiter who travels to the deep south, ends up investigating a murder with the police chief played in Oscar winning performance by Rod Steiger.This is a controversial film with some racial bigotry that you have to overcome. The performances by Sydney and Rod are fantastic and they work well as a team. The film won 5 Oscars and I think deserved the best picture although Bonnie and Clyde the same year was very good as well.The storyline is solid and the music was good as well.I recommend this classic film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures the real underlying essence of racism in that time and place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a socially progressive film receive the accolades it deserves immediately following its release like "In the Heat of the Night" did. Most are re-examined decades later and deemed "ahead of their time." Norman Jewison's film, however, is so complex and earnest in its portrait of race relations in the 1960s that audiences were stirred by it then as much as we commend it now.What makes "In the Heat of the Night" as effective now as it was in 1967 has to be the approach. Neither the script nor the direction tackle racism head-on in an explicit manner; the film slowly builds racial tension by feeding off viewer assumptions and creating racist undertones in the characters and their actions.When we first meet Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), he's being arrested on suspicion for murder. He doesn't say so much as a word and the clear implication is that he's being arrested because he's black, but the characters and situations are composed in such a way that the racism doesn't feel blatant or entirely addressed. The dialogue does not confront the topic in explicit terms either. Instead, we have an unsettled and discomforting mood.We also never get a real beat on Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger). Both the character and Steiger's performance possess real depth and complexity. Few characters in cinema history (and none that I can think of at present) have characteristics that include deeply rooted prejudice and great understanding. Steiger so perfectly communicates Gillespie's conundrum of reconciling what he believes and the evidence that rests before his eyes, both in the murder investigation and the way he treats Tibbs.Tibbs is a Philadelphia detective with a strong forensics background who finds himself in Sparta, Mississippi assisting with a homicide case. Given that Civil Rights was a relatively new concept in America at the time, the racist attitudes and suspicious glares of the other small- town cops cast a heavy shadow over Tibbs' work. Poitier gives Tibbs this humble courageousness for much of the film but occasionally gives in to the anger the viewer will surely feel for the way his character is treated."In the Heat of the Night" truly portrays the sorry state of the South in the wake of Jim Crow laws, a time when long-standing attitudes struggled to adjust and frankly, some never did. Steiger's Chief Gillespie represents the crux of this change as he begins to admit the errors of his judgement both in judging Tibbs and in doing his job. As equally powerful as the film's statement on race is its statement on the flaws of the justice system in certain parts of the country. Without Tibbs' help, two innocent men would have been tried and likely convicted of the murder thanks to the old Western sense of justice, that being "someone has to pay."There are some head-shaking and jaw-dropping moments in the film, but "In the Heat of the Night" mostly succeeds in being subtle and displaying racism through tension more so than action. The truth is that while the frightening tales of hate crimes are much more compelling for the screen, this form of racism is what truly abounds, even today. With a couple knockout performances, the ideas of racism and justice in the film become much more than ? pardon the pun ? black and white.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is yet another movie that holds up after forty years or so. Despite being shot in Illinois it reeks of decaying magnolia and the two leads are well supported by the likes of Lee Grant, woefully underused in film yet always able to make a cameo tell - witness her mugging victim 'Somebody stole my baig' in Detective Story circa 1951 - and Larry Gates. Though it is a film of 'parts' - Poitier slapping Larry Gates, Scott Wilson enquiring why Poitier is wearing 'white man's clothes', Steigers great line 'I got the motive which is money and the body which is dead' and 'it would give me a world of satisfaction to horsewhip you' and Poitiers laughing response that his father used to say the same thing plus, of course, 'they call me Mister Tibbs', the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Norman Jewison's direction was sure-footed and there's really nothing more to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They could make 'em like this today, but they don't..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this originally in 1967. Still packs as a punch as I watch it today on TCM. The story was based upon a novel, and the character of 'Virgil Tibbs' carried on in succeeding stories. Poitier and Steiger are outstanding, and a great ensemble support cast rounds it out. It's about the characters and the conflict (particularly racial) as out-of-town Homicide Cop Poitier finds himself more or less coerced into helping a white Police Chief in the Ol' South solve the murder of a prominent industrialist. Neither the characters nor dialog are stereo-typed. The plot isn't complicated, but the film is compelling, in fact, Oscar-worthy.I'm a big believer in the idea that the CAMERA is the best FX - it allows us to overhear private conversations, and to secretly observe the unfolding action -- and the facial expressions of the Players. When Actors could act (or were allowed to), as we see here, they p-a-u-s-e and ponder a response; they twitch, or look away; they chew gum; they tell lies; they r-e-a-c-t to other characters; and they lose their tempers. And not everyone is a glamor model (like CSI, or Grey's Anatomy) -- sometimes they are pock-marked, dumpy, or shabbily-dressed. It looks real. And we get to watch. Why don't they make 'em like this anymore?Great films like 'Heat' and others of 1967 (what a year!) last for 5 decades - not 5 weeks! There are dozens of great books on the 'Best-seller' lists today: spy stories, mysteries, political intrigue (would they be on the lists if no one was buying them?) -- why aren't these being made into great movies? 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was Poitier's 1st movie I was watching and I am really impressed with his acting in this fantastic movie with a great screenplay. But the character of Chief is my pic from the movie and I am happy that he won the Oscar for lead not supporting actor. It was brilliantly written and performed to be adored. In fact he was the backbone of the movie, Poitier did the classy-short sentences but Chief had the expressions: funny, innocent and genuine, stuff that you wait and crave for while watching this movie. Each and every standoff between these 2 police officers was quite intense, entertaining and educating as well. You sure don't see that kind of stuff in today's movies. The scene where a lady is in mournful mood but still speaks authoritatively is something rare but done nicely. The movie attains a different height when Poitier slaps a white old guy and righteously. Again a low budget movie, but well casted and written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit dated but still powerful crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the Hear of the Night" admittedly doesn't have the impact nowadays as it did upon original released, as it deals with racial politics not nearly a relevant to today's society. Still, it is a stirring portrayal of racism from within the "justice" system and an engrossing crime drama. It perfectly captures the time period of 1960s southern society. The film drips perfectly with the swampy atmosphere of the locale - watching it, you can practically feel the humidity causing sweat to pour down your back. Plus, past the morals dealing with racism, the film can be enjoyed as a compelling mystery and character drama. Both Mr. Tibbs and Chief Gillespie are terrifically drawn characters with a good amount of depth that transcends any normal film dealing with racism (its a much better film than the recent and overrated "Crash").On a technical level, the film is terrific. Sidney Poitier shows why he was one of the country's biggest movie stars for a period of time. As the cool and calm Mr. Tibbs, he offers what is possibly his best performance. Rod Steiger is just as great as Police Chief Gillespie, giving a lot of emotional depth to a character who could've been a stock type racist Southern male, not completely demonizing him but showing his inherit flaws. Its also odd seeing Warren Oates playing such a submissive character (I'm used to his tough guy roles in Sam Peckinpah and Monte Hellman's films), but hes great as always. The direction by Norman Jewison is workmanlike and aesthetically dull, but technically perfect and the film moves at a very quick pace. "In the Heat of the Night" doesn't have the impact now as when originally released, but its still a compelling film. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Tale of Race, Murder and Equality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Virgil Tibbs, a black man in the 1960s, is implicated in a murder he didn't commit. Once his name is cleared and the local police find out that he is a "homicide expert", he is retained until the crime is solved. But the police only grudgingly accept him and the local community would rather see him lynched. Is solving the mystery more important than his own safety? I don't have a lot of experience with Sydney Poitier, the star of this film set in the Civil Rights era. But he comes across as very smooth and a fine actor. I'd love to compare him to Denzel Washington, but, of course, that would be a bit backwards. Washington should be compared to Poitier. (although, really, in a world where race doesn't matter we probably shouldn't even have a subcategory like "African-American actor", just "actor".) It's amazing how bumbling the police are in this film. I can understand the racism, even if it gets a bit extreme at times -- some hoodlums assault Tibbs in front of the police chief. But at least three times the wrong man is arrested for the murder. How incompetent are these guys? Ignoring FBI evidence, incriminating people on circumstantial issues. What kind of town is this? "Heat of the Night" is considered one of the greatest films ever made -- the American Film Institute ranks it in the top 100. I'm unsure how to rank a top 100 list, but I don't find this film's inclusion unfair. It certainly is a richly-plotted story with good characters and plenty of cultural significance. If that's something you'd be interested in, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The narrative.Is well constructed, entertaining and engaging throughout. Renowned actors Poitier (to sir with love) and Steiger (The pawnbroker) star as different styled detectives and capture audience's attention through Steiger's Oscar nominated performance and the sheer brilliance of Poitier's very serious character. It is often slow moving, allowing audiences to engage deep within the central plot about a conventional murder in the crime genre, an unknown killer in the city. However the movie works extraordinarily well with these two central protagonists and their input is fantastic. Their relationship is definitely worth watching for the tension, surprises and excitement as the two mark their differences about each other. The narrative was definitely Oscar deserving and it beat off the competition for 5 Oscars in 1968.Characters.Poitier's serious character is one of the best I have ever seen. The way he acts to portray a character who is concerned, clever, devious, friendly, committed is outstanding. His serious mode of address is remarkable. The character has an edge about him which makes Poitier so brilliant in this role, his facial expressions are amazing.Issues.At the time of release it was common for racism to be apparent in society. If you watch it these days I'm sure your jaw will drop. I was amazed how heavy the film centralised itself on such, what now, is a very delicate issue. I was spellbound by the use of terminology in the police force as the police tried to accept Poitier. But the terms are really disgusting, but I suppose it gives an accurate display of what life was like for black residents in society in the late 60's.watch it if...you enjoy the conventional murder mystery plots and actors who give their all to portray meaningful characters.8.5/10</fullReview>

He is arrested on general principles when a rich white man is found dead, and Tibbs' being Black is enough reason. When his identity is established, his boss offers his services to the small town sheriff who has little experience with murder investigations. As the two policemen learn how to work together, they begin to make progress on the crime.This film deserves all the praise that it has gotten, and it's position on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 list. It truly is a classic. It is a great diagnostic film on the racism which apparently was decline in the period the film was made.Truly a masterpiece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The award-wining 1967 film In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison and produced by Walter Mirisch was the first movie of its genre to win an Academy Award. It's not surprising, however, as I found this MGM movie to be more than just an ordinary murder mystery. The movie takes place in 1960s Sparta, Mississippi. It is the story of a black police officer (Sidney Poitier) from Philadelphia who must work with the local white Chief of Police (Rob Steiger) to catch a murderer. I enjoyed the fact that the movie not only utilizes the suspense of a murder mystery, but it also shows the struggle for each officer to put aside his differences in order to work together. Though Rod Steiger won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Chief Bill Gillespie, I feel that Sidney Poitier was equally deserving of this award. Through his superior acting, Poitier brought the character of Mr. Tibbs to life. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The essence of both Gillespie and Tibbs stayed in my mind long after the film was over. I thought the conclusion of the movie not only wrapped up the mystery, but also completed the development of the characters. For me, the soundtrack was memorable, including the Ray Charles song with the same title as the movie, and some rock and roll music, a novel idea for the time. I thought that the metaphors in the movie were great, carefully planted so to be picked up only by the most observant viewer. The protective glasses Gillespie wears most of the movie symbolize his inability to see clearly in other aspects of his life. This and other less obvious metaphors enhanced the film, making it more than just a murder mystery, but in my opinion, a four(out of five)-star film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a radical film, but a rather compelling one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great films that deal with race relations throughout film's history have ranged from blatantly racist ('Birth of a Nation') to radical ('American History X') with some quieter, more subtle and very intelligent films in between. ('Guess Who's Coming to Dinner') In the Heat of the Night', directed by Norman Jewison in 1967 and starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger as policemen from either side of the Mason-Dixon line fits in more with that 'in-between' category.Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), while waiting in the bus depot of a small town in Mississippi is detained by the local police after the town's wealthiest businessman is found dead on the street. After he is brought into the station and essentially arrested, Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger, who won one of the film's several Oscars for his acting) learns that Virgil Tibbs actually happens to be a police detective from Philadelphia, who was visiting his mother during his vacation. The racial profiling and racism that brought Tibbs in is echoed throughout the film and while he (at first) reluctantly helps Gillespie solve the case before heading back up north, he puts his life at risk simply by remaining in the town.'In the Heat of the Night' won several Oscars, including Best Picture in 1968, and is certainly a good film. I can see why it won its awards back then, and why it has earned a spot on many film lists ? it is a good solid picture, and a safe one at that. Of course, there is some excuse for the film's safeness; it was made in the late 1960's during the center of the Civil Rights movement, and being a mainstream film, it is not going to have overtly inflammatory moments. I can't help but feel, however, that I have seen films that are its peer ('Guess Who's Coming to Dinner', also starring Poitier) or even predecessor ('Gentleman's Agreement') that took more chances and as a result were more impactful. Unfortunately, while the race relations were not presented in an extreme fashion, they were present enough for me to focus on that and not really even care about the actual murder investigation ? when the murderer was revealed it was kind of a big 'so what' for me.For what it was, however, 'In the Heat of the Night' was indeed a good film which was bolstered by some incredible performances. One cannot imagine two other actors in these roles, they so absorb their characters. Poitier is as dignified and intelligent as ever, and when he proclaims one of the film's most famous lines 'They call me MISTER Tibbs!' you know he means business. Steiger's Chief Gillespie is a redneck, and he's sly ? but he's not stupid, and not without feeling. Under Jewison's decent direction, the editing work by Hal Ashby, who later went on to direct 'Shampoo' and one of the all-time great cult films, 'Harold and Maude' provides some good pacing to the film. It's a safe enough film to recommend to most, but don't look for anything overly ground-breaking here. 7/10--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A clash of identities between a black big-city detective and an overweight white sheriff down in the bigoted South. A murder brings them together (that, and some story contrivances), but as a mutual admiration begins to develop we see all different shades of humanity. It's a picture designed to show off hot-headed emotions, and Rod Steiger (in an Oscar-winning performance) is the perfect actor to pull this off: with his silly yellow-tinted shades and crooked policeman's cap, he's an outdated cartoon, but one with an underlying sense of sadness and self-loathing. Sidney Poitier straightens him out, he and the rest of the town. Easy to see why Poitier was such a hero to audiences of this era (of any color): he pulls no punches, and the prickly reminder of his race isn't a nagging issue. Like all character-oriented dramas that strive for something extra, this isn't much of a murder-mystery; however, as an acting piece it's first-rate. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I expected something a little more heavy handed and cut and dry along the lines of "Mississippi Burning," but "In the Heat of the Night" turned out to be much more subtle. There are no speeches and really no moments of truth. Poitier and Steiger wisely play their characters as complicated, multi-dimensional people rather than the stereotypes they might have become in a lesser film. Tibbs is both aloof and seething while Gillespie is neither a bigot nor saint.Unfortunately, the mystery angle is unsatisfying, and the solution is arbitrary (It's a perfect example of film critic Roger Ebert's "Economy of Characters" rule, which states that no one is introduced into a film without having to serve *some* purpose). I know the killing was only a catalyst for everything that came after, but equal attention could have been focused on both the murder and everything that happens because of it (e.g., "Chinatown"). I also found the movie's pacing to be excruciatingly slow, especially the first half an hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Years later,this film is still socially important and still packs a punch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Norman Jewison,the film "In The Heat Of The Night" won five Oscars including the Best Picture of 1967 over some stiff competition which included "Bonnie and Clyde","The Graduate","Guess Who's Coming To Dinner",and not to mention in the same category the musical "Camelot".Even after some 35 years later after its initial release it is still one socially important masterpiece of a motion picture and to this day still packs a mighty punch. However,this picture came out during a time of one of the most turbulant times in American history and the overall struggle for Civil Rights and at a time when America itself was confronted with its own racism including the escalating saga in Vietnam,and it also focus on the status of the black man in particular as an individual in his own right.Based on the John Ball's novel of the same title,the story takes place in a sleepy little town in Mississippi where the sweltering conflict of racism is found everywhere and it shows during the first twenty minutes of the movie. Sidney Poitier stars as Virgil Tibbs,a young black policeman from Philadelphia who ends up in the small town of Sparta who happens to be the suspect in a grisly murder and is arrested just because he is black. When police chief Bill Gillespie(played by Rod Steiger in the role that won him the Oscar for Best Actor in 1967) learns that Poitier is an police officer and not only that a homicide detective,he enlists his help.However,Virgil is relectant but knows that he is likely the only man who can piece the clues together and solve this complicated case and catch the criminals who did this and bring them to justice. But that will not be easy for our young detective since he has to confront complete bigotry and straight up hatred at every turn not to even mention having his own life hanging in the balance and some dealings with the town mob. Not only that but in turn having Gillespie there for help and every turn to catch a deadly killer.However,there are some fine performances here that makes this film worth seeing. Poitier's portrayal of Virgil Tibbs is excellent and Steiger's portrayal of Bill Gillespie is brillantly portrayal and it shows just by watching these two actors go and it in the prime of their careers. Also straight support performances from Warren Oates and Lee Grant as well. The film itself is overall brillant because of the risk-taking elements that are exposed here and it is handled nicely due to some of the subject matter that is present throughout the film. The direction,and the screenplay are nowadays a standard classic. The film's theme song sung by the great Ray Charles is a wonder to behold and the score by Quincy Jones is superb. A great film that needs to seen again all the way around just to show how different as human beings we can be in hopes of working together in a time of great need. Catch it sometime on either on home video or later on TCM(Turner Classic Movies). Five Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'In the Heat of the Night' was the winner of five Oscars with Norman Jewison for Best Director and the sound editing also receiving nominations, all richly deserved, especially the Best Picture and Best Actor.Although the Best Picture was a strong one, apart from 'Doctor Doolittle', 'In the Heat of the Night' this reviewer finds the best of the five and also one of the greatest films of the 60s.Visually, 'In the Heat of the Night' is an incredibly well-made film with cinematography that's both beautiful and gritty. It is immaculately directed also by Norman Jewison, who directed several other great films, and film and sound editing are also very good, fluid with a suitable unpleasantness which suits the atmosphere well and thrillingly authentic. Quincy Jones' soundtrack at least fits and evokes some good atmosphere, the title song sung by Ray Charles is a classic.The script is incredibly thought-provoking with the racial tension tensely and vividly drawn, never resorting to heavy-handedness or talking at you, something that films with heavy subjects don't always achieve. The "they call me Mr Tibbs" line is iconic. The story is a gripping powerhouse and very ahead of and daring for its time with tremendous power, edge and emotion.Characters are compelling, and the acting couldn't have been better. Rod Steiger has never been better as the bigoted police chief, and Sidney Poitier matches him every step of the way in a subtler and no less powerful performance. Warren Oates and Anthony James stand out in the uniformly strong supporting cast.Overall, fantastic film and one of the greatest films of its decade. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

He brought in for the murder of a prominent man in town. You have an understanding that he is never read his Miranda rights, because of the color of his skin and because he's a new comer to town. No one believes at first that he's just passing through town.After a short interrogation, Sheriff Gillespie discovers that Tibbs is in fact a detective and contacts Tibbs superior to inquire. After the conversation has ended and at the request of his superior Tibbs has been assigned to help the Sparta police department tracker down the murderer.Its horrible how Tibbs is treated during his time in Sparta, just because he's an African American. However you can see that there is some form of friendship building between Tibbs and Gillespie. However neither of them discusses it.</fullReview>

The murder is investigated by a white and a black man and the way that they work despite the problems faced by the community is refreshing in some way.PROS:After some time you yourself will not care about who is the culprit, but will focus on how the two are working. The story is average but there are a great number of exciting moments. The film is focused on what the filmmakers wanted to show. There are no unnecessary details. It keeps you into the subject and the location all the time. The acting by all was fairly OK. The way they showed a Black police officer working in an environment where no one wants him, gives a feeling how they all were treated back then. The charm of the film is the depiction of a white police officer taking help from a black one. CONS: The way the white police officers were shown was unimpressive. They were shown coming to conclusions without even thinking a little bit. May be it was done to show that Virgil was smart. But this type of comparison looks cheap. It makes the general look and feel funny. Also the way they shouted looked so funny even when they were trying to be serious. MESSAGE: "It is not a shame to ask for help."VERDICT: "A recommended watch"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great drama!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This drama takes place in the 60s, before the south had civil rights. Two cops, one mystery to solve. Funny at times, but the DVD I watched had some problems, so I didn't see the whole movie. We will never forget this classic gem. The movie has made me stand up and cheer, but I wasn't born yet when the film was in theaters. Sidney Poiter is the Philadelphia cop, and the Southern cop? I can't remember the actor's name. but this gem will make you feel good, and sometimes bad, due to its racism, violence, and dialogue. This film has a murder victim, and it may scare those under 13. Otherwise, it's one unforgettable gem from the beginning to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>UNITED ARTISTS presents a Mirsch Corporation Production. Directed by Norman Jewison, Written by John Ball (novel), Sterling Silliphant. Original Music by Quincy Jones. Title Song sung by Ray Charles. Starring Sidney Potier, Rod Steiger. With Warren Oates, Lee Grant, Larry Gates, James Patterson, William Scallert, Beah Richards, Peter Whitney, Kermit Murdock, Larry D. Mann, Arthur Malet, Fred Stewart, Quentin Dean, Scott Wilson, Timothy Scott, William Watson, Eldon Quick, Stewart Niesbit, Peter Masterson, Khalil Bezaleel, Phil Adams, Sammy Reese, Anthony James, Nikita Knatz, Buzz Barton, Phillip Garris, Clegg Hoyt, Warren Kenner, Michael Le Glaire, Allan Oppenheimer, David Stinehart, Jack Teter.The Civil Rights Movement was just about cresting at 'high water' when this film debuted. IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT (1967) presents us a story about people in every day life; and makes no mention of the Movement whatsoever.Selection of Principal Players and Supporting Cast was the most important element in getting the story from page to celluloid. The handling of what was a sensitive topic delving into some very touchy areas. We see that Director Jewison is up to the task of making a tale that is tense, gripping, exciting and still relevant to events happening in the Real World.To start off, we have one Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Potier) of The Philadelphia (PA) Police Department being taken into the Town's Police HQ on suspicion of Robbery. This is quickly disposed of by Police Chief Bill Guillespie, an old line Southern Law Man in this Mississippi town.But before Det. Tibbs leaves town, the Chief prevails upon his talents and expertise in helping the Town's P.D in solving a murder. Reluctantly Virgil acquieces to the request.We then follow the Detective around town conducting a real Big City Follow-up Investigation. Usually in company of a Local Cop often Chief Guillespie, himself.After a long, meandering journey through the Town and the People involved, Virgil succeeds, but not without consequences. If it is true that "??..A New Broom sweeps clean!", it certainly applies here; as The Detective from Up North does manage to ruffle the feathers of more than one of the Town's Upper Crust.With the job done, Virgil heads on out. He is taken to the train station by the Chief, himself. As he boards ready to depart, heading for Northern Climes, he is told by the Chief, "Now you take of yourself, Virgil!" This brief declaration meant so much to both men. To Chef Guillespie, it showed true gratitude, humility and recognition of Mr. Tibbs as an equal in the Police Field and as an equal as a Man. To Virgil, it indicated that the hereto for stoic and silent Chief could acknowledge his fallibility in asking for assistance.IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is always mentioned as a cinematic landmark in the Civil Rights movement. It obviously is that. But there is much more to it. Just think a moment.In addition to being saddled with being an outsider to the town as well as a Black Man in the pre-Civil Rights South, the story has thrown several issues out for us to consider and as stumbling blocks for Det. Tibbs.He has to fight ignorance and fear by the working class people. The local poor are always reluctant to talk to or otherwise help the Police, period. He deals with that. Also, those of the Landed Aristocracy feel themselves to be above any of the rules that govern the land. Hence, they believe that they are immune from all of the procedural matters and Police Powers of the State. As for a Class thing, the filthy rich bluebloods always are resentful of any "Commoners" having the authority to command their attention and compliance. This was all negated when Virgil smacked that old, rich guy back. It was the smack heard around the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshingly Unsentimental Examination of Prejudice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The OTHER movie about race relations released in 1967 that also starred Sidney Poitier, "In the Heat of the Night" feels ten times more authentic and much less touchy feely than its fellow Best Picture Oscar nominee, "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." "Night" is aided greatly by a grittier, less sentimental script; a sweaty, sultry location and atmosphere; and a wonderfully gruff performance by Rod Steiger.Steiger plays a sheriff in a small Southern town investigating a murder; Poitier is the hot-shot detective from the big city who shows up to help. One small problem -- he's black. And suddenly, the movie becomes about Steiger and his ability (or lack thereof) to put his personal prejudices aside to make way for his professional responsibilities."Night" works so much better than "Dinner" I think because screenwriter Stirling Siliphant anchors his story around a murder investigation, and the examination of race conflict between the two men and the people around them emerges as an organic offshoot of the main storyline. Director Norman Jewison never preaches to us, and the men don't come to a rosy, sunshine and flowers understanding at the end. Both learn more about one another than they knew at the beginning, but each still has much to learn.Jewison creates a sticky, humid atmosphere that feels just right, and it's contributed to greatly by the sound design, in which night sounds -- crickets, stealthy rustlings, the mournful cry of a far-away freight train -- play a dominant role.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Virgil Tibbs is a black cop who is sent down south to investigate a murder and immediately meets with suspicion and bigotry by the town residents and sheriff. The latter is wonderfully played by the late Rod Steiger, who received an Academy Award for best actor.Steiger thinks of it as nothing to refer to Sidney Poitier as "boy." However, Poitier is too educated and too proper to put up with this racial intolerance.The movie is basically a who did it with racial over-tones. Remember, the 1960s was a very liberal period in America and Hollywood took advantage of it by tackling a variety of social problems.Naturally, Poitier is able to come up with the real killer- a surprise that even amazes Steiger. The picture depicts that by working together, we can develop positive human relations. By the film's end, the sheriff has huge respect for Tibbs and welcomes him back at any time.Lee Grant's role is wasted as the victim's wife. Beah Richards, Poitier's mom, in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner has a small role as well.</fullReview>

Lee Grant and Warren Oakes were superb in their roles, along with the supporting cast. It's a great pity that Sidney Potier missed out on an Oscar which would have been the icing on the cake with Rod Steiger, Lee Grant and Warren Oakes deserved the best supporting role nominations for this year also. I could not imagine a major remake of this movie could ever replace the original genius of those involved with the 1967 production. Having watched this movie over and over, it never fails to impact and deliver a powerful message about how wrongs can be rectified in our lives.</fullReview>

From the first scene of Sidney Portier as he stepped off the train in his suit to the interrogation of the young pregnant girl in the chiefs office to the action of the deputy when he was to be retracing his path in the car and turned off a block sooner so the black officer couldn' see the young girl showing herself in the front room.

		<shortDescription>"What are you going to do about it?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the Civil Rights movement at its peak in the late 1960s, it was inevitable that Hollywood would reflect and comment upon the struggle and the social ills it was addressing. However cultural progress rarely keeps pace with legal progress, and many well-meaning attempts were unfortunately heavy-handed, even patronising affairs. But not all were like that. In the Heat of the Night isn't the best movie on race ever made, but it is among the most dignified and eloquent.The screenplay was adapted from the John Ball novel by Stirling Silliphant, primarily a writer of thrillers and action movies. And what makes his screenplay for In the Heat of the Night work most of all is that it isn't purely about race relations. This is at base level a murder mystery of one white man by another. And this is not some MacGuffin, a mere backdrop for the main themes. This is a genuinely gripping police procedural. And yet the question of racism in America is woven into every scene, sometimes openly, other times beneath the surface. What this picture does then is not to grapple directly with the issues but to show them in action in a real life situation.The director is Norman Jewison, a strongly visual filmmaker who deals in details and fragments. When he's shooting an actor he'll very often give us close-ups of faces and hands, breaking down a performance into marginal elements. His framing may be ostentatious, but his object is always subtle. He's often plopping little ideas into the mix, such as the prominent placing of the black ornament at Endicott's house. It's not an overt statement, it's just a little hint at styles and personalities. Often characters are introduced via a prop or symbol such as the Confederate flag on the bumper of the car ridden by the hoodlums who accost Poitier. For this picture Jewison is also keen on keeping the gritty tension going with almost constant movement in the frame ? a waving car aerial, a flashing "EAT" sign ? even though the camera itself doesn't move too much.This tense atmosphere is carried through to the flawless acting that In the Heat of the Night boasts. Rod Steiger blends perfectly into Jewison's compositions, often keeping his body rigid while his jaw flaps away and his eyes dart around. It's a curious mix of the aggressive and the restrained, implying a man of short temper and firm convictions, but one who doesn't need to expend a lot of energy in getting his point across. Sidney Poitier equals him in quiet dignity. He has a hard, cold stare that makes us sit up and heed his words. Ultimately both performances make us feel the necessary respect for each character. Of the supporting players, the most notable is Beah Richards, who has a short yet pivotal role towards the end of the movie, and pulls it off with the necessary impact.In the Heat of the Night went on to win many major awards and receive much critical acclaim. Some today may see it as a soft option compared to the more contentious Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, which tackles race relations in a "this how it is; deal with it" manner. This is not a bad thing in itself, and a movie like that was needed (although Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is actually a rather flawed effort), but In the Heat of the Night is able to give us a story that has its own integrity, its own strengths as a work of cinema, and that along the way shows us the realistic manner in which race relations can change, even by the smallest of increments, through daily experience and human necessity. This is what makes it the stronger, more timely picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film &amp; an important one. When this movie was released the race attitudes in the United States were still evolving. In fact unlike today the media are the main folks left behind on the race issue, we still had folks who were blatant racists all through our society. This movie confronted this issue at a time when it was daring to do so.Sidney Portier does such a great job as Police Detective Vigil Tibbs, that his depiction of this character alone made it possible to make a sequel to this movie. The material is so good that many years later CBS &amp; Carroll O'Conner did an entire successful TV series called "In The Heat Of The Night" as well.Rod Steiger, a great actor in his own right should not be over looked in this movie. While Steiger was past his peak here, his co-star to Tibbs is essential in supporting a great role. The rest of the cast is loaded with some very good character actors. The story is a strength too as the Detective genre works perfect to frame these characters &amp; be the bedrock to confront race issues.There is nothing wrong with this film &amp; it should be considered an essential film for all viewers from the 1960's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rough Time in Sparta, 1966</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is curious to see the amount of time it took Sidney Poitier to get to his Oscar for LILIES OF THE FIELD (1963) versus the amount of time it took Rod Steiger to get his for IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT (1967). Poitier and Steiger came into films in the 1950s, and both had made some impressive films before they got to the Oscar (Poitier's NO WAY OUT and THE DEFIANT ONES among others; Steiger's supporting role in ON THE WATERFRONT and lead in THE PAWNBROKER). Both of the actors did remarkably good work in a variety of different films (Steiger, for example, actually dances a little as "Jud Fry" in OKLAHOMA) but stardom was a real climb for both. For Poitier it was a matter of race as a block. For Steiger it was physical appearance. As talented an actor as Brando or Cliff or Dean or Newman, Steiger was heavy set not handsome. But this gave him a clear advantage towards really good character parts. Imagine Brando trying to be "Mr. Joyboy" the corpse beautician in THE LOVED ONES.That Poitier did get that Oscar for LILIES was amazing, giving the track record of the Oscars towards African Americans up to the middle 1950s. Aside from Hattie MacDaniel's win in 1939, only Dorothy Dandridge got a nomination (for best actress) between MacDaniel and Poitier. That Steiger got the 1967 Oscar (against Spencer Tracy among other choices) was amazing too. To be fair, however, Ernest Borgnine's Oscar for MARTY and Lee Marvin's for CAT BALLOU both preceded Steiger's (Marvin by only two years). But both were playing against type as good guys (in Marvin's case as a comic good guy). Steiger ends being one of the good guys in IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, but he has to struggle with his entire background and social beliefs to reach out to Poitier at the end.Set in the small southern town of Sparta, town deputy Sam Wood (Warren Oates) discovers the dead body of one Philip Colbert, an industrialist from the North about to build a factory in Sparta that may rejuvenate the local economy. Problem is that Colbert being a northerner was willing to invite African-Americans to have a chance for employment too. This does not sit too well with many locals, such as the richest man in the town, Eric Endicott (Larry Gates). So when Wood reports the murder to town Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Steiger) they are aware that the sooner the case is solved the better. And solved by the simplest explanation (i.e., murder by a robber). Gillespie suggests his men look for suspicious characters, and Wood, in passing the train station, sees a well dressed African - American (Poitier) and arrests him as a likely suspect (about to flee by train). Steiger is smart, but is as bigoted as Oates is. Chief Gillespie is about to accept the suspect for arrest, when he is informed by the suspect he is Detective Virgil Tibbs of the Philadelphia Police Department.From the start there is mutual distrust and dislike between the men. Everyone recalls Poitier's famous forceful comment, "They call me Mr. Tibbs!" when Steiger sneers at him, but first Steiger makes fun of that first name "Virgil". However, Poitier's expertise as a homicide detective causes Steiger to realize he could use the latter's abilities to solve the crime. Poitier is ordered to do so by his Philadelphia chief. So they become locked together in an attempt (made difficult by their mutual culture war) to find out who killed Philip Colbert.Gillespie soon thinks it was a young man (Scott Wilson) he and his deputies cornered who certainly had the dead man's wallet (one has to note that Gillespie is a "good ole boy" but a really sharp one). However, some inconsistencies in the suspect are pointed out by Tibbs to Mrs. Colbert (Lee Grant, in a too short, but still effective role), who insists he stay on and find the real killer. This annoys Gillespie and his deputies, but soon they find that Poitier has some good points. Unfortunately some of these points suggest that the killer might be the important Endicott.It is a remarkably balanced film, and Steiger makes one see just how hard it is for a small-town southerner to shake his prejudices when confronted by them. Gillespie not only struggles against his own aggravation from Tibbs, but those of his townspeople (including the deputies). His key scene (to me) is when Endicott slaps Tibbs in the face, thinking him an "uppity" type. Tibbs slaps the stunned millionaire back. What also stuns Endicott is Gillespie's staring at the two and not reacting (as the town mayor, William Schallert, later says, Gillespie would have shot any other African-American doing that as an act of self-defense). After that you know that no matter how annoyed Gillespie is, he is slowly realizing Tibbs is his equal.Tibbs by the way is not flawless either. His investigation gets twisted by his dislike of Endicott. And he is capable of remembering slights...when Wood is arrested later as a suspect, the deputy is gently trying to coax Tibbs to help him while Tibbs visits another prisoner. Tibbs pointedly ignores the man who originally arrested him, and treated him like dirt.The film's plot is a twisted one, and yet from the start the clues are there for the astute viewer to put together. But if it was just a "who-done-it" IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT would have been forgotten long ago. It still is an excellent view of the last decades of the "Jim Crow" South, just as the civil rights movement was coming into its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Investigation of a murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having seen this film for a while, we decided to pay a second look when TCM showed it the other night. The DVD transfer looks as though the movie was shot recently. "In the Heat of the Night" was one of the best films directed by Norman Jewison. He showed a great affinity to the material in the screen play by Stirling Sillipant, and based on a novel by John Ball, deals with a crime committed in a small Southern town.Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphia police detective, happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. He had just visited his mother and was going to Memphis on the early morning train. When a prominent citizen, a Mr. Colbert, is found dead by one of the town's policemen, Sam Wood. The policeman had observed Virgil at the waiting area of the local rail station when he made his rounds, prior to finding the body, so it's easy to pin the crime to a black man without any proof. After all, these small minded people in Sparta haven't moved with the times and any black person is considered guilty.The local sheriff, Bill Gillespie, is a prejudiced man. He doesn't believe that Virgil Tibbs is a policeman at all; his suit tells the bigoted man he is up to no good. Unfortunately, Gillespie is proved wrong. Tibbs shows his superiority when he examines the body of Mr. Colbert. He realizes the man has been killed some place else and dumped in the street for Sam Wood to find. It's at the widow's insistence that Tibbs is asked to stay and investigate the case.Tibbs, who is an unwelcome presence in town gets to experience, first hand, the town's prejudice. From Mr. Endicott, to Mayor Stewart, to the other policemen, he represents someone from their past, who under the old South would have been eliminated without any problem. Virgil shows everyone he is a better man by investigating and solving the mystery behind the crime. At the end, a contrite Gillespie brings Tibbs to the railway station where he was at the beginning of the story and although he doesn't come right out to thank him, the sheriff realizes how wrong he was.The film works because the great chemistry between the two male stars, Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. Mr. Poitier was at the top of his craft and popularity. He always appeared in roles that were dignified and always projected a positive figure. Rod Steiger, on the other hand, was an actor with another background who was not afraid to tackle more controversial characters like this Gillespie who couldn't measure up to Tibbs.Mr. Jewison got good performances out of the supporting cast. Warren Oates, who is seen as Sam Wood, the local policeman, has some effective moments. Anthony James plays the local greasy spoon cook with conviction. Scott Wilson had an interesting role of a wrongly accused man. Lee Grant appears for a moment only. Larry Gates, William Schaller, and the wonderful Beah Richards, have also great moments in this satisfying movie.Quincy Jones contributed to the musical score that plays well with the southern atmosphere. Haskell Wexler photographed with his usual visual style. Hal Ashby, a man who went to bigger and better things, edited the film. Ultimately all credit must go to Norman Jewison for a film that has aged well and it's worth another look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just a Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the Heat of the Night" appears as a thriller (an assassinated man and the search for his murderer) but no doubt director Norman Jewison goes for more. In fact the investigation and the revealing of the murderer at the end is just standard and the excuse to deal with racism in a small southern United States town back in the 60's.Sidney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs a Detroit homicide detective involved by chance in the mysterious killing and he is forced to join local sheriff Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) to solve the problem. As they get to the job Tibbs presence is rejected by racist citizens who don't like a black man to tell them what to do as he shows he is the best qualified man. The film is most interesting and well handled in all and has some memorable moments the most perhaps when Poitier slaps back a white man and Gillespie can't believe what he is seeing.Poitier is as good as usual as the self confident and educated Tibbs (he repeated the role in "The Organization", a watchable but inferior product). Rod Steiger is outstanding (he was awarded and Oscar) as the sheriff that learns to sort of admire the black man's investigation skill and professionalism and even gets to like him. Lee Grant as the dead man's wife and Warren Oates as the main deputy are a good supporting cast.A most entertaining and well done picture no doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Quincy Jones' score to Haskell Wexler's cinematography "In the Heat of the Night" is worthy of inclusion on anyone's top ten films list. But as ground breaking as the film was on the subject of 1967 race relations, the most amazing thing is how well it has held up almost 40 years later. I think it rings so true because of way they elected to play several key scenes. Watch for the carefully orchestrated scene between Mrs. Colbert (Lee Grant) and Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) when alone in the chief's office early in the film. He has just told her that her husband has been murdered and she recoils from his first two attempts to comfort her. Given the upfront racism exhibited in the film up to that point, you assume that it is more of the same. But this is Mrs. Colbert's first scene and when she does not rebuff his third attempt to comfort her you realize that she is completely unaware of his race, she is just devastated by what he has told her and would have rebuffed anyone as she struggled to accept what she has just learned. The attentive viewer realizes that their own prejudice, kindled by what they have seen up to that point in the film, caused them to jump to the wrong conclusion about her character's motivation. Then watch for the evolving attitude of Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) toward Tibbs. Early on he comes to professionally respect him (as he respects the town's black mechanic), then he comes to respect Tibbs as a man when he slaps Endicott (something no other man-black or white-would dare), and finally he comes to respect him as a human being when Tibbs reveals a lust to take Endicott down. The irony being that it is finding Tibbs capable of a higher level human weakness (not a strength) that opens Gillespie's eyes to the fallacy of racism. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, classic film with strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Norman Jewison made this film at the height of the civil rights movement. Four years earlier the March on Washington had resulted in over 200,000 people joining together to protest, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had eliminated voting taxes and other schemes to keep blacks from being able to vote.Martin Luther King, Jr. was still at the top of his power in 1967 (he would die a year later) and blacks had made a huge leap forward, but the south was still hugely bigoted and this film really exposes the racial tension between two men.This is all important to know beforehand because it gives the film a backdrop that you really need to be aware of prior to viewing it.Sidney Poitier stars as a detective from the north sent to investigate a racially-motivated killing in a small southern town, which is led by the bigot cop played by Rod Steiger.Steiger has no respect for Poitier, and when he asks what they call him up there in the north, it results in one of the cinema's most famous lines ("They call me MR. Tibbs!").It's interesting to note that the director of this film, Norman Jewison, had planned on making a Malcolm X biopic with Denzel Washington in the early 1990s, but it was stolen from him by Spike Lee, who had no involvement with the picture but felt "a white man couldn't tell it" the same as a black man. What's particularly ironic is that the same "white man who couldn't tell" a story about a black man turned out one of the most important civil rights films of the 1960s and arguably one of the best films, in general, of all-time. Spike Lee has yet to make a film as thought-provoking as "In the Heat of the Night." Steiger and Poitier have great chemistry together and you can really see their friendship develop -- realistically, too -- as the film progresses. It doesn't seem cheap or contrived -- it seems genuine -- and I think that's essential for any film like this.Highly entertaining, but not "just" entertainment -- it has a message, too.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In the Heat of the Night" is a typical movie of which you can say 'They don't make them like this anymore' and a real shame that is.The movie is a typical 'whodunnit' movie cleverly disguised as a racial themed movie. To be honest the whole murder mystery storyline isn't that new or interesting but it truly is the racial theme of the movie that makes this a classic. The tension between Det. Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) and Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) is perfectly scripted and portrayed by the actors and it's beautiful to see how the two slowly gain each others respect. What I love about "In the Heat of the Night" is the objectivity of it. In movies like this it's very easy to make all the white characters bad guys and make the black person the helpless victim of their racial ideas. But Virgil Tibbs in this movie also isn't a perfectly good person. He is determent to find evidence that a racial person which he had a bad encounter with, did the killing. Both sides have certain prejudices about each other and that is perfectly shown in this movie. The whole racial theme, in the way as it's portrayed in this movie, might be a bit outdated and not relevant anymore now but most of the racial elements in the movie are still relevant, which makes "In the Heat of the Night" also still these days a powerful and important movie to watch. The movie has a splendid Southern atmosphere and the musical score by Quincy Jones suits the movie perfectly and adds to this atmosphere.The movie its character are perfectly portrayed by the impressive cast. Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger play or both on par with each other and portray some impressive characters. Only Steiger won an Oscar for his role while Poitier wasn't even nominated.The movie might be a bit slow at times and the 'whodunnit' elements of the movie also aren't done in the greatest way, "In the Heat of the Night" still remains an unforgettable and still important movie to watch.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was soo good. In the beginning I thought it was going to be about a black man getting charged with something he didn't do. I was so relieved when he told the chief of police that he was a detective. As I watched this movie it made me happy to see that the chief of police (Bill Gillespie)got close. It kind of predicted the future, now it is so normal to see blacks and whites together (THANK THE LORD). So I really thought that Sidney Poiter did a wonderful job in this film. I especially liked the scene where he as Virgil Tibbs, slapped the white man, after the white man had slapped him. I was really relieved when Bill didn't do anything, but try to get him out of town, just to save him, in reaction to the action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Poiteir and Rod Steiger have the defining roles of their careers in this superb crime thriller which sees smart black detective Virgil Tibbs (Poitier) solving a murder case whilst battling the prejudices of an all-white town, governed by a bigoted sheriff (Steiger). Norman Jewison's film, taut and stylishly directed, does not so much concern itself with the plot as it does with the uneasy relationship between the two men yet the film is nevertheless engrossing from start to finish thanks to the performances of the two leads, whose contrasting acting styles (the former, cool and elegant, the latter loud and forceful) drive the drama. In less capable hands, the film could easily be dated fare today. Fortunately, this is not the case and the result is not only a cracking dramatization of sixties racial tension but a screen classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful movie crafted by an all-star team</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a callow youth when I first saw this film and failed to appreciate its brilliance. I saw it as a message movie in which the condemnation of racial prejudice was sugarcoated by presenting it in the form of a whodunit. As an educated Northern liberal, I felt that I didn't need this oblique approach. I could take the truth straight. After all, I knew about the horrible racial situation in the deep South from listening to protest songs by Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs. What I failed to appreciate is what a superb example of move-making it is. The early scenes in which Sidney Poitier is pulled in for the murder of the rich white entrepreneur proceed with a rhythm and snap that is irresistible. He and Rod Steiger play off one another like opponents in a high stakes tennis game. The advantage keeps shifting from one to the other. The device in which two strong characters learn to respect and ultimately like one another as the result of a sharp struggle of wills is an old one, but rarely has it been used to such effect as here. It is little wonder that the film is so well crafted considering the team that collaborated on it. The cinematographer Haskell Wexler and editor Hal Ashby were soon to become important directors in their own right, but it is clear that at this stage in their careers these two major talents were willing to contribute to the synergy of the project, however eager they may have been to take the directorial reins themselves. This powerful cooperative vision is apparent all through the film but especially in scenes like the one between Poitier and Lee Grant in which the tension between emotion and convention achieves an almost balletic expression. Director Norman Jewison must have played a key role in distilling that vision from the Sterling Siliphant script and bringing it into focus. The performances are all extraordinary, particularly that of Steiger, who richly deserves the Oscar he received for his efforts. I have to say though that while I found Pointier's performance powerful, I thought it lacked the depth of characterization that made Steiger's police chief so fully realized. Poitier is a man out of his element, but he does not convey much of a sense of the element from which he comes. The Philadelphia police force of which he is a part exists only as an abstraction. Aside from the brief phone conversation in which his boss confirms his identity then asks him to aid Steiger with the investigation, there is little in Poitier's characterization to make us feel that he is part of an organization, that he comes from a particular area of the country, that he has colleagues, family, and friends, that he has worked his way up from somewhere and has ambitions to go somewhere else, in short, that he is a specific human being, rather than an embodiment of intelligence and outraged dignity. But that one caveat aside, the movie is still marvelous and holds up extremely well after almost 40 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless classic, multiple Oscar winner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting to place classic movies in personal history, and 'In The Heat Of The Night' came out about the time I graduated from college. I wasn't particularly interested in movies back then, and I don't recall noticing this one. But I now know of its pedigree, Best Picture and for Rod Steiger as the Police Chief, Best Actor. Also, the movie which created Virgil Tibbs for Sidney Poitier. Set in the South, it is difficult to watch for its theme of hard racial prejudice, but for deep southern states like Mississippi and Alabama, probably realistic for that period. Some of it is dated, as it is no longer an oddity to see a black police officer or black attorney, we've long ago abandoned calling a black man 'boy' (I hope, anyway), and blacks no longer have separate sections in restaurants or separate restroom facilities. But all those things were in place in the South, and seeing this movie is a reminder how absurd things were just a few short years ago.SPOILERS are in the rest of my comments, quit reading OK!?Filmed in Sparta, Il, the movie is set in Sparta, Ms. Redneck as they come. The body of a wealthy man in town to build a factory is discovered in the street by night patrol, a black man is found at the train station, naturally he is arrested, and money in his wallet almost seals his guilt. Until Tibbs is found to be a police officer returning to Philadelphia, where he is the top crime investigator. The Sparta police are hapless, Tibbs reluctantly sticks around after his boss suggests it, mainly to satisfy his ego, to show those stupid white cops how much smarter he is. And he is. He examines the body, uses temperature to establish the time of death, finds traces of a nursery product which leads him to the greenhouse of a wealthy rival of the dead businessman (which turns out to be a red herring of sorts). Basically exonerates the accused and brings out the guilty by his powers of discovery. Who is actually guilty and why are secondary, the movie is really about race relations and how this black detective from 'up north' won over the bigoted white simpletons 'down south.' I suspect it wouldn't really have happen that easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DVD of ITHOTN is one of the best I've seen. The commentary by Norman Jewison,Rod Stieger and Lee Grant is very well done. The image and sound have been restored and look good as new. A grainy, scratched theatrical trailer is included for contrast. Rod Steiger is fascinating to watch and deserved the best actor Oscar.The supporting cast is excellent also. Filming began in southern Illinois in the summer and fall of 1966 in the towns of Sparta and Belleville. The Endicott plantation scenes were shot in Tennessee. The direction by Norman Jewison is taut and visually compelling. The chemistry between Rod Stieger and Sidney Poiter is evident during their scenes together. Great character actors include, William Schallert (who also appeared in an "in the heat of the night "TV series episode). Anthony James and Arthur Malet (who appeared as the gay hitchhikers in 1971's Vanishing point). Scott Wilson from Truman Capote's "In cold blood". Timothy Scott (also from Vanishing Point). and the late great Warren Oates.We recently spent two days in Sparta and stayed in a 1854 B&amp;B that appears in the film.The downtown is virtually unchanged and the train depot has been restored.We saw many filming locations and found it to be a friendly town unlike the violent,racist burg portrayed in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you want to see a great character-based movie, this is it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people who have reviewed this movie keep talking about Poiter and how the movie is about racism in the south, but all I hear is blah, blah, blah. What makes this movie so good is not the fact that it deals with racism and was made in the 1960s, but the fact that Steiger plays the most badass police chief with a heart of gold I have ever seen. Seriously, the best part of this movie is seeing how great a guy this character is, even if he is prejudiced and somewhat arrogant. In order to understand what the film is really about, you have to have lived in the south for some time. Poiter does an excellent job as well, but his character is not nearly as likable, which is why the oscar went to Steiger in the first place IMO. But that's because he's a black cop from the north who thinks he's better than everyone, no racism intended. Also, the movie shows the relationships Gillespie has with other people in the town and shows his internal struggle and thought process a lot more clearly than it does the outsider. I could go on, but that's enough to say for imdb. Anyway, great movie, and Chief Gillespie is badass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific study of conflict and teamwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The small Mississippi town of Sparta is dealt a puzzling blow when one of its leading citizens is found bludgeoned to death in the street in the middle of the night. Within minutes, the police have arrested their prime suspect, a Black man who was waiting for a train. However, to the disappointment of the police, the man turns out to be a police officer himself, heading home after a visit to his mother. Thus begins the tenuous relationship between the bloated, lazy sheriff (Steiger) and the refined, diligent city officer (Poitier.) They form an uneasy alliance in order to uncover the real killer while fending off the various local bigots and thugs who resent the presence of a Black man who is above his station in life. Director Jewison provides sensational direction of this character study masquerading as a murder mystery. The scenes are bursting with amazing acting performances and fine detail along with well-crafted stagings and camera setups. Steiger is amazing in his role. His method training immersed him completely in the life and world of the police chief. Poitier's customary dignity and quiet authority is a perfect counterpoint. The two make a fascinating pair. Both actors give fully conceived performances, with Steiger taking home the Oscar for his. Exceptional support is provided by virtually all the actors, but most notably Oates as an inept local officer, Grant (always compelling) as the stunned, outraged wife of the deceased and Gates as the prime enemy of the dead man. Oates is thoroughly authentic in his role. Grant gets one of the all time memorable scenes of shock as she finds out that her husband has been killed. She perfectly captures the disbelief of the situation versus the standard approach of screaming and flailing. Gates has one of the most memorable scenes in which he tries to put Poitier in his place and learns fast that it won't work. There are other bits of strong work from the cast, many of whom have since become familiar faces in other films and TV shows. The film takes place in a time and a world which is gone now, but the basic attitudes and feelings are still relevant. It won't fully satisfy the explosion and gunfire crowd, but thoughtful viewers will find much to admire in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the heat of the night, by Norman Jewison, shows the blunt racism towards African Americans in the 60's. The movie came out in 1967, a time where society was confronting its own racism. The movie shows how initial assumptions arent always right.Chief Bill Gillespie, originally accuses Virgil Tibbs of a murder based on his color and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. As the story continues, he finds out Tibbs is a great detective, and eventually asks for his aid in solving the murder case. The director was trying to show that differences in color isn't always a barrier on work and/ or friendship. For the time that the movie was made, the cinematography and creation of the movie was very good. Many very creative shots were pulled off, and everything seemed to work to work well together. The acting was very good too. In several parts you could see Virgil Tibbs keeping himself from blowing up in a reaction to the way he was treated. For the most part he always managed to stay cool, in the toughest situations. The music, featuring artists such as Ray Charles, gave a good feel for the time period. I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars. I think it was a great movie, well made and about a good topic, but in parts it seemed to be a little slow. This is not the movie for you if you are into non-stop action, and explosions left and right. This is for you however, if you appreciate a good story, with good acting, promoting good ideas. For the most part I think most people would enjoy this great movie.</fullReview>

The relationship that develops between Tibbs(Poitier) and Gillespie(Stieger) is the true focus of this film. Their brilliant performances are what make this movie a classic, not the murder mystery plot. I highly recommend this film, just don't go into it expecting some wonderful who-done-it type of plot.

		<fullReview>Title: In the Heat of the Night Year: 1967Taking place in the 1960's, a small town southern Police Chief (Rob Steiger) overcomes his bigotry when he is assigned to work with an African Americanhomicide detective (Sidney Poitier), as they solve a murder mystery. Screenwriters John Ball and Stirling Silliphant, and Director NormanJewison could not have portrayed the racism and segregation of the mid 20thcentury better. The characters of Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) and Chief Bill Gillespie (Rob Steiger) were carefully and progressively developed to changebased on the progression of their friendship, which was unusual and disgraced at the time. Jewison's direction was incessantly notable throughout. The small motifs, such as the manor and names Gillespie used to address Tibbs, and thesimple metaphors like Gillespie's "equality" sunglasses, could not have beenmore appropriately used. Sidney Poitier made for a perfect Virgil Tibbs, always level headed and cool, as did the aggressive, yet adaptable Rob Steiger, as Bill Gillespie. The music choice was phenomenal on the part of Quincy Jones and RayCharles. The movieís soundtrack, clearly helps to emphasize the mood andintensity of each scene, particularly the "crossing the border" scene withGillespie. However, as a mystery, the movie lacked an interesting motive for murder andscantily developed the murderer. The progression of solving the crime wasintense and suspenseful, but the final outcome leaves the viewer wondering,why all that fuss for such a common motive? **** 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this Oscar-winning crime drama that spawned one of the best series of the 1980s, "In the Heat of the Night" profiles the murder of an industrialist in a small Mississippi town and the tense investigation that follows. Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs, a black homicide expert paired with white city police chief Steiger. The film explores the strained teamwork between the two, Steiger's resentment at Poitier's Tibbs, while giving fresh insight into the crime drama as a whole. Despite an underlying theme of the folly of racism, "In the Heat of the Night" doesn't bear the viewer with a morality tale. Won many awards, including Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (Steiger), and nominated for many more.</fullReview>

Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) is falsely arrested for the crime. He then proves his innocence to the chief of police (Rod Steiger). The chief soon realizes that his men are not capable of solving the crime and then Virgil joins in on the chase to help find the murderer. This movie is great. It shows how some men and woman today still have old racist beliefs. I'm really surprised the movie got a PG rating.

		<shortDescription>A Really Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would just like to say up front that I am not a particularly big fan of movies made during the 1960's. Now I'm an African-American and since this movie was made in 1967, when racism was a major issue in this country, it touched me very deeply. A wealthy white businessman from Chicago is found dead, the victim of an apparent homicide, in a southern racist town. The police, being the bigots that they are, think they have the murderer when they arrest Virgil Tibbs(Sidney Poitier), an African-American police officer from Philadelphia who is there to visit his mother. The sheriff(Rod Steiger in an Oscar-Winning performance) laughs at Virgil's claims of being a police officer, a high-ranking officer at that. The scene where Virgil tells the sheriff of how much money he makes is a striking moment. When Virgil's identity is confirmed by the Philadelphia police, they say that he must stay in town until the crime is solved. Staying in the town, however, is not going to be pleasant as many of the local residents think that Virgil should leave while he still has a chance. This movie is so under-appreciated by critics and the movie-going public alike. Didn't this movie used to be on the IMDb Top 250 List? I mean, what happened? Why did it get booted off? Why isn't it still on there? I'm sick of all the people who say that this movie is so overrated. Please. Sure, In The Heat Of The Night won Best Picture in 1967, but that was 1967, everybody has probably forgotten it since then. Sidney Poitier is a great actor whose performance in this movie was completely overlooked by the Academy Awards. Rod Steiger's performance here was good as well. He really did deserve the Oscar for Best Actor, but Sidney Poitier should gotten at least a nomination. This movie should also have gotten an Oscar nomination for it's hip 60's soundtrack. The Ray Charles song "In The Heat Of The Night" is a classic. One scene I would like to personally comment on, is the scene inside the jail cell where Virgil is talking to Harvey, the guy suspected of killing the businessman. The reason is because the way the bars are casting a shadow over his face. They show separated Virgil is from everyone else in the movie. I love this movie and I'm never, never ever going to get tired of it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the great actor, Sidney Poitier, was honored for his life-time screen works, he (as expected) select the film, "In The Heat of the Night" as his most impressive achievement. In it, he plays Det. Virgil Tibbs a police officer on vacation who is deliberately arrested by Off. Sam Woods (Warren Oates) as he aptly fits the profile of a thief and murderer. Today, in many towns, we call that 'Racial Profiling.' Yet in that day and age, they (people of the south) called it justifiable law enforcement. Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) the top cop in the Southern, bigoted town called Sparta is as sure as Woods, that his office has caught the right man. Everything is as it should be, until Tibbs, reveals to the Chief, he is a major city police Lieutenant and Law Enforcement Homicide expert. What follows is perhaps the finest dramatic duel between two exceptional actors ever. The superb cast includes, Lee Grant as Mrs. Leslie Colbert, Larry Gates as Eric Endicott, James Patterson as Purdy and William Schallert as Mayor Webb Schubert. The challenge for the prejudicial Police is to somehow use the expertise of the Black detective to solve the murder of a rich tycoon who planned to build a major business opportunity for the town. That is, without ruffling his feathers. The racial atmosphere, tense situations and exceptional acting is the reason why this film became a Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Things Can Pass Through the Walls of Racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like so many REALLY good murder/spy mysteries, the basic murder mystery is just a vehicle for what the film is REALLY about. This is very much the case of In the Heat of the Night.Laid in a time when LBJ's emancipating social reforms were sticking in the American white racists's craw, this is a new kind of anti-racism picture. At the beginning,we have a well-dressed, well educated Negro, up against a prejudiced, loud-mouthed Southerner who is practically the blueprint for Clifton James's Sheriff J W Pepper in the James Bond films. Putting the educated Negro in a racist environment to show up the ignorance of the racists is not quite new. But in In the Heat of the Night there is one important difference: the Sheriff grows out of his prejudices. And that is the basic message of the film. Southerners are not ogres. Give them the time, give them the opportunity, and they will learn to accept LBJ's reforms, and the events of Selma, Alabama, will become as irrelevant as animosity towards the British over the American War of Independence.Now here is something even more interesting. The Sheriff is treating Virgil Tibbs as he would any Negro suspect...until he discovers that Tibbs is a police officer. Police officers can murder people,too. But as soon as he discovers that Tibbs is JOB, then, so far as the Sheriff is concerned, Tibbs is an innocent man. His bile turns instead on his deputy, the arresting officer. He tosses Tibbs's badge in front of him and growls: "Yeah! YEAH! YYEEAAHH!!" His attitude towards the educated, affluent, Tibbs with his posh name and his correct grammar changes, too; but, cleverly, that change is gradual. The sheriff and Tibbs have something in common: they are both on the same side of the fight against crime. And that is more powerful than colour or background could ever be.Rod Steiger is a magnificent, powerful actor - so powerful that he is quite capable of taking over an entire film, even though he might only have a small part. It is to Sidney Poitier's credit that he is not at all swamped by Steiger, and gives a performance that is the equal of Steiger's. This film was something of a watershed so far as the examination of racial issues is concerned; and seems as fresh today as it was back in the 1960s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic film that manages to be better than the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember clearly seen this picture when it came out in 1967. As a young man of 16, I had grown as a moviegoer and as a person. Having been a film fanatic since I was a young boy, I went to movies about once a week, and by this point had become a trite more sophisticated in both my tastes in film and in my awareness of such things as social politics. I hadn't read the book until the years later, and was surprised at the differences though the shock. After all, just about every book that it becomes a motion picture is changed considerably from the original, but it was a very small detail that made the film superior to its original source. The two leads in this film (Sidney Poitier as detective Virgil Tibbs and Rod Steiger as Chief Gillespie) are different in both race and age, two sometimes volatile elements in a situation like a homicide investigation in the deep South during the 1960s. Mind you, my knowledge of life in this region of the United States was and is limited to what I saw on the nightly news and in novels and motion pictures like this. But I do know that a black man in a different surrounding around people who don't know him can be asking for trouble, especially if there is a homicide investigation going on. The recent Stewart case here in Boston makes my point. I suspect that the director, Norman Jewison, thought that the age difference would add a certain added tension to the relationship between the two factors, not to mention that these were two acting powerhouses. Here is the single thing that the book is does not have. The author John Ball sought to make his point by making bold characters the same age, and while this may work well on paper, it loses something in the visual sense. Normally, I am not a big fan of Mr. Jewison's work. To this day, I refuse to watch his "Fiddler On The Roof" because of his intentionally not casting the great Zero Mostel in the role he made famous on Broadway, but this film scores in just about every way imaginable. Lee Grant appears in this film after many years from the time the infamous blacklist kept her from working, and she is magnificent in the role of the widow to the murder victim. The elements of sexuality and brief nudity certainly made it a major event in this moviegoers life. After all, I was 16 at the time. But the racial implications of sexuality were somewhat lost on me that young age and makes this film a true treasure to revisit. Just watch the scene where Virgil views the naked body of a woman in the County morgue. And to this day, I will not enter a home that has a black lawn jockey on the front lawn.  I believe that writing a review of this movie without mentioning the splendid work of actress Beah Richards would be a huge mistake. Just the one scene between she and Poitier is a prime example of great acting. You must see the film yourself. My description could not possibly do it justice. Needless to say, it rings true in a somewhat eerie and sad fashion and also speaks volumes to the class differences of black and white in the South at this time in history. 1967 had a lot of great films, and I recall being stunned that "Bonnie and Clyde" was overlooked with the exception of the Oscar win to best supporting actress Estelle Parsons, but "In The Heat Of The Night" he observed the title of best picture of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger are excellent in In the Heat of the Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Happy birthday, Mr. Tibbs! Exactly three years ago when I reviewed Sidney Poitier in Paris Blues, I ended it with those exact words when I found out it was his 81st. Now, on his 84th, those words are even more pertinent since the comment I'm now writing is about the very movie that introduced him as that iconic character that I read is one of his favorites. And how convenient that this very film, among various films I'm reviewing featuring people of color in chronological order for Black History Month this year, is the 33rd on the list I've gotten to so far as it indeed provided such a wonderful coincidence to comment on. Anyway, Det. Virgil Tibbs gets arrested by deputy Sam Wood (Warren Oates) for the murder of a Mr. Colbert simply because of his color and when Chief of Police Bill Gillespie (Oscar winner Rod Steiger) realizes his error, he wants Tibbs out of town quickly but Virgil's boss in Philly wants him to stay to help solve the murder which the Chief reluctantly agrees since he admits he's not a homicide expert. And then there's the widow Mrs. Colbert (Lee Grant), who after finally getting the truth about her husband from Tibbs, is threatening to pull her factory workers out of town if he doesn't stay. Among the suspects is the racist cotton plantation boss named Endicott (Larry Gates)...I'll stop there and just say this was a very well-made murder mystery by director Norman Jewison with a fine script from Stirling Silliphant-adapted from John Ball's novel-and a likewise score from Quincy Jones, of which both of the latter people had previously worked for Poitier on The Slender Thread. And seeing Sidney in action is very exciting indeed especially when he slaps Endicott back after getting one beforehand from him for accusing him of possibly killing Mr. Colbert as they seemed so friendly previously. Among other people of color in the cast are Jester Hairston-who I previously mentioned dubbed Poitier's singing voice in Lillies of the Field a few days ago-as the butler who witnessed the slapping, Beah Richards as Mama Celeba-who becomes an important figure in figuring out the murderer, and, I think, Warren Kenner, who I found out on IMDb that he appeared in a few other black-oriented movies in the future and I think is the mechanic who gives Virgil a place to stay but is simply listed as Unidentified on this particular movie in this site. By the way, he died in 1989 in New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from where I live. And how cool is it hearing Ray Charles warble the title song, composed-like the other ones in the soundtrack-by Jones with lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. Anyway, while I'm not sure this was a better film than The Graduate or Bonnie and Clyde (the other movies this beat for Best Picture at the Oscars), In the Heat of the Night is indeed a great movie worth watching over and over. So once again, Happy birthday, Mr. Tibbs!</fullReview>

I'm thinking' how nice it'd be if I had a cool fountain drink. Sam comes down our road just like he comes every night passin' like a Lord in that fine, big, shiny car. Only, this time he stops. He's got a nice face, don't you think, Chief? -So he stopped.- (softly) He says... - What? I didn't hear what you said. (louder) He says..."Hey, little girl, you know what the coolest spot in town is? And I said "No, Sam. I guess I don't." And he said..." The cemetery. That's where." "Know why?" "Cos they got all of them big, cool tombstones." "Ever stretch out on a tombstone, Delores?" "Feel all that nice, cool marble all along your body?" - He said that? - All right. Sam comes along and stops in front of your house and talks. What else? Well, come on now, girl. What else? What else? What else? - Then I went for a ride with him. - Where'd you go? The cemetery. So, Wood took you to the cemetery in the patrol car, right? And then things went a bit too far. Is that what you're sayin? Did they get a little bit outta line? Come on now. Is that what you're trying' to say? Come on, girl! Is it or ain't it? Yeah, they went too far! - Well, fine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparta, Illinois</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "goofs" section points out that the real Sparta, Mississippi, is too far away from the Mississippi River for the capture of Harvey Oberst to have been carried out by the Sparta Police. However, the real Sparta, MS, is such a tiny town that it does not appear in Rand McNally's "Road Atlas." With the Sparta in the film obviously being a town of some size (having been filmed in and around Sparta, Illinois, pop. near 5,000), it is fair to say that the Sparta in the film was intended to be a fictitious MS town located along or near the Mississippi River across from Arkansas. A Mapquest search shows that Sparta, MS, does not even appear to be an incorporated town. What it was like in 1966 is entirely unknown. The scene in which Harvey is captured takes place on the Mississippi River bridge at Chester, Illinois. This is my favorite film of all time. Some undergraduate acquaintances at the U. of Illinois from the Sparta area said the filming was the talk of the area. A neighbor of mine, originally from Sparta, IL, had many an anecdote about the filming process. I do not know where the cotton plantation scene was filmed, but certainly not in Illinois. If anyone has some stories about the filming of this great movie, please post them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Poitier is a Philadelphia Homicide detective. He comes home to the south to see his mother. He's arrested on general principles because a rich white man is murdered. He's black so he's automatically a suspect.But when the police find out who he really is, they call Philadelphia. Poitier's boss suggests that he help the police solve the murder because the sheriff (Rod Steiger) isn't that qualified to handle a murder investigation.The two men learn to work together, despite their differences. Poitier ultimately gets the respect and friendship that he wanted from Steiger. With this accomplished, the case begins to unravel.Both of the leads are equally good in this one. Poitier gives his best work and Steiger doesn't let us down. The plot, as you can see, is very interesting and is true to what can happen in a southern town like the one in the film. It won five Oscars including Picture, Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, and Sound. It was nominated for Director and Special Effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not executed very well....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really starts off well. It is tense, you can feel the heat, and there is some real suspense. The beginning, however, is a good as this film gets. It is downhill from there. Jewison does a good enough job directing this film. The problem with it, however, lies in the script by Silliphant. It is a script that tries to be socially conscious, and build that around a mystery or investigation. This doesn't work out very well however, for numerous reasons.First of all, Poitier as Mr.Tibbs, and Steiger as Gillespie are both good, but Steiger is excellent in his role. The problems of this film cannot be blamed on either of its leads. They were both excellent and carried themselves well. The only thing that keeps this otherwise bland mystery going is the interaction between the two. The problem though, and this is a scripting and story problem, is that the relationship between the two is extremely repetitious throughout the movie. Steiger constantly tries to best Poitier, and then likes him, and then tries to best him and so on. There is really nothing new to it, no real layers. The first scenes with the two are excellent, and then its the same thing for the rest of the film.Another thing that bothered me even more is the fact that the film is never subtle in its attempts to show the downfalls and ignorance of racism. There is racism against Mr.Tibbs throughout the whole film, and it gets worse. They are never subtle, he is a black man in a white mans town. There are cotton picking negros in the film, and he is always looked down upon with lines like "why are you wearing white mans clothes" and so on. The focus of the film becomes the racism, but its not done in an intelligent manner, and detracts greatly from the suspense and story.****POSSIBLE SPOILER**** I was ill impressed with the resolution of the main murder as it is. I hate, and I must repeat this, I always hate when a minor character, that we have barely been introduced to, ends up being a major player when the movie resolves itself. Of course we can never solve the mystery because we don't have the information required to do so. It never impresses me when a nobody is the guilty party. I mean, some guy that is only in two scenes in the film, who works in a little diner, that we know nothing about, becomes the killer. Of course I would be surprised by the resolution because it comes out of nowhere. Thats not impressive to me at all. A movie like 'Arlington Road', where we know all along who does it, but they still plant seeds of doubt and have a stellar ending, now thats impressive. This murder mystery however was not.So overall its really not that great. There are more effective movies about race relations, and ones that are done in a much more clever and intelligent manner. The film is never subtle and could have been excellent, but ends up falling short and becomes just a mediocre film at best. Not highly recommended. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The complex premise and masterful performances elevates the simple dull plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very engaging and provocative movie that deals with multiple themes like racial prejudice, discrimination, carelessness of law and loneliness all engulfed inside a central crime thriller plot. What works even better is the character development which is elevated even beautifully by Rod Steiger's masterful performance. While the additional layers are well written and even well executed, the central plot lacks the required thriller element partially due to emotional disconnect with the victim, leisure progress of this plot and way too many distractions.Officer Sam Wood (Warren Oates) comes across a deceased body of a rich business man on the road during his scheduled patrol in the night. He duly informs Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) who takes over and orders Sam to keep a check on some usual notorious places. Sam finds a black man with a fat purse waiting to get on a train. Coming from a racist southern town, Sam duly hauls the black man to the station without even questioning him marking him as a prime suspect. When the chief finds the black man Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) to be a police officer from North and that too one of the best Homicide experts, he reluctantly requests his help in turn mounting the wrath of the town on him.It is a movie with extreme highs and a moderate lows. While the conversations between Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier are electrifying, the general behavior of the town is provocative and many external plot elements inducing the required urgency for a thriller, the general progression of the central plot is hampered by a leisure screenplay and too many distractions. The climax revelation needed to be a lot more intelligent given the buildup. Rod Steiger's Academy win is one the most unconventional and well deserved I have come across. Apart from Rod Steiger, Sidney Poitier and briefly by Lee Grant and Larry Gates, the host of other supporting characters performances were too ordinary. Some of the memorable scenes that impressed me 1) Tibbs consoling Mrs. Colbert 2) Tibbs altercation with Endicott and Chief Gillespie's response to that. 3) Chief Gillespie's personal confession about loneliness 4) Climax parting sceneThe complex premise and masterful performances elevates the simple dull plot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A black Philadelphia detective tries to solve a murder in rural Mississippi without becoming the next victim.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Heat of the Night examines how racial prejudices and stereotypes tend to cloud a person's judgment. Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) is a black Philadelphia homicide detective who gets drawn into a murder investigation of a prominent white businessman in rural Mississippi. When Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) learns that Virgil (Sidney Poitier) is an experienced homicide detective (after falsely accusing Virgil of the crime) he reluctantly makes use of his expertise. Chief Gillespie, as well as other officers and townspeople are resentful and threatened by Virgil's detective skills. In the end, Virgil had to solve the murder before he ended up the next (homicide) victim! The film was written by Stirling Silliphant (The Poseidon Adventure) and directed by Norman Jewison (who also directed the 1984 film A Soldier's Story, which also dealt with racial prejudice, segregation, and murder in the south). The film won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Rod Steiger), Best Film Editing, and Best Screenplay. Sidney Poitier's performance was worthy of an Oscar. The film established him as one of the greatest actors of all times and the first African American leading man in Hollywood.The movie is set in rural Mississippi in the 1960's. During this time, racial prejudice, segregation, and lynching were common. People didn't have a problem expressing their bigotry openly. The film was an accurate portrayal of issues that faced this country. Although the film was hard to watch at times, because of the demeaning way that Virgil was being treated, it sent a positive message that people's prejudices can be changed if they are exposed to people of different backgrounds. The dialogue, along with the music enhanced the film. During the scene when Chief Gillespie asked Virgil What do they call you up there?" Virgil responded in one of the most famous lines in movie history "They call me Mr. Tibbs!" Quincy Jones did an excellent job with the music that he chose for the film. The In the Heat of the Night theme song was sung by Ray Charles. The lyrics that best described the film were "I've got trouble wall to wall. It must be an ending to it all. But hold on, it won't be long, just be strong and it'll be all right." If people would take the time to talk to people from different backgrounds, they would realize that we have more similarities than differences. A Classic. A film definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They got a murder on their hands? they don't know what to do with it."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If, in the leading role of 'In the Heat of the Night (1967),' you were to (inconceivably) replace Sidney Poitier with a well-known Caucasian actor, then what would result would be a solid, above-average murder mystery set in a small Southern town. Of course, the film would never have been as critically successful as it was, and it certainly wouldn't have taken away Best Picture at the 1968 Academy Awards {beating out such stiff competition as 'The Graduate (1967),' 'Bonnie and Clyde (1967),' 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967)' and even 'Dr. Dolittle (1967)' ? the latter being the unlikely nominee that nonetheless remains a childhood favourite of mine}. As it were, however, 'In the Heat of the Night' stars African-American Sidney Poitier in a commanding lead performance that has become iconic among American cinema, and the film tackles the still-prevalent issue of racism in a way that had rarely been seen before.While waiting for a late-night train in the small town of Sparta, Mississippi {much of the picture itself was filmed in Sparta, Illinois}, homicide detective Virgil Tibbs (Poitier) is arrested for murder, if only for being a Black stranger with money. When the blundering and prejudice ? but well-meaning ? Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) realises the mistake that has been made, he tries to get Tibbs out of town as quickly as possible, only to find that the experienced detective from Philadelphia has taken an intense interest in the murder case, that of wealthy industrialist Philip Colbert (Jack Teter). While Tibbs traces the murder clues to a dangerous killer, racial tensions flare throughout the town, and the detective finds his life threatened on more than one occasion. The presence of Tibbs in Sparta also has an incalculable effect on Police Chief Gillespie, who finally understands the baselessness of his racial prejudices, and comes to respect Tibbs, not only as a detective but also as something of a friend.'In the Heat of the Night' led the charge into a new type of Hollywood film-making. Gone were the elaborate studio sets of previous years, replaced by on-location photography that makes the film seem newer and more realistic. The two main performers give truly memorable performances, and it was Steiger who escaped with the Best Actor Oscar that year {bafflyingly, Poitier wasn't even nominated, though there was some strong competition}. What is most remarkable about the picture is its depiction of Virgil Tibbs, a resourceful and intelligent hero whose courage is unfazed by the threats of the racist Southerners. The scene in which Tibbs responds to the abuse of Eric Endicott (Larry Gates) by slapping him in return is truly inspirational - the moment when the African-Americans suddenly stood up to assert their equality - and nobody else could ever have delivered the line "they call me Mister Tibbs!" with such staggering conviction. However, despite perpetuating a few stereotypes {particularly that of the racist, stupid Southerner}, director Norman Jewison ensures that Tibbs is not a perfect hero: just like the rest of society, he is also unknowingly driven by prejudice, and it is mostly ego that keeps him on the trail of the murderer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blistering tale of racial hatred that really sears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They call me Mr Tibbs!"I had no idea where that famous line came from until I watched In the Heat of the Night for the first time. But its a line Sydney Poitier delivers with great gusto. Because its a declaration of his own independence to the bigoted redneck sheriff Bill Gillespie, played with equal gusto by Oscar winning Rod Steiger.In the Heat of the Night was perhaps the first film to attempt to address the line that separates Whites from Blacks. It may be 40 years old, but it has as much resonance today as it did then. The actual murder plot almost seems like an afterthought when examined closely, but it succeeds in bringing together two superb characters, brought magnificently to life by Steiger and Poitier.An important industrialist is murdered in a Mississippi town. At the same time, Virgil Tibbs is passing through town after visiting his mother. A Black man in 1960s Mississippi is enough of a reason to get him arrested on suspicion of murder. But when he's brought before Gillespie, the whole force is shocked to discover they've arrested a homicide detective.Tibbs won't work with racists, even if a murder took place, but he's 'persuaded' by his own captain, and reluctantly joins forces with Gillespie to find the real murderer.In the Heat of the Night has an almost straightforward mystery to propel it, but its the marvellous, subtly nuanced performances from Poitier and Steiger that elevates it to one of the all time classics.There are times when you can almost taste the racism in the air. It really seems that tangible. No doubt helped by Rod Steiger's powerhouse acting.I love the way Steiger incorporates developing subtleties into Gillespie's character. Like the scene when Tibbs is examining the murder victim. Tibbs uses forensic psychology to extrapolate where this man was before he died. You can tell Gillespie is astounded by this man he prejudged. He momentarily stops chewing his gum, observing Tibbs in a (slightly) different light.This is an important scene because it gives Gillespie pause for thought. Steiger expertly downplays astonishment, which is what gives the film such richness. Without tiny subtleties like these, In the Heat of the Night may have become a very different story indeed.Equally impressive is Sydney Poitier. Its a shame Poitier was overlooked at Oscar time. Because his acting is just as much on a par with Steiger's. Its his steady conviction that anchors the film and keeps things on course.Tibbs is in the unenviable position of working alongside racist rednecks, interrogating bigoted White supremacists, and occasionally accusing some of the Blacks in the community. With his streamlined, impeccably dressed attire, he cuts a striking figure. This is a man who stands out among everyone else.And I believe Poitier recognised that, which is why he inhabits the role of Virgil Tibbs so well. He wants the people of this town to notice him going about his business. He is Black and proud of it. He's well spoken and well educated. Its his way of saying a Black man can achieve just as much as any White man if only they were given a chance.When Tibbs encounters Black people, he almost seems sad for them. They either work as butlers, or in the fields doing menial labour. These are people who haven't been as fortunate as him.And yet Tibbs is a slightly flawed character himself. When he interrogates a potential suspect, a wealthy White man, he immediately assumes he must be the murderer because this man is racist. Its a good idea that director Norman Jewison included this scene, because it helps to level the playing field. Tibbs might otherwise have come off as a bit sanctimonious, and lost some of our sympathy in the process.But where ITHOTN really shines is any scene that pairs up Steiger and Poitier. These are two men who really hate each other, but they have to tolerate one another. Because Tibbs can't do this alone, and since he scored points with the murdered man's widow by putting them on the right track, Gillespie has to entertain Tibb's notions.I really loved the scene when Gillespie defended Tibbs from a racist gang. He's eating his own words, but he's not going to let an innocent man be hospitalised (or worse) when there's a murderer on the loose. Or the scene in Gillespie's home when they realise how much they have in common. Two men with no wives or families. Only a job to live for. Which thoroughly depresses them both.At the end, the mystery solved almost seems anticlimactic in retrospect. But both Tibbs and Gillespie have come to respect one another's abilities, and they're fond farewell may be brief, but the glance they share speaks volumes.A quite wonderful film that helped pave the way for today's Black actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without a doubt in my mind In the Heat of the Night is a top ten film of all time. That is a lot for me to say in view of the fact that I am a devout fan of movies made in the 1930s-40s. All the elements, too many to mention are here. The acting is off the charts. It not only showed white prejudice but the reverse as well. There are so many scenes that are memorable I loved the scene where the Chief breaks up the fight between the white street punks and Virgil. And the repartee between Poitier and Steiger exploded with chemistry oscillating between disdain and respect (mostly from Steiger) I am admittedly very biased about Sidney Poitier he is among my favorite actors along with Cary Grant and William Powell. His pacing, his silence, his movement and his countenance provided me the most enjoyment in any film I have ever loved. I have read the comment that this movie is preachy, I totally disagree it is well balanced on both sides of the then color lines. "You dig" God I love this film. Sidney you are indeed the best. As Steiger says "Virgil you are among the chosen few" I hated that this movie had to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great and it showed a great view of raciest people. Back when this movie was made it was common for people to view African American people differently. But now a days they are viewed the same by most people and the people that do not believe that have problems. My reasoning for that is that you do not judge people by how they look but by the way they act. Sam Wood just looked at Virgil Tibbs and saw that he was black so he figured that he was to blame for the murder but then the chief of police finds out that Virgil is a murder detective and could help him. In the beginning he was a little unsure about this but as the movie went on he began to trust Virgil. The rest of the town had a little problem with that but at the end they believed him and was able to find out who the real murderer was. I hope that people do not judge people on how they look because their is more to a person then looks. What did you think of this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superlative comedy-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A superlative comedy-thriller about murder and racism, Norman Jewison's "In the Heat of the Night" is one of the most enjoyable American movies ever made, (it was so much fun, in fact, that the Academy gave it its biggest prize, Best Picture of the Year, though in truth they probably saw it as 'a message picture').A white industrialist is found robbed and murdered in the small town of Sparta, Mississippi. Shortly afterwards a well-dressed black man with a wad of money in his pocket, (Sidney Poitier), is picked up at the railway station and pulled in for the crime. He turns out to be a high-ranking detective from Philadelphia called Virgil Tibbs and not only is he innocent but his superiors assign him to helping the racist, red-neck cops solve the case.The picture is all of a piece; the jokes and the suspense stem from having a black man run rings around the thick, white cops and lord it over everyone else. It affords the same pleasures that a really good Sherlock Holmes mystery does with Poitier as Holmes and the brutish Chief-of-Police, (Rod Stieger), his Watson. (There is a magnificent scene in which the town's local bigwig, (the wonderful Larry Gates), slaps Poitier who immediately returns the slap and the look of horror on the face of an old Negro servant is worth the price of admission).The film has a good sized cast and the performers rise to the occasion. Poitier seems to be having more fun in this picture than in anything else he's done. In a way, it's the first great black part of the modern age. Virgil is superior to everyone else and Poitier takes delight in breaking new ground. As the Police Chief, Gillespie, Rod Stieger is magnificently bullish. He appears to be small and squat and fat, (his uniform seems to be too small for him), but he ticks like a bomb about to go off and once or twice he explodes. (He won an Oscar for his performance when Poitier failed to get nominated). And in a superlative supporting cast the other characters are allowed their moment; (Warren Oates, slow and likable as another cop whom Poitier suspects of being the killer, Lee Grant as the victim's widow, Scott Wilson as a sexually voracious but throughly innocent Huck Finn whom the police suspect of being the killer, Beah Richard as an abortionist called Mama Caleba). And like a good detective story it keeps you guessing to the end. We pick things up the way Poitier does. Haskell Wexler was responsible for the stunning, shimmering cinematography and Ray Charles sings the title song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Drama with Excellent Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Heat of the Night (1967) **** (out of 4) Entertainment at its very highest can be found in this drama that picked up five Academy Award wins including Best Picture. A rich white man is murdered in a small Mississippi town and soon Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) is right in the middle of it as he tries to solve the case while battling racists in a town that wants to keep its secrets to itself. Best Actor winner Rod Steiger plays the Sheriff who has to walk both sides to make sure the case gets solved. IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT often gets called a "message" picture but I think that's rather insulting because it's so much more than that. These so-called "message" pictures were always so much more than that because the filmmakers made sure that the story, performances and every other aspect of the film was the most important thing because if you nailed that then the message would come natural. In other words, this isn't the type of film that needed to beat you over the head with its message because the film is simply so strong that it can tell a great mystery, have the actors give great performances and the message behind the scenes is so clear and it didn't have to give speeches. The main reason this film works so well are because of the two lead actors, both of whom give terrific performances and the chemistry has pretty much been unmatched in any cop movie. I don't want to say this is where the different personality partners came to play but I do think it played an important role. Steiger is simply marvelous as the hot tempered cop and Poitier is equally great as the more laid back character. The way the two actors make their characters come to life is something truly great to watch and especially the different styles they bring to them. The supporting cast includes fine work from Lee Grant, James Patterson, Larry Gates and Warren Oates. Director Norman Jewison does a a fantastic job at building up the heat in the air of this small town dealing with various issues and the Ray Charles songs certainly add some spice. The most amazing thing is that the film really hasn't lost any of its power over the years and I think this is due to how strong the story was and by the fact that the film never preaches its message. There are some truly memorable scenes ranging from the slap to the famous "Mr. Tibbs" line that have more power than any speech could have delivered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In The Heat Of The Night" rounds out by list of Top Ten favorite films, and in an odd coincidence, it contains an element from one of my other best liked pictures, "To Kill A Mockingbird". Here though, the 'wrong hand' gimmick is used by Sidney Poitier's character to exonerate a jailed man for murder, whereas it didn't work for Gregory Peck's defense of a wrongly accused black man. It's not as pivotal a scene as well, but it does serve to establish Virgil Tibbs as a 'powerful piece of manpower' in the eyes of racist redneck sheriff Gillespie (Rod Steiger).Everyone knows about Poitier's classic signature line from this picture - "They call me MISTER Tibbs" - even if they haven't seen it. It's a powerful moment in cinema, and conveys in a single line director Norman Jewison's attempt to confront racial prejudice head on. What's unique here though is the way the picture treats the subject both ways. When Tibbs becomes convinced that wealthy landowner Endicott (Larry Gates) was behind the murder of industrialist Colbert, Gillespie challenges him with my summary line above. The look on Tibbs' face reveals an understanding of his initial motivation, and plays a role in the changing dynamic between himself and the sheriff. There's a similar moment of reflection on the part of Gillespie when one of Sparta's citizens states that the 'other sheriff' would have shot Virgil for slapping a white man. It's clever the way the film explores these subtle means of exposing intolerance and bigotry, yet leaves it's principal characters the better for it.Speaking of indignities, the Tibbs-Endicott scene prompted me to consider another time I'd seen a white man slap a black man in film. This won't mean anything to most readers, but way back in 1940, the East Side Kids appeared in "That Gang of Mine', in which Leo Gorcey had the temerity to slap an older black man in the face. Immediately after, realizing he had done another human being wrong, Gorcey challenges the man to fight back and beat him up, to beat Gorcey's own fear out of him within the context of that story. The part of the black man was played by an actor named Clarence Muse, who appeared in many pictures of the era without condescending to racial stereotype. In my review of that other film, I considered Muse the Morgan Freeman of his era, but after watching 'Heat', he could just as well have been the Sidney Poitier of his time.If you grew up in the Fifties and Sixties, you'll remember that racism was still a fact of life in many parts of the country, but was methodically being chipped away by the perseverance of brave civil rights leaders on both sides. For anyone not caught up in that day to day struggle, films like "In The Heat Of The Night" were fundamental in stripping away society's prejudices, putting the focus on people as individuals and the 'content of their character', as Martin Luther King so aptly appealed. Seen in that context, this picture is a landmark of film-making, expressed best by the understanding between two men of widely divergent points of view in the closing scene of the picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated but still excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This takes place in a small Tennessee town. Bigoted police chief Bill Gillepsie (Rod Steiger in an Oscar winning performance) reluctantly lets black Chicago police detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) help him solve a complex murder case. However some of the townspeople don't want a black man around and things get tense...The racial politics are dated and hard to take (a certain word beginning with "n" is used quite a bit) but this is still an excellent movie. The movie IS against racism all the way--there's an incredibly rousing scene where Poitier slaps back a white man who slapped him first! Race politics aside the murder mystery is good and complex with many twists and turns. Also the atmosphere of a small Southern town is caught perfectly on the screen. It's beautifully filmed and has an excellent soundtrack that fits the mood of the film. Steiger and Poitier are superb in their roles and the whole cast matches them. This was pretty strong stuff in 1967 and while it IS dated today it still works. This also won Best Picture Oscar of its year. Well worth seeing. Be warned--the beginning does involve flashes of female nudity (which are necessary for the plot) and is cut out from some broadcast TV prints. It doesn't destroy the movie but it lessens a few revelations at the end."They call me MR. TIBBS!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This outstanding motion picture is slightly marred by one problem. This may be a SPOILER for some... Early on and to establish his credibility, Virgil makes an observation about a suspect being left handed. The observation exonerates the suspect on the faulty reasoning that, since the death blow was delivered by a weapon wielded by the right hand, the lefty could not have done it. As a member of the left handed minority, I can categorically deny the veracity of such a conclusion. If I were to hammer someone, I would use my right hand. Such blunders about left handedness arise often in crime stories, going way back. Otherwise, "In the Heat of the Night" is a fine movie with terrific acting all around and wrapped in a magnificent visual package. Also, it is a solid historically accurate explication of a social phenomenon on the way out, more or less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In the Heat of the Night" won the Best Picture Oscar in 1967 over some very stiff competition ("Bonnie and Clyde", "The Graduate", "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"). Sidney Poitier stars as a young policeman who happens to be the suspect in a grisly murder in the deep south just because he's black. When police chief Rod Steiger (in his Oscar-winning role) learns that Poitier is a police officer, he enlists his help. Poitier is reluctant, but knows that he is likely the only man who can solve the somewhat complicated case. "In the Heat of the Night" is socially important because of Poitier's portrayal. The film is overall excellent because of its risk-taking elements, the direction, the screenplay, and the top-notch performances. A great film all the way around. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

It almost makes you wonder what people of all color was thinking when they first saw this film in 1967. In the Heat of the Night is a very good movie even to modern day standards, people can still connect with it and see the excellent performances given by all the actors. It makes the viewer rethink how they treat people, and if they find themselves acting like the racist men in this film, then they feel guilty and ashamed.

		<fullReview>I like to watch films having in mind the context in which they were filmed, so I do not mind to watch films from the past that deal with topics which today we might consider silly, pointless or strange. But in the case of In the Heat of the Night the film has important flaws in its very grounds, irrespective of the topic it deals with and the fact that it was filmed in the sixties in a context very different from what "the South" is nowadays. The plot never really manages to engage you; looking at the title you expect a story of racist prejudgments intermingled with the investigation of a crime told in a thriller-style way, and the film actually seems to try to pursue this in some moments, but totally fails, and both aspects run in parallel but are very awkwardly connected. Particularly unfortunate is the depiction of the chief policeman of the city; the clumsy script and the poor acting make one ends up having no idea if he is a racist whose attitude is changed by the intelligence and straight attitude of detective Virgil, or if he is not but has to act as if he were because of the social environment he lives in, or... who knows!? Watch Missisipi Burning, when you finish then watch it again, but skip this one.</fullReview>

My first surprise was that it is in colour; I remembered it as black and white. Speaking of which. Everything in this film is in fact black and white. The black guy is perfect in all respects (good looking, intelligent, polite, well dressed), and the white guys are exactly the opposite. Simple, no? The murder plot (I admit this is not the main point) is very weak, and a lot of celluloid and time is spent in superfluous shots and chases. To compensate for that, the solution is so artificial that I would not be able to repeat it. To do that, I'd have to watch it again, but no thanks. Sydney Poitier had the easiest part to play and ?what shall I say without sounding blasphemous? I found his acting very one-dimensional. He leaves Sparta the same man who arrived, unaffected.

		<shortDescription>Unsubtle but very entertaining racial drama-cum-murder mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part 2 of my 1967 Oscar double feature (after "In Cold Blood"), this is another very nicely presented DVD, interestingly also scored by Quincy Jones and beautifully shot in a bright autumnal tone by Haskell Wexler. Indeed I might have given the cinematography palm to Wexler that year; rarely have I seen two contemporary films right in a row with such high quality (and quite different) photography.The story is, no question, a familiar one: outsider who is "different" (in this case, black) comes into town prejudiced against him and wins most of the town over. Sidney Poitier's Virgil Tibbs for the most part fumes silently or quietly, with the occasional outburst; Rod Steiger's Chief Gillespie is his near-opposite, over the top loud and rude with the rare moment of introspection. It's surprising how well these two broad characters mesh and actually seem borderline realistic, a tribute much more to the two great actors than to the pretty standard screenplay; in fact, the scenery-chewing between the two of them, and the other "bits" in the film, the gorgeous look of it all, are for the most part a lot more interesting than the ho-hum murder mystery. There really isn't a lot of tension, and that's probably the biggest problem with the film as you're watching it, though afterwords you may be bothered more by the blatant reverse-stereotyping going on. It probably felt necessary in 1967, and I can't say I blame the filmmakers -- though I don't think subtlety was ever director Norman Jewison's strongest quality -- but it does certainly date the film in some ways now, and "dated" isn't a word I used lightly. Still a solid entertainment all around. DVD rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They call him Mr. Tibbs - and don't call this movie anything other than great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie that took home Best Picture for 1967, Philadelphia Det. Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) has to solve a murder in a racist Mississippi town. The idea sounds simplistic, but director Norman Jewison knows how to do it well. First off, there's the title. It refers both to the physical humidity and temperature of this town, but also to the tension between Tibbs and Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger in an Oscar-winning role), and basically to the tension that prevailed in the South - and the country at large - at the time.The two scenes that really stand out are: "They call me Mr. Tibbs!" and the scene where Tibbs and Gillespie slap each other. The movie's most famous line entails African-Americans' demands to be treated like human beings. The scene where Gillespie slaps Tibbs and Tibbs slaps him back shows that African-Americans are no longer going to let white people just walk all over them; if white people attack black people, there will be revenge.I will admit that I didn't grow up in the '60s, so I can't accurately talk about the things that happened then. But nevertheless, "In the Heat of the Night" is a great relic of the era, and probably the best movie ever for Jewison, Poitier, and Steiger. Also, it was one of the three movies that made 1967 Sidney Poitier's annus mirabilis (along with "To Sir, With Love" and "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"), and one of the many movies (as well as "The Graduate" and "Bonnie and Clyde") which affirmed that year as the year that changed movies in a major way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find this movie a masterpiece.The most important thing,for me,is that the racial problem is well discussed,but it is only an excuse to show how two men try to demonstrate their own ability in making good things.The racial diversity only assures them a well declared diversity.Of course,it is Steiger who is fired to demonstrate he needs no help from Poitier,and this latter's infallibility makes the white face of Steiger turn scarlet .How could it be that a black man is the master of a white,so detached from personal motivations? Till when Poitier says"I will knock him down from his pedestal!",referring to the flowers keeper.Then Steiger says:"So...You are just like us!".The sudden showing of his weekness reveals that also Tibbs is full of rage,just like Gillespie.So,they are not so different after all,and this fact makes a profound relationship possible.This movie is so full of great moments that is impossible to speak about them all.The study about the two characters' relationship is the thing I prefer about this movie.Everywhere you go you find men who want to demonstrate you are unable where they are true champions.And sometimes you have to admit with yourself that you do the same thing.Just like the "perfect" Tibbs:"I will knock him down from his pedestal!"Thanks to all the staff of this film,thanks,thanks! This film teaches:"Look at yourself,maybe you are doing something not for the reasons you declare,but only to "knock someone down from his pedestal",so that ...you can take his place! (I base myself on the italian dubbing) It reminds me of Gregory Peck in the marvellous "The Big Country", who declares to Charles Bickford:"You make this for personal reasons,not for what you declare!" It seems to me a very important theme,maybe one of the most important ever:Truth and Lie in every men or women life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost faultless work that is arguably the greatest of Sidney Poitier's films. You may reason that his character isn't realistically flawed and that Rod Steiger gets all the best lines, or that the murder plot is underdeveloped, but they are irrelevant to the overall picture. The murder in particular is low on priority, the motivation behind the whole movie being a chance for two first-rate actors to strike sparks off one another. Steiger fully deserved his Oscar, and stands well against Sidney, who also deserved one as the Northern cop in a redneck Southern town. Direction is outstanding, as is the incidental music throughout. The iconography is a snapshot of the time it was made, from the coke dispensers to the neon lights on the drive-by restaurant, while the photography evident throughout is superlative. Acting, too, is top-notch from all, though understandably the two leads demand the attention in every scene in which they appear. Every scene they share is a charged one, the racial chemistry between the two irresistible. Steiger displays all the talent of a truly worthwhile actor, carving Gillespie out as more than a one-dimensional bigot. Poitier, for his part, shows a refreshing arrogance beneath the surface of Virgil Tibbs. For Sidney personally, the experience saw him improve upon his own acting technique, where he was in awe of a method-acting Steiger that stayed in character both in front and behind of the cameras. Racial tension was such that the movie (adapted from the novel `Heat') had to be filmed in Belleville, Illinois, and not the Mississippi where the film is based. It is almost impossible to imagine in these (relatively) open-minded times that such racial issues were prevalent. Indeed, Sidney's own biography accounts of being a young man alone in America, encountering a policeman who put a gun to his head for being the "wrong colour" in the wrong part of town. However, this was one of the films that saw the most resistance from Sidney's black fanbase. Clifford Mason's article `Why Do The White Folks Love Sidney So?' held the movie up to the most scrutiny, dubbing the slightly physical role he has here as `SuperSidney'. An important reminder that film appreciation often has little to do with the technique of film-making, and often the politics behind it.</fullReview>

But here lies the problem; the movie relies too much on the racial conflicts and doesn't pay that much attention to the mystery of the murder.

		<fullReview>The acting, directing, cinematography, and score are all better than the uneven and belabored script. The film wavers in tone, tempo, focus and interest. Characters and situations are awkwardly introduced, and then dropped, and their relationship to the plot is often irrelevant. The murder mystery feels arbitrary, and its resolution is rushed and unsatisfying . Despite the fact that it won the Academy Award for best film of 1967, the film is not a classic. The awards for best picture, editing, and screenplay were undeserved, and Point Blank, Cool Hand Luke and In Cold Blood were more deserving, though none of them was nominated for best picture. Steiger's winning is understandable, and he is matched by Poitier who plays Virgil to steely perfection. Beah Richards who played Poitier's mother in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner the same year makes the most of her brief appearance, and a strident Lee Grant has the thankless role of the murdered man's wife. The film is enhanced by Haskel Wexler's cinematography and Quincy Jones' memorable score. Ray Charles performs the vocals. A flawed, entertaining, and well-intentioned film that had the good fortune to be released at the right time. A good example of the parts being better than the whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a good Canadian I want to be fair to Toronto born director Norman Jewison. I want to think that his alterations to John Ball's 1965 racially progressive detective classic, In the Heat of the Night, were done with great care. I even tried to resort to the fact that the movie is now nearing its four decade mark. But, after re-reading/viewing the novel and the film, I find that I cannot.As is oft said: 'the devil is in the details.' So, I find, that it is in the details the cracks in Jewison's interpretation lurk. The major changes, at first glance, seem sound enough. Sam's (Warren Oates) developing racial awareness, certainly an admirable oddity for a 1960's North Carolina (now called Sparta in the film), have been usurped and given to the not-so big Texan, Bill Gillespie (played by a wonderfully gruff Rod Steiger). It then follows that the Duena Mantoli/Sam Wood love tryst would also find themselves on the cutting room floor (if ever filmed at all). In the end though, the then radical sentiments present in Ball's novel are, for the most part, alive and well, albeit donning different attire, in the film.I would like to be able to excuse Jewison's modifications as being one of the necessary evils that occur when we change from one medium to another. Had this been the case I would have been duly impressed. But it was not. To make accusations against a multiple-Academy Award winning film, a reviewer must make a case for such claims. So, for the defense, I call to the witness stand the character of one Mr. Harvey Oberst.In the novel, murder suspect Harvey Oberst, was merely picked up by officers of the Wells PD. His entrance into the novel's story is a rather unglamorous one. To be true, in both versions, he is in possession of the suspiciously missing wallet (whose owner changes from the novel's Enrico Mantoli to the film's Mr. Phillip Colbert). However, in the novel, perhaps alluding to some distant Danish relative, Harvey's conscience gets the better of him and he fatefully moves to see it returned. No such admirable qualities are to be found in Scott Wilson's portrayal. In the novel, Harvey Oberst is picked up by the police after bringing the wallet to the attention of the town banker, Mr. Jennings (Mr. H. E. Henderson, played by Kermit Murdock). In contrast, the film has a rather anti-climatic police 'take-down' which, in the end, belies no such judgmental hesitation on the part of this Oberst. In essence, Harvey may very well be the "poor white trash" (p. 27, 1976) that Gillespie states he is yet the novel's Oberst chooses to err on the side of right over wrong. Jewison's rendition leaves his Oberst with few of these qualities. It may be true that, in both versions, Oberst can be described as morbidly opportunistic but Ball's character has this tragic flaw, a conscience, and thus makes no attempt to flee to either Arkansas or Denmark.The geriatric chase scene, thankfully absent in the novel, in and of itself warrants puzzlement. To be fair, films, being visually dependent, need action if they are to be attended by anyone other than the most dedicated of cine-files. Therefore, to criticise Jewison's mere inclusion of such a scene based upon this aspect alone would, in this reviewer's opinion, be remiss and duly unfair. However, an audience can justifiably expect to be excited by such scenes. Viewers should be led to the forward edge of their seats by the director's use of, in this case, a chase scene-otherwise what is its purpose? However, this scene has all the tension of that rubber band forgotten and lost behind the sofa you are now seated upon. And so, good reader's, we are left a-wondering as to Jewison's motives for including such a scene. It is not entirely clear, to me, why Jewison altered Oberst's motives for snatching the wallet nor why he added such a lame-duck chase scene. Neither of these changes adds to the film nor to the story in any meaningful way. In fact, in my opinion, these alterations detract not only from the story but from the socially conscious aspect so clear in the novel. This is only one example of the many changes and only one of many cracks in the film. Reader's who have watched only the film must put this film, and the novel, in context: the 1960's civil rights movement in America. Even amidst the consciousness raising speeches of Martin Luther King, or the warnings of a justifiably angry Malcom X, Ball's inclusion of a Negro detective, not only to the Deep South but to this genre (otherwise a bastion of testosterone and machismo), was a bold one. Ball may not have hoped to raise the rights of the black's living in the south with this novel but he did, at least, raise some eyebrows. No doubt he also left some reader's pondering the African-American experience. Ball's novel, then, is one part detective fiction and one part social commentary whatever genre it may be. Reader's and viewer's of this well crafted and subtle statement should, then, be wary of any changes.The adjustments that Jewison made to otherwise minor characters like Harvey Oberst leave me wondering as to his motives and direction of the film in general. These seemingly minor changes have led me to ask why Jewison would have, for example, hinted at a "prejudiced" Tibbs. Or why he would have allowed a racist like Gillespie to reduce an otherwise tolerant and diplomatic Virgil Tibbs to being "just like the rest of us." These changes cannot be explained away by making vague allusions to the benefits and pitfalls of one medium over another. No, in the end, some things, some times, are best left unchanged. See the movie but read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is about two cops in Mississippi trying to solve a murder. At the same time, these two cops are also trying to overcome their own racism rfor one another. It stars Sidney Poitier as the black Detective from Philadelphia, who is racist agains whites; and Rod Steiger as the white racist Chief of the Sparta Police Station. In the Heat of the Night is not just about a murder case. It is about racism between two Police Officers. This racism can be seen in several ways. At one point, Sidney Poitier's character, Virgil, questioned a white man who had black people work for him. Virgil wanted to convict him, not because a substantial amount of evidence was against him, but because he was white, and he had black people work for him in the same fashion as when slavery existed. Rod Steiger's character, Bill Gillespie, shows his racism immediately in the beginning of the movie when one of the Police Officers picks Virgil up because they suspect him of the murder that has just taken place. The Chief treats him badly, talks harshly to him until he finds out that Virgil is a cop. Virgil and Bill end up working the murder case together, and overcoming racial tension between them to the point that all they can do is smile. I did not like In the Heat of the Night. I thought the acting, directiong, and how they set up the movie was good, but the story was dull and boring. I didn't think there was enough action in the movie. I thought the movie sent a good message about racism, but the movie didn't grab you. You could easily fall asleep watching it. I think this movie could have been a lot better if the characters had a little more fire to them. I often found that especially Virgil Tibbs was excessively boring because when he said things, he always said them in such a calm way, that it was hard to concentrate. If he was a little harder, it might have spiced up the story more. The same goes for Bill Gillespie, at times he could be entertaining, but most of the time it seemed like he was just: there. Nothing more, nothing less. I would give thei movie two stars, ecause it wasn't a good movie. It could have been much better. I think that maybe if they had thought about it a little more, they could have made this movie really entertaining and really gripping. By Pete Bornn</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not surprised the French TV has programed Norman Jewison's classic "In the Heat of the Night" the very day after the 2008 historical election of the 44th President of the US... Of course, Sidney Poitier is still as smart and handsome as he was in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner", but both films were not aiming exactly the same audience. Being such a perfect thriller, "In the Heat of the Night" addresses a much larger number of spectators of all ages, and not only intellectual ones. Just watch it, or watch it again nowadays, and show it to your children?an excellent way to have a better understanding of how some clever blockbusters are capable of actually improving society. Even if it took four decades to make the dream of Mr Tibb's fans come true. Sidney Poitier can be proud of his job at the time. As the first black Hollywood star ever, he's definitely one of those giants of the XXth century who helped people to think about what "Liberty" really means in order to bring a major change on earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This drama about murder and racial prejudice in a small Mississippi town won the Best Picture Oscar that should have gone to "The Graduate." It starts off quite well as a dead body is discovered by a policeman making late night rounds. However, it kind of goes downhill from there because of stereotyped characterizations and uneven acting. Almost everyone in the town is a racist red-neck. There is no subtlety in the execution and the resolution of the murder mystery is unsatisfying. There are good performances from Poitier, Steiger (in his Oscar-winning role), Oates, and Grant, but many of the bit players overact badly. Jewison's flashy camera-work is rather distracting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a good race film, but a good film on many levels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A murder occurs in a small Southern town. The local cops do what often probably occurred during this era--they picked up a black man (Sidney Poitier) and assume he did it! However, it turns out that this black stranger is no ordinary man but a Philadelphia cop on vacation in Mississippi. And, not only is he a cop but he's an expert on homicide investigations--and this small town is ill-prepared to deal with a murder investigation. So, after treating Poitier like dirt, the town's sheriff (Rod Steiger) is in an awkward position--he needs to treat Poitier with an unaccustomed level of respect--and beg him to help with solving this crime. Not surprisingly, Poitier is hesitant--after all, the cops are prejudiced creeps and the town seems to be filled with folks who are even worse.Nowadays, some people might assume that films like "In The Heat Of The Night" are just about racial prejudice. However, to see it only as a race film does the movie an injustice, as it's much, much more. Not only is the acting exceptional, but the movie is a great film on police forensics. As far as I remember, it's about the earliest film to talk about and show forensic work that we pretty much take for granted today due to shows like "CSI", "Law &amp; Order" and "Bones". Here in this film, we see an examination of a corpse and words like 'lividity' and 'rigor mortis' bandied about...as well as showing genuinely modern detective work. It is indeed groundbreaking and fascinating in many ways.I have a few assorted observations about this film: When Tibbs talking to Endicott, it sounds a lot like Vincent D'Onofrio from "Law and Order, Criminal Intent". I wonder how much this movie later influenced the show.The climate/time of year is VERY consistent throughout the film. It's supposed to be summer, yet in some scenes Steiger's uniform is long-sleeved and he's wearing a jacket! The trees in distance are orange-yellow because it's fall--yet in other scenes it does appear to be summer--the trees are green and Steiger is wearing short-sleeves! This is the biggest reason I gave this movie a 9 and not a 10--this is sloppy and a 10 would seem to indicate perfection.In the film, they never say 'abortion' but that's clearly what they are talking about near the end of the movie.There is a real Sparta, Mississippi but it is much different from the town in the film. I am sure this caused some confusion.The Ray Charles tunes are great and work well with the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title says the opposite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I discovered this movie, I had expected an intense crime thriller which digs out racism like Alan Parker's masterpiece Mississipi Burning. However, In The Heat of the Night is a mild film. It is not deep and its focus is not racism at all! Norman Jewison says almost nothing about racism, also the murder itself is mild either. A nice, compelling poster, you see its potential, an austere Sidney Poitier with a baseball bat in his hands, standing, but the movie is not powerful or unforgettable. There is only one memorable scene starting by a racist group drive Tibbs into the corner. What kind of a racist town is this? Then what is the point of putting an Afro American cop into a so called racist town? The main case in the movie is like a high school case, it would be a right choice as a plot for an episode of a TV series, but for a movie, it is thin. Visually, the movie is pretty successful, stylish, the last scene with In the Heat of the Night track was amazing, but a movie should be more than a good cinematography and a good soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Heat Of The Night is a really good movie about race. Thhe plot is ironic because you'll never expect that the protagonist would be an African-American homicide detective from another state helping a group of racist cops to solve a murder case. It was really interesting as I was watching the film. Sidnet Poitier played the role of Det. Virgil Tibbs and I think he played it well. He kept his character together throughout the whole movie. Another actor that played a good character in the movie was Rod Steiger as the racist Chief Bill Gillspie. Gillspie is the chief of police who wasn't running his department right. Everything was sloppy. First of all, they were racist. That's bad enough as it is. Second, they wouldn't know where to search for clues in a case like that. In the movie, he catches the wrong guy instead of catching the real killer. That's when Det. Tibbs arrives to the picture. At first, Gillspie hated Tibbs because of the color of his skin and the intelligent level he had. Tibbs basically used his common sense. (That's something that most of society lack in doing)Throughout the climax of the movie, you can see that Gillspielearns a lot from Tibbs and he came down to an understanding that he needed Tibbs all along but he didn't seem like he wanted to admit it. You could say he had a lot of pride in him...I call it ignorance. Anyway, at the end, they solve the case and end up having this mutual, peace connection that wasn't typical in the south during that time. This movie won 5 Oscars with another 15 wins and 12 nomination. (Including best picture). This is a highly recommended film about drama, mystery, and irony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The activity that goes on in a little quiet town in Mississippi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie series stars some very good T.V actors including Chief Guilespie, Virgil Tibbs, and many more. This series is about a little town named Sparta where everyone knows everyone so when things go wrong people knew. This begins when Virgil and wife moves here from the suburbs of Philadelphia where Virgil was also a detective and was coming to start a family and also work for the Sparta Police. Soon enough when settled Virgil encounter problems but after people got to know them things were better. Even the chief falls for the lady of the town who is Harriette DeLong the counsilmen of the town of Sparta. Mrs. Tibbs becomes the head counselor at Sparta High School. After many years in Sparta Virgil's wife becomes pregnant and has twins and the chief and Harriette become the Godparents. After many years of hard work Virgil becomes chief of detectives. This may be quiet but it does encounter some bad criminals but the Sparta Police were there. Every morning the Sparta Police would have coffee and at the little café' across from the station and sometimes had meetings there to help solve crimes and just to relax. I enjoyed this movie series and still to this day.</fullReview>

I have a hard time sitting through this one, it seemed very tedious and overblown, although it only ran an hour and 47 minutes it seemed a lot longer. Its sad that so many of these old movies are no longer worth seeing, and this is one of them. If you want to see a good movie about racial conflicts, see "Mississippi Burning", it is more up to date, and is much, much more exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Race Card</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is no big deal now, but back in the '60s it was, as race tensions ran high with race riots all the country, especially after Dr. Martin Luther King's assassination. In this film, a black man goes down South and helps solve a crime. He battles a stereotypical racist small Mississippi town and racist sheriff. Sidney Poiter, as "Mr. Tibbs" (from Philadelphia) plays the classy, high type and Rod Steiger plays the gum-popping low-life white sheriff. This was fine for its day, but look what it spurned: the political correct monster which we have now seen on film ever since: white guys = bad; black guys = good; Northern = smart; Southern = dumb rednecks. (Can anyone say "reverse racism or liberal elitism?") These characters are so exaggerated in this film, it's almost laughable. Talk about racism! Every white Mississippian here is a brutal redneck, racist, sadistic moron. The police and those trailer-trash scumbags are so deplorable at times that - even though you know it's only a movie - you can get really emotionally involved. That was the idea of the filmmakers, obviously. It's a wonder this movie didn't cause more riots. Whatever the case, the acting with the two leads is excellent and the movie has great drama. It has to be considered a "classic" by now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this once before, but I confess I may have dozed off somewhere, I decided to watch again when I could, so that I could really appreciate it, and hopefully agree with its placing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, directed by Norman Jewison (The Thomas Crown Affair, Fiddler on the Roof, Moonstruck). Basically in Chicago wealthy entrepreneur and industrialist Philip Colbert was planning to build a factory in the rural town of Sparta, Mississippi, he is found murdered and Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Rod Steiger) is under pressure to find the killer. African-American northerner Virgil Tibbs (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sidney Poitier) is passing through town and picked up by a racist policeman, Gillespie is heavily prejudiced against blacks and jumps to the conclusion he has caught the culprit, but he is embarrassed to learn Tibbs is actually a homicide detective from Philadelphia visiting his mother, after being allowed to go he just wants to leave as soon as possible, but he is asked to help. The victim's widow Leslie Colbert (Golden Globe nominated Lee Grant) is frustrated by the ineptitude of the local police, but she is impressed with Tibbs clearing the name of another suspect due to lack of evidence, she refuses to continue with the construction of the much needed factory her husband planned, unless Tibbs leads the investigation, Gillespie does talk him into lending his services. They have a rocky start, but Gillespie and Tibbs come to respect each other as they work to solve the crime, Tibbs initially suspects Eric Endicott (Larry Gates) the wealthy plantation owner who opposed the new factory, interrogated Endicott slaps Tibbs in the face, he slaps him back, this leads to Endicott sending a gang of redneck hooligans after him, Gillpesie rescues him from a fight and orders him to leave town for his own safety, Tibbs refuses to leave until the case is solved. Officer Sam Wood (Warren Oates) was the one who discovered the body, he is asked by Tibbs to retrace his steps the night of the murder, he and Gillespie accompany Sam on his patrol route, stopping at a diner where Tibbs is refused to be served by counterman Ralph Henshaw (Anthony James) because he is black. Sam is suspected of the crime by Gillespoe when Tibbs notices he has deliberately changed his route, he made a sizable deposit in his bank account the night of the murder, Sam claims these were gambling winnings, and local Lloyd Purdy (James Patterson) files charges against for getting his sixteen year old sister Delores Purdy (Golden Globe nominated Quentin Dean) pregnant, despite Tibbs protesting Gilleespie arrests Sam, Purdy is insulted a black man is involved in the interrogation, he has a lynch mob gathered to get him. Tibbs clears Sam when it is pointed out he could have driven two cars to dump the body and continue his patrol, acting on a hunch Tibbs finds an abortionist and finds out someone has paid for Delores Purdy to have an abortion, she arrives, and then the murderer reveals himself, it is diner counterman Ralph Henshaw, the mob arrive and hold Tibbs at gunpoint, but he proves it was Ralph not Sam that got Delores pregnant. Purdy attacks Sam, he kills Purdy in self-defence, Ralph is arrested and confesses to the murder of Colbert, he wanted to rob him to pay for Delores's abortion but accidentally killed him, with his job done Tibbs finally boards the train he wanted to, he is seen off by a more respectful Gillespie, Tibbs gives him a smile before leaving. I suppose I can see why Steiger won his Oscar, he is good at being the gum chewing and bigoted police chief, but Poitier makes the most impact as the immaculately dressed black man prejudiced by other but eventually respected and helps the investigation, the murder storyline almost plays second fiddle to the relationship between Poitier and Steiger, but it is still interesting, this film was made at the time of the civil rights movement and became a major movie, and spawned two sequels for Poitier, it is certainly one to see, a worthwhile crime drama. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for and Best Sound Effects, it won the BAFTA UN Award, and it was nominated for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Director. Sidney Poitier was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 22 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 47 on The World's Greatest Actor, Virgil Tibbs was number 19 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("They call me Mister Tibbs!"), and it was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

It`s not bad as either a murder mystery or a movie but it`s hardly something deserves to go down in some hall of fame . Let`s examine the subtext and what the movie is actually saying Racism is wrong - Check Jumping to conclusions is wrong - Check Policemen can`t always be trusted - Check Forensics catch criminals - Check And that`s basically the story . Mind you when you stop to consider what was going on in America in general and the Southern States in particular at the time you do start to realise why the Academy board decided to give this movie a hatful of Oscars . Rod Steiger is absolutely outstanding in his role as the chief of police and thoroughly deserved the award for best actor , but I have reservations that IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT deserved the award for best picture</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Norman Jewison. He has done great movies. So it's hard to believe that he directed this slow paced, technically poor and tedious film. This should have been fast and quick. Instead it gets continuously stuck.The main theme song of Quincy Jones was more suitable for a movie about a man riding his donkey. The opening sequence is terrible. The camera doesn't move. An endless minute just to see a train pass by.The whole movie is full of terrible cinematographic moments. A man is being chased by the cops in the woods. Jewison made such a lousy camera movement he got me seasick. He thought he was cool putting the camera at ground level.In another sequence Sidney Poitier is talking with a man in the basement of some building. Wow, that scene lasts forever, I think 15 minutes. I was going nuts so I had to move fast forward. I reached the speed of 32X and that camera still wasn't moving. A long chat can be made interesting. It doesn't happen. Of course the movie talks about very interesting arguments but it doesn't mean that the basics of cinema can be ignored.This movie never builds any suspense. The encounter of Poitier with Lee Grant is frustrating. The images are not crystal clear. The light is bad and we are talking about a film that takes place during night. The final scene is confusing.This is Jewison's flop.</fullReview>
