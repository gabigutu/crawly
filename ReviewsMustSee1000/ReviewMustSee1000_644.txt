		<fullReview>'In the Line of Fire' is one of those Hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit, but although I've seen it a few times, I usually end up sitting through the whole thing again. Why? - It's GOOD! Clint Eastwood is great as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual. The character, Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he's forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president. However, the film doesn't make him a depressed, brooding, and obsessed character. He's charming and personable, and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He's even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. The film is consistently enjoyable, and it delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance, and drama - all in their proper amounts. It's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russoholds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie'sgreatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". He capturesthis character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received anOscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and beon the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this riveting film. Malkovich says he's going to kill the president, and he purposely calls Eastwood, and pushes his buttons. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cold, but very intelligent mindset to his character. Everything he does, he does for a reason, and he's not shy about killing. Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him. The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.Teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense,Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood delivers as only he can.Also,John Malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin.As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest,I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said,referring to his own career,"I keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger".This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and Peterson should team together more often. Top notch movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood could do no wrong in the early Nineties.Hot on the heels of Unforgiven, he teamed up with The Perfect Storm director Wolfgang Petersen for one of the best thrillers of the decade - In the Line of Fire.Imagine a cross between The Day of the Jackal and The Bodyguard and you get the idea. Hollywood's craggiest leading man plays Frank Horrigan, a troubled bodyguard assigned to protect the US president against a psychopathic assassin.John Malkovich delivers a stunning performance as the man on the end of the trigger and acclaimed German director Petersen directs with such skill, Eastwood even asked his advice when he came to direct A Perfect World.Clint was 63 when he made this and brought a lifetime of experience to the role of a world weary Secret Service agent haunted by the fact he failed to save President Kennedy from the fatal bullet. The clever use of a doctored photo by Hollywood whiz kids shows the actor/director stood at the side of JFK. A nice touch which is well worth looking out for.To be honest, ITLOF is a cliched thriller, the sort of story which crops up most weeks as a glossy, no brain offering on Channel 5.However, both director and stars took the well worn material and gave it a fresh spin, upping the tension several notches with each passing scene, resulting in a spectacular finale which is great value for money.Rene Russo is so good she could play the part in her sleep. The former model adds a degree of mature charm to her role of an agent who Horrigan believes is mere `window dressing' for the department.As with all of Wolfgang's movies, believability is everything. A rare degree of authenticity was achieved during the crowd scenes when the German film-maker integrated his fictitious President with the crowds from the Clinton and Bush election campaign. The cost? A cool $4million.The script had been knocking around Hollywood for a decade before it was dusted down and given a green light. It was originally to star Dustin Hoffman (who signed up for Petersen's follow up, Outbreak). British director Michael Apted (The World is Not Enough) was due to direct the Hoffman version, but when David Puttnam took over as the head of Columbia in 1987, the movie was put on hold.Producer Jeff Apple (a man more known in the trade for his interactive shopping shows than films) brought in Jeff Maguire to polish up the script.The idea of Horrigan as an agent who failed to stop JFK's untimely death gave the movie a twist that Hollywood execs found delicious.Before long, there was a feeding frenzy over the new, improved script and eventually, Rob Reiner's Castle Rock company snapped it up for a million dollars with Clint Eastwood on board.Petersen had wanted Harrison Ford, but eventually cast him as the President in Air Force One (which you may remember was the film of the week a couple of weeks ago).As any Clint fan knows, he's a jazz fan - a passion shared by Horrigan in what seemed to be a tailor made role adapted for old Mr Squinty after he signed on the dotted line.However, Frank's love of piano and jazz was already on the page - a happy accident which helped turn Horrigan into one of Clint's most likeable big screen characters.Top drawer stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfactory Condition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another of Eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue, action, and a dollop of romance, along with "The Gauntlet," "Firefox," and so forth. Clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. In this one, he's taciturn and a bit outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise; it's above average. Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink, which drove his family away, and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself "Booth," who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. Now, this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project, but he does rather well, less robotic than usual. And he does seem to carry around with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He's tested again halfway through this movie. He is hanging from the roof of a tall building, grasping Booth's hand, and he pulls his pistol and points it at Booth, who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. If he does, of course, he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIA-trained murderer, but he does so at the cost of his own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. Later Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about his failure to save the president in Dallas. "If I'd have reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me." It's underplayed, but his voice chokes slightly, his eyes water, and his lip trembles. It's one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that might properly be called "moving." We know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time. (The irony is that he doesn't like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they "carved a nation out of the wilderness." Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?)It's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It isn't true, nothing is that simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is marvelous.Talk about disillusioned. Okay, he can ham it up a little, sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes, but he's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little do to. Fred Thompson, as the chief White House aid, is now back in politics, a relief for movie-goers. If Clint's acting range is limited, Thompson's is something less. In every film he's been in, he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder.The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in "Das Boot," which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful cross-cutting in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta. Interrupted, Clint lies back on the bed and sighs, "Now I have to put all that stuff back on again."Well written and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great performance by Clint Eastwood and particularly John Malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date. Malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor it's incredible. Eastwood is Agent Mike Horrigan, an aged and cynical Secret Service Agent who is finishing out his career busting counterfeiters and chasing down routine assignments. But one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat on the President by a "wacko". As fate would have it Horrigan has stumbled not upon a delusional nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the White House. As Horrigan dives deeper into "Booth's" world he attracts the bad guy's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him. Horrigan was JFK's top agent and present in Dallas, Texas when he was assassinated and blames himself for what happened. Now he feels it's up to him to stop the current Head of State from joining the list of dead Presidents. But this killer has turned the tables on Horrigan and now he's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game. Who will win? Who will die? It's a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleon-like enemy who can get to anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good a nail biter as any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malkovich Steals The Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. I am not a particularly fan of his but I have to hand to him: he knows how to make entertaining movies. This is one more example. It didn't hurt, either, to have John Malkovich as his co-star. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is fascinating to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given. He also has a interesting voice.Rene Russo is fairly low-key (for her), but that's fine and Eastwood plays the usual loner-cop role, not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end. I guess he couldn't stop playing the "Dirty Harry"-type figures, but he played them well.There were some negatives this film, however, namely: credibility in parts as there were a couple of times, had this been real-life, the killer would have done away with Eastwood. The climatic scene, in particularly, had too many holes in it. There also were too many abuses of Lord's name in vain in here.Overall, however, this is good, escapist fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IN THE LINE OF FIRE, in my opinion, is an excellent, suspenseful, and edge-of-your-seat action/drama/thriller! I thought that Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked good in the attire they wore at the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved to toy with Frank by phone. He looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film, though. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the entire cast and crew did an outstanding job, I loved the setting, and I couldn't get enough of it. Now, in conclusion, to all you Clint Eastwood fans who haven't seen this excellent, suspenseful, and edge-of-your-seat action/drama/thriller, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Making It Personal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when I was working person, I remember having a really obnoxious client to deal with who insisted on making everything on a personal basis. I was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed I was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his. I swear but I was thinking of this guy as I watched John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle of wits.In The Line Of Fire casts Clint Eastwood as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case.But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but that I thought Malkovich was better.Oddly enough Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taunts him. And after a while what Malkovich says and does causes Clint to get real personal. The presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imagined grudge, is the most dangerous kind of foe.Others to note in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as the White House chief of staff (and would be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent who falls for the Eastwood masculine charm, John Mahoney as the Secret Service head, Gary Cole as the White House head Secret Service guy, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as the President and First Lady.But when Malkovich is on he owns In The Line Of Fire. The climax with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malkovich makes this an above-average thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'In The Line Of Fire' tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former-government assassin turned psycho. The secret service agent/bodyguard (Eastwood) is on defense and the assassin (Malkovich)is on offense. The stakes? The president's live.I really like this movie...I've seen it numerous times on TV and have recently bought it on DVD. Yet, it's not an excellent movie. The plot is way too thin and the attempts to thicken it are downright ridiculous. The whole love-story isn't very plausible and the way they brought an extra character into the story, just to be able to kill it off is kind of insulting to the more or less intelligent viewer. Though I feel these mistakes can't be forgiven, I can easily look past them to Mr. Malkovich exquisite performance. I've always deemed him to be a great actor but in this movie he's really on fire. There's a reason why he got an Academy Award nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were okay, but I don't deem their performance to be memorable. They're never at the best of their abilities.If you don't expect too much, you'll certainly like this movie. It's no masterpiece but John Malkovich is really extraordinary and I don't think anyone can't enjoy his performance. Really worth the watch...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Against Type, Flawed But Still Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This is Peterson's best movie after Das Boot, the others: Perfect Storm, Air Force One and the dreadful Outbreak pale in comparison. I like Troy but I prefer this one. The main flaw is that it simply is too long. A lot of the jazz bar scenes, Frank at home, the courtship could have been trimmed. This could have happened within the narrative we do not the eating ice cream scene on the steps. The main attraction is that Eastwood plays against type. Leary is ahead of him the entire movie until Frank stops the assassination. Find me another Eastwood movie where the villain is way in front of our 'hero' the entire movie? Yes, maybe Tightrope but that was one awful movie. Malkovich does his usual credible job of creeping us out here with his icy sociopath who kills people, like the fishermen, with the emotional content of pushing a button. That is one creepy scene where he closes the front door on the banker lady and her partner that asked one too many questions at her bank. Eastwood also is delineated as a worn out old guy who screws up, can barely breathe and gets canned from the protection detail: not exactly the portrayal of Josie Wales? Yet, this is what makes his role work, his age is written into the narrative; he even chickens out and gets his partner killed by not sacrificing himself when Leary is holding him on the building ledge. I understand the above attacks on the length; Peterson did the same thing with Perfect Storm it was way too long with many extraneous, irrelevant scenes. The movie still is worth owning for the two performances and the rare against type depiction of Frank. Dirty Harry he is not but a worn out guilt riddled human being who makes plenty of mistakes but keeps coming. His persistence not his invincibility, as in most of his other films, is what defeats Leary. Yes, I agree the romance was a stretch, given the age difference, but it was necessary to reveal what was going on inside of him. The clever planning with the plastic gun, Leary's way of donating his way next to the president, I found both pieces of excellent writing. When you revisit the movie, you just wish the director had trimmed some of the length so it had a better flow to it. Even as it is, with its flaws, it far surpasses the only other detective Eastwood film, Tightrope, in going against the Dirty Harry Type. Frank's fallibility, his partner's death, and his many mistakes make him a human being you can identify with and not a cartoon character.I recommend the movie for its writing and acting. The twists and turns will surprise you; of course, we know how it will end but the writing up to this inevitability is full of surprises. Tell me you knew Malkovich was coming back to that ledge? In the theater I saw it in, popcorn went flying when his face appears over Eastwood. It is in my library, is it the best Eastwood? No. Is it Bronco Billy or Any Which Way You Can? Not by a country mile. Seeing his battle the whole movie to redeem himself from that haunting failure gives the movie existential depth. His fallibility adds the ability to identify with him. On the whole, worth owning, it is not a masterpiece like Unforgiven but still a good piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cat and Mouse Thriller That Intensifies to a Dramatic Climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood), a veteran US secret service agent, has never recovered from that fateful day (22 November 1963) when President John F. Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald at his watch. Blaming himself for not reacting sooner and taking the fateful bullet, Horrigan became occasionally brooding and turned to liquor, actions that drove away his wife and daughter. He stayed in the bureaucracy though and requests an assignment to protect the latest president thirty years after the Catastrophe in Dallas. Now in his early sixties, the grizzled and intense Horrigan questions his own decision and forms doubts whether he still has the physical vigor to stand up to the job demands. Secret Service Director Sam Campagna (John Mahoney) backs him and grants his request, but Assistant Director Bill Watts (Gary Cole), although reluctantly agreeing to the new assignment, is so strongly against Horrigan that he revels in his apparent faux pas (like running out of breath while running alongside the presidential vehicle). Chief of Staff Harry Sargent (Fred Dalton Thompson) is similarly not in Horrigan's corner. The president is facing a very difficult reelection campaign, and Sargent does not want him to look awkwardly or cowardly in the face of potential danger.Mitch Leary (John Malcovitch), a trained operative for the CIA who was laid off, claims he was double-crossed by the US government and wants revenge. What is this loose cannon's plan? He longs to kill the current president (Jim Curley, code name "Traveler"). Calling himself "Booth" (after you know whom) he takes the offensive and continually torments Horrigan on the telephone, explaining exactly what he intends to do. Booth had studied Frank Horrigan for years, and is so clever and conditioned and twisted that he is able to burrow deeply into the latter's mind. A master of disguise, Booth continually toys with Horrigan, recounting parallels in their life experiences. At other times, he creates bummers. For example, consider the scene when President Curley is holding an AFL-CIO rally in Chicago. Booth uses pins to pop display balloons, badgering Horrigan into believing that gunshots are being fired. Horrigan's actions caused disruption and humiliated the president, although the agent did show his self-assurance and quick reaction, and was even willing to take a hit for "Traveler." Now Frank has a partner, Al D'Andrea (Dylan McDermott), and the two of them had undermined a deadly band of Phoenix counterfeiters early in the film. D'Andrea, though, is fated for a different destiny even though for more than two-thirds of the film Horrigan and he tail Leary. The psychopath divulges that he could have killed Horrigan many times but left him alone ("I have allowed you to live so you show me some g**damn respect!"). And at one point the aging Horrigan nearly perishes from a rooftop fall. Now when the denouement eventually arrives, will he have the efficacy to save the president? Malcovitch's acting is always of high quality. He is just so believable as a creep that one almost begins to hate him. Rene Russo may have come late to Hollywood (in her later thirties), but she already had polished acting tools and looks to match. Her role here is Lilly Raines, a capable and strong agent herself who is on presidential protection detail; later she becomes Horrigan's younger lover. Of course the beginning was rocky, especially after Horrigan made several offensive statements. But Raines eventually saw his masculine sensitivity, charm, and his real respect for her, and she shows her own capacity to fall in love.This movie is a nice vehicle for Eastwood, a good actor who easily handles similar roles. Director Wolfgang Petersen created a competent film with a novel idea of a man obsessed with his inability to save a past president from a real, historical assassination. Those pictures and footages (digital effects) of a young Horrigan inserted into actual pictures of Kennedy are believable. Also, the sets are convincing (White House, Air Force One, police escort, rallies). The only drawback may be that the movie runs a few minutes too long. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tried, tested and tired?..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Secret agent Frank Horrigan is a man of his past; his past being the assassination of John F Kennedy, of whose protection he was in-charge of. After his failure to prevent the assassination, he is only a former shell of himself. He does odd jobs, regarded by his colleagues with scorn and has nothing to look forward to in his life, until an assassin called Mitch Leary threatens to kill the President. Now Frank finds himself reliving the past with the heavy burden of his failure, the mistrust of his fellow agents, his guilt and the inevitable doomsday in which he must outsmart the energetic and cunning assassin.If so much of what you've read so far seems oh-so-familiar and predictable, it's because it is familiar and done to death. As is to be expected of such suspense thriller films, the plot involves the aging, disgruntled, insecure hero; the alluring fellow agent heroine; the cunning assassin who comes so close to killing the president but is stopped at the nick of time; the hero's partner who's aspiring to retire but is killed eventually.... so on and hence forth.Clint Eastwood plays the insecure hero and that demands that he play it without his usual charm, style or sarcasm which is a drag because that is what makes his acting memorable.John Malkovich plays the cunning assassin but unfortunately, he does not have much to do rather than to taunt the hero in all the usual tried and tested methods.Rene Russo plays the alluring fellow agent heroine whose role involves mischievous temptation and then unwavering support.Without this star crew, one can imagine what sort of a reception this movie might have made and it is only because of these actors that one can sit through the painfully familiar and predictable story. The entire story hangs on the shoulder of Clint Eastwood, but what can he do with a role which demands that he can never do anything he is famous for. He can not have any sarcastic one liners or be a badass or even sport his usual sardonic look.The director of the movie is Wolfgang Petersen who directed such nerve wrecking thrillers like Air force one, The Perfect storm and Poseidon. A good director who paled after his best works Das Boot and Never ending story. In the line of fire is a movie that you can see if you are bored and not in the mood for anything serious at all but is best left untouched otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malkovich shines in great crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>on the narrative:.A fast energetic plot involving many engaging characters to make it consistent to conform to the thriller genre. Eastwood plays the part of the aging detective brilliantly as he is assigned to find an obsessed man who has his heart set on assassinating the president. At times there maybe too much information for viewers to contain with and it is a film where you must concentrate. However when focused it is really exiting with fast paced action, contrasts in characters, both good and evil. The sentimental values over the pasts of the characters are a great device to create emotion and I felt particularly touched at many points during the two hours. The beginning is sensational as viewers wonder who the villain is and what his agenda towards the president is. The plot remains consistent and very engaging throughout. There are many crime conventions encoded such as murder, robbery, violence, police and detective scenarios which all brilliantly from into this film. John Malkovich.The star of 'Dangerous Liaisons' brought such a powerful motive to this film as the evil cunning assassin that I was completely spellbound. Rarely have I seen a character of this creative charisma. Only Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the lambs matched this performance, the only difference in brilliance is that Malkovich didn't win an Oscar. Malkovich was simply amazing. His tone of voice, his attitude in being relaxed and yet inside frustrated made him a joy to watch from start to finish. The beginning is essential to the personality of his character. Viewers are not given a proper glimpse of him, only side glances through mirrors and binoculars which add to his tension and cunningness, making him one of my favourite villains of all time. Clint Eastwood (Dirty Harry) was also outstanding as the aging cop who also has a lot to contain with in his life as does Rene Russo in her role as the sophisticated secret agent. watch it if...you love the crime genre and mysterious villains</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers ahead)I loved this movie. And the best part was the interaction between Eastwood and Russo. When they first meet, he can't help himself from busting her chops ("nice secretary", "she's here to please the feminists", and other sexual remarks), and later she gets him GOOD. When they're outside escorting the president's car (is that how you say it?), we all think Eastwood will drop dead from a heart attack at any moment (a 63 year old fart chasing after a car, come on). And right afterwards we see a paramedic team rushing into his office, where Eastwood is buried in his chair unconscious (he looks wasted, if not dead), and they start slapping him awake and putting an oxygen mask on his face, he of course shouts them away, and they say "somebody reported you suffered a cardiac arrest" and all the secret service guys laugh out loud in Eastwood's face. Later he's fuming saying what he'll do to the guy responsible, and Russo says "what makes you think it was a he?" and turns and walks away. The best scene!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, an excellent thriller, with Malkovich absolutely brilliant again.Yet again though Hollywood have plonked in an unnecessary romance storyline, which although doesn't ruin the film, doesn't do it any favours at all.Like 'Good Will Hunting' &amp; 'Sphere' this has a romantic sub plot which lessens the quality of the film, but also is almost laughable with the age gap.Yes Clint is cool and an icon for anyone. But I promise you, any girl in her 20's or 30's, may have at the most, thought him attractive a few years ago, but is repulsed by the thought of sleeping with him. The bedroom scene was almost cruel to watch &amp; reminded me of a wildlife documentary, it was that embarassing to view.Despite that, 'In The Line Of Fire' is a very good film, and one of the few, where every single scene in it, contributes to the storyline &amp; quality.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IN THE LINE OF FIRE, in my opinion, is an excellent, suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat action/drama/thriller! I thought that Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked good in the attire they wore at the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved to toy with Agent Horrigan by phone. What a psychopath! He looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film, though. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the entire cast and crew did an outstanding job -- Especially Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, I loved the setting, and, I couldn't get enough of it. Now, in conclusion, to all you Clint Eastwood fans who haven't seen this excellent, suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat action/drama/thriller, if you liked MURDER AT 1600, although I haven't seen that movie, I recommend IN THE LINE OF FIRE. When you see it, prepare to be driven to the edge of your seat!</fullReview>

Sort of but doesn't really hook up with sultry female costar. Vindicates himself in the end with the villain finally getting his just desserts. The whole movie peppered with cheesy lines stolen from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie that were originally stolen from a Clint Eastwood movie.

		<fullReview>A solid if predictable presidential assassin thriller boasting a typically strong performance from star Clint Eastwood. Eastwood plays an old-timer who finds himself in a battle of wits with a much younger man, a psychopath who's planning to kill the president. The running time is overlong but the film plays out in a serviceable, entertaining manner even if it sticks entirely to Hollywood convention throughout. Wolfgang Petersen, a director always more at home at sea rather than on land, displays little enthusiasm for the material but wrings the usual thrills out of the premise, only failing in some ludicrously cheesy slow-motion shots.There are roles for a whole bunch of familiar faces and John Malkovich is allowed to get his teeth into his turn as a psychopath, although it has to be said this is one of the less memorable villains that Hollywood's thrown our way. Watch out for a memorable rooftop encounter and some vintage tough-guy moments from Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the not-quite Dirty Harry for the 90s; a sinister blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolfgang Peterson's In the Line of Fire is cunning and occasionally a truly white-knuckled ride, even if once or twice we might feel like we've been down similar roads before. How could one not when Clint Eastwood, right after (allegedly) closing the book on his western legacy, likely closes the one on his gritty detective pictures (don't count Blood Work in there). But there's more than that because Eastwood's character, here a hard-bitten, demon-ridden and hard as nails secret service agent, has a slightly charming side to him, even the more romantic side that one never got to see in the pictures where he spouted his trademark lines. There is some complexities going on here that don't rely on just the usual swagger, and it's note-worthy for how such a possibly contrived back story (didn't save Kennedy from being assassinated in 63) is made somewhat believable amidst the rest of his persona, which more than likely hides his wounds- most of the time. Eastwood goes to town to make himself a great presence in the film, however, and under the circumstances the character seems tailor made for him.But there would be the risk of his part in the movie being slightly conventional (we still get the 'Harry' type scenes of him being smarter- and as smart-ass- over everyone else in the room, and being scolded and told to back off by the top brass, here a chief of staff), including here protecting a president that (wisely) we never really see or know at all. Even the romantic sub-plot, which is sort of undercooked if there for some machismo laughs, would make the picture a little sub-par if the other quasi-Dirty Harry aspect didn't come into the picture: an indelible villain. This time there's some extra Hollywood suspense, however brillaintly intelligent suspense (almost smarter than the rest of the movie deserves), with the "John Booth" character, played in an Oscar nominated performance by John Malkovich, as someone who's described more as a predator than an assassin. There's ways this could go wrong with the Eastwood character, but Malkovich possibly trumps some of his former villain counterparts by being extremely cool and un-collected (there's that devastating, cringe-worthy scene where he kills the bank teller and her roommate), and as his past is revealed, there's still that element of 'what the hell is with this guy' that keeps the audience and Eastwood's agent guessing and extra paranoid. It's a classic Malkovich performance, quintessentially creepy and always measured in the level of insanity and professionalism.It's also, aside from the conventional points, just a sleekly made picture from Peterson and company, and they come pretty close to the spunky pulp realism of Don Siegel. But Peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks up his sleeve that had me grinning at times; anytime someone puts in such a blatant but exciting homage to Vertigo- jumping from rooftop to rooftop, hero dangling from the ledge, the 'twist'- it still provides some shivers down my spine. There's also the phone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game, probably another kick in the ribs to Hithcock. But in the end, even with all the excitement and brutal danger and crisp formalism in the climax, it's also a characters picture in some ways throughout, and everything is fairly realized to give the audience a fine amount to ponder over, at least in the suspense-movie sense. Eastwod's a great lead, Russo plays the female possible love-interest sincere and mature, and Malkovich is top of the pops. There's also a few notable supporting roles too, and a fine studio score in there. One of the better films of 1993.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I like Clint Eastwood I have to say this was not his finest hour. This film was filled with way too many mistakes that also took one too many liberties with the facts. Clint Eastwood plays Frank Harrigan a Secret Service agent that at one time was assigned to protect President Kennedy. When President Kennedy was assassinated frank felt he did not do his duty by protecting the President and has carried the guilt ever since. Now 30 years have passed and Frank Harrigan is still a Secret Service agent again assigned to protect the President, and this time he will not make the same mistakes. Here is the first problem I have with this film. Frank had a lot of health problems being an old man now, and at one point while running along the President's Limo he can be seen coughing and gagging barely able to keep up. Now do you really think that such an old tired sick man would be allowed to protect the president? I don't think so. The second problem is Rene Russo's character as Special Agent Lilly Raines. She serves no useful purpose except to look sexy for the camera, and there is even an absurd scene where she is on duty in a tight dress (which the secret service would have never allowed) and Frank asked here where her gun is hidden and she replies, " Wouldn't you like to know." Give me a break. Of course we know there will be an attempt on the President life in which sick tired old man frank with redeem himself.The only standout in this film was the performance of John Malkovich as the would be assassin. Other than that avoid this mess...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'In The Line Of Fire' is a film that sounds better than it really is. It has all the prerequisites for an exciting thriller- an oddball assassin planning to kill the President, a Secret Service agent determined to stop him, a long cat &amp; mouse game between them, a beautiful woman the agent has an affair with... all tried and true plot devices. The Secret Service agent, Frank Horrigan, is a hard-headed loner, the last surviving member of the detail that guarded John Kennedy when he was shot and killed. All these potentially exciting elements never really come together, and the film has a cut-and-dried, paint-by-the-numbers feel to it. The various subplots come across as clichéd; for instance, we instinctively know, early on, that Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) will fall out of favor with his superiors. We know he and the beautiful Secret Service agent Lily Raines (Rene Russo), even though she apparently can't stand him, will have an affair. We know the nutcase assassin (John Malkovich) will come within a hair's breadth of killing the President. And of course we know Horrigan will prevent it, on duty or not. Granted, the movie delivers all this competently; Eastwood, as always, is fun to watch and some of his dry dialogue is effective. But an air of the routine permeates the film. There is nothing particularly scary about Mitch Leary; he's more annoying than anything in his phone calls to Horrigan, when he taunts the agent for failing to protect Kennedy all those years ago. Nothing in the film is very subtle or mysterious. It is suggested that Horrigan is too old for his job and sure enough in the next scene, he is running alongside the presidential limo, obligingly huffing and puffing to show his age. The film wants to be a cross between 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'The Manchurian Candidate' but has none of those films' layered textures or rich characterizations. It plays like a decently produced TV movie and, taken on that level, is moderately entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The teaming up of Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich was the idea of, what can I say, a mad genius! The two along side each other convey a bitter and chilling relationship that keeps you in suspense all throughout the movie. Though I must say Malkovich, as always conveys the most noticeable character and achieves it well as the sick and twisted but clever assassin Mitch Leary, who attempts to ruin the life of the American President's bodyguard - Frank Horrigan (Eastwood). Horrigan is determined to protect the President's life no matter what - even if it means being In The Line of Fire for him, because of his fail at protecting John F. Kennedy's life thirty years before hand. With the odd funny moment and sparks of romance this film is great entertainment for those who like fast, hot action.The movie was very intense and a great cat and mouse game between Eastwood and Malkovich ensues, as the villain taunts our hero Horrigan, of mistakes made in the past. A great supporting cast, Rene Russo, Dylan McDermott, John Mahoney. I really thought the performance by Malkovich richly deserved the best supporting actor for his role as Mitch Leary.. but alas. The script is slightly cheesy with love interests, a last gasp attempt to resolve situations and defying the odds. Though these elements usually ruin pictures, the direction and performances are enough to save the film. The action sequences are well thought out, particularly the roof top chase and the scene in the lift. The fact this film doesn't overdo the action is an added bonus and is kept solid and consistent through Peterson's direction. If you are not a political person then there is no fear as this is none educational, more of an action and dramatic styled refection on past politics. This is a shame however as this could have stepped up the ante of the plot and driven the film on a serious everyday issue but instead was used to build on Frank's personality, his lack of belief in himself, which ultimately leads to a fairly awful and cringing saving ending.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent psychological thriller with some minor plotting problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is still plagued with anxieties 30 years after the death of President Kennedy. Horrigan felt that he could have done more to try to prevent Kennedy from being assassinated and continues to blame himself for this tragic occurrence. 30 years later, Horrigan finds himself being taunted by a man who tells him that he is going to kill the president. In order to prevent another assassination, Horrigan sets to work in trying to discover the identity of the would be assassin whilst doing his utmost to protect the President.I've mentioned in my summary that there were some minor plotting problems with this film so I will address these issues first; it's established early in the film that Horrigan blames himself for Kennedy's death and sees this assassination attempt as a means to prove to himself, and to everyone else, that he can adequately protect the President. OK, that's fine, but I wasn't completely taken with the way that the story was set-up (it came across to me as Horrigan being on some kind of self-pitying guilt trip). This is only a minor problem because despite this Horrigan is still focused on the job at hand and therefore it's still very easy to develop a rooting interest in his character - I only wish the story would have been set-up in a different way. I also felt that Leary's (John Malkovich) motivations were a little thin and not entirely believable. The pacing of the film is also a little uneven. Now for the good bits....Where the film is at its strongest is in the various scenes between Horrigan and Leary. In these scenes, a slow-burning psychological battle of wits begins to develop between the two men (Leary clearly has the upper hand at the start, but Horrigan's dogged determination soon sees him begin to close the gap). Director Wolfgang Peterson makes many of these scenes cold and menacing by not showing all of Leary's face at the start - yes it's not original, but it's simple, effective and helps to create tension. The screenplay is also relatively clever and had enough intelligence and depth to make sure that my interest never truly waned.The performances across the board are variable, but once again it's John Malkovich that steals the show from everyone here. Malkovich is one of my favourite actors and his sociopathic performance here was wonderful to watch. Eastwood is also good here and I liked the way that the writers made his character feel believable - he was in his early 60's when this was made and therefore his character is human here rather than super human (he has heart problems and fitness issues) which makes sense given his age and his lengthy career in a somewhat stressful job.In The Line Of Fire is a very good film that is exciting, suspenseful and intense. There are also very few dull spots which isn't bad considering its running time. It's a race against time film/psychological thriller and the two elements mix well together creating a very impressive film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is so adept at playing the over-the-hill badass--and this movie is no exception. "Unforgiven", in which Clint plays the past-his-prime gunslinger, is still one of my favorite movies (if you haven't seen it, shame on you).Here, Clint plays Frank Horrigan, a secret service agent that is the only still active agent to have been on duty when JFK was assassinated. That day plagues him and it becomes all the more relevant when he is dragged into a cat and mouse game with another potential president assassin, Mitch Leary (John Malkovich).As adept as Clint is at playing a golden aged hero, Malkovich is equally adept at playing a psychopath. The drama and intensity of In the Line of Fire was brought to life by Malkovich. Mitch Leary was a respectable bad guy. However ignoble is aim was he was going to achieve it in the most noble and sophisticated fashion. Mitch Leary was both cold-blooded and honest. He toyed with Frank Horrigan and the entire secret service but left tiny bread crumbs just to keep it interesting for himself and, by extension, the viewer. I so enjoyed the chess match between the two of them.Rounding out the starring cast was Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott. Rene played an agent and Frank's love interest (naturally) and Dylan played Al D'Andrea, the rookie. Their roles were inconsequential because the real show was Eastwood and Malkovich. I wish they'd done more projects together.</fullReview>

Now I recognize the need for strong female characters. But she's not exactly a strong character at all. In fact, her character is never really significant throughout the entire film. I respect Russo as an actress, and I'm sure if the screenplay was further refined, her character could have been developed further. Still, I recommend it. It makes for a fun movie night, and it's ever enjoyable despite some flaws, which you can easily get over by paying attention to how awesome Eastwood and Malkovich's battle of wits really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Peterson Power-Punch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolfgang Peterson is a well-known film director from Germany, best known for his action- packed, high calibre blockbusters. In The Line Of Fire is his first American thriller at the highest level. Peterson broke out in 1981's Das Boot, the best German epic ever. The Neverending Story showed his versatility and In The Line Of Fire cemented his legacy and best-known genre to tackle: a political thriller. Only Wolfgang Peterson could have made a movie this exciting.I have no interest in politics, but I found this movie to be thoroughly engaging and very fun. It is about a Secret Service Agent (Eastwood) who is haunted by his failure to save John F. Kennedy. A psychotic madman (Malkovich) toys with him, saying he plans on assassinating the current president. Eastwood does a job well-done in acting, one of the best he's ever done (I'd say). But John Malkovich steals the show in every scene he's in. I'm surprised the American Film Institute didn't put him on their list of 50 Greatest Villains. He's sure better than some that made the cut. Many political thrillers aren't really interesting to me. There's too much talk about the different parties and subjects that only avid news watchers would like. In The Line Of Fire is about battling a hit-man. The political bit don't get in the way at all. Since there's many subplots about the characters that tie together very well, the strength makes it outweigh most other flicks like this. To top it all off, Wolfgang Peterson gives us a picture with a direction that only the best can do. Any perilous thriller like this is a sure winner, but Peterson does more. He treats Malkovich's character like an actual monster. Similar to what John Carpenter did with Michael Myers in the original Halloween, we do not really see Malcovich's character into part way through the movie. He uses lighting and camera tricks to keep him a mystery, a thing. After a while, at the right point, he had to have been shown. Does Peterson stop his clever tricks? No. That is just when they begin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunted Horrigan Seeks Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In The Line Of Fire" is a real crowd-pleaser that contains plenty of action, suspense and humour but also distinguishes itself from most similar thrillers because of its engaging plot, its well fleshed-out characters and its excellent dialogue. Its greatest asset, however, is its totally deranged villain who plans to assassinate the President. His dual with a tough but vulnerable secret service agent is at the heart of virtually everything that happens and provides the movie with much of its impetus as well as some interesting insights into the psychological preoccupations of the two men.Veteran secret service agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is haunted by the memory of the day in November 1963 when he was guarding President Kennedy but failed to save him from being assassinated. That incident left him doubting whether he had the courage needed to risk his own life to save the President's and the guilt that he'd suffered since led him to drinking too much and suffering the breakdown of his marriage. When he receives a phone call from a man who threatens to kill the President, Horrigan seizes the opportunity to return to the Presidential Protection Detail because doing so could offer him the chance to redeem himself.The potential assassin turns out to be a disillusioned ex-CIA agent called Mitch Leary (John Malkovich) who's very bitter about the way he'd been treated by the government and is seeking to take revenge by killing the President. He's obviously read a great deal about Horrigan's background and sees certain parallels in their experiences. Leary is very cool, clever and cunning and clearly has the ability to carry out his threat. He's also determined and recognises that he has "a rendezvous with death".In his new role, Horrigan starts a relationship with a fellow agent, Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) and also runs into trouble with the Presidential Chief Of Staff, Harry Sargent (Fred Dalton Thompson) who orders him off the Detail when he raises the alarm at one of the President's re-election rallies after mistaking the sound of a bursting balloon for a gun shot. Horrigan then takes matters into his own hands and pursues his quarry until they eventually confront each other in the movie's exciting climax.In a movie which is full of good performances, the contributions of Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich stand out. Frank Horrigan is something of a misfit among his colleagues due to his age, his sexism and his lack of fitness which becomes most apparent when he runs breathlessly alongside the President's car. He knows he's seen as a "borderline burn-out with questionable social skills" but also knows that his instincts are intact and despite being regarded as a dinosaur and being subjected to Leary's mind games, knows he has the experience and confidence to hunt down his adversary.Clint Eastwood, in one of his most subtle performances, strikes the perfect balance in portraying his piano-playing tough guy's interesting combination of strengths and weaknesses and John Malkovich is wonderfully creepy as the dangerous psychopath whose CIA training and brilliant use of disguises make him a formidable threat and just the type of top class villain that this superior thriller deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched this film the other evening, what struck me from the perspective of having been around when John F. Kennedy was assassinated was how familiar all the press clippings appeared to be in Mitch Leary's apartment. The pictures and headlines were ubiquitous in the aftermath of the assassination, and it struck me how viewers born after that event will never have that same kind of perspective. Not sure if that really means anything, but it's something I've been thinking about since watching the picture.Considering Clint Eastwood's character to be one of the Secret Service agents assigned to the Kennedy detail, I'm glad the film writers didn't take the approach of making Frank Horrigan a discombobulated mental case because of the assassination. Eastwood displayed just the right amount of angst over his connection to Dallas without obsessing about it. Casting John Malkovich against Horrigan as the disgruntled ex-CIA agent was a brilliant move, he exhibited a cold menace in the early going to keep Horrigan off balance. There was a great line he used to taunt Horrigan with when he said "What do you see when you're in the dark and the demons come?" Without knowing anything about how the Secret Service actually operates, the film had some interesting points to make about protecting the president. There was also the upcoming election intrigue taking into account the president's standing in the polls and how the Chief of Staff (Fred Thompson) obsessed about closing that gap with personal appearances in light of a credible threat. Another interesting observation which can only be made in hindsight, is the phony name used by Leary early in the picture when he was calling himself James Carney. How could anyone know that in 2014, the presidential press secretary would be someone named Jay Carney. It calls to mind all those weird coincidences when considering the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful presidential thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a suspenseful thriller involving Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood), who is haunted by his failure to save President Kennedy while on duty in Dallas. Thirty years later, a psychotic and loner named Mitch "Booth" Leary (John Malkovich) threatens the life of the current President, and Horrigan decides to confront his past and protect the President at all costs.This movie is full of edge-of-your-seat excitement as Horrigan tries to track down Leary, and is an fascinating roller coaster ride in every scene involving the President, making you wonder if danger will strike.I think the acting was superb, and I especially liked the chemistry between Clint and Rene Russo, whose character understands Horrigan. She gives the film the right amount of drama where appropriate. Arrogance never sits well with me, which is why I despised Gary Cole's character, Bill Watts. If Clint would have knocked him a few rounds, this film would have been a more satisfying viewing pleasure. In addition to the intensive thrills and drama, this movie could have used some more action scenes - lots of all talk and no action, But, what made up for it is the high-tension climax.Overall, a pretty fascinating thriller with some of Eastwood's best work.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wolfgang Petersen directed this thriller that stars Clint Eastwood as veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, who lives with the bitter memory of failing to save the life of President John F. Kennedy on that fateful November 22, some thirty years previous. John Malkovich plays former CIA agent Mitch Leary, who is enraged at his firing, and decides to assassinate the current President, and cruelly uses Frank in his plan, taunting him with his failure, and how he will lose a second president, something Frank is determined to prevent, even if he has to take the assassin's bullets himself... Exciting and quite well acted and directed film is also most interesting for its plot and as a character study of two very different men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can stand the Hollywood Conceit of Romance with Sloppy kissing and groping between a Geezer and a Thirty-Something Hottie you might give this one a Pass because it is an Above Average Thriller with a Venomous Villain. If you can believe Clint Eastwood as a Jazz Pianist you might give this a Pass because it has much more going for it.There are a number of Suspenseful Set-Pieces and John Malkovich without doubt steals the Film from the One-Note Eastwood who really struggles delivering Lines at times and is unwatchable as He exchanges Loving Stares with Rene Russo. Overall, this is kept from sinking to Cringe inducing Territory by a Multi-Faced Malkovich that is as Creepy as they come. It moves along at a brisk pace and it needs too as it moves quickly from badly Written exchanges and exposition Scenes among Good Ol Boy Ballbusting and a predictable Sub-Plot with a Partner that is never fleshed out and comes across as totally Contrived.A Watchable Film that tries just a little too hard to be Heady, and the best of it outweighs those excruciating Filler bits and delivers an Entertaining, but Puffed-Up Piece of Product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Line of Fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. Being a huge fan of him because he knows how to make entertaining movies and make his audience sit on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is awesome to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialogues he was given. Directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Troy) it is one of those movies of 90s that would remind you of Eastwood's trademark role Dirty Harry Eastwood stars as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case.But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but sadly he lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive. Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls and taunts Eastwood throughout the film. And after a while what Malkovich says does causes Eastwood to get real personal. John Malkovich is also magnificent in perhaps his most famous and celebrated psycho role. Screen chemistry of these two incredible actors is enjoyable to watch- especially in the phone call scenes. "In the line of fire" has huge amount of splendid moments. Scene where Eastwood is hanging on the edge of the roof and points his gun at Malkovich's mouth who's only trying to help him is a classic and so is the elevator scene in the end of the film. If you ask me personally the best part was the climax involving Malkovich and EastwoodMy Rating - 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Line of Fire is directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Jeff Maguire. It stars Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by John Bailey.Veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) is pulled back into President protection duty when a deadly assassin, Mitch Leary (Malkovich), surfaces and announces his intention to kill the current incumbent of the Whitehouse. But Frank is feeling his age and he is haunted by his failure to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and Leary knows this and uses it to toy with Horrigan's mindset.Good old fashioned thriller that we could do with more of these days, In the Line of Fire is a classic cat-and-mouse plot elevated to greater heights by Eastwood and Malkovich. Horrigan, a bastion of good with a determination to succeed and once again prove his worth, Leary, troubled but cunning and clever, it's a mental face off and the prize is not just the Presidents life, but also redemption. The script is sharp and the film hits its straps when Horrigan and Malkovich are in conversation, they have a definite link to each other, a common ground, even if Horrigan refuses to accept it. The writing shows intelligence and worth, with a Leary back story making him a scary uber villain. Russo always engages as fellow Secret Service Agent, Lilly Raines, her tender scenes with Eastwood well acted, while McDermott scores well but his character is one that features all too many times in cop/agent thrillers.Eastwood enjoys himself because he is asked to play himself, and the film is better for it, Malkovich, once again, proves he has few peers when it comes to playing off the chain baddies. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In the Line of Fire" is a fairly enjoyable, if obvious, tale of a guilt- ridden secret service agent being tortured by a terrorist. Eastwood gives a terrific performance who just wants to be left alone, but on the other hand, wants a second chance to redeem himself during a time of crisis. For a while, Malkovich's performance isn't especially interesting. Eventually, the character has some momentum. For those who lived through the JFK assassination, this movie will be especially meaningful, even though it's not technically about the JFK assassination. It may not be anything fresh, but it's very effective and entertaining.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before he became a super-hack, Wolfgang Petersen, who showed much promise with "Das Boot", directed "In the Line of Fire", perhaps his last decent film to date. The film stars the perpetually cool Clint Eastwood as a seething cauldron of masculinity, an ageing Secret Service agent who chases bad guys, beds youthful women and tells high ranking officials to kiss his taunt, well honed, bony ass.The film belong's to the "cat and mouse", "bodyguard" or "serial killer" genre, Eastwood essentially a slightly more civilised Dirty Harry, who follows clues, tracks leads and attempts to apprehend a maniac out to kill the President of the United States. For all his supposed non-conformity, Eastwood is still just another guy willing to throw body before bullet to protect his boss. The film was released in the wake of "The Bodyguard" and "Silence of Lambs" (both of which were part of a string of late 1980s, early 1990s serial killer and bodyguard movies), and works largely because of Eastwood, who chews scenery like a fleet of combine harvesters. He's like the modern Bogart, perpetually ticked off and oozing a laid back cool.John Malkovich plays the film's villain. He's another in a long line of balding and bespectacled serial killers, paedophiles or deviants. These characters are typically sexually neutral and/or androgynous, their hair loss signifying some sinister loss of masculinity, some kind of sexual aberration. Malkovich is suitably memorable in his role, but it's a thin, bogeyman role (much like Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs"), in which the villain is imbued with a near supernatural intellect.Most of the film's "action" consists of verbal sparring, verbal games of one-oneupmanship, and brain battles, so "In The Line of Fire's" aged fairly well. The film is formulaic, literal cliffhanger ending and all, but Hollywood did such thrillers in the 1990s better than they do today.8/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible -- but a Genuine Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea that a man planning to assassinate the President would be in regular contact with a Secret Service agent is utterly implausible. It is, however, the underlying basis for this excellent thriller. With Clint Eastwood as the aging secret agent and John Malkovich as the assassin stalking the President, "In the Line of Fire" is nonetheless a taut thriller that makes the most of the skills brought to the table by both of its principals. Eastwood is again the stalwart individualist and continues to be marvelously adept in that role. Malkovich is a splendid villain, who kills efficiently and without compulsion. The final portion of the movie in which the two confront one another at the scene of the intended assassination is executed with great skill and dramatic intensity. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Although it's impossible not to guess (correctly) that Eastwood's character will survive and get the girl, his co-agent played by Rene Russo, the implausibility and the clichés do nothing to undermine the action. As a resident of the Washington, D.C., area, I admired the use of the city as the backdrop for much of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood plays a secret service man that once again puts himself in the line of fire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a rather good thriller starring Clint Eastwood as a secret service man who once again goes on active duty to be a bodyguard for the president of the United States. John Malkovich plays a man who is determined to assassinate the current president and once he finds out Eastwood's character was one of the men who was with JFK during his assassination he begins taunting Eastwood's character. Rather good movie, though it is made much better thanks to Eastwood and Malkovich's presence in the film. There is a bit of action in this one and some humor as well. The movie at times moves a bit slowly though, but it is nothing that is really going to detract from the movie a whole lot. Rene Russo also stars in this one and plays a love interest for Clint and plays an agent also looking out for the president, her and Clint's scene where they try to get intimate is one of the more humorous parts in the movie. There is also an interesting scene in which Malkovich makes a rather unique gun capable of evading detection and it all leads up to a rather thrilling conclusion. A very good end to the film to say the least. Malkovich was up for an academy award for his role as the would be assailant, but the award ended up going to Tommy Lee Jones for his role in the "Fugitive". I have to give a slight edge to Tommy, this role is one that really does not differ all that much from Malkovich's usual role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is being harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught. In the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer, "John Kramer" (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series. Through clever planning and influence, Frank is able to make the arrest of Mendoza (Bell).From thereafter, its a series of cat and mouse chase. Malkovich is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile. Once again showing a different role in this film, he astounds me with his ability to interchange his characters with the next film.I've watch Malkovich play in Con Air as a menacing insanely smart Cyrus, in Of Mice and Men as the tragically challenged bunny lover Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very smart bomber terrorist who is very sane but is deluded into thinking he can elude his captures.Clint Eastwood is no one special me. He's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing he can really astound you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional.Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me with her supporting actually being a bigger role, to me, than Eastwood's.While this might seem like an action blockbuster, it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation. You have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the end. Along the way, you'll be mesmerized by Malkovich and Eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse.</fullReview>

Agent Lilly Raines(Rene Russo)tries to keep Horrigan grounded; but he is head strong in stopping Leary from carrying out his threats of assassination. Very good FX and fast pace sustains the plot.

		<shortDescription>Gripping political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this late at night thinking I would just watch the first half hour, but I got sucked in and wound up watching the whole thing. Maybe this movie absorbed me because I don't watch many thrillers and this was a change of pace, but it can get its hooks into you on several fronts.Early on two themes are set forth that are attention grabbers. One is the back-story of a secret service agent, Frank Horrigan, who was in the detail protecting President Kennedy at the time of Kennedy's assassination. We see Frank in a picture from the time of the assassination. Whenever we see such a picture it is hard not to wonder what the story is behind the people we see - how did they come to be there and what happened to them? Here we get the inside story on Frank. The second theme is that of presidential assassinations in general. That topic seems to be endlessly fascinating and the assassination of Kennedy is perhaps not even second to that of Lincoln in spawning speculation and controversy, even almost a half century on. Frank's story hooks us into Kennedy's assassination in a personal way that brings the event into focus in ways we have perhaps not thought deeply about. What if Frank had been successful in protecting Kennedy? How would things have been different? It's hard to resist being given an insight into Frank's personal involvement, even if fictional, in one of the most significant events of the 20th century.Clint Eastwood does a fine job in playing Frank as a man tortured by about as big a "what if" as anyone is ever likely to have to live with. One of the strengths of "In the Line of Fire" is that it delves fairly deeply into Frank's psychology. The main tool in exposing Frank's tortured soul is his being taunted by Mitch Leary (John Malcovitch), an eerily diabolical psycho intent on killing the president circa 1991. Malcovitch plays Leary so well, and with such creepy wickedness, that you begin to wonder what he is like in real life. Mitch has seized on tormenting Frank as a form of gamesmanship, feeling that both he and Frank have been let down by a government that they once were willing to die for. Questions are raised about the psychology of someone whose job it is to take a hit for a president, perhaps a president they don't even respect. I also liked the relationship that developed between Frank and his partner Lilly (Rene Russo). They may not be Bogart and Bacall but they have some well-written, sharp dialog that adds some spice to the movie.Then there is the aspect of going behind the scenes at the highest levels of power in the U.S. This hook is what drove the popularity of "The West Wing" for its seven-year run on TV and is well exploited here. We are even treated to Fred Thompson playing a duplicitous White House Chief of staff.The pacing is brisk, but the story is skillfully presented and there is never any difficulty in being able to follow what's going on. The director seems particularly adroit in being able to present chaotic scenes without losing the audience.</fullReview>

Malkovich says he's going to kill the president, and he purposely calls Eastwood, and pushes his buttons. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cold, but very intelligent mindset to his character. Everything he does, he does for a reason, and he's not shy about killing. Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him. The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood Vs. Malkovich, in Suspense Classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood, following up his Oscar-winning UNFORGIVEN, chose a winner with Wolfgang Petersen's suspenseful IN THE LINE OF FIRE. As 30-year veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, Eastwood had the misfortune of protecting President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and the specter of not reacting quickly enough to 'take the fatal bullet' has never fully left him, through the subsequent years. At the other end of the spectrum is ex-CIA assassin Mitch Leary (brilliantly portrayed by John Malkovich), who had become 'excess baggage' for the intelligence community, due to budget cuts. After surviving a bungled attempt to kill him, Leary decides to vent his rage at his 'betrayal' by assassinating the President. In his research, he discovers that the only person still active from the 1963 Kennedy team is Secret Service agent Horrigan, and, deciding the agent is a worthy opponent, begins to tease Horrigan over the phone with clues about his identity, and how the agent will be "standing over the grave of another dead President".The film builds up a 'head of steam' from the very first scene, as Horrigan and his partner, Al D'Andrea (Dylan McDermott, long before television stardom in THE PRACTICE) take down a band of counterfeiters, and the edginess never lets up, after Leary, introducing himself as 'Booth', begins his series of fateful calls to Horrigan. Facing mounting opposition from the head of the Presidential Secret Service team (Gary Cole), as well as the White House Chief of Staff (future Senator Fred Dalton Thompson), Horrigan badgers, insults, and belittles everyone's work, knowing the potential assassin will find any crack in the security, and take advantage of it. Only his boss, Sam Campagna (FRAZIER star John Mahoney), his partner, D'Andrea, and fellow agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo, in another star-making performance), take him seriously, with Raines soon falling in love with the cantankerous agent.The plot is full of twists and turns, as Horrigan barely misses capturing Leary, twice, and Leary, at one point, actually saves Horrigan's life (while ending D'Andrea's). Strung so tightly that his health is affected, and he starts making bad 'calls', Horrigan is finally removed from Presidential security...just as Leary is about to make his move...IN THE LINE OF FIRE does for the Secret Service what BACKDRAFT did for firefighters, and television's NYPD BLUE does for policemen; it shows the organization not as a group of faceless supermen, but as dedicated people performing an essential service, protecting the life of the Chief Executive. As Leary sneers to Horrigan, "I'm the Offense, you're the Defense," which truly describes the difficulty of their job; they must find the means to counter whatever misdeed a potential perpetrator can concoct. While Clint Eastwood's Horrigan may be far more of a 'lone wolf' than the Agency would, in real life, accept, his dedication to the job reflects well on those unique individuals who would 'take a bullet' for the President.It is an excellent suspense film, and a worthy addition to any Clint Eastwood collection!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie straight through since the day it first opened in theaters. I still love it and remain at the edge of my seat throughout. That plastic gun idea was a classic. I'm sure if someone could really make a plastic gun, there would be a lawsuit against this movie, because it definitely puts bad ideas into assassins' and terrorists' heads. But with airport security getting tighter and tighter, they might actually check the rabbit's foot keychain for bullets. Hell, even nail filers are considered lethal weapons nowadays. There is a great degree of tension throughout the film. Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich are both great. Eastwood is terrific at playing these conflicted characters, and let's face it--his snarling dialogue delivery is always fun to hear. I'll always remember the "You have a rendezvous with my a*s, motherf**ker" line. And it's so much fun watching Malkovich play the slimy villain. His Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Along with Ray Liotta, there's nothing more fun than watching Malkovich explode into a fit on screen. His descents into relentless anger are classic. I think what works is he starts out very pleasantly and mild-mannered, and next thing you know--he's a monster. I can see why he was chosen to play Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde (in "Mary Reilly" which I have yet to see). Dylan McDermott is also great as Clint's naive partner. I think the subplot of Eastwood's character being an agent during the JFK assassination was a little much, but that's merely a minor flaw. I have a lot of fun with this movie. It stars two actors I highly admire and is full of suspense. And the plastic gun concept I mentioned earlier was very original. My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frenetic, intense cat and mouse thriller set to a chilling tone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`In the Line of Fire' is a tense paranoiac thriller. There are many good things about it, but at times it isn't realistic. If a guy was really trying to assassinate the President, it's unlikely that he would phone the bodyguards, drop hints for them, or constantly draw attention to himself. Then again, this is a film, and it's that aspect that makes it all the more exciting. The movie follows along the lines of the age-old `cat and mouse' genre. But this follows in a sometimes repetitively episodic tone. What surprised me the most was the brutal violence that occurred in several scenes (e.g., when the stalker follows the bank clerk home).There are good performances all across the board for the most part. Clint Eastwood is convincing as the burned-out bodyguard, though the romantic sub-plot with Rene Russo is absolutely un-necessary. Not only that, but there's no chemistry between the two and the romance seems forced. John Malkovich received an Oscar nomination for his part as the stalker/killer. His performance is good, even if it is something of a stereotype. Rene Russo is OK, but doesn't get quite enough time to flesh out her character to the max. The same applies for Dylan McDermott. The only other real problem I had with the film is the fact the only part that is really relevant is the last 15 minutes. The sequences that lead up to it are engaging, but predictable. The climax has the distinctive `Hollywood' elements, but it is still a satisfying conclusion. `In The Line of Fire' certainly isn't a political thriller, but it does what it promises to do and is at it's when it isn't taken seriously. My IMDb rating: 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malkovich at his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the first billing of this show was Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich was the real star deservedly earning himself the Best Supporting Actor nomination. No offence to Mr Landau's impeccable performance in Ed Wood but I bet the Oscars are going to do the same to Malkovich some time when he's a senior too. It's your usual run-after-the-bad-guy thriller but Malkovich's evil portrayal of the screwed up assassin maniac will keep you watching, even if you know he's going to die in the end (typically Hollywood!). He's a bad guy you love to hate and though he's supposed to be the evil one, you can't help but like him simply coz he's just so evil, you know like Alan Rickman in Robin Hood or Gary Oldman in Dracula. Brilliant movie for both guys and gals to watch together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the Line of Fire" is a terrific movie. I'm so glad that Clint Eastwood decided to take a break from spaghetti westerns and did this movie. I love movies that have the hero and the villain playing cat and mouse games and this one takes the cake. Clint Eastwood was great as Frank Horrigan, a detective who is trying to stop a vicious assassin from killing the President of the United States. He looked very into shape for a man in his early sixties. John Malkovich plays Mitch Leary/John Booth/James Carney, the pychotic assassin that Eastwood is trying to stop. He was excellent in this role and I don't think he was over the top. His performance was very intense and he was downright scary at times. Rene Russo was ok but I really didn't care too much for her character. I loved the chase scenes and the phone conversations between Clint and John were intriguing. It was a little disheartening to see John kill everyone that he came into contact with but I think that if he hadn't then the movie wouldn't have been as good. The last scene in the movie was one of the best and I'm glad it ended the way that it did. This was a very good movie and I'm so glad I own it now. Well, thanks for reading my review! Bye!</fullReview>

He's playing really good as the old, broken secret service agent and he's taking advance of his age. John Malcovich is also doing nice as the bad guy and it was a good move from the directors to give him a big role. Rene Russo is (for a change) also doing nice as the fellow agent. The ending is very exiting and I give it a big 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This really deserves the prime-time TV slots it always gets, when ITV decide to air it. There are all number of thrillers, and most of them hit the average mark. And to begin with, that's how this sounded. A secret service agent has to save a president from a psycho - original eh? But there was so much more to it.Frank's background about the ex-president he failed to save was never mentioned in the brief description of this film that I saw, so it came as an extra element to the plot. And the acting is brilliant. There isn't one main character who fails to deliver the goods, and while the plot unfolds predictably in the most part, there were small surprises along the way which kept me thoroughly engaged in the film at all times.There are some weaknesses in the film. For instance, there was a rather weak romantic sub-plot, and the president himself was too insignificant. But the real ace-in-the-hole for this film is the acting, it never fails to be superb stuff. Out of Eastwood, and Malkovich, it's impossible to pick who the better man is.9/10 - it stands out in the 'above-average' film collection</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Line of Fire is certainly one of the better action thrillers of the decade, far superior to stupid garbage like The Jackal. Eastwood turns in a performance in which he's rough as well as sensitive; Malkovich makes an almost alarmingly convincing portrayal of the psychopathic killing machine. Russo has a rather insignificant role but the cute little romance between her and Clint is a pleasure to watch. The rooftop chase, reminiscent of the opening scene of Vertigo, plays like a homage to Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoiler, maybe...)"In the Line of Fire" has quality. It's an exciting thriller, with a great cast and with an intelligent story to back up their excellent performances. To say that Eastwood never "has been better" (Maltin review) is taking it way too far - but it is still a very honest, believable and interesting performance. Malcovitch, well... he can embody the creepiest characters imaginable, and he does an enviable job of it here. It's not so darn unpredictable, but that doesn't matter much. The issue isn't if Leary is going to succeed in killing the president, it's about Horrigan's chances for redemption. Malcovitch's creepy guy Leary and Eastwood's hard-*ssed Horrigan and the interaction between them is drive enough for this movie, and the suspense comes rather from that.</fullReview>

Malkovich is truly frightening and Eastwood gives his usual bravura performance.

		<fullReview>"In the Line of Fire" has to be Clint Eastwood's best non-"Dirty-Harry" film ever, even though you see shades of Clint's trademark character contained in "ITLOF". This film has enough suspence and action to keep you to the very edge of your seat. Not only the phsyical content is great, but the performances were outstanding. Eastwood's tough and stiff as always, playing a secret service agent suffering from painful memories, Dylan McDermot plays the weary sidekick, Rene Russo is the agent who yanks at Eastwood's boxer shorts (Sondra Locke, eat your heart out!!), and John Malkovich plays probably his best role yet as the mind game-playing psycho who taunts Clint.Like I said before, there are a lot of "Dirty Harry" elements in this picture, like chases on rooftops, sidekicks to our main hero, the madman character (with Malkovich does like how Andrew Robinson did in "Dirty Harry") and the showdown between our hero and the main enemy. Without a doubt, "In the Line of Fire" is the best suspence film for decades. If this flick doesn't recharge your batteries, you're probably dead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Malkovich is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Malkovich has made many films unforgettable. He was incredible in Con Air and The Man In The Iron Mask and even better in this. What makes him so good is the way his voice remains to be calm, and still manages to be as intimidating as baddies that shout "F**k You, come on motherf**kers," for the majority of their screen time.Since Clint Eastwood's 'Golden Time' with his cowboy/soldier films, he has never since been able to be quite the same. His recent film, True Crime co starring James Wood is a terribly boring movie from start to finish. And sadly, his gruff good guy in this is a big let down. After Malkovich convincingly acts out his wannabe-assassin, Eastwood just seems like such a bore. Somewhere in between Malkovich and Eastwood lies Rene Russo(Lethal Weapon3,4). She plays Eastwood's partner in stopping Malkovich. Also in on the show is Hamburger Hill's Dylan McDermott whose last scene is an absolute killer.&gt; An intelligent film from start to finish. Malkovich and McDermott are brilliant. This film is for anyone wanting a good nights entertainment. Rating=3/5</fullReview>

For an entertaining theme evening -- the theme being film psychotics who wish, for money or passion, to do violent damage to the American president -- show this flick as a double feature with The Jackal starring Bruce Willis. Both of these movies have really creepy bad guys, extremely well portrayed (although Malkovich is the greater artist); both are well shot and have cute men and women that are fun to look at; both have lots of plot twists which, predictable or not, are fun to ride along with.

		<shortDescription>Eastwood strikes again after Oscar win; Malkovich also shines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly after Clint Eastwood finally won the Oscar for 1992's "Unforgiven," everyone (including myself) was excited to see with what he would follow it up. This time, he steps down from the directorial podium to allow Wolfgang Petersen to take control, and continues a streak he has had in the 90's that is unlike any other star from this decade. His next triumph is called "In the Line of Fire."Clint reprises his Dirty Harry-type character as Frank Horrigan, a retired Secret Service agent who performs free-lance investigations on the side, assisted by partner Al (Dylan McDermott). When a mysterious caller who is attempting to assassinate the president (Oscar-nominee John Malkovich, in an intelligently evil performance) sets off Horrigan's overreactive intuition, Frank asks to be assigned to the advance team once again. Rene Russo is also along for the ride as a female agent, one who is turned off by Frank at first, but later takes a shine to him.Malkovich, whom I've always thought as one of the most accomplished supporting actors we have working today, plays this deranged assassin to a tee. He is a frightening character, not so much for his creepy voice on the phone, but because of his challenging intellect and how he uses it to Eastwood's disadvantage. He's one of those villains that is so entertaining but so hated at the same time. We become quite familiar with him by the end of the film, but still cannot crack the mystery that overrides his persona. In many ways, it is a brilliant performance, close to the situation, but also maintaining that edge of impersonality.Even though we recognize Eastwood as again immortalizing that Harry Callahan image in this film, he is still far outside that classic image at the same time. Frank Horrigan is craggy and arrogant, but still very likable and gallant. He is not always ticked off, but often with a kind disposition, sometimes becoming scared from Malkovich's threats as well as from his own personal demons. The suggestion that Horrigan was present on the Secret Service when Kennedy was killed surprisingly does not seem like a cultural whitewash here, but rather a moment in Frank's life that left him to question what his life would have been like if he had thoroughly done his job and saved JFK's life. This leads us to better understand his ambitious will to catch Malkovich, and as a result, attempt to find meaning again in his lonely life. Clint Eastwood's performance in this newer film may resemble Harry Callahan somewhat, but this portrayal is more calculated and overall more deeply felt.This is a thriller involving great minds and careful pacing rather than a lot of shooting. There are a couple of good action sequences in the film, but the real excitement comes from the cat-and-mouse game that Eastwood and Malkovich face off in. I have no idea what the real Secret Service thought of this picture and how it reflected their organization, but I believe they would have admired it just for how much "In the Line of Fire" focuses on dignity and taut investigation, instead of a bunch of would-be police officers with a prestigious individual to protect. Clint Eastwood shows us that after the glow of Oscar and at the age of 63, he can still keep on the cutting edge of great filmmaking. Rating: Four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An assassination thriller in the mould of Day Of The Jackal, In The Line Of Fire has the added twist that Eastwood's old-timer bodyguard Frank Horrigan is troubled by past failure on the job. The chase becomes personal as John Malkovich's reptilian assassin Leary taunts him over this neurosis - with the rather clunky exception of the love of a good woman (Russo's Lilly Raines) nothing's going to set Frank's mind at rest than taking Leary down personally.Malkovich is a volatile presence - not simply combustible on screen but often a changeable actor too. This is one of his good films, focused and playing director Petersen's game. Eastwood is too old but a) the audience don't care, cos it's him and b) his age is written into the script, not only in the narrative but also as a recurring joke. Pretty much as you'd expect but well-handled. 7/10</fullReview>

I thought that Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked good in the attire they wore at the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved to toy with Frank by phone. He looked good in the tuxedo he wore near the end of the film, though. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the entire cast and crew did an outstanding job, I loved the setting, and I couldn't get enough of it.

		<shortDescription>One of the more intelligent political thrillers of the nineties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the cinema, as in most areas of life, one occasionally comes across some strange coincidences. Two years after "Dances with Wolves", one of the two great Westerns of the early nineties, Kevin Costner, its director and star, appeared in "The Bodyguard", a film about a former Secret Service agent named Frank who is haunted by guilt following the assassination attempt on President Reagan and who now has to try and prevent another assassination. A year after the other great Western of the early nineties, "Unforgiven", its director and star Clint Eastwood appeared in "In the Line of Fire", a film about a Secret Service agent named Frank who is haunted by guilt following the assassination of President Kennedy and who now has to try and prevent another assassination.There are, of course, differences between the two films. In "The Bodyguard" Costner's character, Frank Farmer, has left the Secret Service and now works as a private bodyguard for a female showbiz star. Eastwood's character, Frank Horrigan, still works for the Service. Whereas Farmer is still a comparatively young man, Horrigan is an elderly man approaching retirement, worried about whether he is still physically fit enough to cope with the demands of the job. (Eastwood was sixty-three at the time). Just as "Unforgiven" was Eastwood's final entry in the Western genre in which he made his name in the fifties and sixties, so he seemed to be using "In the Line of Fire" and "A Perfect World" (made in the same year) as his farewell to the cop thriller, another genre which he had come to make his own in the seventies and eighties.In "In the Line of Fire", Horrigan must thwart a plot to murder the current President by an assassin. There is also a sub-plot about a growing romance between Horrigan and a younger female colleague, Lilly Raines. (Rene Russo, thirty-nine at the time the film was made, was often regarded in the nineties as one of Hollywood's "glamorous older women", but this did not prevent her from being cast here as the love-interest of a man old enough to be her father).This may seem like the plot of an ordinary political thriller. Although there is plenty in the way of thrills and excitement, it is raised above the level of the ordinary by Wolfgang Petersen's taut direction and by the standards of acting, particularly the duel between Eastwood and John Malkovich as the assassin, who calls himself "Booth", after the murderer of President Lincoln. Unlike the real John Wilkes Booth, however, this man is no political fanatic. He is a psychopathic former CIA operative named Leary with no ideological motive for killing the President, who always remains an anonymous figure. (We never learn whether he is a Republican or Democrat, or even his name). Leary's motivation seems to be taedium vitae, a belief in the purposelessness of life and a desire for notoriety at all costs, even the cost of his own life, and he gets a thrill out of taunting Horrigan (to whom he has announced his intention to assassinate the President) and playing psychological mind-games with him. He knows that Horrigan's weakness is his sense of guilt stemming from the Kennedy assassination, and plays on it ruthlessly. Malkovich plays him as intelligent but unhinged, at times insinuating, at others raving, and he contrasts strongly with Eastwood's decent but haunted Horrigan. The result is one of the more intelligent political thrillers of the nineties, on a par with Eastwood's later effort, "Absolute Power". 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest movies I have viewed...Good script, original plot of a man who is haunted about JFK's assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that Cold November day in 1963. Thirty years later another anti-social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner along the way,to the crazed gunmen who schemes,lies and murders anybody in his path who'll stand in his way of his mission. The movie accompanies with a great memorable score,and a restrained but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood....which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. Malchovich is great,sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played,but how many could acted with such craftiness,and intellect that he displayed in the movie?Needless to say,I thought this was a great movie...everytime it's on television I have to watch it..and I own it on dvd! I'm a big Eastwood fan,this only boosted his already fabulous career,and Malchovich's best role to date!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On my all time top five list of action movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen quite a few action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever! There are very few films which I even consider watching several times and this is one of them. Everything in this movie is just right: Clint as the superb leading actor, Rene Russo as his non-stupid female partner(this is a very rare combination - sad,but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his excellent villain but let us not overlook Eastwood`s initial buddy, played by Dylan Mcdermott, who in my view fits the role perfectly.The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but sadly never released on an original soundtrack CD (shame on the producers!). The plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace, the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich. I give this one 10 Stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was watching the Perfect Storm, and thought about another Wolfgang Peterson film which is much better--this one. Although certainly not based on a true story, In the Line of Fire is how a movie should be made. It has a terrific story with a great cast. Malkovich won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served all too well. Eastwood is good as the tortured Secret Service and Russo is easy on the eyes. If you haven't seen this, definitely rent it or buy it as I did. Definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In the Line of Fire" is an absorbing and entertaining political thriller, extremely well-acted, technically excellent and directed with cool professionalism.But there is a definite slackness in the pacing, that reminded me of a similar 1973 film, "The Day Of The Jackal". "In The Line of Fire" isn't quite as padded and tedious as that film, but still includes far too many needlessly extended "crowd scenes" that make it look more convincing, but often result in our boredom, as well. And when Clint Eastwood is the hero, it's fair to say that the ending will be rather predictable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of big, loud, trashy, completely stupid action movies such as The Rock, Con Air etc. All of these are great fun to watch but, when you think about it, extremely silly. IN THE LINE OF FIRE tells a story and it tells it well. With plausibility as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think. The last shot of the movie is Eastwood and Russo sitting together on the steps of the White house watching the pigeons to gentle, peaceful music and I felt a deep feeling of satisfaction. This was because I cared about the characters and I was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion. It felt like a true story. As the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that he failed to protect JFK on that fateful day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. He brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary. On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich, as the creepy predator who tortures Eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly telling him of his plan to kill the current president. This Oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin. Throughout the movie, Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they are friends. He doesn't threaten him, he doesn't lie to him, he doesn't laugh at him, but he tortures him with his unbearable friendliness right up to the last moment. As well as this thrilling main plot, there is a charming love story involving Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood. Despite the age difference, they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely. To sum up, I love this film because it has a mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Cat And Mouse Game With Some Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leads Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich were both very good in this. As Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan and potential presidential assassin Mitch Leary they play an interesting enough cat and mouse game. The back story has Horrigan as the last surviving member of the detail on duty when President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Already tormented by the memory, he's tormented further by Leary, who toys with him as he openly shares his plan. That interplay is well done, but it does seem to drag on for too long, perhaps because Leary's motive in tormenting Horrigan wasn't especially clear. Why so much obsession with Horrigan? I never really understood that. Why not just seek out the chance to assassinate the president? Another point I wasn't clear on is why Horrigan - clearly aging and out of shape - would be put back on the presidential protection team, against the wishes of the head of the detail? It moves the story forward but honestly makes no sense.The weakest part of the movie revolved around agent Lilly Raines, played by Rene Russo. Russo's performance was fine, but the character didn't hit home with me - especially when a "quasi" romance between Raines and Horrigan was introduced. Why do that? The age difference made it unlikely to say the least. It doesn't really move the story forward at all, but it does seem to detract a bit from the character's credibility. I mean, I can understand Horrigan's interest. Russo is lovely. But I couldn't wrap my head around why Raines would be the least bit interested.After playing the cat and mouse for a couple of hours, it all leads up to an exciting enough climax. All the performances here are fine, but the story seemed to me to be a bit lacking in some ways. (6/10)</fullReview>

John Malcovich plays a great bad guy trying to kill the president of the u.s.a. . Clint plays Frank Horrigan, a secret service agent,, who failed to prevent the Kennedy Assassination,, and John Malcovich,, Mitch Leary knows this,, and he haunts Frank and tortures him throughout the whole movie,, saying why didn't you do more to protect the president you were the only one who didn't react to the first shot. so this time Mitch pretty much leaves a trail of bread crumbs for Frank to find so he can make this game of cat and mouse with our agent easier,, in the end you will just have to watch and see who wins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense and exciting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the Line of Fire" is a very exciting film and works well because the film was well cast and very well written. Clint Eastwood plays an old Secret Service agent whose claim to fame was his being on the detail that protected President Kennedy in Dallas (oops). Not surprisingly, he blames himself for the assassination and although he seems like a great agent, he is imperfect and vulnerable.Out of the blue, a strange threat arises--a would-be assassin (John Malkovich) who announces himself to Eastwood's character! In other words, he tells the Service that he's going to kill the President and taunts them! And throughout the film, the psycho keeps contacting Eastwood--as if they are old friends! What's next? See it for yourself.While I am pretty sure a Secret Service agent would watch this film and spot a few flaws, for the average Joe, it seems pretty tight and well made. My only quibble was the notion in one scene where the agent (Eastwood) did NOT kill the killer when he had a chance because he knew he'd die in the process. My assumption is a real agent wouldn't even think about this. Perhaps I am wrong. But, it did make for good viewing--as did all the film. Plus, using an old guy like Eastwood worked because his age was figured into the plot--not some old guy pretending to be a lot younger than he really is. Well done.By the way, if you get a chance, watch "In the Line of Fire: The Ultimate Sacrifice"--a special feature on the DVD for the film. It talks about how the Secret Service worked with the crew to make sure the details in the film were correct. Fascinating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS*** Having the unenviable distinction to be the only Secret Service Agent to lose a president to an assassin's bullet Frank Horrigan's, Clint Eastwood, life has been a living hell since that faithful November day in Dallas Texas. That's when President John F. Kennedy was gunned down with him not being able to take the bullet that was meant for the president. In the 30 years since that tragic event in American history Horrigan had lost his wife who left him with the couples daughter and hit the bottle hard becoming an out and out drunk and given undercover field duty in him being unable to do his high profile job in protecting the resident of the United State. Unknow to Horrigan he'll soon be given another chance to redeem himself in the most unexpected way. And with that be able put his shattered life back together again if he's willing to accept the consequences.It's former CIA assassin and now deranged and loose cannon psycho Mitch Leary,John Mankovich,who gives Harrigan the chance he's been looking for all these years. In Leary planning to assassinate the now,in 1992, president of the United States Harry code-name Travler, Jim Curley, and give him a chance to prevent that from happening by taking the bullet meant for him; like the one he didn't takes when President Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas some 30 years ago!With Leary who calls himself Booth, After Abraham Lincoln assassin John Wilks Booth, food spooning Agent Horrigan all the clues in his attempted assassination of the president he's soon put back on his old job in protecting the president who's to be assassinated ,according to Leary,during an election campaign stop in L.A. at the Bonaventure Hotel. And it's at the Bonaventure Hotel that agent Horrigan will have to prove that he's got what it takes to protect the president by taking it on the chin or in the gut from Leary's concealed, under his tuxedo, handgun.The film "In the Line of Fire" preceded by some ten years a very similar Clint Eastwood movie "Blood Work" with Eastwood playing a retired cop, who's undergone open heart surgery, who attracted the attention on the man who caused him to go under the knife by having a heart attack in chasing him. And it's that person who later became Clint's biggest admirer in keeping him alive by having him obtain baldy need blood transfusions from people that he murdered with Clint's very rare blood type! In this movie Leary in fact helps Clint,or Agent Horrigan, redeem himself in saving the president's life and earlier in the film even ends up saving Clint's! ***SPOILERS***Leary as crazy as he is does Agent Horrigan a big favor in that he really doesn't expect to survive in all this but does expect Clint to redeem himself. As Leary later points out in a phone recorded message that he left, like a last will and testament, in his shabby hotel room for Horrigan and his pretty secret agent woman partner Lilly Raines,Rene Russo, to find. Despite being in his 60's at the time the film was made Clint Eastwood is in as good as shape as he was in any of his "Dirty Harry" movies. Hard and trim and looking at least 10 to 15 years younger it was hard to believe that he was within a few years of collecting his senior citizen or Social Security check.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie's greatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". He captures this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough.Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!</fullReview>

This time around Clint Eastwood is a secret service agent who failed to protect JFK on that fateful day in Dallas in 1963. Agent Frank Horrigan(Eastwood) has never forgiven himself for not preventing Kennedy's death. Years later he is taunted by a man calling himself Boothe, as in John Wilkes Boothe, Lincoln's killer. John Malkovich is identified as Boothe and he and Eastwood play cat and mouse the rest of the way with some of the best dialog of any character I've ever seen.

		<shortDescription>A decent political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspense. History. Conspiracy. It's the perfect trifecta for your typical political thriller, which is what In the Line of Fire is. It's directed by Wolfgang Peterson, a German director who hit his highest mark in 1981 with Das Boot, a thrilling story about soldiers stranded in a German U-Boat during WWII. In the Line of Fire won't be the most memorable film you'll ever see, but it's a good film regardless. In it, Clint Eastwood plays Frank Horrigan, a long time member of the Secret Service who was alongside President John F. Kennedy when he was assassinated. Frank has always been haunted by this, and those fears really come back to life when a psychotic and elusive man named Mitch Leary, played excellently by John Malkovich, contacts him and tells him he plans on assassinating the current president. Frank makes it his mission to catch this nutcase and protect the president at all costs as he campaigns around the country. As a whole this movie falls just short of great, but still in the range of well worth watching.An entire movie from the perspective of the Secret Service agents is something I haven't seen much of, so that was one of the most interesting things about this film. Most of the characters in this film are given very human qualities, breaking the mold of the robotic, stoic Secret Service character stereotype. This is a film that shows the inner workings of the Secret Service and some of the conspiracy that goes on within the service. Eastwood's character makes the film the most interesting, as he is someone who wants to defend his own reputation and disprove the theories that he doesn't have what it takes anymore, while also showing undivided loyalty to protecting the president. He is obviously a man who has devoted his life to his job and also someone who, ever since that fateful day in Dallas 1963, has been trying to prove himself worthy and put his past behind him. Eastwood plays the character at just the right level of remorse, intensity, and respect.Undoubtedly the most interesting character of the film, however, is John Malkovich's Mitch Leary. His character is excellent and truly menacing. Malkovich is an odd looking guy, as we all know, and he uses his strange appearance to become much creepier for this role. He is the kind of subdued, passive-aggressive psychopath who you can never feel completely comfortable watching. His dialouge is written fantastically, riddle with double entendres, parallel structure, and darkly insightful proverbs. He makes for the best moments of the film and his character is what draws in most of the emotion of the film, especially alongside Eastwood and the relationship that develops between those two characters. Leary wants to be remembered and he wants to be written into history, never to be forgotten. He drags Frank into the mix in order to share his experience with someone else on the presidents side. He's a true psycho, making his character a lot of fun to watch operate.In the Line of Fire is a good movie, but when looked at in the overall spectrum of political thrillers, it isn't something very revolutionary or groundbreaking. The story is fun, despite some kinks such as a romantic subplot that is awkward and serves no real purpose to the main storyline. The characters are fun and their dialouge is written very well, making for a consistently exciting two hours of film. Eastwood and Malkovich are fantastic and the interactions between their characters are the most intriguing and interesting thing about this movie. But the movie seems to lack a certain umph that is needed to make a movie memorable. I don't regret watching the movie, but I feel like I'll forget about this one within a week. It's something different, fun, and an entertaining two hour escape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Crazy Malkovich!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly an engaging film. We have two entities. One is Clint Eastwood's Secret Service agent who is carrying around a great deal of baggage. He was in Dallas when JFK was assassinated and felt he should have taken the bullet. The other is the psychotic (and totally magnificent) John Malkovich, who takes it upon himself to torment the man and exert his own power. There is a gradual union of the two personalities who parry and thrust their way through each intense day. There is a third adversary, which is the Secret Service itself, which sees Eastwood as a loose cannon and an incompetent. Some of this is true, but they also don't see the forest for the trees when it comes to the danger to the President. It evolves into a chess match with a real twist. I won't throw a spoiler in here, but something occurs to create even greater conflict for Eastwood. The pacing and tight plotting of this film are quite good and we care about the people. There's a touch and go romantic thing, but it doesn't play into the real issues of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wolfgang Petersen's 'In The Line Of Fire' is a taut thriller, that keeps it's viewer interested from start to end. Some thrillers remain true to the genre, and this box-office super-hit is one of those films!The film is about a psychopath who attempts to assassinate the President of the United States and the Secret Service agent who tracks him. 'In The Line Of Fire' grabs your attention from the very start. The conversations between the Agent and the Psychopath are superb, one can state those sequences as the mainstay of the film. The climax, also, is absorbing and leaves a major impact.Petersen's direction is fantastic. He's at his best over-here. Jeff Maguire's screenplay is terrific, placed with memorable dialog. John Bailey's Cinematography is perfect, he captures each frame neatly.In the acting department, Clint Eastwood is stunning. The Living Legend plays his part with style and grace. Without a doubt, one of his best works. John Malkovich is marvelous as the menace. He sinks his teeth into the part and brings it out with flying colors. Dylan McDermott is another topper; he's superb all through. Rene Russo looks angelic, as always, her performance is just right. Gary Cole is very good. John Mahoney does his bit well.On the whole, 'In The Line Of Fire' works big time and comes up a winner! Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tussle between the Bodyguard and the Assassin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is s superbly crafted top-notch Washington thriller directed by the talented Wolfgang Petersen with hotshot screenwriter Jeff Maguire (who seems to have done very little over the years, so maybe he tends his roses). The film has Clint Eastwood as an ageing secret service agent and John Malkovich as a vengeful assassin pitted against each other in a massive test of wills and ingenuity, where the President's life is at stake. Unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost dooms the President, which is an authentic touch. This film was made when both Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. Probably Eastwood has never done a better job than he does here, and it is all so effortless for the old pro. There are some wonderful sound effects of him huffing and puffing as he runs along beside the President's car as a bodyguard, for which he is too old. I wonder if anyone else noticed the humour of those noises having been added. My 'guardian angel', whose name is Vigil, enjoyed this movie even more than I did, but then bodyguard movies are very much his thing. Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls for Eastwood, as she is so unobvious but so talented, and she shines. The tension is taut every inch of the way in this story, and the psychological struggles of Eastwood to redeem himself from an earlier protection failure are beautifully shown by his typical understated acting. With Eastwood, if he lifts an eyebrow by a millimeter, watch out! Of course, he is the master of the super-cool. Malkovich has the opportunity to indulge all the creepiness he could wish in the paranoid character he portrays, and he captures the man's central vanity to perfection. What a good 'un.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Hollywood film. The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. This film will not change the world. However, it is well-made, well-plotted, and well-acted, which counts for a lot.It's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former-CIA assassin who feels betrayed chasing a Secret Service agent who was protecting John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992-or certainly in contemporary America, this would-be assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance) has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the President. He imagines he has common cause with Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood at his cool, calm, good-naturedly grouchy best) who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the Warren Commission, blamed Horrigan-unfairly, Leary believes-for the assassination of President Kennedy. The tension is ratcheted up through some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary wanting to keep Horrigan close but not to betray his location and plans.Rene Russo is excellent as Lily Raines a fellow agent with whom Horrigan develops a grown- up relationship. It is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Russo is a fair deal younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe-to-toe with the quick-witted Horrigan in friendly banter. It is a nice part for Russo, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man. The acting by the leads, Wolfgang Peterson's competent direction, the thoughtful use of music in plot development, and excellent cinematography make this a film I can watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood nails a nineties thriller and makes it a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I have a biased opinion on this film. First of all I am an Eastwood fanatic...I love the man...he's amazing. I am also a Kennedy fanatic so the content of the film made it even more interesting to me because they did an incredible job of using The Kennedy Assassination as a back story to this one. Still the film is really well done and technically speaking done on a relatively low budget considering some of the shots they create. But if you watch the special features on the film you'll see that they used a lot of computer graphics to simulate casts of thousands, and used old Bill Clinton speech crowds for their President speech crowds. It's flawlessly done and you'd never know it unless you were really looking. The film is not about the backdrop, it's a character study from two very different perspectives. You have an aging Secret Service agent, divorced, left alone, alcoholic, constantly haunted by the fact that he was too slow to save President Kennedy in 1963. He doesn't whip himself into shape...he's old...and he looks old and acts tired and that is exactly what he is. Then you have the flip side of the coin where you have an angry, driven, assassin trained by the United States who wants nothing more than to give his life to end the President's life. It's cat and mouse, and it's psychological and just really interesting to watch.Clint Eastwood is a god. I mean the man never changes his performances much...his performance in In The Line of Fire as secret service agent Frank Horrigan is a more tired and broody version of Dirty Harry but somehow he does something with his characters. You see something in his eyes where he just draws you into his character and makes you believe it and become a part of it and that's exactly what he does here. He has unparalleled screen presence! John Malkovich, who I am rarely a fan of, is incredible as the creepy and disturbed killer Mitch Leary. He is a master of disguise and that is no figure of speech because he has to change his appearance so drastically and so many times and does it realistically and amazingly!! On top of that so much of his performance is done over the phone or just his voice and he creates this incredible character that you almost feel compassion for at times. Best of all his character and Eastwood's character have incredible chemistry and are the perfect adversaries. A statement commonly made but I could have done without Rene Russo. Her character didn't have a lot of depth or reason other than as a rather ridiculous love interest for Eastwood's Horrigan and the two of them didn't really go very well together anyways. Russo had this habit in the nineties of showing up with every leading man you could possibly think of. This is one performance that was unnecessary.Director Wolfgang Petersen definitely has a talent for combining action with a really good story that draws you in. I think he is probably one of the more intelligent action directors given films like Air Force One, this one, and Troy...I was NOT a fan of his Poseidon remake but every great artist stumbles sometime. In the Line of Fire is just simply a great cat and mouse mystery, thriller with a little bit of action and other than the love interest they don't try to force Eastwood to be younger than he is because his character calls for a world weary character and that is what he is. Some definite edge of your seat moments mixed with a really good story and if you haven't seen it you'll wanna check it out because it is definitely worthwhile!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I've seen of Wolfgang Petersen's films has been pretty good. He knows how to direct action, create suspense and get you interested. Eastwood tends to be great, sometimes excellent. This goes for both his acting and his directing. They both hand in solid work here. The concept isn't bad, and the cat-and-mouse game works well. Malkovich performs rather well, and his and Eastwood's playing off each other adds to the film. I suppose this won't introduce anything new, really... but it never really claims to, nor needs to. It's two great actors, each playing a basic type of role that they have proved at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well, and with a magnificent director at the helm. Really, it's entertaining, well-done, and it just plain delivers. Editing and cinematography are good. Acting and character writing is, as well. The film manages to be suspenseful and intense, and if you let yourself, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are superior films out there. The pacing is pretty much spot-on. I recommend this to any fan of the principal actors, the director and/or this type of film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Line of Fire is not the first film to tackle political/presidential assassinations but its enlivened by the excellent ensemble cast director Wolfgang Petersen has assembled. I especially liked it because unlike most thrillers nowadays, it actually accomplished what it sets out to do. It had me thrilled from start to finish.Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) was there when Kennedy was shot. November 22nd is a date that's haunted him every day since. Not only because he failed to save the President, but he failed to take the bullet meant for the President.In the 30 years since, Frank has battled a drinking problem, lingering doubts in his own abilities, and the pain of a divorced wife and daughter. But on the date of the current President's reelection, he receives a chilling message from an anonymous caller stating his intentions to kill the President. And so spurs Frank into action, not wanting another dead President on his conscience.I suppose In the Line of Fire isn't terribly original, but Wolfgang Petersen's sure touch and fine direction gives the film a considerable charge. And although he handles the thriller aspects well enough, he makes sure there are other forms of pleasure to be had from the film.Eastwood gets a love interest in the form of fellow agent Lilly Raines, played by Rene Russo. And she holds her own quite well against Eastwood. Their gentle flirtations are surprisingly involving considering the subject matter of the rest of the film. It's nice to see an action thriller for once taking something like that into consideration without it detracting from the main thrust of the story.Eastwood slides into the role of a grizzled, world-weary veteran agent with total ease. But what separates Frank Horrigan from another of Clint's Dirty Harry impersonations is the fact that the man has a softer side. All because he hesitated when Kennedy was killed. We even get to see Clint cry in one of his weaker moments. Clint Eastwood is one of Hollywood's unsung celebrities, because he never shows a hint of pretension or vanity.And Petersen has supplied Eastwood with a worthy adversary. The very underrated John Malkovich is just brilliant as Mitch Leary, the ex-CIA assassin who plays intricate mind games with Horrigan. Malkovich being the exceptional method actor that he is gets to try on various disguises to stay one step ahead of Horrigan.The psychological games Leary comes up with to torment Horrigan are given considerable gravitas by Malkovich. He comes across as a concerned friend and then a cold blooded killer at the drop of a hat.Petersen never allows things to slow down for too long. He gives the characters time to breathe in between the inevitable plot mechanics, but there is considerable excitement to be had from watching the agents pin down Leary's trail. There's never a dull moment.And the cast do an admirable job avoiding the predictability that comes with the genre. As well as Rene Russo's tough and forthright performance, Dylan McDermott does nicely as Frank's partner Al. It's a slightly generic role. The young pup who gets in over his head, but McDermott is a charming enough actor to make you warm to him. All the more so when he meets a tragic end.John Mahoney (taking time out from my favourite sitcom Frasier) adds warmth and geniality to Frank's boss Sam. Then there's Gary Cole who has a tricky part to play. A cocky, snot-nosed agent who tolerates Frank, and doesn't always listen when it might have made a difference. Still, Cole understands the difficulty in playing such a role, and ensures the character never gets too annoying.The only real black mark on ITLOF is Fred Dalton Thompson's White House Chief of Staff. It's like Wolfgang Petersen couldn't resist including at least one stock, generic character. In this case, a pompous, self important politician only interested in the President's image. Thompson is too good an actor to be lumbered with such a one-dimensional character.But elsewhere, ITLOF is a film that's very difficult to find fault with. There are wonderful gems to be found as Wolfgang Petersen's inexorable direction moves towards its inevitable conclusion. The night of the Presidential election.It builds to a final showdown between Frank and Leary within the confines of an elevator. But its good stuff all the same. And Malkovich brings such fascinating dimensions and excellent dialogue to Leary that his final message to Frank is surprisingly sympathetic and even feels honest.In the Line of Fire is by far Wolfgang Petersen's best film. Its a template for the perfect thriller. One that keeps your pulse racing, but lets it slow for the intelligence to shine through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really surprised me! I didn't expect much of this movie. The acting is really excellent! Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo and, especially, John Malkovic are doing an excellent job. John Malkovic is very convincing as a killer. Clint Eastwood does a good job as police officer, he combines intense serious acting with every now and then a funny joke! Director Wolfgang Petersen does a good job with a few scenes that are excellent! Sometimes the atmosphere of the film is too much like a Clint Eastwood police film, but overall the direction is good. Only the last scene could have taken a little longer. I thought the movie ended a bit abrupt. But overall this is a movie that is worth watching because of the marvelous acting and because of the direction by Wolfgang Petersen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My experience as a walk on extra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a an interesting story I feel is worth telling. I was just married, and in my early 20's stationed at Naval Hospital Bethesda Maryland in 1992. My wife had just moved from back home in Michigan to be with me. Not long after she arrived the two of us decided to take the subway in to Washington D.C. (Bethesda is a suburb of D.C.) to go to the museums, monuments, etc... We were walking near the old post office when I spotted the motor cade. Very excited, I looked around the corner and saw a large crowd of people standing on the side of the road waving American flags waiting for the president in office at the time (George Bush Sr.)to pass by. My wife and I ran to get a spot right near the curb so we could see the president. As the motor cade approached us it stopped. Then the man in the car (President?), and a couple secret service agents come to the crowd right in front of us. I looked up, and couldn't believe my eye's. I was looking right at Clint Eastwood standing in front of me. I pointed at him and said "That's Clint Eastwood", as if no one else around me knew, LOL. Then I looked up, and saw a big crane in the street filming a live scene in a movie. It must have been an open set. We stayed for 2 more takes, and left. Several months later we saw previews of what we knew was "our Movie" LOL, and went to see it at the theater. Just like we had hoped we were in that scene, and are easily visible in the crowd close up right where we were standing. The surprise, and excitement of that whole experience was great. So, the next time you watch that scene, look for a white male with a flat top haircut looking extremely surprised (just good acting), lol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The person responsible for writing the storyline to this great movie must be a outstanding teller of tales. In my job as a teacher I tell stories to the kids direct from my imagination. I try to get the kids pondering what the next twist will be. This film does exactly that. John Malkovich plays one of the best "bad guy" roles in the last 30 years, a real credit as lots of his other roles are not of this genre. His portrayal as Lennie in "Of Mice &amp; Men" seems light years away from the psychopath he brings to the screen here. The role played by Clint Eastwood is straight out of his "Dirty Harry" days but the romantic aspect, played very convincingly by Russo, bring s a new dimension to Clint and saves the film to some degree. There are plenty of films depicting cops dealing with nutters, some involve protecting heads of state but none come close to the drama which unfolds in front of the viewer. This is another gem which failed to make the box office ring over big time, here in Oz anyway,and will be shown on late night free to air telly. When talk is made of Clint's movies this title will be overlooked in favour of "Harry" and a few westerns (all good films by the way). When the same talk is made of Malkovich films however, along with "Mice" this one should be a standout. A thriller from go to whoa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have Clint Eastwood, walking the line between a very cool and funny performance. The comic timing is excellent in this, but is in no way a comedy. It's pure suspense, a trademark of director Wolfgang Peterson.This is one of those rare films where the old man and much, much younger woman relationship works. Well, maybe not entirely realistic, but the sparks between Eastwood and the stunning Reno Russo seem real enough. It had me convinced. Score one for the old timers! Let's see, there's Eastwood, Connery, Newman, Redford, etc.The real tension in this movie comes from the phone calls between Eastwood and Malkovich (an excellent performance by an always superb actor). It's just fun to watch the two of them pushing each others buttons. Malkovich at first, then Eastwood, with the classic, "You have a rendezvous with my ass, motherf******!". God, I love that, and Malkovich's response.Eastwood, Malkovich, and Russo. Three actors who hit all the right notes in this one. Oh, and Dylan McDermont is kinda funny as Eastwoods partner, the "Wow, I have a wife and kids and I sure do have a lot to look forward too and a long life ahead of me.... wait a minute, i'm a movie cliche! Help!", you know where this is going....Great flick. Check it out. Chicks don't get Clint like the fellas so, don't question his appeal, ladies. Just take our word for it, the guy is a god. 9/10 stars. G'night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even at 62 years of age, Clint Eastwood still has what it takes to be in a successful action thriller such as this. Not only was he in an action movie, he did very well. I really enjoyed the film from start to finish because of Eastwood and the villain played by John Malkovich.This is about an aging Secret Service guy who is haunted by his past. That past urges him to keep the current President safe at all costs with election nearing. Even if that means playing a cat-and-mouse game with someone who wants to kill the President.As I said previously, Eastwood did very well. Even better is John Malkovich. I can't decide on who plays the better villain, Malkovich or Gary Oldman. But anyway, Malkovich is very creepy as the villain.Overall, this is a top-notch thriller. There are plenty of action, thrills, and even a little romance. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Action-Adventure Thrillers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love action/adventure films and this is one of the best. Of course, we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but its the story that really counts. The best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little "over the top" as in the comic book style of action. The more twists and turns, the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film; the more we action/adventure fans enjoy them. "In the Line of Fire" has ALL the elements required for a rip-roaring action thriller. It has Clint Eastwood as a near-retirement Secret Service Agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him. It has one of the most evil, despicable, maniacal villains in John Malkovich, the type in which you can't wait to see him, "get his due". It has Rene Russo as the 'love interest.' It has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. It is extremely well paced by director Wolfgang Petersen and even has a score by the great Ennio Morricone. This one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller! Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood against Malkovich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many times big screen has tried to show the hazards of American presidents´lives. Although the risk is real, sometimes it is overemphasized as if the security would have been often inefficient. Personally I doubt it. So the plot prepared by the director Wolfgang Petersen is just a good fiction for entertainment. The film has two good actors, Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich backed by that attractive lady, Rene Russo, whose charm is always present. Expressed in a simple way, this film was the hunt of a cat (Eastwood) against the intelligent mouse (Malkovich), where the latter wanted for unclear reasons to kill the president of USA. After so many efforts Eastwood saved the live of the president and caught the cat Malkovich. However, it was a curiosity to see how the bodyguards of the president moved and how they protected him, which confirmed me that it is not so easy for any killer to be so close to the president of USA. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining to a certain extent, but I wouldn't give it more than a "3" or "3.5" out of 5...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They're going to write books about us, Frank." - John Malkovich, "In the Line of Fire."I feel like trying something new for a change. Let's summarize the movie at face value and go on with the critique later: "In the Line of Fire" is a pretty routine thriller that entertains to a certain extent, but never really takes off like it should. Sure, it's recommendable, but compared to some other recent thrillers, and the potential this one had, it fails to deliver.It has to do, in part, with the Kennedy assassination, and a cat and mouse game that never really takes off like it should between an ex-assassin named Mitch (John Malkovich) and a Secret Service Agent, Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood), a man who was guarding John F. Kennedy on the tragic day so long ago. Frank is not haunted by the past and determined to stop his new adversary as a way of revisiting his past.It is the re-election of 1992. The US President is parading around the nation delivering speeches and interviews. This is when Frank receives a disturbingly wicked call from Mitch, who threatens to kill the President. His motive? The US Government has screwed him over. He wants revenge.Mitch was a trained assassin whom the government tried to get rid of. Now he wants revenge and he is out to prove his point by killing the great nation's leader. Mitch insists that he and Frank are alike. Frank took the blame for the Kennedy assassination even though he was the one who recommended advanced security. There was an assassination attempt on Mitch even though he is an assassin. Perhaps "Ironic Assassinators" would have been a better title for this film. But then with a title like that it probably would have been a straight-to-video release with Kris Kristofferson or something. Anyhow, Frank denies that they have any connection. The phrase, "We're not so different, you and I" has never held a greater meaning.Mitch has a pretty neat technique--he can alter his appearences almost as well as Jamie Kennedy. He can be a street bum, an overweight businessman, or he can bear a striking resemblance to John Malkovich, so much so that he should win a Special Achievment Oscar for the category Best John Malkovich Lookalike. (And on another note, I'm starting to get tired of John Malkovich -- once he had a movie named after him I knew there would be no turning back.)Because of Mr. Malkovich's impressive facial alterations, Mr. Eastwood has a pretty hard time nailing him. Even when Mitch calls he has a super-cool device that diverts the tracking systems the police use to a random number. Correct me if I'm wrong: This device cannot possibly be built? If it could be, we'd have seen it in a million other movies by now, trust me.Rene Russo comes in for a bit of love interest in the movie (attractive female Secret Service Agent -- how convenient!). She's in her thirties, Clint's in his sixties. They kiss and snuggle and she acts like he's some sort of Brad Pitt or Colin Farrell youngin', flaunting him off to her friends like she got some major catch. Yeah, maybe he would have been the catch of the week thirty years ago, lady - but something tells me a young woman like herself wouldn't be attracted to an old guy like him who could be her father. Perhaps it is his giant skin bubbles she finds so attractive? I'm through talking about this. Clint Eastwood is often considered the thinking man's action hero. He's getting older now - he was 63 then and 73 now - but the films stay the same. This is Dirty Harry with a touch of irony. And it really all depends on if you like Clint, because this is his movie. Malkovich gives a splendidly dark performance as a sicko assassin but the film relies on good ol' Clint for life support. And this movie is just about to go under. It's time to get a new brand of life support devices or we're going to have the worst disaster since "Titanic" -- er, the event, not the movie. Nevermind.3/5 stars (recommended) -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No doubt Wolfgang Petersen's best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have the courage to predict that "In the line of fire" will remain in the books of movie history as Clint Eastwood's last movie under the guidance of another director, in this case Wolfgang Petersen. Since this one Clint has directed every film he's starred in and I'm sure he will do so also in the future years. But I guess you'll never know for sure what's going to happen.Nevertheless, there's no doubt brilliant cooperation of Petersen and Eastwood gave birth to German director's finest achievement. What would be a better movie from him? Unfortunately I haven't seen "Das Boot", it might be better. But let's see, "Outbreak" was a pretty nice little flick but not far as good as this. "Air force one", his other "presidential thriller" wasn't even half as good and effective as "In the line of fire". I don't think if it's even necessary to mention his amusing fantasy movie "The Neverending story". Well, I liked it when I was a kid.But hey, "In the line of fire" is so different from anything he's done before and after, I mean it's something phenomenal. The fantastic role of Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan is alongside with William Munny ("Unforgiven"), Luther Whitney ("Absolute power") and Steve Everett ("True crime") one of the most memorable of Eastwood's classic performances of the 90's. John Malkovich is also magnificent in perhaps his most famous and celebrated psycho role.Screen chemistry of these two incredible actors is enjoyable to watch and dialogue is marvelous - especially in the phone call scenes. "In the line of fire" has huge amount of splendid moments. Scene where Clint is hanging on the edge of the roof and points his gun at Malkovich's mouth who's only trying to help him is a classic and so is the elevator scene in the end of the film. If you still haven't seen this excellent, exciting and highly suspenseful motion picture I can only state that you've missed one of the most terrific thrillers of the early 90's. So do something about it and do it fast. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slightly over-the-hill Secret Service Agent for the U.S. President is contacted over the phone by a would-be assassin who baits the team-veteran with knowledge of his spotty success record; it all leads to a showdown in Los Angeles where the President is campaigning for re-election. Cat-and-mouse thriller stars Clint Eastwood as the raspy-voiced, piano-playing hero who doesn't seem to have anyone backing him up. This film, in fact, makes the Secret Service unit look especially inept. When a fellow agent tells Eastwood, "You have to give the rest of us some credit", it's rather a laughable request since there is never an agent around (besides Eastwood and his partner) when one is needed. As the disguise-laden psychotic, John Malkovich trots all over the country without hesitation, and is always in the right spot (undetected) at the right time. Talking in an intentionally wet, mushy voice (like a rejected homosexual), Malkovich doesn't give us a new spin on the proverbial villain/nutcase role, and the feeble attempts to flesh out his character with background information just makes things worse. Eastwood is more affable than usual, but the unimaginative screenplay from Jeff Maguire features a rote finale and some especially ludicrous lines of dialogue. ** from ****</fullReview>

Kennedy, but did not respond to the shots, and as he was the closer bodyguard, this still haunts him. One day he receives a call from a crazed stalker and trained army assassin, calling himself Booth, and threatens to kill the president. Now Frank along with the department, including Secret Service Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo), are trying to find this assassin, real name Mitch Leary (a sensational performance from John Malkovich).Frank also gets onto the team that protects the current President (Jim Curley). There are some great chase sequences, near catches and complications to ending the whole thing, including a great scene where Frank could kill Mitch, but fall to his death, and his partner Secret Service Agent Al D'Andrea (Miracle on 34th Street's Dylan McDermott) is killed as a result. The final scenes at a conference with the President is most gripping, seeing if Frank can make it and save the leader, and seeing if disguised Mitch can succeed in killing him with his own made gun. Also starring Gary Cole as Secret Service Presidential Detail Agent-In-Charge Bill Watts, John Mahoney as Secret Service Director Sam Campagna, Gregory Alan Williams as Secret Service Agent Matt Wilder and Saw's Tobin Bell as Mendoza.Doesn't get any better, I give it a solid 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To date, this is the last film Clint has starred in that was not directed by him. But if you're going to work with the best, why not work with Petersen? That logic appears to be sound, as this film is one of the more seamless dramas Eastwood has done. Everything fits, from the opening scenes as an undercover agent to relationship with John Mahoney to the interaction with John Malkovich. The love relationship between him and Rene Russo is neither forced nor overly romantic, but the feeling blends perfectly into the resolution of the film. Fred Dalton Thompson is not stranger to political roles, but might have played this one with a little more panache. Overall, this film is well-written and directed, plays well to the adult audience, and leaves a favorable impression, like going to a good restaurant on a night when the chef has gone all out. You leave satisfied, and plan to come back again. Rated R for violence and language, this film is not for the preteens, and while the teens would not be shocked at the violence, they probably won't want to watch a bunch of "old people" for 128 minutes. Their loss is our gain. Collectible for the Eastwood fans, and anyone who enjoys a good suspense film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood And Malkovich Elevates This Secret Service Thriller Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Line of Fire is a thriller about a disillusioned and obsessed former CIA agent that attempts to assassinate the President of the United States and the Secret Service agent who seeks redemption that tracks him. It stars Clint Eastwood as Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and John Malkovich as the former CIA agent and assassin Mitch Leary. Horrigan is the sole active-duty Secret Service agent remaining from the detail guarding John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, at the time of his assassination in 1963. Aside from Eastwood and Malkovich,the movie also stars Rene Russo, Dylan McDermott, Gary Cole, John Mahoney, and Fred Dalton Thompson.It was written by Jeff Maguire and directed by Wolfgang Petersen. In the storyline,Frank Horrigan is a U.S. Secret Service agent who keeps thinking back to November 22, 1963, when, as an agent hand-picked by President Kennedy, he became one of the few agents to have lost a president to an assassin.Thirty years later, psychotic Mitch Leary is stalking the current U.S. president running for re-election. He has spent long hours studying the psyche of Frank Horrigan, and he taunts Horrigan (feeling that there is a bond between them), telling him of his plans to kill the president. After his conversation with Leary, Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty. Horrigan has no intention of failing his president this time around, and he is more than willing to take a bullet. But everything goes Leary's way -- he is smart and cagey and the president's aides refuse to alter the itinerary. As the election draws closer, Horrigan's chances to catch Leary look to be less and less a possibility, and he begins to doubt his own abilities -- both now and in the past, when Kennedy was murdered.But in the end,Horrigan redeems himself as he finally was able to protect the current U.S. president from the assassination attempt.Clint Eastwood delivers one of his finest performances as Frank Horrigan.Although the viewer gets a rendezvous of Dirty Harry in terms of being a flawed hero,how he solves the mystery and how he meets with the villain,he was able to allow the viewers to sympathize with him in terms of his doubts,psyche,frustration and need for redemption as a Secret Service agent.Kudos also goes to John Malkovich for his portrayal of a psychopath who definitely was both excellent and outstanding as a villain.Although the movie is both formulaic and predictable,both actors elevates this film about the US Secret Service into a superior thriller especially in their battle of wills.Also,the film is both smart and intelligent in the screenplay despite the fact that everyone knows what to expect in the end.Petersen direction is superb as it the movie never lacks tension nor suspense.If Top Gun is presents what the US Navy is all about,then In Line Of Fire does does it to the US Secret Service.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Line of Fine Fire ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great, fabulous thriller dealing with an obsessed assassin, John Malkovich, is brilliant in a supporting Oscar nominated performance. He was far better than the winner-Tommy Lee Jones in "The Fugitive." Of course, the award should have gone to Ralph Fiennes for his ingenious portrayal of Amon Goeth, in "Schindler's List."Malkovich torments Clint Eastwood on the phone regarding the latter's failure to fully protect the slain JFK in 1963. Since he is a technological genius, Malkovich is able to thwart any of the calls he makes to Eastwood, a really washed up Secret Service Agent. Malkovich conveys a sinister evil character, rarely seen in films today. Eastwood's gravel like voice serves him well as the tormented and frustrated agent.The chase scenes are well done and the ending scene will strike terror into anyone's heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good Clint film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Course, I quote from 1996's "My Fellow American's": "Why don't you go rent "In The Line of Fire" again".This is a very good film.Clint doing another good job with his role.What WAS NOT needed was brining in a possible romance with his &amp; Russo's characters. Unnecessary. Just because we have a woman character film maker makers HAVE to put in a romance.This did nothing to the film, why could they not just be co-workers? Course, repeat scenes we have seen before in films, Clint's partner getting killed. A new idea should have been used. Like him getting hit by a car in a foot chase, something like that.Meaning let us be original.John Mahoney was also good, although his part was not big.Over all, a very good film.</fullReview>

John Malkovich was number 59, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Malkovich was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Eastwood was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.

		<shortDescription>Very good entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the main plot is quite predictable, the way in which it was executed, no pun intended, was sleek and efficient, making the experience worthwhile. Malkovich is convincing as a former CIA operative with grievances against his former employers. The tension of his conflict with Clint was maintained throughout. Their conversations usually terse and to the point to put it mildly. The understated romance between Clint's and Russo's characters was delicately handled and a pleasure to watch unfold. The revelatory scenes of Clint at the bar playing piano were also a nice touch. I should also mention the bonus features on the DVD make the viewer appreciate not only the craftsmanship of the film but also the dedication and sacrifice of our Secret Service men and women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a HUGE fan of Clint Eastwood, I can't help but admit that this movie was way too unrealistic, even for an action film. Clint's character is a bit too weak when compared to toughs like the man with no name or Harry Callahan. The moviewas mildly enjoyable, but so predictable that it never really stirred any suspense in me. There is some action in the film, but for the most part it is stale and expected, making this movie barely meet even the most average of viewer'smovie standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Clint Eastwood Makes A Bomb Now And Then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much wrong with this movie, I hardly know where to begin! We are supposed to believe that an agent too old for his job, and easily winded, would be employed by the secret service in the first place. After that.....the "super cop" stereotypes come fast and furious. Of course Eastwoods character once guarded JFK....and of course, we are told how he was JFK's "favorite agent", and we are told how he...of course, took the blame when JFK was found with a girl in the white house. Everyone is here....the psycho ex CIA assassin over acted by John Malkovitch......the "asshole" Chief Of Staff who seems to be more concerned with poll numbers than a threat to the presidents life, the lead agent who we are supposed to believe thinks that Eastwoods character is "over reacting" to a threat to the presidents life...AFTER he and every other agent have already listened to the psycho's threat on a tapped phone call. And finally......as if we hadn't already figured out the ending 5 minutes into the movie, Eastwoods character ends up saving the Presidents life! By that time, you won't care anyway, because you will be too busy shouting "bullshit" at the screen as one unrealistic scene after the other flashes by. Take a Pass...you'll thank me for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is a pro at playing two versions of himself and versions of himself. First he was The Man with No Name, then he advanced himself from 'High Plains Drifter' to 'Outlaw Josey Wales' to 'Unforgiven'. Here he plays a version of his lesser self--Dirty Harry.This is your only spoiler warning...Petersen resembles John Woo in that he is infatuated with his adopted country. This is his 'Face/Off', complete with typical typecasting. Like so many other films, this one keeps trying to change gears to mask dead ends in the script. Unfortunately, 'The rooftop chase is a stepping stone from 'Vertigo' to 'Matrix'. Ennio uses a similar cue from 'Untouchables' for the scene to show he sees the obvious reference. This is Petersen's first use of Air Force One.Clint's partner gets killed. Who'd have thought?Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all in the execution (in more ways than one)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Line of FireIt never fails to astound me how a decent premise for a film can be ruined upon execution of it. (pun not intended) This was what struck me about 'In the Line of Fire'. The concept sounded excellent - a grizzled secret service agent (Clint Eastwood), still haunted by memories of his inability to prevent the assassination of President Kennedy is now confronted by another madman (John Malkovich) who also claims he intends to dispatch the current president by force. But of course Clint isn't willing to let Malkovich off the president so easily this time, and becomes even more determined to track down the madman and stop him.But unfortunately, the interesting story didn't turn out nearly as well as an actual film. The film is frequently far too obvious when it should have been much more subtle, when explaining things such as how Eastwood's character reflects on whether he would have been willing to die for Kennedy and Malkovich's character's backstory as to why he wants the president dead so much. These would have worked much better if the filmmakers hadn't tried to beat the audience over the head with these plot points, making them much less interesting. Also, whoever decided to put 63 year old Clint Eastwood in a love scene with 39 year old Renne Russo can only be described as sick and twisted, not to mention the two of them falling in love seems ridiculous due to their age gap. (Clint's best seduction technique seems to be winking every 5 seconds, which gets extremely annoying after a brief while) But apart from the terrible script and oversimplified characters, I was also astonished at for a suspense film how little suspense 'In the Line of Fire' actually contained. Again, the concept of the killer constantly phoning the hero, taunting him with clues and hints as to what he's going to do next must have seemed more original when the film was released in 1993, but for today's audiences, who have seen the concept executed much better in films such as 'Speed' and later 'Phone Booth', it really isn't as interesting as the filmmakers seem to think. And the fight scene at the end between Malkovich and Eastwood was one of the film's greatest letdowns, and seems to mainly consist of rude pushing back and forth. Of course, the absurdly predictable plot leads up to the required happy ending, another eye-roller. Eastwood is completely wasted in the role of aged secret service agent Frank Horrigan, playing off his patented tough guy persona and nothing else. He isn't a complete letdown, but it isn't at all difficult to imagine a more enthusiastic lead for the film. Renee Russo is also given almost nothing to do as the far too young love interest for Eastwood's character, complete with cheesy dialogue ("I can't believe I'm doing this!") and all. Dylan McDermott also has almost nothing to do other than yell a lot and look frightened as the necessary young naive partner to Eastwood's grizzled old mentor figure. It's Malkovich as the psychotic assassin who easily steals the film, coming across as genuinely creepy and chilling - his silky voice over the telephone was surprisingly off-putting. Overall, 'In the Line of Fire' comes across as a far too clichéd and predictable weak Hollywood action film and nothing more. There is almost no suspense created in the "suspenseful" sequences, and all the "plot twists" are far too predictable to ever be enjoyable. There is the occasional good element present (Malkovich's villain is a plus) but overall, there's no real reason to see "In the Line of Fire" - there are several other very very similar action movies that turned out much better.-5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before. Not much action in this one though. Again it's about the guy protecting the president. He's macho - as usual, and at the same time soft and melancholic - as usual. Does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president?! And then there's the girl and the usual conservative flirting around. Stereotypical and predictable to the last toe-crumbling minute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a bodyguard for the president who failed to keep one president alive, and then tries to make amends when another is targeted by a super assassin.This could have been very routine, but it was well written, acted, and directed. A lot has been said for the main actors, and they deserve it. Eastwood, as the lead, serves as observer, so his lack of acting ability doesn't get in the way. The minor characters are all exceptional, and one who plays a hunter with only a few seconds of screen time almost steals the show. In fact, all the minor actors are quite exceptional.The super assassin part is even fairly well explained. At least better than most movies. Since everything is so well done, most people are willing to accept this usually ridiculous character.There are a few down sides. In one scene, this supposedly super assassin, an extremist at covering his tracks, kills two witnesses, yet leaves their barking guard dog alive. This highly illogical act is so bizarre, that it does detract the viewer for a long time. It is probably attributable to the kid gloves film makers use with dogs in movies.An average movie, but well done enough to make it a touch above.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to one of the most pathetic, predictable and badly acted films I have ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, never have I seen somebody less convincing on screen. I was laughing at him the whole way through. Then there's this romance kinda thing between him and the gorgeous Rene Russo, which was even more pathetic than the one between Mr.Connery and Ms.Zeta-Jones in Entrapment.One IMDb user posed the question: What's not to like about this film? I'm asking: What is to like about it? And the answer is: John Malkovich. He is an absolute genius and probably the best movie villain ever (He even saved Con Air you know). But that's it. This movie is called In the line of fire, but 'Bodyguard 2: the rip-off' seems to be a more appropriate title. Watch only if you are a die hard John Malkovich fan. Otherwise, avoid at all cost. *1/2(out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Performances Make This Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Line of Fire (1993) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Extremely entertaining film about a secret service agent (Clint Eastwood) who finds himself trying to locate a man (John Malkovich) who plans on assassinating the president. What makes this case so special is that the agent was on the staff of those who letdown Kennedy on that faithful day and this assassin makes it a game trying to compare himself with the agent. I remember when this movie was released many people called it very Dirty Harry like and I guess I'd agree to a point since this agent plays by his own rules just like that famous detective. This is an extremely well made and well acted picture that's certainly gotten better with age thanks in large part to the terrific storyline and strong performances. I also remember quite a few people thinking the film was tasteless because it mixes in this fictional story with a subplot about Eastwood protecting Kennedy the day he was assassinated. Many people found it quite tasteless that they'd take real history and twist it around to fit the story here but I thought it actually added a lot of drama and it really helped stretch out the character played by Eastwood. The actor was just starting his hot period, which amazingly continues today but he delivers a terrific performance and really nails this character. We all know that the actor can play the tough guy like no one else but the screenplay allows him some quieter moments and this is where he really shines. Reliving his feelings about his past mistakes have Eastwood really going for broke and he delivers. Malkovich is also excellent in his part and watching him here you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real psycho with these evil plans. He's just so calm, cool and collective that you can't help but see how truly sick he is. The actor is so good that you just have to look into his eyes to see that cold nature. Rene Russo plays the love interest but she makes the character more than just that and her chemistry with Eastwood makes this subplot work. John Mahoney, Fred Dalton Thompson and Dylan McDermott have supporting roles. IN THE LINE OF FIRE contains quite a bit of suspense as director Wolfgang Petersen does a very good job at building up the cast and mouse game between the agent and the assassin. I think the film works best as a psychological thriller because the best moments aren't really the action scenes but instead the scenes where the two actors are on the phone simply talking to one another. These scenes are so intense and well-handled that you can't help get caught up in everything that's going on.</fullReview>
