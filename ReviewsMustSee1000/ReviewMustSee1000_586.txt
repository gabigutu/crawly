		<shortDescription>Hate Begets Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reminiscent of Costas-Gavras' film Z with its rapid-fire dialogue and staccato rhythms, La Haine (Hate) directed by 28 year-old Mathieu Kassovitz, is a passionate look at racial tensions at a Paris housing project. Although drug dealing, urban decay, and police brutality have been shown in films before, rarely have they had the sense of vitality and urgency shown in La Haine. Three friends from different ethnic backgrounds live in the Bluebell housing projects on the outskirts of Paris. This is not the Paris of travel brochures or films like Amelie, but a desolate urban landscape, harsh and grim with housing projects that look as if they could be in any big city in the world. Vinz (Vincent Cassel), is a working class Jew; Hubert (Hubert Kounde), the most intelligent and self-reflective of the three, is an African boxer; and Said (Said Taghmaoui), an Arab from North Africa is younger but just as embittered. The film depicts their rage against the police whom they see as oppressors. Marginalized economically and politically, without jobs, parents who care, or hope for the future, the streets are their home and they are open targets for police who are shown as brutal and racist. In one startling scene, a veteran cop taunts and physically abuses Said and Hubert while training a rookie cop. The rookie can only look on and shake his head in disbelief.Shot in black and white, La Haine shows a single day in the lives of the three friends. Following a major riot in which a local teenager, Abdel, is critically wounded by the police, Vinz, the most volatile of the group, vows that if Abdel dies he will kill a cop to get even. Hubert wants to restrain him, and Said doesn't seem to care either way, as long as he can get his money from a drug dealer named Snoopy. When Vinz finds a Smith &amp; Wesson 44 lost by the police during the riots, the spiral of violence escalates and builds toward a memorable conclusion. La Haine does not offer any solutions to social problems but clearly shows the anger and frustration of people who feel trapped by their circumstances. In its depiction of a society in free-fall, it also has immediacy. Three weeks after the film was released, riots broke out in the Brixton section of London, following the death of a young black man in police custody. Though it is a wake-up call for action on society's growing gap between rich and poor, La Haine makes a powerful statement that violence does not solve anything and that hate begets hate. Someone should pass the word to a few of the world leaders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better and Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen La Haine a handful of times now and with each viewing it just gets better.The first thing that stands out about the film is the cinematography. It's rare that a film like this is considered both genuine and a good example of it's art but La Haine is both.The plotline is compelling and realistic and neatly shows the way that inner city life has gone in the big cities in France as well as proving that despite the romance of Paris, it suffers from the same problems as any other major city.The characters are above all believable and the cast did a great job. The quality of acting is simply stunning from several actors and it would be a shame if it was simply dismissed as "just another foreign art-house movie" by audiences outside France.Above all the film whilst showing the influences of American films and society has a very clear sense of it's own identity and at no time does it feel like another US Ghetto film transposed to France. This is a major boon to the film and it stands out of the crowd for this, even though many people will dislike it because of this. It is, however, their loss.It's hard to recommend this film highly enough, but I should add that more than one viewing is required to get the best from La Haine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most relevant French film of the last 20 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mean Streets' in french - and so much more. While there are so many references to Scorsese that you could almost call it an homage, this French milestone deals with the disillusioned youth who live in the outskirts of Paris in such an elegant - and honest - way, that I would go so far as to call it the most relevant French film of the last 20 years. But it's also a cinematic masterpiece and great, often hilarious entertainment. Everything fits: the musical choices, the outstanding performances by the 3 main characters, the beautiful cinematography and flawless direction. And, perhaps most of all, THE perfect script. As much a realistic portrayal of a torn society as it is an artistic achievement, 'La Haine' is essential viewing.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great achievement. One of the most unforgettable Euro movies of the 90's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Haine aka Hate is a story about three friends living near Paris in France (one Jew, one Arab and one black) who have nothing special in their lives and try to live a day at a time by drinking and having a good time and also working (at least the black character, who owns a boxing hall). Their friend, however, is captured by a police which tortures and maltreats him so badly that he is sent to a hospital in a critical condition. This makes the youth gangs in city including the three protagonists start a war against the police and authorities for the horrible wrongs they and their friend have suffered, and suddenly they notice the whole society is collapsing, and all there is is hate and need to revenge...Violence and mayhem is almost everywhere, including authorities which should do nothing but fight against it..This film is powerful and grim. Totally unforgettable is the last scene which at my first viewing time blew me away. It comes very suddenly and there are no warnings what will happen at the end of this film. The message is so important and these marks of the "apocalypse" can be found in our everyday life everywhere. The society is falling and it is "spinning" as the voice over says just before the end credits..The film brings into question such horrific facts as racism which should have passed away long times ago, but no. Racism is such a primitive, stupid and despisable cancer among people, that there is no hope of better future if individuals don't understand the real facts of life and right ways to live with each other. Hate feeds hate as the character Hubert says, and that is something that our stupid race has not learned.There is one very powerful scene just before the end scene and it deals with a skinhead and these three characters who could kill him right away and pay something back. It is very challenging scene and even Vinz, the most revenge seeking character, starts to see things different way after that. The whole point of La Haine is violence in all its forms. Why there is violence and why the hell it is used so often everywhere in every form? Don't we ever learn? These kind of films are important and so powerful that unfortunately people who should see them don't want to or they can't bacause it would be as a mirror for them..The film is also a comment on power used by police as they are pretty tough and hard in this film. Police think that they can use any methods in order to get some answers, or in order to have some fun..It certainly doesn't judge police as "pigs" or violent sadists in general, but it is a warning example of what must NOT happen anywhere ever, by police or by others. One has to see through the film and to its core in order to understand what it says. Otherwise there is no point in watching these kind of films. La Haine is that kind of a film that it should be seen by police and youths as well, because there are still possibilities to prevent things to go too far in our life and world we live in.The camera techniques used in this film are magnificent. Director/screenwriter Mathieu Kassovitz uses camera so smoothly and passionately and there are many similarities in techniques between this film and his more recent, Assassin(s). I am very happy for this young talent to have won the director's award at Cannes. These kind of talents deserve their prizes because there are so many stupid and worthless films which don't have nothing artistic in them and have nothing to say, and are just mindless and greedy entertainment. The black and white is very great element and the film strikes greatly without colors. The same case is with the Belgian classic Man Bites Dog, by Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde and Andre Bonzel.A great masterpiece in French modern cinema and recommended for the fans of intelligent and important cinema so seldom found from big studios or Hollywood (there are exceptions, of course) nowadays.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how can you sum up a film this beautiful &amp; slick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film in 1997, after seeing and reading reviews about it on tv and the net for a couple of years. I never thought a film could actually make you truly think about things around our world, not just how bad it can be in places like the projects set in the film. I could truly see this happening where I am from(Rochdale,Manchester,UK).The situation set in the film is a dark and nasty one. you watch 3 friends fall apart from the aftermath of a riot in a parisian project.a friend is near-fatally injured in police custody, which sparks a chain of events, part forced onto the 3 friends, part of self-inflicted.the acting is amazing. Vincent Cassel's performance is electrifying. his mentality is distorted with hate(hence the film name), but you truly feel he is not a bad seed. His problem is he can't see the wood for the trees, which Hubert tries to point out to him.Hubert is a character who has the potential to better his life, but he is trapped in his parisian project cell. he tries to guide vinz to a healthier and more productive way of thinking about life.said seems to be the one who doesn't want trouble, but it is thrust upon him. he sees the relationship between hubert and vinz, his 2 best friend, deteriorate, but doesn't know who to side with, or what to do about it.Mathieu Kassovitz made this film in a way that you feel for both the police and the the 3 friends. It is amazing to watch, as mathieu takes the simplest things, and makes them look classy(check out the DJ scene for a true example of what I mean). he uses black and white as to colour, and it doesn't look fake, or cheesy. in fact it enhances the film more than you could imagine. you won't sit there and wish he filmed it in colour by the end. the action, although relatively mild compared to todays film, is believable.speaking about the end, it is one of the most simplest and powerful endings I have seen in a film yet. the soundtrack is awesome too. who would have thought french hip-hop would sound so sweet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moviemakers when filming French based films have traditionally tended to sentimentalise the ?people' through the celebration of les petits gens, the little people of Pagnol and Clair as well as more recently the fantastical Parisian wonderland environments of Amelie and Moulin Rouge. With La Haine, young director Mathieu Kassovitz took the flipside of this and gave an illustration of the awfulness of life in the depressed blue-collar areas of ParisLa Haine (?Hate') begins after a night of rioting on a dismal housing estate on the northern outskirts of Paris and focuses on 24 hours in the lives of three close friends aged around 20. They are Vince (Vincent Cassel), an explosive working-class Jew, Hubert (Hubert Kounde), a handsome, soft-spoken black, and Said (Said Taghmaoui), a mercurial streetwise Arab. With little hopes or prospect of regular employment due to where they come from, the trio drift aimlessly, engaging in petty theft, and seething with aggressive resentment against an uncaring world. L'Avenir c'est nous (We Are the Future) is the ironic slogan on the estate's playground, but this is a film about people who believe they have no future.The quality of the performances from the 3 main actors, their conviction, the way they interact with one another and the vigour and fluency of Kassovitz's script and direction make this a very special movie indeed. Its full of action, detail, unexpected incidents and quirky humour. For instance, the boys have a bizarre encounter in a public lavatory in central Paris with a diminutive survivor of the Gulag that is as puzzling to them as it is to us. Does the story the Gulag survivor tells them have a deeper meaning than on the surface? Of course it does, and importantly this film makes you think as to what the metaphor means. Throughout violence is always on the point of erupting. There are constant confrontations with a brutal, racist police force, and Vince has a 44 Magnum revolver that a plainclothes cop lost during the riots, which we know will eventually be used on someone. However none of this ever descends into mere gratuitous violence like so many Hollywood filmsLa Haine presents a state of affairs of the alienation faced by many young people in the ?projects' in France, and all over the world. It doesn't offer any solutions, though the point is forcibly made that in France, as elsewhere, parts of the police force are part of the problem rather than the solution. Of course, much of what we are shown is familiar to us from British and American films .The strength of the film is that it neither glamorises nor patronises its characters. They hate their life because it's boring, and they despise the society that's created it for them, together with parks, football fields and a few mod cons with which to comfort them. In particular, they hate the police, who hate them right back. The film's other major achievement is to show in a tangible and very expressive way how a cycle of distrust and anger is created on both sides of this awful divide, so that there is very little anyone can do about it. In other words violence and hate breeds more violence and hate.A criticism that could be levelled is that in the US / UK versions the sub-titles don't help, pushing what is very authentic dialogue into something more like cliché, as well as pointless miss-translations that occur. However this is just a minor thing, and does not and should not reflect at all on the film itself.This certainly is one of the greatest films of the 1990s. Its one of those rare films that you will think about for the days and weeks after ? not solely about the film itself, but on wider issues such as society, poverty and racism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie about social problems and how they're being dealt with</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the riots broke out last autumn in Paris..the first thing I thought about was this movie. I put on the TV and all the scenes reminded me off the best movie ever made in Europe, and the best on the subject...La Haine The first time I saw the movie in 2003, we was gonna watch it for school. At first I thought it was gonna be another french movie about a young french girl that got pregnant(we watched a lot of those in French lessons)...but what followed was probably the most defining 90 minutes in my life.When the movie started with the images of riots (real riots, old news footage) combined with Bob Marley's "Burning and Looting" I was getting fascinated about this movie, this had to be good. A lot of things were very recognizable, everyone knows a "Said", everyone knows a "Hubert" and at the time I was feeling like "Vinz". All the scenes influenced me and were very recognizable, the hanging around with friends, the way of talking, the arguments they used for their deeds...everything. The end shocked me and I couldn't really think anything else then "I got to watch this movie again", and the day after I bought a DVD of it.The movie tells the story of a black, Arab and Jewish guy who live in a housing project near Paris, the kind of neighborhood where most of the people don't have a job, where the youth bores itself and flirts with criminal behavior, where drugs are being sold and where an occasional riot starts (this happened from the 80's until recently from time to time). The movie follows them 24 hours after their friend Adbel got beat up by the police during the riots, where a cop lost his gun. Vinz (the Jewish guy) found the gun and swears that when Abdel dies he's gonna take vengeance by killing a police. With Vinz - not being the most stable nor the most smart and relaxed person - having a gun on him the three come in some hard situations, but also without the police gun they have enough problems during the 24 hours....I ain't gonna spoil anything, but this should be enough to make you wanting to watch this movie.After watching it a couple of times I realized that this was a story, I always thought it was a documentary, which is a big compliment to the whole crew I think. But still that didn't made the movie less strong, the greatest thing about it is that it isn't easy made, no clichés...when you watch an American movie on the subject there always is some form of exit for the main character or he dies in a way that makes you think he deserves it. So either way a character is portrayed as a nice guy or a total bad guy, who both have girl who want to get them out of troubles. This is where La Haine sets itself apart from other movies, it doesn't try to portray the characters as nice people, although you do feel sympathies for them. The best thing is the end, which sets the movie mostly apart and makes it more recognizable for the European crowd (I'm not gonna spoil it, but if it ended differently the movie wouldn't been so great) The way it is shot in black and white makes it look realer, makes it grimier, it portrays the banlieues as a place without an exit. That's what maybe sets the movie also apart, the black and white makes it look arty and grimy at the same time. Maybe the best is that it still doesn't look dated because of that.Another great thing is the soundtrack, all the songs that are used in the movie have a great effect on the images and visa versa. Bob Marley perfectly fits the riots, Isaac Hayes fits the hashish packing and smoking scenes, Zapp and Roger fits the break dance song perfectly and the Expression Direct fits the haunted car scene in inner city Paris perfect (if you can understand the lyrics). But what really sets this movie apart is the Cutkiller scene, this scene only made me wanted to get a set of SL1200's...The way the tension is build in the movie is great, most of the time the characters don't do anything, but you still feel the tension building, the hate growing, and when you maybe bored watching some scenes the first time (the "candit-camera" scene for instance and the "eiffeltower" scene), but afterwards they're like pieces of a puzzle falling into it's place. Some shots are brilliantly, the Taxi Driver imitation of Vinz at the beginning (when you already see that Vinz is losing it), the police interview shot with Said and Hubert, the discussion at the toilets, the way the characters are introduced, the subway shot...it's all eye candy.To make a conclusion, if you love hip hop and don't think the police as necessarily the representation of the good in society. of course when you love cinema it is also a good movie, but it really is a movie which has it own public: the youth. If your Dutch try to get hold of the 7 euro Freerecord shop version, but I can recommend the English 10 year anniversary more...the directors commentary, trailers and bonus material make this a really nice DVD. But I can understand why a lot of people don't like it, it doesn't offer solutions, it doesn't give an opinion on anything except the police, and of course you have to have a certain frame of mind to like the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"La Haine"; Mathieu Kassovitz' stark social study of violence, fear and hatred, remains the powerful masterpiece it was in '95.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1995, Mathieu Kassovitz wrote and directed a film that showed the controversial truth; "La Haine", which translates to "Hate", a film deemed so important the then-prime minister Alain Juppé arranged a special screening and ordered his entire cabinet to watch the film. Kassovitz rightfully won the Best Director award at the Cannes festival for his film that had and still has a huge impact on French society. La Haine mixes ethnics to emphasise the overriding importance of solidarity against the police. In my opinion, the greatest film ever made. A cinematic phenomenon so close to my heart.It is the day after the riots on an underclass French estate (the film opens with real footage of riots with the suitable soundtrack of Bob Marley's Burnin' and Lootin'). A youth named Abdel had been caught and beaten by the police and is now in critical condition. One of his very best friends, Vinz (Jewish), had found a cop's weapon. He swears that if Abdel dies he will kill a cop. The majority of the film revolves around Vinz and his two other friends Hubert (Afro-Caribbean) and Sa?d (North African) roaming around their ghetto and suburbs of Paris. Set just within 24 hours, this is just a glimpse of the chaos.There is an image in La Haine where Vinz (Vincent Cassel) imitates Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) in the mirror; "You talking' to me?" and then points his fingers like a gun and fires. This is not an action he only does once as he repeats it twice during the film. But why? He has a gun. Is this preparation? Yes. Vinz has to prepare because he is scared. And he has to see what it looks like, to make sure it looks "cool", as when he does kill a cop, he will get an undeserved respect by his peers. There is another scene in which Vinz and Hubert bump into a cop while trying to run from this. Vinz' first instinct is to pull the gun on him, this shows that the first instinct has now become violence. The reaction to violence is fear (which is apparent in the cops face until Hubert knocks him out). Fear creates hate; or, the thought and idea of hate. Like the youths feel they are supposed to hate the cops. Vinz is the angriest central character, but when he had his chance, he hesitates; consequences are not forgotten. Cassel performs Vinz with brute force, not failing to portray his character for a second.Hubert (Hubert Koundé), the most subtle character in the film, remains quiet and gentle, although he is a boxer; or a fighter; for the majority of the film. He has a longing to escape. He has no idea who to trust. Everyone is a thug. This is the stereotype that has been created. But not even a thug wants this thought about them. He is always watching the hatred breed around him but never takes part. But when it comes to the cut, the action and reaction is always the same and he proves himself wrong. Koundé put a lot of effort into his role and earns his praise.Sa?d (Sa?d Taghmaoui); possibly the most vibrant character of the three, feels as if he has to be something, he hates change but he follows the crowd, he wants to be accepted. He appears to be everybody's friend as he constantly makes jokes. This is because his family is dead so Vinz and Hubert; and possibly Abdel but we don't know since we only ever hear about Abdel, so they are basically his family. But if they get into trouble they wouldn't hesitate to leave each other. It's every man for himself. Cassel, Koundé and Taghmaoui work so well together its as if they have known each other for years.The youths are stuck on the idea that the cops are there to stop them, and they refuse the idea that the cops are there in fact to protect them. And the youths express hatred with violence. Sexual intercourse is not an issue in this society as it is too dangerous to have a girlfriend, as it will spawn more violence, thus more hatred. La Haine does not offer solutions to all the racism but in fact, shows you in a detailed and mature manner.Starkly shot in black and white; La Haine has one of my favourite cinematography works. Kassovitz directional style is so inspirational, using rocketing zooms and smooth swerves to get the full view of the destruction. Popular hip hop music is used and heard throughout the film, none of it I would listen to unless I was watching La Haine. The film shows a side of France you can not find on a tourist map. Passion, dedication and effort was well put forward to La Haine. It punches you in the face with its sheer, raw intensity.The films most important quote is the one it opens and shuts with: - "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!". This directly reflects the films content, structure and result. La Haine proves that hatred is in fact the strongest emotion. One of the greatest films of the 90s and of all-time; if there was one perfect film; it would be La Haine.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most important thing isn't the fall but the landing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"La Haine", probably one of the most momentous French movies of the nineties caused a stir when it opened in 1995 so much so that it became a big social phenomenon. It heralded a genre: the "film De Banlieue" whose backdrop is high-risk French suburbs and in its wake, other movies emerged like "Bye-Bye" (1995) or "ma 6-T Va Crack-Er" (1997). "La Haine" remains Mathieu Kassovitz's best moment. Afterwards, he didn't cease to disappoint me. "Assassin(s)" (1997) left me uncomfortable and queasy and "les Rivi?res Pourpres" (2000) was an absolute turkey. I haven't seen "Gothika" (2003) but he shot it with the Hollywood presence on his back and I fear the worst.To better be immersed in his plan, Kassovitz shot his film in one of these high-risk French suburbs (I can't remember its name but you can check it in the "filming locations" rubric when you arrive on the page of the film on this site). This gives his movie an ultra-realist sensation which rings true. In the space of a day, his camera follows a threesome of ruffians. There's Vinz (Vincent Cassel) who acts the tough guy. He is proud of having stolen the gun of a cop and hopes to make good use of it. When he is asked to make an effort of reflection, he loses his temper. Hubert (Hubert Koundé) a pacifist who craves to get out of this daily hell but where to go? He also knows that hate breeds hate. It's both the catalyst of the riots and adds fuel to the fire in the incessant conflicts. And also Sa?d (Sa?d Thagmaou?), a brazen teenager. The three of them wander in their neighborhood and in Paris between visiting of friends, relationships with the riffraff, the police, arguments, reconciliations and foolish things. An ordinary day during which the trio appears as prisoners of their suburbs and have a life with no horizon. A day which will lead to the inevitable, marked out by the time which often appears on a black screen.Kassovitz did his best to create a stylish film and it paid off well. It was a good idea to have shot his film in a black and white cinematography because it bestows it with a very gritty aura; sometimes there's a documentary whiff which pervades the film. His camera work which commands admiration makes juxtapose travelings, static shots and circular movements according to the vibe a sequence could convey. It also helps to enhance the scenery which is perhaps the fourth main actor of the film after the trio. Overrall, his film is a hard-hitting assessment of a faltering universe (the high-risk suburbs) in which latent tensions and hate reign and it can awake at any time in violence. This hate in question which the inhabitants of these suburbs feel towards the cops is also smoldered in the cops and I wonder if Kassovitz indicts their sometimes intolerable demeanor, especially when some ruffians are kept in police custody. In the beginning of the film, the audience learns that a suspect, Abdel is in a coma at hospital because he was badly injured by the cops during questioning. When they learned this, the toughest guys of these suburbs sparked off a riot. In a way, the attitude of the police helps to fuel the hate and to separate farther the gap and the incomprehension between the inhabitants of these suburbs and the police. That said, Kassovitz doesn't generalize. Not all the cops are monstrous. Check the two sequences when in the first one, a policeman tries to make the riffraff understand in a sensible manner that they can't stay on the roof of a building and the second sequence when Vinz, Hubert and Sa?d are in Paris and they ask their way to a policeman who guides them in a polite way.The actors were discerningly chosen and perfectly directed. It seems that Kassovitz fostered improvisation. It was the right method to confer his film with an authentic feeling. They deliver dialogs full of slang, coarse lines and sometimes they're inaudible so you'll have to be very attentive to catch what they say. However, this drawback isn't really irritating and was surely wanted by the director to reinforce the unique spontaneity of the film. With his build and his face of ruffian, Vincent Cassel was ideally cast as the stubborn Vinz while his two main partners are amazingly true to life. And there are some famous French actors who have cameos and who weren't afraid of having demeaning parts like Vincent Lindon, a drunkard or Zinedine Soualem, a sadistic cop.Kassovitz remains as objective as possible and doesn't offer solutions to solve these problems. More than ten years after it reached the streets, his films is still a topical one and the riots and violent incidents which broke out in high-risk suburbs in many French cities the last fall alas show that these tensions aren't alas ready to subside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hood by a Frenchman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather like Haneke's Code Inconnu, we follow a principle trio of destitute urban teenagers through 24 hours in episodes, punctuated with screen splits showing the time - and, invariably, their boredom. There is no romanticism or squalor in squalid drug dens (unlike in the contemporary Trainspotting) or any carousel of murder. The boys want to do their own thing, perhaps collect the pettiest of debts and get along. Instead their every encounter breaks down into goading and aggression, however constructively instigated by the boys.Kassowitz paints bleak sequences, but without a sense of hopelessness. Instead we are left with frustration that there is no intervention to manipulate the intelligence and good intentions of the boys at each chapter of their day. The episode in the private gallery is the perfect example of this; the imaginary cul-de-sac of self-worth that eventually leads them to behave with defensive antagonism is a painful scene.Vincent Cassel is the money name leading the melodrama. Said Tagmaouhi is a good foil for Cassel's occasionally self-regarding virtuosity, but I was most impressed with Hubert Koundeas, the introspective, middle class manqué third of the three. The film stays true throughout, incorporating Paris as a metropolitan backdrop, rather than a beautiful juxtaposition for pity's sake. A troubling, even angry but positive film. A real benchmark. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La Haine is the work of the arrogant. It has no story (three wasted youths bum around town all day) because the romping characters would carry the day, they assume. However the characters are extremely predictable; they are serially presented with decency or authority which they heatedly reject in identical fashion. Perhaps that is the point, but it gets tiresome after two hours. La Haine is also filled with indulgent cinematography, a "best of" of camera tricks that serve no narrative or emotional purpose (I'm thinking in particular of an extremely long inverse dolly-zoom as the trio looks over a balcony in a one minute orphan scene). There are also many interesting but completely irrelevant "lifestyle" shots of break dancing and djing; cool in their own right, but if that's what I wanted to see I'd be on youtube. But I'm here looking to learn something, and I get nothing. It presents me with the angry lives of three ghettoites with no context of how they got there or why they feel the way they do. They are just angry, though a few obvious lessons are learned (literally "hey, I guess not all cops are that bad"). I heard the ending was a tacked on shocker...I didn't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great bits and pieces, but not solid as a whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie nicely presents great elements one can find in a movie. The cinematography proves to be a great treat for the eyes, displaying nice plays of pan and zoom at time and also genius camera angles, especially at the long shots. The scenes also prove to be really strong, although in essence they actually depict only simple and everyday life activities. Yet as a whole I feel that the movie didn't present a solid story. Yes the theme, proclaimed vividly in the title, gets to be ever present all throughout the movie. But between each scenes there seem to be less coherence and lack a bigger picture to connect them as a whole. Furthermore, the ending comes very much abruptly with the subject being stretched just prior to it coming. The acting overall feels very nice. The trio of Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde and Said Taghmaoui presented a very nice acting work. Their relationship seems very natural and fluid, especially with those long dialogs. Also their interactions with the surrounding look convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense atmosphere and story with good acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it interesting that the film uses the names of most the actors as their character names. Perhaps by doing so, it adds more of an authentic feel to the film. The trio (Vincent, Hubert and Said) have good chemistry on screen, and what really ties them together is Said, as Vincent and Hubert are constantly butting heads; one the angel and the other the devil. Said plays the cheerful innocent young boy without much of a care and does not take sides with either, trying to maintain the peace. Vincent's expressions are really intense and though he does talk of violent acts, he does not engage in many. Hubert thinks of the bigger picture and with his calm demeanour is the image of morality in the film. The trio can be seen as gangsters by the way they walk and talk and the influence of American hood films is apparent here.This film is in black and white and that makes the atmosphere constant throughout. It has this bleak tone to it, and can even be seen as Expressionistic for both its visual style and narrative. The film expresses social issues in France at the time, and this film greatly portrays that. Set in a time when the citizens were conditioned to fear and despise the police, Kassovitz impressively shows both police brutality and sympathy.The cinematography is noticeably appreciable as well. There is this one scene, where I had to rewind to appreciate it some more. This is when Vinz is in the bathroom acting all macho, and testing out his toughness in front of the mirror. We are led to believe that we see him through the mirror, but then the camera should be in the reflection too, and it is not. That is truly ingenious.Though the film did keep me quite engaged, I just felt that it was a bit heavy for me, and that it wasn't leading anywhere. Then the ending came and it was just so unexpected that it left me feeling empty. Not sure how I feel about that.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, I watched the badly subtitled American version of this film, and so couldn't possibly comprehend the resonance of what they were saying, but at least I got something out of it. Though I feel the characters are a little lacking, this being a film they made up as they went along, the cinematography is just brilliant if you take the time to think about it. This film gets such mixed reviews, some people love it, some people hate it. It's all just a matter of what you want to get out of a film. Some people watch films for the entertainment value, in which case you're better off watching something else, but others watch for more unique reasons. If you like to ponder the metaphorical resonances of a film, this is the one for you. If not, and you'd rather watch something for pure entertainment, maybe give La Haine a miss. You need to actually care about this film to enjoy it, which is a shame, as the first time around, this film often goes over people's heads (It certainly went over mine!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do The Right Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French director Mathieu Kassovitz directs "La Haine" (Hate), an "angry urban youths movie" which centres on three young men ? one Jewish, one Arabic, one African - living in a Parisian housing project. The film unfolds over the course of one day, and uses its impoverished youths to represent any and all minorities currently ostracised from France's social majority. They are those whom society prefers to keep out on the fringes, a separation which the very tenets of multiculturalism makes difficult. Alienated and belittled, the kids spend all their time drawn into constant confrontations with the police. The police, being the only visible signs of the boys' subjugation, understandably become all that the boys can lash out at. But their violence is wasted. They should be seeking other avenues, but don't know how. One day, one of our heroes' buddies dies in police custody. Like the LA Riots, anger arcs across the housing estates. One of the boys, who owns a pistol, fires the first shot. Tensions then escalate into outright war. In this regard, the film plays like Spike Lee's "Do The Right Thing", Scorsese's "Taxi Driver", and the many Angry Young Men movies of the British new wave ("Look Back In Anger", "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner", "If", "Kes", "This Sporting Life"), though like most of those films, "Hate" eventually engages in ideological displacement. Anger is quickly misdirected, straw-men are scapegoated and both the violence and the cause are forgotten. In terms of flaws, the film doesn't go far enough, refuses to place any blame on the kids (Kassovitz rightfully sees them as victims, but refuses to examine their complicity in the events), and possesses two very pretentious scenes, filled with some didactic moralising. Other than this, the film is fast, punchy, and reasonably stylish.Today in France, relations between the French and local Arabs are still tense. The film's plot is loosely based on the actual police beatings, during a 1986 student protest, of Malik Oussekine, a young Arab who died from his wounds. Two decades later, riots again flared up in the streets of Paris, again due to accidental deaths caused by police. "You are not responsible, you are irresponsible!" Kassovitz would tell then Minister of the Interior Nicholas Sarkozy, who handled the whole fiasco like an idiot. Sarkozy became President of France two years later. Months later, Kassovitz's "Babylon AD" bombed at the box office.8/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you discover through this movie what life in certain neibourhoods is like then you probably have never taken a Paris suburban train. I say Paris but it could say Marseille or Bruxelles, or Manchester,...La Haine, which I saw when it came out in 95 did not teach me much. I even found it a bit boring and I was astonished at the welcome the film, almost a documentary, got in the French press... Then I realized that most viewers, comfortable in their downtown Paris flats or cosy suburbs had no idea of what was surrounding them. These well to do executives and decision makers had no clue of how rough life was just a few kilometers away from their ploutocratic dwellings...La Haine is not a great movie but it is a realistic painting. Therefore, if it managed to awaken the consciousness of some towards social problems in French Suburbia then I am ready to give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hate begets hate and ignorance leads to fatal. 'Hate' and 'ignorance' are two pillars of racism which we are observing today while its foundation was laid far years ago. The main question arises while watching this story is,first,"What exactly are we facing due to effects of racism?" and second,"What urges us, we common people, to get trapped into the maze of racism. We have been and are still living in the world of togetherness and unity with a motto of 'oneness for all', unknowing of our society which is still diseased by the plague named Racism. We don't observe, while we are in our own peace, that someone superior to us is injecting a fluid in our hearts that is developing more and more hatred for the ones who are either of different casts or of different races. But if we observe meticulously, we should remember that we already had lived in a society with different kinds of people of various races without any of our issues. 'La Haine' translated as 'Hatred', directed by Mathieu Kasosvitz is very firm on the issue of Racism and is by far the most occupied film ever made on the subject. The story set in the city of Paris is righteously motivated through its director and cast. Watching this, it didn't make me feel numb and pity towards them; it is as rough as it gets as emotional we feel in the end. I was stunned to see Vincent Cassel in his early days, how beautifully he has crafted his work in form of acting. I've previously seen him in "Irreversible(2002)" where he was more mature but less bold than in La Haine. Hubert and Said Taghmaoui have played their roles brilliantly. Said is another face to watch throughout if you enjoyed Vincent. All these being young have been so perfect and artistic, you may never find such acts in other French movies. Pierre Aim is another brain on whose shoulder, cinematography was staged. And guess, that leaves us spellbound to see very different angles of Paris. This is not all for we see this movie. We got to take something back after viewing this, have to apply positivity we gain from it. Because, "the world is dying, the society around us is degrading and we are making it happen too soon."</fullReview>

La haine is a modern classic which i thought should have gotten the best foreign language film award at the Oscars and a best actor nod for Vincent cassel as vinz. It is tense, suspenseful, funny, emotional, vivid and real. It is a film with soul, dark and brutal but shines a light on socio-economic and racial issues in France. It is like taxi driver and do the right thing had a child named la haine. Please watch this film. It is a classic in world cinema.</fullReview>

Their friend Abdel was arrested and hospitalized after getting beaten by the police. Vinz has a gun and vows to kill a cop if Abdel dies. Rioters had looted a police station.This movie tries to take on some compelling modern issues. The problem is that the group of friends is so diverse. Instead of realism, the movie seems to be trying to be PC. The movie is missing the religious aspect of the fighting and basing it solely on social class.

		<fullReview>This 2010 movie from Geraldine could be the feminine version of this movie as the two speaks about the life in a block suburb. Those two movies couldn't have been made before because those urban innovations hadn't been invented so far ! Sure the life over there seems alienating as there is nothing else except the buildings and in addition, the apartments are small ! To grow up there helps being uncomfortable and in each movie, Paris, the big real city with a past, an history, shops and everything else attracts like a magnet ! However, the big difference between the two movies is the gender feeling : Geraldine is soft, hopeful, constructive ! Here, the boys are like a wolf-pack : ready to bite every time, barking for everything? The director doesn't want to stigmatize a community as the trio of friends counts a Muslim, a Jew and a black Christian. They all share a lack of family monitoring and just can't stand authority ! So even it's disturbing and sad, the movie tells a certain truth and is a rare opportunity to enter this new french territories and way of life. Kasowicz was inspired to build a excellent drama on this background as well as beautifully picturing this angular suburb. The trio of friends are excellent, very natural, especially for Cassel as he had surely a golden childhood?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After local youth Abdel (Abdel Ahmed Ghili) is beaten unconscious by police, a riot ensues on his estate during which a policeman loses his gun. The gun is found by Vinz (Vincent Cassel) who threatens he will kill a cop if Abdel dies.This film was written, co-edited, and directed by Mathieu Kassovitz, and championed by such folks as Jodie Foster (unusual but true). Powerfully done in black and white, it presents a slice of French life with a mix of race and class. In some ways the film (released in 1995) is prescient, because the class conflict was not well-known to Americans until after the 9/11 attacks.In a way, it could be seen as a companion piece to "Kids", which came out about the same time. Though they deal with different issues and different cultures, both strongly express what it means to be a youth who is struggling.</fullReview>

The smaller one - how mighty you could feel when carrying a gun. How inhuman you become just because of possessing it. But when it comes to the real killing - the fully conscious one - you feel you have choice. And you choose. 2. The bigger story is the suffocating realization of the scale of the terror. You receive a detailed picture of the quiet torture that represents the everyday life of a great part of the humans in "civilized Europe" (and America, and Asia, and Africa, and Australia). Just for the case they are gathered in Paris.This movie won't be seen by any of the people who live such kind of life. Pity.But any of the rest is obliged not to remain indifferent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The French's answer to Spike Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hate" is one of the two movies that have been recommended to me the most (the other, if you care, is Sansho the Bailiff). Criterion's recently release of it in region 1 finally allowed me to see it, and though it's well made and decently enough written, I can't say I'm a huge fan."Hate" is the French answer to Spike Lee, right down to the floaty camera and the constant emphasis on racial tension. It starts on a riot, then introduces three friends (one Arab, one Jew, and one black) the next day, then goes to a party where someone says, "Did you hear about the pig (cop) that lost his gun last night?", and from there the entire movie is spelled out to anyone familiar with this type of story.This movie is a social commentary on racism, class warfare, and "hateful" mentality, and it doesn't add much new to the mix except a cow (symbol of the character's misdirection) and a joke/theme about a man falling several stories to his death. The rest of it--the strange old man with the anecdote in the bathroom, the tracing of the gun as it changes hands but persists in remaining with the friends, the music, and the drawing up of the characters--are all tropes of what is becoming something of a recognizable sub-sub-genre within the already known "Urban Drama" sub-genre. And, like all those other films, this film isn't really interested as much in providing answers or clues as to what to do about humanity's tendency to hate as it is more interested in waxing poetic over it.Not to say it's that bad of a movie, and technically the world can use a thousand movies like it until people finally get the point. But really, for one like me pretty uninterested in the theme and more interested in the medium itself, this movie really doesn't have much more to offer.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

Kind of reminds me of the American film Kids, too. Sure, the film is, I assume, steeped in honesty about its characters. But that doesn't mean I feel sorry for them in the end.

The film was supposed to be set in the aftermath of the Paris riots but for all the film portrayed it could have been after a bit of rain. There was no sense of anger, loss or hopelessness - just a bunch of young men moaning and brooding. These men were so unsympathetic I lost any kind of concern for them very early on. To me they just seemed a bunch of me, me,me victim-mentality that is all too common now. The dialogue was trying to be real and urban but it just came across as stilted. Anyway this film drones on and on without any plot twists, change of pace or building of tension. The obvious "tragic" ending couldn't have come soon enough for me. I am sure this is a case of "emperors new clothes" and most of the people who say they like it are just saying it. Not a patch on "irreversible", "City of god" "Im not Scared" etc</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of La Haine is not so clear from the outset. What is this film about, who are these people, what are the rules of their world and why? These are questions that I was asking myself for the first half hour of the film and then I realised that the film is not going to blatantly give me the answers as I'd expect. Instead it's going to slowly unravel them, intriguing me every so often and making me feel smart when I work something out. And that's exactly what happened. I found the story and plot to be fairly original in the sense that we haven't seen this type of story telling before this film. The shape of the dialogue could have been inspired by the likes of Tarantino but it stands on its own. Although the film can deal with brutal themes at times it is very comedic. There are little references to other films as well allowing the viewer to feel clever when they recognize them. The only issue with the story is that it is obviously a story for a specific audience. Not much context around the world of the characters is given making it difficult for westerners to feel sympathy for what the characters are going through because they simply don't understand the gravity of the situation.Technically, the film works okay. I understand the decision to make this film black and white but I don't think it needs it. It's not a subtle reference to the world of the film so it just feels like one of those wanky artistic decisions. Additionally, some of the shots could have been very beautiful but they simply weren't as they looked cheap. Perhaps the film makers were a little to ambitious and acting outside of what they could actually accomplish neatly. For the most part though the film looks and sounds like a documentary but this really works with the films gritty context.Acting: Exceptional.Overall, a nice independent film with an original concept of narrative structure and story telling techniques.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dealing with a side of French society that was hitherto ignored, this is a memorable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthieu Kassowitz's LA HAINE (Hate) is a portrait of youth disenfranchisement and the ensuing rage set in the public housing projects outside Paris. Before this film was released, many foreign viewers knew only the well-dressed, white, reserved and educated France depicted in e.g. films of the 1960s New Wave. Even many French people were unaware of the darker undercurrents of their own society, as no film had dared to handle this subject matter before. LA HAINE was a bombshell. While shot in 1995, it remains entirely topical today, as riots have continued to make the news in recent years.LA HAINE follows one day in the lives of three young men of different ethnic backgrounds all born and raised in one particular housing project: the aggressive Jew Vinz (Vincent Cassell), the insecure, clownish Arab Sa?d (Sa?d Taghmaoui) and the more level-headed, pensive sub-Saharan African Hubert (Hubert Koundé). The film opens on a spring morning, in the aftermath of a riot which has rocked these youths' housing project. Some cars and buildings are destroyed, and the news reports that a police officer has lost his gun in the chaos of the night before. During the 24-hour period before the film's shocking ending, this trio tours the bittersweet environment of their housing project (violence and poverty on one hand, loving families on the other) and, in an effort to pick up money owed to them, they navigate the alien environment (rich, educated, white) of downtown Paris.This is not only a revelatory film in showing viewers a side of France they had never seen before, but it is also extremely entertaining. The performances by these relatively unexperienced actors are totally convincing, Vincent Cassell in particular. Kassowitz shuns his country's own film tradition and instead sculpts the action under inspiration from the USA. However, the "urban", "hip-hop" aesthetic he employs does not lower the film to the more vacuous Hollywood productions but instead is at the level of Spike Lee and Scorsese. The director's decision to print the film in black and white has imbued it with a gravitas that makes it timeless. That said, in spite of the fine acting and ethnographic detail, the plot itself is rather mundane, which holds me back from giving this a full five stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life in the Ghetto !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Haine is a political film directed by Mathieu Kassovitz which deals with the constant riots in the projects of France. It focuses on three young boys living in the suburbs and follows them for a few hours during one particularly chaotic day when one of their friends, a protester by the name of Abdel gets critically assaulted by the police.Kassovitz successfully manages to capture the feel and the bleak nature of life in these projects. The conditions that the boys of the neighbourhoods grow up in are completely unsuitable for children and the violence and chaos existing all around them after a point engulf them all whether they like it or not. Gyms getting damaged, schools getting burnt down and constant fighting with the police are part and parcel of the lives in these ghettos. Vinz, Said and Hubert are boys who also during their lives have been exposed to this violence and as a result they have also become violent, although Hubert is the most sensible among them. They constantly feel the need to act like badasses just to prove that they are brave and bigshots, although they are all boys who are pretending to be something they are not. The direction is stylish. The film is in black and white. A reason for that might be to show the hopeless nature of life in these projects where colour as a symbol of hope has not entered. Mathieu Kassovitz uses fast zooms, Raging Bull-esque slow motion and some other techniques which work well.The screenplay for the most part works well and I remained engaged. But during the last 30 minutes the story sort of lost its way a bit and lost the intensity that made everything that came before very captivating and the climax felt a bit contrived.The acting is very good and every one looks natural and at ease in front of the camera. Vincent Cassel deserves a special mention.La Haine is a very good film depicting the hardships that come along with living in the ghetto. While it may not be perfect, it certainly does manage to provoke the viewer to think about the world at large.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as relevant today as when it was made, La Haine (or Hate) captures the difficulties faced by disenfranchised youth in France. The news of rioting in France a couple of years ago made the film seem all too real. Looking back on the film, the film seems very prescient in foreshadowing the problems percolating beneath the surface in France. I imagine the economic slowdown since 2008 probably has made it even worse than what it was in the 90's.Powerful,gritty, and quite realistic portrait of contemporary France. The film is sort of a precursor to the rise of social realism in French films, with the Dardenne Brothers' works being the most successful example. The plot is a bit weak but the acting and the realism more than make up for it. Recommended for those who like social realism in films.</fullReview>

A boxing gym gets burnt down and these three lads end up in Paris and get in to a fight with some skinheads.Clearly their is more to the film than this but I needed to put 10 lines in to get my comment on the site and the main aim of this was to tell people they have to watch the film.If you like Vincent in this then you must watch Doberman.</fullReview>

I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try.Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Sa?d), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin", a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily.La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause.Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching.Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way.Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them "The World is yours" (Said corrected it to "The World is ours") is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages.One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called "Le Tonneau de la Haine" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection.I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds.Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are "black and gray" sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching.10/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dedicated to the dead (major spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with footage of actual Parisian riots and a dedication to those who died whilst the film was being made. The use of black &amp; white photography makes the film more serious and documentary-like and more respectful to those dead whose lives the film fictionalises.The plot is very simple: a 20-hour period with 3 young disaffected men (Hubert, Said and Vinz) living in the Paris suburbs that are beset by riots after another young man (Abdel) was beaten into a coma by police. The men live in an area affected by low employment, poverty and deep distrust for the authorities. The time we spend with the characters is not without enjoyment or humour as they get into scrapes, fight amongst themselves and muse upon life and politics.Hubert is of West African origins and had boxing aspirations. He successfully campaigned for a gym on his housing estate. When we meet him his gym has been trashed by rioters and he has no intention to restore it. He is the most philosophic and reflective of the characters. He is the mouth piece for the film's main theme and title: 'if you'd been to school you would know that hatred breeds hatred'. Clearly Hubert has been to school but we learn he has also been to prison and though he longs to escape the confines of his environment he spends his time dealing in and smoking cannabis.Said is of Maghrebi origins and is the most amenable of the 3 spending his time thinking about girls, sex and defending his sister. He has dubious ways of making money and we meet one of his debtors, a sleazy man called Asterix, in a hilarious confrontation replete with guns and machismo. Said seems to be the fall guy and stooge of both Hubert and Vinz and others in their community. He is also a peacemaker whose anger is channelled into graffiti. It is he who graffitis an advert changing its slogan from 'the world is yours' to 'the world is ours', part symbol and part the political theme of the film that is gently woven throughout the drama.Vinz's origins are unclear but we learn he is Jewish. He is the most troubled of the three looking for fights with authority and warring with Hubert. Hubert suspects that Vinz was one of the rioters who trashed his gym and given Vinz's interest in killing a cop so that he can do time in prison and, therefore, earn some standing in the community, this seems a real possibility. But Vinz is not invincible (in spite of his name) and is unnerved by the cow he glimpses wandering around throughout the film. The cow is a symbol and foreshadowing of death.The film's mantra of 'life, so far, so good' we hear from Hubert in an opening story of a falling man who says over and over as he falls 'so far, so good'. But as Hubert notes it's not how you fall but how you land that matters, i.e. the consequences and the future not temporary living from hour to hour. For all their bravado and world weary cynicism the three are falling and when they land their bravado and survival instincts fail them as Vinz and then Hubert are shot in a final and fatal confrontation with the police.This film is beautifully shot; the use of black and white is stark and illuminating, giving the suburbs and its people gritty texture. Everyone is terrific in the film and the acting and dialogue seem spontaneous and natural. In fact the dialogue is so natural that one wonders how much, if any, was ad lib. I saw the film on release and several times since on DVD and it has improved with each watch. I cannot recommend this enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best film of its year; pure urban horror filmed in unflinching and poetic eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthieu Kassovitz shot out a wad, so to speak, of the kind of "issue" movie that had brawn and balls and didn't back down from showing the truth on all sides, and how it's all ultimately ugly and screams for change to happen. How much the film might have changed things in the ghettos of Paris I'm not sure, and possibly it didn't do much. But as an act of cinematic awareness to a grim situation with bravura drama and humor and in the guise of a "youth" movie, it's completely captivating. What's strong about it is not just that Kassovitz wont turn away from the cyclical nature of violence between the young citizens brutalized and the cops 'battling' them back causing the ensuing riots, but that nobody is shown as being really right or wrong... Maybe that's not entirely true; La Haine was made for a purpose, through visionary direction and outstanding performances, which is to shed light on something that without any awareness would go on unabated. It's basically like Mean Streets meets Battle of Algiers, if that makes sense.Maybe the latter of those examples is a little extreme an example since it's a wider framework of history and terrorism, whereas this is a work about the little horrors with those who cross the wrong path with the wrong cops in heightened racial and ethnic tension, and is intense on a slightly different level. But it also is relentless in its pursuit of truth at the matter, or rather the filmmaker's heightened and suspenseful level of truth, and it hits the viewer like a gun across the cheeks. While at the same time this societal statement is made there's a real story going on about three young friends (Vincent Cassell, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaoui, all named with their characters), one of which carrying a gun he 'found' from one cop who lost it during a riot, and their travels and adventures over a day trying to get money, drugs, or just getting by the haze of bewilderment over their friend dying in a hospital from cops beating and Vinz's demand for revenge *if* he dies.La Haine is an impression of just a part of a city, as much as one can grab in a day's length of time in 'movie-time', but as well as comparisons to Mean Streets may lie there's also one perhaps for Do the Right Thing. Kassovitz isn't afraid to take a current event and turn it into the stuff of rousing character-driven drama with some semblance of plot (in this case the old 'if the gun is used in act then one act five' logic), but like Lee or Scorsese his black and white cinematography that follows these guys around with the verve to keep on a tracking shot or a specific close-up (in a half-ironic close-up Cassel talks to the mirror ala Travis Bickle, a little inspired through a whole other perspective) that speaks so much. And sometimes he'll put a strange but perfect detour in the structure, like the old man telling the story in the bathroom, or the sudden break for break dancing, or that one shot flying across the air from the window of the DJ. Sometimes it's docu-realistic, but then Kassovitz will throw that stylistic curve-ball reminding us this is in-your-face and with an attitude that would make the Clash raise an eyebrow or two.And along with Kassovitz hitting it way out of the park intellectually and emotionally as a filmmaker, his actors are all lock-in-step wonderful for their characters: Taghmaoui, who you might remember from Three Kings or Traitor, as the uppity and bad-joke telling Arab who has attitude to spare but is like a rough puppy at best; Kounde as the one with probably the most common sense as a guy who lost his gym to the riot and gets by smoking hash and trying to get (or talk) Cassel out of trouble; Cassel as the hot-head with something to prove to himself, or so he thinks, carrying the gun and not really knowing its implications. The three of them are not really very bad kids, but they're from the streets and know it well and know what they need to do to act right and behave around amid what is at points squalor (i.e. the subway bit with one after another homeless folks going by) and just rough gang stuff.They're even sensitive performances to a degree, which is important since La Haine, for all its toughness and rigor and occasional blasts of harsh violence, is a beautiful work of a Frenchman who knows what he's doing. It's made by the young and for the young, but it's also made for anyone looking for an example of what is both important and entertaining art after the French new-wave has come and gone. And, as with any great post-modern film, seeing it once isn't enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La Haine: a very sincere statement of the not-so-romantic life in the suburbs of Paris, a cinematographic masterpiece, an excellent and very entertaining film, a story that lingers in your mind for you to reflect upon. Many people were scandalized by this film, stating it is too violent, too crude... neither is the case. It is one day in the lives of three teenagers in a dirty, dangerous suburb of Paris: Hubert (an African), Sa?d (an Algerian), and Vincent (a Jew), and how they survive in a very hostile environment, where surviving for the next few minutes is the only thing you can look forward to. This is one of the greatest screenplays I have recently seen, and I think this film resembles many of the classics in many ways. Mathieu Kassovitz did a wonderful job directing, with shots that clearly resemble any major director (Hitchcock for example). Another great thing about the film, the editing... the story is very nicely put together through the editing.A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can a film made in the 90s still resonate in the 00s? Ask Kassovitz!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"La Haine" is a political film. "La Haine" is a humanistic film about the realities of ghetto life. "La Haine" is a film about France, specifically the turmoil surrounding rebellion, honesty, and sacrifice. "La Haine" will anger you. It will make you cringe in your seat. It will make you question the values within your own community. That is why this film swept in 1995 when it was released, why other directors have attempted to recycle the story, and why even today - 14 years later - it still remains a relevant film, not just about French society, but a dedicated relevance towards American society as well. Director Mathieu Kassovitz has pulled this story directly from the headlines, taking the injustice of the police and the corruption of the streets and transforming it into the lives of three multi-national boys hell-bent on initiating revenge for the sake of their fallen friend. It is a dark story that uses drugs and violence off the scene to build the suspense within. Filmed in a stark black and white, Kassovitz takes away the glory, wealth, and American-ized culture of project life (see Baltimore's "The Wire") and allows us to experience one day in the life of these boys and their discovery of a gun.Like von Trier's "Dear Wendy", "La Haine" focuses on the gun, a rarity within the youth of the French projects, and builds this momentum that the unknown will eventually happen. This onset of violence, which has been haunting us throughout the film, a la "Mean Streets", finally comes face forward in our third act in a shock provoking scene that will rattle you each time "La Haine" visits your DVD player. Yet, this is just a small indication of what "La Haine" has to offer. Yes, it is a film about violence, it is a political film, and you better believe that it is a youth film, but there is something universal about this mid-90s film that continues to resonate with each viewing. For me, it rests powerfully on the actors. Vincent Cassel absolutely steals this film. From his opening dance, until the unique dilemma surrounding the skinhead, he proves throughout this film that he was passionate about the material. For those doubting the power of his ability, see his body language, emotion, and intensity behind his words - what Cassel does in this film is rare in today's Oscar-caliber films. I recently had the opportunity to watch his film, "Eyes Wide Shut" - again, another independent film in which he gave over 100% of his ability to bring to the screen a genuinely unique character. That is the ability of Vincent Cassell. Yet, in "La Haine", we have two other players that bring even more of a dynamic to this group. Hubert Kounde's performance of Hubert is jaw-dropping. There is this subtle level of intelligence that rounds out our group consisting of himself, the wild-card, and the jokester. Hubert shows that life in the ghettos of France are not just a status symbol, but instead merely abilities to get by. When selling drugs, the money doesn't go towards jewelery or cars, it goes back to his mother to pay the gas bill. In this scene alone, Hubert shows his humanity, while Kassovitz demonstrates the truth behind the scene. Said was equally as good, keeping up with the other two, but for myself, Hubert and Vinz were our stand out roles. They played against themselves so much, that the two of them became closer as the film progressed.Watching Criterion's release of this film, it is impressive how much they put together for this double-disc set. The interview with Jodie Foster is a bit long, but interesting. She talks about her first impressions of the film, and her excitement about bringing "La Haine" to the US of A. While it showed a different side to Paris, the universality of the message Kassovitz was trying to bring to the screen; youth's anger towards leaders, corruption within the police, and unnecessary casualties of protest is still relevant here today. Albeit, the language is different - the message is the same. Kassovitz's audio commentary is a political one, occasionally discussing how the scene was created and the shortfalls of creating a independent film, he talks in length to his experiences within the ghetto, and the truth behind the police in France (as well as its leaders). He also interestingly enough, talks about his influences on this film, and throughout his career. Obviously, you can see the Scorsese references throughout (see "Taxi Driver"), but he talks in length about "Mean Streets", and how that film spoke to him more than any other big-budget Hollywood film he had seen. Included on the second disc are plenty of behind the scene moments as well as extended and deleted scenes that further demonstrate Kassovitz's ability, and how he transformed this color film, into a cinematic triumph.Overall, I love "La Haine", but be forewarned. This is not a "sit-down-on-a-Saturday-with-some-friends-and-a-beer" film. This is a thought-provoking slice of international cinema that demonstrates amazing actors in their craft, a film with a message, and a director who had little to work with, but used what he had with artistic talent. "La Haine" will remain with you long after the short credits roll, the shock of the ending will make you jump again and again (no matter the amount of times seen), and the discussion to follow remains a pivotal part to this film. I cannot watch this film back to back, but when I come across a need to experience cinema as it should be created, "La Haine" will be the first to come to mind. Impressive.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly disappointing look at France's desperate underclass.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel bad that I wasn't as knocked out by this movie as much as most other viewers, but I must give an honest reaction. 'La Haine' looks at roughly twenty four hours in the lives of three young friends of various ethnic backgrounds who live in the suburbs of Paris. It is the morning after a riot and tensions run high. A buddy of theirs is in hospital after a police beating, and one of them (Vincent Cassel, 'Dobermann') the volatile Viz finds a cops gun. His mates are the more level headed boxer Hubert (Hubert Kounde) and the charming rogue Said (Said Taghmaoui, 'Three Kings'). This is a gritty, depressing and presumably realistic look at France's desperate underclass. The three leads are all very good. Cassel is a major star in France ('The Brotherhood Of The Wolf',etc.) but the real stand out for me is the charismatic Taghmaoui, who after this and a memorable role in 'Three Kings' has the potential to be an international success. 'La Haine's heart is in the right place and the ending is powerful and unexpected, but overall I felt it seemed overly familiar and a bit too shallow. Even so it's a movie worth watching despite having almost unreadable subtitles on the video version I saw. If you want to see another even more disturbing look at racism and hatred in modern day France I highly recommend Gaspar Noe's 'Seul contre tous' ('I Stand Alone') which almost makes this look like a feel-good teen comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know everyone liked this film, but probably none have been around Arrondissements like 18. This is not Mean Streets but a couple of lame dudes who would have been beaten with bats had they lived in Brooklyn or Bronx. The movie is a great example of why we need Arrondissements like 18, to keep these hooligans penned up. It does not even come close to Battle for Algiers in terms of cinema verite realism. There are much better French films than this pretentious attempt.Sure lighting and black/white photography was great, direction great, actors superb but there was no really original story or insight. The handling of the three main actors was really very, very well done: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaui - talk about three amigos. But script seemed very flat... as they just bum around from one scene to the next being stupid with little or no insight. No real insight into their lives, families, other friends, environment. They are simply pugs with no original thoughts other than, "I got to get out of here". ! Brilliant. They sure knew how to navigate the art opening.Film Formula: take some skin heads, bad cops, some pugs, the projects as background: stir, walla ! a movie. But if no one has been near the real deal and only read about it..oh, my gosh honey...look at their conditions! "And such one dimensional characters. See what the projects create"No insight whatsoever except standard clichés which to white people are 'oh so enlightening". Really. Do you talk about this 'insightful' movie at wine and cheese art openings. Somehow the film represents 24 hrs in their lives. It feels more like 72 hours.Go see Banksy instead. You will be well rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the youth Abdel goes to the hospital in coma due to a battering he receives at the police station, there are riots in the outskirts of Paris and one policeman loses his revolver. On the next morning, the Arab Said (Sa?d Taghmaoui) summons his Jewish friend Vinz (Vincent Cassel) and they meet the black boxer Hubert (Hubert Koundé) in the slum where they live. Soon Vinz shows the missing gun that he found in the night before and he tells that if Abdel dies, he will revenge his friend killing a police officer. The trio of troublemaker and pothead friends head to the downtown of Paris where they spend the day asking for trouble. On the end of the long night, tragedy happens.The awarded "La Haine" is an impressive French movie that follows along 24 hours, the lives of three idle friends from a poor suburb of Paris that belong to a lost generation. I saw this movie in the 90's and today I have decided to see it again to compare the situations shown in the movie with what is recently happening in Brazil with several riots and it is amazing the similarities: lost youths with neither instruction nor job; unprepared and brutal police force; low quality of life in the slums or ghettos in the outskirts of the big cities (in Brazil, there are several slums also in the noble areas). The only difference is basically that France belongs to the First World and Brazil to the Third World; the rest is identical. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Ódio" ("The Hate")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A French Classic of Indie Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie floored me when I saw it about 8 years ago. I was alone, stoned, and ready for a decent foreign film. Black and white, one great freaking soundtrack, amazing amateur acting, a very real script, and just a blazing atmosphere set this movie apart from almost every indie film in the last 20 years. a mixture of race had to be done to achieve the mentality of youth in a "ghetto" culture like this. I grew up in Echo Park, Compton, and in a sprawling, nasty, dirty, section of Indianapolis when I was much younger. I know how these kids felt. I was a white boy screwing around with a couple of black kids smoking jays, causing a little bit of havoc, and just seeing what our city had to offer. Cops were rarely a problem, but I do know that race profiling is real. Even if you are white. Screw racist cops.The ending is one of the most abrupt and BEST endings I have ever seen. I saw it on VHS, and when it was done, my jaw was still dropped after the snow had hit the screen a few minutes after credits had rolled. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment was at one time deleted by IMDb based on an abuse report filed by another user. So I've edited it a bit.Three youths from disparate racial backgrounds united against the "real" enemy - the police and therefore, by extension, French society itself. The kids together fighting The Man. Right on!The attitude of the outcasts may be correct and the film has great style but I always suspected this film was a liberal fantasy, it has taken ten years but recent history has shown it for what it is. The recent riots in France have shown that. Where were all the Jewish youths burning cars along with the Muslim youths? Nowhere it seems.I see since I first posted this 4 out of 5 people weren't happy about it. So what is the point of disagreement? Are Jewish youths in fact fighting the police in France and burning thousands of cars every year? If they are I would be glad to have some factual evidence of that.So when the evidence shows up for whites and Jews joining Arabs and Africans in the daily violence in France I'll be sure to add it to this comment.Indeed where is that evidence?

		<fullReview>Once we were eating out in the "Flunch" in Strasbourg. It was Sunday afternoon, so people around us were in that sort of relaxed, world-loving, quiet, Sunday mood. Until three young " les beurs" came. Apparently, they were completely unable to behave themselves: they were swearing, shouting at each other. That lasted for couple of minutes until they turned a tray with their food on the floor. A waitress came up to them and asked them to leave. Why am I telling this? Because I don't know what is the problem with the society. Someone, explain me, why these kids don't go to schools, don't read, don't try to do anything to fit into society, but they want everyone to be tolerant towards them? I know that bus drivers are scared to go to certain neighbourhoods in Strasbourg, I know that on New Year night to "banlieus" compete with each other which one will burn down more cars."La Haine" tells a story. What I really liked about this movie, that it is very honest. Yes, police, sometimes is unacceptably cruel, but as Cousin Hub says: "There is always a good cop and a bad cop". He and Said'd elder brother, are the only ones who to some extent understand what is happenning in their life and try to find reasonable ways to deal with that, well "Le flic beur" too. They move, they try to put some sense in their lives.Hostility - is the normal reaction of the inhabitants of cozy and safe hoods to the strangers who have all the potential to break this safety.Remember that episode, when Vinz, Hub and Said came to look for Asterix? Vinz started screeming at the lady who answered him with a joke. How did she feel then? Is this her fault that Vinz does drugs and sees cows? There is a proverb in Russian: "You don't go to another convent with your laws".Apparently many people from ghetto try to do that. They want rights, but not responsibilities. Definitely, a society must find the way to deal with this violence, but it has to be a mutual process. I think, I went a little bit off-topic, I am not commenting the movie itself. But the truth is "La Haine" is full of questions that have no one exact and right answer, a solution that will make everyone happy. I was trying to put together the ideas of the movie and my personal experience and opinion.If anyone of the readers has something to tell me, please, e-mail me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark tale about urban violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic principles of this great French arthouse-movie reminded me on some unhappy incidents that happened in the early 1990s in L.A., when a squad of policemen beat a black citizen to death. This desperate mood is transfered on the film perfectly, the tension is marked and you always know that there´s something in the air, although there is no direct outbreak of violence visible. Shot in black/white-pictures the hopelessness and the menacing atmosphere from the ghettos of Paris/France will go under your skin and the characters and their behaviour are much more understandable than in cliché-loaded flicks like "American History X", "Kids" or similar stuff like that!

		<fullReview>I saw 'La Haine' a few years ago in Sydney, Australia when I enrolled at the local Alliance Francaise. I think I saw it a dozen times. Now, I now live Manila and I can't find a copy! I absolutely love this film, the director and the actors. The editing is great as well as the black and white photography. This film is one of the reasons why I became a filmmaker. If only I could my hands on a DVD of "la Haine' !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hate breeds hate... and a legend is born</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen anything like this one. The first image strikes us right in the face: the world, lost in a emptiness of black, is covered by the blowing slo-mo flames of a cocktail molotov. The story may look simple. But that is the exact way it wants to be. Here we have a journey into the places hate lives. Here we journey through the deep entrails of hate, which grows, and cannot be stopped. When you think everything is right, everything is wrong. When you find peace, war seeks us. Here we are close-up to the ghettos we want to avoid, at the same time people who live there are always thinking of revenge, even if they are subject of social and physical abuse. Technically the movie is genius, beautifully shot in black and white, with a great music selection and three great leads, which look and think like they were really from the streets. Some scenes stroke me particularly (the opening shot, the camera wandering over the rooftops as the music spreads, the final scene) and will still strike me in the future. This movie has also a great amount of juice to be drunk, and requires multiple viewings to be seen properly. A work of genius, which reflects the quality of young values when they are given the proper treatment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncomfortable indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, where shall I begin?I saw this movie for the first time some years ago and was immediately struck by the thought that this was not an acting movie but a documentary of some sort. However, it is an acting movie and quite an astounding one indeed. The one thing I noticed was that the actors used no character names but their own! An odd but very effective tool for making the intense and improvised dialogues more realistic. Furthermore the movie is entirely black &amp; white erasing many of the emotion-enhancing colour effects and it takes place in the timespan of a single day. All of the above makes small but important add-ons to the overall impression and dark undertones throughout the picture.This movie is about hate. Its also about how kids of today act as individuals and in groups. Sometimes its all boredom but hey, that´s how it is. I guess the red line in this movie is about what hate does to us. The rookie policeman knows no hate. Watch him as he has to watch what he does not want to see. Try to pry into his mind. What will he become? What does the man in the public toilet really mean?See the movie through. See it one more time, then try to make up your mind about what you´ve seen. Do you feel sympathy or antipathy? And what really happens in the end?Only you have the answers. One thing is clear though, it will not leave you untouched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I been as moved as in the last minute of "La Haine", that one scene summed up the whole movie. I would tell you about it but I wouldnt want to give away anything. This movie demonstrated how dangerous guns and power can be (guns also used as a metaphor for power), and most of all how dangerous hate can be. It was not a movie about killing cops for the sake of killing cops, it demonstates that not all cops are bad with the arab cop who bails Sayid out of jail. Had it just portrayed cops as being fascists I feel the whole movie would have come off as ignorant. I also enjoyed watching each characters prejudices unfold throughout the film. The acting was (and I know i'm going out on a limb her) better than any other film ever. The cinematography was also amazingly-astounding. This could be my favorite film of all time, easily the best foreign film of all time. 1000 stars out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tough, honest and human film thankfully not drenched in sentimentality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first sight, La Haine seems a film very much of its time. But it manages to break out of this accusation by focusing on the emotions of its characters. Set the day AFTER a Parisian riot (unlike most other films, which lead up to a riot as a kinetic, cinematic climax), the three main characters deal with the hospitalization of a friend by the police in startlingly different ways, despite their common background of prejudice and disillusion. It's the play between the three that makes the film, as over the space of 24 hours the viewer comes to understand their frustration - almost siding with them in the battle - before the denouement brings home the reality of the actions of both sides - the authorities and the protagonists. Filled with too many 'Oh no' moments for comfort, it's not a film that will make you feel warm and happy, but it still evokes a sense of hope that tough, honest and above all human films can be made these days without being drenched in sentimentality.</fullReview>

La Haine has the all the ingredients for a classic, it is funny, tragic and extremely hard hitting. It combines police brutally with every day life, and highlights the hopelessness that young people in the "banlieus" feel. Talking about this film, I have heard mixed reactions, but if you can relate to what is going on then it is, to coin a well used phrase, "a must see movie". 10/10 in my books!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must-see film of the 90's. Although the themes of alienated youth, urban depression and violence have been tackled before, rarely has it been done with such style and assurance. As a directors first film it defies belief. From the opening, metaphysical parable, to the final, shocking gut-wrenching scene, this film oozes class. The performances are flawless, the sound-track superb and the set-piece scenes just blow you away (the fly-by shot though the estate with NWAs Fuck tha Police mixing with Je Ne Regrette Rien, or the break-dancers in the burnt-out warehouse). Funny, touching, and gripping by turns, the grainy black and white just adds to the mood. Films like this don't come around too often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical realism poetic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La haine is an excellent movie a great proof that the old poetic oneiric movie-making is still alive. all the scenes in the movie are pure poetry transmitting this mysteriousness behind their symbols. Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote "as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense.

Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the "heart aching" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, "HATE", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great French Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass.La Haine is a French black-and-white drama/suspense film written, co-edited, and directed by Kassovitz and it features Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé, Sa?d Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili and Solo.Vinz, who is Jewish, Hubert, who is Black, and Said, who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy.La Haine is a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.Kassovitz's iconic film about race, violence, and class struggle is both rousing entertainment and brilliant film making.And he mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.A great film indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>La haine is written and directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. It stars Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé and Sa?d Taghmaoui. Original music is by Assassin and cinematography by Pierre A?m. When a local youth is beaten unconscious by the police, a riot ensues on his Parisian estate during which a policeman loses his gun. As tensions rise, the gun is found by Vinz (Cassel) who proclaims that he will kill a cop if the beaten youth dies.This is not Paris, surely? Where's all the beloved tourist sites and bohemian streets? Of course some way away from this Parisian suburb Paris thrives, but this is a real place, real heat and real hate. Shot in striking black and white, using firebrand young actors and giving them urban wit, angst and aggression, Kassovitz serves up a powder-keg of a movie. It's a portrait of a multiracial community thrust together by one act of police aggression, but the underlying themes of boredom, prejudice and the escalation of hate drip from every tension fuelled frame. The youth characterisations are rich and intelligently drawn (wonderfully performed by the three principals), but the outer edged characters impact greatly as well, even in the most unusual of places like a gents toilet. Layered over the top of it all is a vibrant rap and reggae soundtrack; perfect. Thematically we have seen it all before in cinema, in fact this feels like a composite of Spike Lee, Larry Clark, Martin Scorsese, John Singleton and Alan Clarke films, but it's still very much its own animal, a French concrete jungle where the heat is piercing but the sun can't be seen. As riots continue to blight parts of the world, La haine is still relevant and still packing a punch today. Incendary and grim for sure, but riveting and essential in the pantheon of urban decay cinema. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Script, acting, direction, camera-work, editing - even soundtrack - all superb. An amazing film that (literally) blew me away.Vincent Cassel, brooding and preening, posing like Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver, flexes his muscles and his attitude in the mirror. He and his Paris suburb estate hoodlum chums have a gun that was stolen from a cop during a riot the night before. Their mate is in hospital, dangerously ill after being beaten up by police.They vow that should their friend (Abel) die, then Vinz (Cassel) will shoot a policeman in retaliation. This all sounds pretty heavy stuff and at times, it is. But, thankfully, a witty and chaotic night awaits the three youths as they miss the last Metro home and we are treated to all sorts of mishaps and lewd behaviour. Then, at dawn, after skinheads try to beat them up, the police move in to arrest them...Believe me, this is one hell of a movie and is almost faultless and is up there with any crime drama, from any director and anywhere.</fullReview>

This isolation isn't just the problem of our era but its consequents can never be seen so explicitly. The camera, colour and the character choices are very well chosen. The attitude of the director about the movie isn't precluding the enjoyment of watching a movie. This can be seen in the scenario which is realistic, humorous and unpredictable.The acting of all three actors is superb and very suitable for the ideas, conflicts and feelings of real mankind.The story isn't just containing a day and a night of a three friends but it certainly uncovers the nature of violence by a cop rifle which determines the criminal and guilt.At the end I must admit that the music was very beautiful and astonishing.The beginning with Bob Marley and the scene of Cut Killer in the neighborhood is unforgettable.

		<fullReview>LA HAINE is a film that really needs to say something. That really needs to shout something. You can tell that since the beginning. When you get a series of black and white images of riots, with Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin'" as the background music (a perfect choice, certainly), you know you're into some serious stuff. Indeed, this movie deals with strong stuff: it's about a group of three friends who live in the suburbs of Paris, France. The word "suburbs" is certainly highly associated with constant crime, drugs, and riots. Our characters are in the middle of all of this, influenced by all of this. I just love when movies succeed in the end in saying exactly what they wanted. Think in American HISTORY X for that sort of point. LA HAINE does that, and it's just great. Also, it is one of the most unique movies out there, since as a "social drama" it still brought to my mind a movie like Kevin Smith's CLERKS. Why? The reason is that here we have a lot of time the "characters doing nothing" kind of thing. We see some moments of an entire day of our three main characters. One can imagine we are seeing the most relevant moments of their day. The day is the day after a huge riot, which started because a police officer seriously damaged a young man during the course of an interrogation, sending him to the hospital. So, there's lots of tension, and the main thing is that Vincent Cassel's character (Vinz) says that if the man in the hospital dies (which is very probable), he will "avenge" him by killing a cop. I said we see the most relevant moments of the day of our characters. We see, for instance, how a kid from around there relates to Vinz stuff about a TV show and how Vinz fails when he tries to cut in a nice way the hair of his mate Said (Said Taghmaoui). Yes, the day of the three is sometimes just a pretty darn normal one, hence my thought in a movie like the one of Kevin Smith. For many moments we can forget, together with them, about all the existing tension. All of this is perfectly done, with a great tone of humor (I would use the word "hilarious" for the two moments I just mentioned), and a great, and very natural, interaction between the actors. This helps a lot to make of Vinz, Said and Hubert truly unforgettable characters. Is all great here, great filmmaking (look for that scene when Vinz sees a murder outside a bar)? it's simply a must-see. Unforgettable stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rude Awakening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does one need to put a magnificent story into real act, to release a set of encrusted emotions and channel it to a vivacious flow? Passion? Love? A strong need to convey a message? Mattieu Kassovitz combined all those three plus a myriad of other motivation-driven tricks to embody the ambiance of a society torn by inner insecurity, grudge and hardly suppressed hatred. "La Haine" represents a 24 hours trip in the bowels of a modern decline fortified by volatile urge to express oneself, smothered in its formative stages by the uncompromising fist of a racist slogan: "We don't need you, because you don't belong here..." A truly heart-shattering, compelling and vivid effort, "La Haine" is a veritable apotheosis of suffering. Suffering inbred as a mental handicap of those of the 'cite', suffering as a result of deprivation, suffering in the midst of an isolated cesspit - a rake well of obtuse silence, suffering for the sake of suffering. For the will to refuse changing yourself, the brave stance in battling conformism results in tragedy. A tragedy expected that is. A tragedy as the only way to salvage what "they" have been stealing from you - the belief in the right to live and exist as a free person. Because in modern France slavery may be a term out-of-hand yet it has mutated rabidly into forms not less hideous and cruel as the affirmative alienation and deep resent that is aimed towards the immigrants and their spawn. Those who had a major role in building modern France of le tour d'Eiffel, the speed arrow train facilities, the outstanding port 'd'Marseille' has been treated as a subhuman breed for years. Kassovitz is extremely socially conscious and in the same time purely conscientious in his effort to picture the inevitable collision of the disaffected Arab, African, etc. youth born in France yet devoid of the right (and rather unwilling) to be accepted as a part of an arrogant, narcissistic and self-sufficient "white pride" society. Through their friendship and attitude towards the surrounding air of neglect and complacency Vinz, Hubert and Sayid evolve as a separate entity - a true embodiment of the stark denial, perennial mistrust and exasperation which are sifting through the ghetto concrete around the French "problematic" blocks. A spontaneous urge to draw the line between the French communes and American hoods which has always indulged vast media coverage thus turning to a sort of a dream vision medium where bling bling and crack cocaine co-exist and complement each other as if one could benefit and make a glorious living of dealing drugs while sporting all the landmarks of a true "ghetto-blaster" - fast cars, fast women, jewelry, a never-ending party time rises. The French 'banlieue' presents us with a whole lot of dramatically sobering reality - the ugly blocks of flats soaring high in the sky, crumbling and grey, stone-cold in their dumb silence - fearsome cages of a humbled spiritual leap into nothingness, the mosques - a place to reunite and seek God's advice on how to escape from the uncompromising void outside, the dim streets - veritable lairs of violence, petty crime and corruption and of course swarming around those prerequisites of a modern French suburb there is a motley crowd. One can sense its energy, a picture throbbing with vitality and pristine emotions. As if we stare at a wild animal caged in captivity by its civil-spoken master. The American ghetto image has been used for ages to cash in and idolize a vast array of show business entertainers while the French 'cite' with its ingenious combative spirit, reluctance to reform and profound resentment for the authorities has always stood as a thorn in the regime of power's flesh. Mattieu Kassovitz managed to capture the vibe of a modern French suburb and its mess of low-income housing and low self-esteemed tenants. I have watched "La Haine" probably on six or seven occasions and I am still able to perceive new striking details with each spin of the wheel. I strongly suggest that you read what others think of the movie in IMDb.com reviews repository. Many stressed exactly on the fact that watching "La Haine" again and again proves to be a reward experience. For beneath the surface of a simple yet tragic story one is about to discover easily a fathomless abyss of tragically enormous question marks and yet in the same time figure out a short set of simple answers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ladies and gentlemen, this movie is a masterpiece.I first saw it in my High School French class, and even with kids passing notes and whispering in class, I was still moved. The acting is flawless. Not every line is completely verbatim, but that's what makes it so good. Each piece of dialect is real and passionate. What I found even more breathtaking was the shots. Each scene is artfully filmed, with certain characters placed on certain sides for a specific reason. Not to mention the ending, which is incredibly shocking and heart retching. I was left with my jaw on the floor.I urge everyone to see this movie. If you don't speak French, watch it with English subtitles. It's truly incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A GREAT bit of French Rough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see this movie, do not bother to look for deeper sociological meanings to the action(s). They are there by the bucket load, but give your brains a rest and just enjoy the experience of watching a superbly made and acted movie about 24 hours in the lives of 3 friends in Paris. The action is raw, violent, shocking and wholly in keeping with the life(s) imposed on these young men. The 3 actors are outstanding, particularly a young angry Vincent Cassel whose Vinz reminds you of the best of Brando and De Nero. There are similarities between this movie and the American cult classic "The Warriors" inasmuch as both deal with the desire to "Go Home" but this is more breathtaking in it's finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High-Quality Delivery of a Story of Significant Cultural Importance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since his hard-hitting debut, Mathieu Kassovitz seems to have become caught up in Hollywood and Hollywood-style action adventure projects, entirely unlike his debut. However, this entrance, La Haine, is an intense time-tabled portrait of three very identifiably characterized young friends in an impoverished multi-ethnic housing project in the aftermath of a great riot. Exceedingly powerful French flamethrower Vincent Cassel, who plays a Jew, is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win street cred by killing a cop, and molds himself after De Niro in Taxi Driver. Sa?d Taghmaoui is a cheery and chatty Arab who attempts to work as peacemaker and tries to find a balance between his two friends' reaction to the world around them. Hubert Koundé is a black boxer and drug dealer. Most quiet and sensitive of the three, he sorrowfully contemplates the ghetto and the surrounding spawn of hate, wanting just to escape the degenerate atmosphere of brutality and hatred but lacks the resources. The three actors play characters who share their first names, which is an interesting touch because it is a quick and easy way for them to familiarize each other to the extent of being tightly bonded friends, as they address each other reflexively even in front of the camera. A friend of theirs has been brutalized by the police after a riot and lies in a coma. Vincent finds a cop's gun lost in the riot. He vows that if their friend dies from his injuries, he will use it to kill a cop.This sets off events that take the three down a foreboding and fatalistic path of destruction. Kassovitz plunges into his intentions by creating an innately realistic and unabashedly gritty capsule. Aside from being shot in stark black and white, which is almost reminiscent of Louis Malle's Elevator to the Gallows, his script does not work like conventional clockwork. The characters do not follow the story, but vice versa. After an intense chapter of the movie in which the three are profiled by police in central Paris, where they are clearly distinguishable as fish out of water, the film slows to their speed as they wander, sit and brood.As an American, I think La Haine is of significant cultural importance because just as foreigners see American films and develop the impression that we are all rich and surrounded by scenic and urban gloss and beauty, Americans see other cultures in the same misunderstood light, one of these cultures being French. This film distinguishes a substantial pocket of France that shares with the United States the racial unrest, white privilege, minority discrimination and profiling, and socially burdened rage instilled generationally and traditionally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, but certainly watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes when watching a particular film, be it a good one or a bad one, it is impossible to get a similar film out of one's mind. Such was the case when I viewed writer/director Mathieu Kassovitz's Hate. Hate reminded me in many ways of Walter Hill's 1979 cult favorite The Warriors. Both films take place over a 24 hour period and both concern tough guy-type young men (a young gang in Hill's film) who must find a way to make it back home while avoiding trouble with the police as well as other antagonists (skinheads in Hate, rival gangs in The Warriors). While The Warriors was more action-oriented than Hate, the main journey in both pictures remains the same, as does the attitude of the characters. The characters in The Warriors, being gang members, are not good role models. Likewise, the protagonists in Hate, Vinz, Hubert, and Said, aren't the most savory of characters either. They constantly try to pick fights, argue, and insult each other mercilessly. This is where Hate encounters a bit of a problem. While Walter Hill is considered somewhat of a master with tough guy talk, Kassovitz doesn't seem to have much of an ear for such dialog. Throughout Hate, it seems whenever Kassovitz doesn't know what a character should say, he simply has them spit out a mouthful of profanities, whether they make sense or not. The routine gets tired quickly. Tough characters in films are known for having foul mouths, but there's a certain lazy and amateurish quality to the way it is placed in the dialog here. Kassovitz was clearly trying to write characters similar to those in Martin Scorsese's pictures (there are a few nods to Taxi Driver). It didn't work out too well. Half the time, the characters sound like a bunch of twelve-year-old boys cursing, like they only recently discovered swearing. At certain points, I actually felt embarrassed for the actors as the words in the script made them look bad. However, when Kassovitz sticks to his own sort of style and doesn't try to push the tough guy talk on the audience, the dialog seems more natural and clever. There's a scene where the three main characters discuss various cartoon characters from Tom and Jerry to Sylvester and Tweety. In that scene, the dialog works because there is a better flow along with a more distinct feeling of voice from Kassovitz. Another nice dialog exchange comes when the three guys attempt to steal a car, only to be stalled over an argument about who should drive. In this moment, the three come across as real friends. The argument itself seems real as it's a conversation that friends have with each other all the time. It is in these instances that Hate is a good film. In these moments, the characters and dialog work, bringing a strong sense of reality to the proceedings and strengthening the relationship between the trio.That being said, the best moment of Hate is one that doesn't seem grounded in reality at all. Throughout Hate, Vinz talks about seeing a cow walking on the streets except nobody truly believes him. Later, Vinz, as well as the audience, sees the cow walking. It's absurd, but also mesmerizing in a what-is-going-on sort of way. The scene could have been out of place and stupid yet somehow Kassovitz makes the scene work within the context of the rest of the picture. The cow makes for an awe-inspiring visual, one unlike any I've seen in any other movie. There are many way ones could interpret the cow and it is certainly symbolic in terms of Vinz's state of mind at that point in the story, but it works just as well to pretend that the cow is real. With all the craziness going on involving the riots, police corruption, and random violence, a cow wandering in the middle of nowhere surprisingly doesn't seem like a gigantic stretch of disbelief. With everything else going on, it could be possible.There is an awful lot that goes on during the 24 hours in which Hate takes place, so much that it would be hard to mention it all here. Some of what happens is interesting, some of what happens feels too familiar to be all that compelling. From a technical standpoint, Hate works. From a story standpoint, Hate could have used a bit more work. As it is, it is a watchable, occasionally compelling, little drama with a few nice dialog moments and some unique visuals.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surely there can be no hate for La Haine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember the first time I saw La Haine (simply 'Hate' in English). It was about three years ago; during the second month of the first year of my degree in film studies. Up until this point in my life, I hadn't really been the sort to actively track down and watch foreign films, never mind foreign language films. But viewing La Haine then and going into that screening having never heard of the film and having never seen any scenes from it prior to the screening, I can safely say this film changed all that. This was one of the few times on the course in which nobody, and I mean nobody, walked out of a screening ? we all sat and watched, a little stunned but thoroughly engaged throughout. When the final act of violence arrived in the final scene, one person in the audience even let out a feint obscenity ? something that no other film on the degree moved anyone else, at least sitting near me, to do.Such was and still is the power of La Haine, a film that I purchased on DVD the following summer and have viewed a couple of times since ? each time the film retaining that gritty first impression. Right from the off, the film gives us that juxtaposed feeling that will continue throughout the experience. Scenes and footage of riots on the streets of Paris are presented with a mellow if not slightly upbeat Reggae song playing over the top of it conflicting the nasty images with the sweetly sounding music. It is an idea the film carries throughout its runtime but is one more focused on specific characters and their actions more than anything. After the credits have ended, the first shot is a hair raising slow track into the face of Sa?d (Taghmaoui). Sa?d has his eyes closed and the accompanying sound effect is an eerie echoing noise. His eyes open just as the camera gets to him and then flicks round to end up behind his head; his point of view. We see what he sees: police officers and dogs lined up against a series of police vans. I feel this is the film immediately suggesting we see the film through his eyes; through his perspective and the eerie sound effects as well as the fact his eyes are initially closed suggest an air of anonymity as we enter his mindset.But the film does not revolve around Sa?d for the entire duration. His two friends complete a threesome of young Frenchmen; one of which is of North African descent (Hubert, played by Hubert Koundé) and Vinz, (played by Vincent Cassel) who is of Jewish descent. Notice how these actors and their Christian names are the same as their character's, suggesting a neo-realistic approach. But when we shift to these perspectives, it is to remind us that Hubert has a dream to get out of the suburb he is in and when we focus on Vinz half way through the film for certain reasons, we do so to highlight the dangers a young, white male in these areas of Paris faces. When we cut to Vinz for this sequence, he says so very little but he will witness in this time a shooting, a murder and a further example of risks of influence to young males going down a similar route when an even younger male than himself tries to copy him smoking in a cinema.The fact of the matter is that La Haine is a film that employs several different techniques and ideas to the idea that three kids on their own are punching well above their weight. On the surface, the film would like us to think the police are the 'bad guys' but there are no 'bad guys' in European cinema and La Haine sort of invites us to see both sides of the argument. Yes the film is shot from the perspective of the youths and yes, director Kassovitz was inspired to do the film through an act of police brutality but Hubert's gym was trashed during the rioting presumably by the youths and the plain clothed policeman that pops up at various points in the film is fair, level headed and put across as an upstanding guy who will help the kids when they need it and shake their hands afterward.It would be too easy to be seduced by the antics of Sa?d, Hubert and Vinz and it would be too easy to say their activities are glamorised by the film. When you break the film down, being arrested; interrogated and humiliated; having someone pressure you into playing Russian Roulette; having to take drugs to escape reality and getting into life or death situations with skinheads does not sound like the sort of roster you'd want to be apart of. But then again La Haine does carry a very distinct air of the documentary. In the background people, presumably real, watch on from ground level and apartment windows as the actors act and the camera rolls; the camera itself is hand-held adding to the urgency of certain situations.The film carries a certain atmosphere. Is Vinz perhaps schizophrenic? The first time we see his character is a bizarre dance-dream sequence and he constantly talks of seeing a cow in the streets, maybe he's hallucinating? This added with the fact he carries a gun the whole time and is easily aggressive adds a whole new sub-dimension to the film: something to get distracted by and yet it never takes centre stage. La Haine is a film that remains powerful and engaging every time I see it, plus it just carries that air that films like this don't get made anymore and that is a great shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hubert (Hubert Koundé): Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land! Society is in free fall. There have been at least 300 "accodental" deaths at the hands of the French police. The current President of France considers the minorities in France to be "scum." This is the story of three of these minority youth and 24 hours in their life after another was murdered by a French policeman.Mathieu Kassovitz (Crimson Rivers, Gothika) has directed a masterpiece showing the youth that are alienated from their parents with their love of rap music and American films, and a culture that is alienated from those in society that are consumed with their incomes, and cars, and fancy houses.The film stars three fantastic actors: Vincent Cassel (Ocean's Twelve &amp; Thirteen, Crimson Rivers, Brotherhood of the Wolf), Hubert Koundé (The Constant Gardener), and Sa?d Taghmaoui (The Kite Runner, Hildago). Watching 24 hours in their search for meaning was both funny and sad. Considering that they represent thousands all over the world makes you cry.The photography by Pierre A?m was magnificent."The peacemakers, those who are supposed to spread democracy and justice on behalf of our sate and self-satisfied societies, are spreading death, contempt, racism, and humiliation. They are creating a world of hate." -- Costa Gravas This is an important film that will stand the test of time; a classic that will remind us of what we are doing; and a warning to change direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect yet harrowing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely is a film so perfect and utterly flawless as this. Not only does it bring the harsh reality about life in the french suburbs (les bonlieus)into light, it also contains a plot in which many of us younger and troubled youths can relate to.It is a film which depicts trouble, hatred (hence the title)and the struggles in life for the social under classes in society. Freedom is also represented with a certain brutality, which the film, through being shot in black and white, represents brilliantly (somewhat reminiscent of Schindler's List.)This also aids the film by using black and white as a metaphor for the situation of racism in France, which the film (I think) is intended to portray.I can not comment further on this other than to say it is A MUST SEE film,a beautiful film and one that has deserved all the critical acclaim and success it has received.</fullReview>

Of course some people would say that it's just another caricature of the french Banlieu, but I think that even if it's a little bit clichet, the atmosphere and the every hour reality is cleverly shown. The actors' play is lively and entertaining... The three different and complementary mentalities of the main characters gives a real balance all the way through.

		<shortDescription>A French bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A French bomb that blows a hole through all the images of berets, baguettes, cancans, cafes, Deneuves, Delphys, Depardieus and French film from Jean Renoir to Jean le Florette, which has at times rather tiresomely persisted in projecting. This is France's answer to Scorsese and Spike Lee. "This is the story about a guy who falls off the top of a 50 storey building(or the Eiffel Tower)," recounts one of the film's heros."As he is falling, he is telling himself,'So far, everything is fine....so far, everything is fine' But in the end he has to land." Kassovitz tells the story of that descent through 24 hours in the lives of three friends, a symbolic trio of Black, Arab and Jew. Hubert, Said and Vinz are homeboys for whom home is one of the countless suberbs outside Paris, The housing estates, shoe boxes or pigeon holes if you ask me. They are members of that singularly exclusive class which Presisent Chirac labelled les exclus: unemployed drifters who hang out, get high, steal the odd car, deal the odd deal. Their friend Abdel is on death's door after being beaten during a police interrogation, a night of rioting has ensued and now the cite is in a state of siege. And now it is Vinz not the Cops who have the gun, lost by one of the riot police during the insurgence. Stumbling upon it has transformed atimid teenager who "feels like an ant lost in an intergalactic space" into a swaggering Titan, rumescent with power, a rebel with, at last, a cause. This is black and white cinematography, bursting with rhythm, almost schizophrenic in its scope, this is La Haine and a hugely effecting film it is. Frozen in boredom and slow motion shots of Hubert hitting a punching bag, all gleaming sweat. An accelerated montage of the frantic mob backed by Bob Marley's music that turns banal televised violence into a massive mournful, comunal dance. the rappers do a different kind of dance, and the camera ups the tempo chasing jumps and pirouettes of such energy and artistry that seem to resurrect a thousand lost hopes. edgily it follows that the three friends who play, joke and provoke because although they are street wise, finally they are only boys and there jokes are about farting and sex. the gags dry up when the boys arrive in Paris. The city's famed charms are lost on them, they are hopelessly alien as the hordes of American tourists, scorned by the girls they try to pull and finally brutalized by a sadistic interrogation officer whose hard-on swells with every blow. The screen screen fills up with a terrible close-up of a face rabid with hatred. It is Vinz, tentatively, fondling the ever present gun, its a chrome-plated Smith and Wesson 44. Vinz is hallucinating about using it on the next cop he passes by. Vinz at the movies, holding up his face to raining images of violence, inviting them to drown him and at the same time empower him. Vinz and a recurring mirage: a lone cow grazing in the cite's concrete fields. In the end, it is Hubert - the trio's voice of reason, the mediator, the one with the most tolerance and faith and the greatest moral sense - who is most inhabited by hatred. the gun is in his hands. The shot reverberates. The screen goes black. The audience does not know who has been shot. and doesn't care. Because in the end, the audience too is inhabited by hatred. This is the story about that falling man....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the time of shooting (1995), the movie shows a remarkable foreseeing given the actual situation in the major french suburban's. It is as if this movie is used as a guideline for the aggressiveness of the last week.If a 10 year old movie is so realistic for today's situation, it can only be a very good movie. And it is a very good movie. The acting is very realistic, the story is very realistic and the shootings in BW gives the movie something extra.I rate it a 9. The movie would have been a 10 if the artistic side of the movie had something in there that made it really special, i.e. some coloured effects to strenghten some scenes (like Sin City has). Worth watching especially at this time if only for trying to understand what's going on in the suburb's of the major European cities.</fullReview>

The end is a bit unexpected too. I wont spoil anything about it though.Although this is quite a dramatic movie, there's also some humor in it. The humor included is actually pretty funny.

Although tainted with tragedy I find La Haine an uplifting experience; the story of friendship through turmoil. I can only fault this film if you see it with subtitles; we know who Asterix and Le Pen are, why change them in the subtitles? Go and see this film;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unrest in the housing projects of France. Three male youths, Vinz, Hub &amp; Sayid represent the multicultural aspect of poverty and desperation found in the projects. Kassovitz captures the boredom with amusement, aided by the creative use of the camera. When the going gets tough the camera jolts you to awareness. But you can never relax when the boys are having a laugh because anything may and can be around the corner, giving you a sense of perspective of their unpredictable lives hanging on razor's edge. Only when the boys venture to the outside world does the film lose its edge, slowing the tension down and showing how the other side differs no less than the projects when it comes to racial intolerance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French version of Boyz N The Hood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quiet possibly one of my favorite ever foreign language films and surely the rebirth of the French film industry that captivated millions around the world for so long. That's why I call this film; the French new wave part 2...To those outside France, it's the French version of Boyz N The Hood, to those in it and to myself, it's a unrestrained urban thriller that moves at such a ferocious pace, you often find yourself on the edge of your seat, clingy on to your arm rest for dear life. Mathieu Kassovitz effectively uses black and white to create art out of the all the crime and violence, mastering a fine tight rope between the rawness of a poor, urban backdrop and a piece of art work that would not look a bit out of place, if it were hung in a gallery next to painting by Picasso. Uncompromising in his attempt to tell a story loosely based on actual events, about riots that lasted for more than 10 years in the French capital, Kassovitz want to portray a story in a manner that makes the whole world stop, not only to serve as mere voyeurs, but instead to actually think.La Haine tells the story of three vastly different and conflicting characters; a Jew, an Arab and an African. That seems to come effortlessly together like a barber shop quartet. As they have to deal with the aftermath of events that lead to a young Arab teenager being beaten into a coma on the outskirts of a riot - Adding fuel to the ever growing, racial and political tension between the people in charge and the powerless individuals of the projects. While most of us feel safe watching violence, as long as it's on TV or film, as we are for the most part detached from what we are experiencing, but instead the aim of for this film, throughout the entire duration of the film, about a world that takes place in the course of one day, which is the time span in the film that seems to last a eternity, we are engrossed in the action throughout, so we are not comfortable or assured at all, instead we are almost bullied into reacting and reciprocate a feeling of tension, as is endured in the film between the cops and the residents of the project. But ultimately the underlying theme of the film is a sense of hopelessness, that is nothing will ever change! It's just a cycle. This is best represented during the opening monologue, and in the final few scenes, as a story is told and narrated, consisting of a man who jumps of a 50 story building, but to reassure himself he keeps repeating "so far, So good, so far, So good" as he hurtles to his death. This is used to show that this never ending cycle of violence and hate is never going to stop, soon enough resulting in society's demises. But no one seems to care. As long as they are surviving, they don't care when it's falling, but when it crashes, that's when they panic. Magnificent, awesome, a compulsive viewing! This is a poignant yet humorous reminder of the harsh reality of people living in the ghettos of France. Boyz N The Hood was a great film, but it is almost eclipsed by this masterpiece and that's saying allot. A must watch. 'The world is ours'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Social-realism with cinematic style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La haine characterised a 90's strand in French cinema where there was a focus on depicting contemporary social issues. A particular point of interest was the banlieue; this is the suburbs of Paris where the working classes were moved to from the 1950's onwards. These housing estates in the outer areas of the city were made up of high-rise blocks and the quality of accommodation was poor. This segregation of the working people from the higher income brackets led to an alienation that was felt especially in the younger generations who only knew this situation. La haine looks at three young men from this very context.After a riot the police lose a gun. This weapon falls into the hands of three young men from the ghetto. These guys represent three ethnic groups prevalent in the banlieue, one is Jewish, one is black and the third is Arabic. This gun gives them a sense of power which they ordinarily do not feel they have. They feel disenfranchised and seeing that France has rejected them they do not look to France for cultural icons; they look to America for this, particularly Hollywood films. This film looks at a highly-charged day in the life of these three young men. It considers what happens when you try to cage an animal. The animal will attempt to fight back. The French riots that happened a decade after this film was released are testimony to the wisdom of this lesson.Mathieu Kassovitz's film isn't just about gritty realism though, as despite the subject matter and urban drama genre, it's a very cinematic film. There are quite a few audacious camera moves and the influence of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets in particular is hard to avoid. Like that film. there isn't really much of a story in La haine, so if this is what you need out of a film then it may disappoint. It's much more of a character and environment study. I guess it's where social-realism meets cinematic style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophy during the riots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>French director Kassovitz was awarded the Palme D'or for Best Director at Cannes 1995, for this film. La Haine (released as Hate in the US) tells the story of a day in the lives of three youngsters, living in a council estate (banlieu) at the outskirts of Paris, in the aftermath of the beating of one of their friends by the police, which had lead to riots and confrontations with the armed forces. The film was shot in black and white, on a very low budget, using many non-professional actors. The scenes are mostly shot on location, in the Parisian suburb of Chanteloup-les-Vignes, with extended use of a hand-held camera, and plenty of stock footage of riots happened in the region in the 10 years preceding the film. The editing is adventurous and dramatic, and this provides a balanced and reliable point of view to the audience, even when the camera point of views are sometime incongruent.The setting of this film is a Parisian banlieu, a term loosely meaning suburb, but which in France assumes a different connotation, because the suburbs of Paris are normally inhabited by lower-income citizens,living in affordable blocks of flats and, in those areas, the social unrest is high, also because normally a high number of immigrants or naturalized citizens live there, almost in a ghetto situation. The movie rides the wave of the atmosphere of social unrest of the early 90's all over Europe, and especially France, Spain and Italy, and, undoubtedly, a lot of the its success arises from this situation. In those years, many so-called Social Centres appeared, and youngsters started to revolve around them, and be active in politics, especially of a left-wing orientation. And a certain type of socially-engaged art started to become stronger and more organized, and it gained consensus; however, the feature possesses high artistic merits, and its place amongst some of the greatest films is definitely deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's not the fall that matters, it's the landing."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Haine (Mathieu Kassovitz, 1995) was one of the movies that got me into movies - along with Star Wars, On the Waterfront and Les quatre cents coups - but I hadn't seen it for a good 10 years. The film, often startlingly directed by Mathieu Kassovitz, traces the lives of three working class kids from a Parisian estate whose lives seem to be heading inexorably towards tragedy as they pose, bicker and pontificate across 24 hours in the big city. Vincent Cassel is the obvious standout in a showy part as a combustible would-be hood who vows to kill a cop if his friend dies following a hospitalising encounter with the law.But just as his Vinz effectively mirrors The Godfather's hotheaded Sonny - albeit with a buzzcut and a mouthiness borne of insecurity - so Hubert Koundé's reluctant rebel follows Michael Corleone's path from model son (of a sort) to law-flouting tough guy - a transition that's shortened from three hours to 10 seconds. And what a 10 seconds it is, as the film's themes dovetail into a hiply-shot but existentially terrifying portrait of a society breeding its own criminals. Co-scripter Sa?d Taghmaoui, the nominal lead, rounds out our central trio as an inquisitive, cheery Maghrebin apparently untainted by his inauspicious surroundings or the impossible hand that life has dealt him - at least until the closing minutes. In fact, though La Haine is dominated in hindsight by where it ends up - and an interrogation sequence that's almost unwatchable - for much of its duration it's a fun ride, with an off-kilter sense of humour that gets its laughs through observation, repetition ("how did they get the car in here?"), surrealism (the cow) and a single, profane anecdote about the difficulties of having a poo whilst being exiled to Siberia.There's a post-Tarantino pop culture conversation about American cartoons that seems forced and out of character for the film, but for the most part the script is bang on, acknowledging that while our (anti-)heroes may be heading for an explosive landing, their journey there is likely to be filled with tragicomic, satiric detail - only some of it apparent to the characters. Kassovitz's directorial ticks and masterful grasp of visual composition drag us through the story, with a sense of timing and an eye for a telling image that augment the compelling story. And the three stars are so perfect in their roles that every time I've seen them since, my first reaction has been to marvel at how they've dragged themselves up from the streets and - oh yeah, they're actors. Seen through the eyes of a young man (I'm now 26), rather than an impressionable teenager, La Haine appears every bit as brilliant, but even more tragic: its protagonists just damaged kids, their minds poisoned by a culture that glamorises the very path they should be avoiding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ghetto, graffiti, and a gun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An intense black and white look into the underbelly of Paris, three youths from the projects are the center of attention in this memorable French film called "La Haine." Taking place over 24 fateful hours, the youths, Vinz, a Jew (Vincent Cassell), Hubert, an African(Hubert Kounde), and Said, an Arab (Said Taghmaoui) all come from differing backgrounds, but the trio, as unlikable as they occasionally are, share a few common bonds: disdain for the police, marijuana, and girls.After riots scorch the projects, a friend of theirs is beaten by corrupt police and claims an explosive Vinz: if their friend dies, a cop dies in his place.The film is a very personal and vivid look into the poor and desperate side of Paris, and for all its worth, the film succeeds in drawing you in, making you shake your head, laugh a bit, and wonder what these youths actually want to accomplish.Like I mentioned earlier, the main characters aren't very likable. They're flawed, ignorant, and harsh. But every once in a while, you see who they are, and how just maybe, they'll live to see their projects change for the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very much a young person's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very much a young person's film both in style and temperament stunningly shot in wide screen monochrome by Pierre Aim and covering 24 hours in the lives of three friends from a Parisian housing estate in the aftermath of a riot in which a fourth member of their clan has been shot and seriously wounded by the police. Fundamental to events is a gun lost by the police and found by Vinz, one of the boys in question, who has vowed that if his friend dies he will kill 'a pig'.It's an exciting, visceral, nihilistic picture influenced by the likes of Scorcese and filmed with much the same documentary like precision that Pontecorvo applied to "The Battle of Algiers" and an influence in turn on the work of British directors like Shane Meadows. A pre-credit prologue in which we are told of a man falling to his death from a 50-storey building should alert us to the fact that no matter what the outcome it isn't likely to be a happy one for anyone concerned. Writer/director Mathieu Kassovitz has no illusions about happy endings and violence and the prospect of a sudden, early death figures large in the lives of the protagonists.It's not a great film; it's too much of a patchwork quilt of outside influences but it is brilliantly made, it's full of energy and it clearly marked out Kassovitz as a director worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid depiction of urban life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gripping foreign-language picture famous for peering behind the tourist facade to show the real face of Paris. It is set in the suburbs and working class projects of the French capital, but in fact the tale feels familiar to almost any city: that of lost youths with no lives to look forward to striking back at the system that contains them.In fact the Paris depicted here has a lot in common with the likes of Glasgow or Edinburgh in Scotland: places of high culture that are also afflicted with a deep-rooted economic poverty and rampant inner-city violence. The explosive riots, the general alienation of the characters when they explore the rich end of the big city. There is also the intrusion, as there is in this country, of the nosey middle-class media types who patronise the working-class world by trying to document it on camera as a slice of 'real-life'. An fractious encounter between the locals of the suburbs and a group of TV journalists captures this exactly.I enjoyed the realism of the narrative, and the casual, natural banter of all of the actors. I don't know how much more (or how less) effective the film would be if shot in colour, but the black-and-white cinematography does the job and conveys the grittiness of the surroundings.There are no pleas for sympathy here or any sentimental twists designed to manipulate the viewer. People and events are depicted just as they are, and it is the raw simplicity of "La Haine" which makes it a compelling and highly watchable picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So simple and so true.. Excellent movie, a must-watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely a must-see, at least for people fluent in french. M. Kassovitz pictures the everyday life of 3 average young guys living in the suburbs of Paris, at a time where the fights between the police and the youth are at their paroxysm. What's really good about this movie is how close to reality it takes you. The characters are simple, they could definitely be your average neighbor, i.e. not especially good-looking or smart or with any kind of hidden gift. The storyline itself honors that: sometimes we see nothing happening around the characters, nothing at all, for minutes. That's enough to make you feel how empty their day can be, but not too long to make you feel bored. The music is minimalist (when there is any music at all) and this fits perfectly.Altought it could seem difficult to get us interested with such realistic, everyday stuff, the plot actually holds us until the end. It's a journey, and we always want to see what's next, and we do get something new every minute. It's totally unpredictable, yet logical and realistic... The character development is excellent, we really get to know the main characters and discover their personality, dreams and fate.Go watch it!Sidenote : I'd mitigate my judgment if you don't speak french, though. The french spoken here not very academic :-) and the translations face the risk to lack some of the 'authenticity' that blesses this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the story of a man. He's falling from a skyscraper and all the way down as he passes each floor, he keeps saying to himself. "So far so good, so far so good, so far so good." how you fall doesn't matter. But it's how you land...And with this the premise is set with a trio of Parisian hoods bent on revenge for an unjustly beaten brother. Blinded by hate the three spiral in on each other looking for redemption. Each through different gains. Vinz (played by the superb Vincent Cassel) is the rough and tumble of the group, who has chanced on a loaded 44. magnum dropped by a police officer in one of the many riots taking place in their neighbourhood, which is by all correct definitions of the word - a war zone.With Sayid and Hubert in toe, he hatches his desire to gun down a cop with his own gun. To gain the highest of respect and to satisfy his rage which slowly builds throughout this one fateful day.It's quite a shattering picture. Shot in a brash black and white, and with plenty of referral to other movies.Example: Taxi Driver - Vinz in the mirror, fingers splayed like a gun... "Are you talking to me?" Scarface - A constant - The world is yours poster wherever they roam Raging Bull - Black n White, with boxing thrown in at some intervals. Cape Fear - Smoking cheekily in a cinema...but it ain't a thief. It's a great user of such pictures. Sort of playing homage to the heights of violent cinema, but always remaining original, thought-provoking and splattered with some scathing humour. It's brilliant in a word. And worthy of applause.</fullReview>

I attempted to watch it without subtitles as my French is usually good enough to enjoy TV &amp; film without, but I soon realised that I was missing too much due to the rapid fire slang and Parisian sub-cultural references. I would say that the English subtitles are a great help for following the story, but they do not really do an adequate job of conveying the linguistic style, grit and wit of the film. This is a shame because this film should be appreciated by as many people as possible! One thing I particularly liked is the use of the background as plot elements. The various tags and graffiti add to the pervasive aggression and irony for this apparently future-less group... look out for Vinz framed by a Perrier advert for example.I really do feel that this is a "must see" film and can't believe that there are people who reviewed it that couldn't see its merit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>about la Haine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mateiu Cassovitz's Le Haine is shows the banleiue of France in an entirely new way, especially considering the recent trends in french cinema. Although influenced by Spike lees do the right thing the issue of racism isn't hugely elaborated on except by the nationalities of the three protagonists. The issue of police brutality is more important but shown in a less unbaised way than generally presumed as all three boys do do drugs and steal although this is presented as inconsequential. In my view the film largely focus's on the problems of kids from the banlieue being excluded from the rest of the country. This is shown by using wide angle and normal lenses in the banlieue and Paris, respectively. Several scenes hint that the boys themselves invite this treatment such as when they enter an art gallery and treated with respect until they begin shouting and smashing glasses. Another example would be there disastrous attempts to enter Astrix's house.I can't help but feel that the ending was almost too sudden and implausible as the particular cop (notre Darn) had so few interactions with vinz that it seems to demonize the police to a unrealistic degree.what makes this film is kassovitz seamless blending of realist(documentary) and anti realist techniques. The use of non actors, shooting on location and real footage give the film a sense of realism which is contrasted by using flashy kinetic camera movements, complicated tracks and focus pulls and stylish editing. This is very similar to city of god which uses all off these devices to show the criminal underworld of slums in Rio.Cassovitz also uses comedy to make serious points, my favourite example being the Grunwaski scene were an old man tells an amusing anecdote to demonstrate that the Paris "Ghetto's" were mearly estates compared to concentration camps or real guarded ghettos.All in all a great film but if you would like something with a little more plot watch "Alice" by Jan svankmeiyer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed when I saw La Haine: a brilliant film and possibly one of the best of the 90s. With its superb, pounding soundtrack, harsh, grainy, monochrome film, and terrific employment of verlan, it's a great representation of, and comment on, life in the banlieue. This film simply blew me away, documenting 24 shattering hours in the lives of three close friends; Said, Hubert and Vinz, each of different ethnic backgrounds, but each united in their resentment towards and dissatisfaction with the authorities. What amazed me even more was that now, it's over 10 years old, and even now is as timeless and relevant as ever: it really helped me to understand the relatively recent rioting in Paris, which began in suburbs much like this one. Overall this film is relevant, poignant, funny, real and quite possibly one of the best films ever made about the plight of urban youth, not just in France but in the rest of the world too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone once said: If divinity can exist on the writtten page, Nabokov proves the existence of god. It's not hard to draw a similar conclusion about Matthieu Kassovitz's searing La Haine. Sublime, impassioned, magnificent; no list of adjectives can truly sum up the impact this film has on the viewer. Breathtaking from start to finish, every little detail makes your jaw drop. Of particular note is the turntable scene with the bird's eye view of the flats, an encounter with a diminutive storytelling gent in a restroom, and one gruesome scene which shows the Parisian police at their vicious worst.The film contains a strong moral message, but is in no way didactic. It's about a society in freefall; "It's not the fall that kills you, it's the landing". I felt one way of dissecting La Haine is to view the whole thing as a prelude to what comes after the final scene... i.e. the landing. Poverty, an alienated and disaffected youth. Ghettoisation, a subclass penned into "les banlieus"; outbursts of nihilistic violence the only logical result. This film is like an eerie premonition of the riots that happened in the urban centres of France last year. Gangs of Moroccan, Algerian, wherever, youths wreak havoc on Western Europe; the question is what else can you expect from a caged and brutalised animal? La Haine raises unpleasant questions for the policymakers of the Western world. Over ten years after its release, those questions are no nearer to being answered.</fullReview>

Hupert thinks much more than Vinz, he is sick of the situation too, but he realizes that individuals are loose and it is not possible to change the reality with minor power, he'd rather choose to leave Paris to solve the situation for him. Said the Arab guy is a trouble maker, he doesn't think much about what is happening around him, he just lives the days.three guys are from different minority groups, having different personalities, all living in the bottom of the economic ladder.I like the music and dancing pieces in the movie too. and the style fits the beats of the movie.Hupert was mocking Vinz about not shooting any cops holding a gun in his hand, however, when he was given the gun and saw Vinz was shot by the cop, although was by accident, Hupert in the end, finally felt what Vinz felt about his friend's death. and felt the same rage from Vinz's within.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hugely powerful film that encompasses everything you would expect from a film called "hate". Dealing with the tense situation between lawbreaker and law keeper, and based loosely on actual events, La Haine follows three young, bored lads on a what was suppose to be an average day, but turns into one they will always remember. Kassovitz directs the film with an incredible emphasis on realism (the whole crew moved into the Banlieue estate for months before shooting) and shows the world audience a completely different side to Paris - far from the rich vibrant colours and happy-go-lucky attitudes in films like Amelie (which Kassovitz also starred in).La Haine is a gritty ride, with no glamour, no colour, no over the top hyperbole - although the film was partially funded by US backers, and shows through the large amount of American influence throughout the film. But this was all part of the success of La Haine, which was able to play on already established French film making methods, deal with themes on a local, Parisian, level and also appeal to an international audience through use of the American influence - the boys discuss Disney cartoon characters and often wear American label clothes.From start to finish this is a truly captivating piece of cinema, with an ending that will leave you screaming for more, which deals with real issues such as the legitimacy of police work, racism and generally the amount of contempt we hold for each other. Kassovitz its truly in his element and i would struggle to think of a better film that deals with the realism of hatred between fellow men. A truly awesome film that should be seen by all film fans, and especially those who thinks that Paris is all about love stories, cobbled streets and cute little confectioners...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not such a Beautiful Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the burning intensity of Bob Marley's 'Burnin an lootin', up till the subtle yet painful ending, this film can boast with every right to be in a league of its own. French director Mathieu Kassovitz helped to escalate the growing problem of rioting through police brutality right up to the doorstep of leading men in the world of politics. The film has three main protagonist, all gelling their own unique personalities into the structure of the film to add a sense of diversity and interest. Following the routine lives of three disillusioned youths over the course of 24 hours, we are given a verite style insight into the social underclass of a Parisian housing estate or projects. This is a bold film that basically invites the viewer to watch just like Hubert describes as a "drive by zoo", and in return feel for the characters. The basic premise of this film is found within the tragedy a youth a few years before this film was made; a teenager who was beaten to his death in police custody helped to influence and propel this film's genesis. It is this event, which acts as the soul of the film, and is also the reason why it seems so real. Raging rap music by Cut Killer - Supreme NTM, allows us to see the inhabitants of the projects vent their anger at the loathed police, and the music also mirrors the personality of one particular individual; Vincent Cassel takes the role of Vinz, a French Jew who seems to be so exasperated all of the time we are simply waiting for him to explode. He is a vibrant character and practically epitomizes the term 'Hate'. When we see Vinz aim his Smith and Wesson in the face of a cop (simulating), he does it in such a cavalier fashion that we see just how screwed up his mind is by the social problems that suffocate him. His friend Said is quite the opposite of Vinz, while being quite a nonchalant character he does seem to accept his position in society with more composure and shrewdness - he doesn't go around flaunting a gun like his friend Vinz does. The final central character is Hubert, who is of African descent, and clearly being the wiser, more prudent of the three. Compared to Vinz and Said, Hubert's anger is inconspicuous, and he manages to channel his aggression. Vinz's hatred on the other hand is so perceptible that he usually brings trouble to his friends and Said never feels to intervene. The camera work of this film needs to be appreciated for it is quite stunning and every scene justifies its inclusion - to complement the hatred that is ever - present. The film culminates in the most provocative and powerful manner, where by the end of it you just know this film is on to something important. Kassovitz shows us that he is a rabid director and a dedicated man who simply wants to raise some serious questions. With it's Verlan dialect, daring, bold and imaginative cast and crew, this film delivers in the most fascinating depiction of police violence, ethnically diverse teenagers and social economic problems. I Strongly recommend this cinematic masterpiece of modern day film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get this film Kidz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film and i would (and constantly do) recommend that everyone see this film. I saw this film 2 days after i'd seen Larry Clarks Kidz and the two are often compared since they came out at the same time and are both tragic tales about poor disillusioned youth. However i thought Kidz was utter cak compared to La Haine. La Haine had a better story, better characters and vitally a better director. La Haine, like all great films should be, is a work of art, written and directed by a man who'd decided that he wants to make every shot as good as it can be. I'm not one for gritty realism. The sort of dodgy hand held camera/ documentary look because i've seen it a thousand times an i can do it myself. Some claim that it gives the film more gravitas or that it makes the statement bolder but i can see no film that makes its statement bolder through great cinematography than La Haine. Its a nightmare shot like a dream. In Kidz i didn't care about the characters, was bored by the dialogue and wasn't particularly shocked or moved by the ending (and i thought it lingered for too long on many scenes) La Haine in contrast never lingered for too long on anything (apart from maybe the s**t man in the toilet), it was sharp, too the point and then onto the next scene. Similarly the characters where engrossing, each one already described to us before they'd uttered a word or left they're bed. The actors themselves where terrific, Said in particular who brought most of the needed comic relief and a perfect portrayal of the sort of cockly little street kid you encounter every day. The subtitles on the DVD and VHS versions are bad and although it's hardly something to tarnish the quality of the film it does frustrate at times especially the candid camera story and vince cutting said's hair. It would have been sensible to outline them or put them below the screen itself. despite risking sounding like a 12 year old, all i can say is that its a very cool film. The sound track is great, especially cut killer Djing out his window, and the sly little messages on posters and graffiti are poignant rather then preachy. A scene where Hubert is standing in front of a advertising board at a bus stop beneath the words 'potrait of a killer' only to reveal he's covering the words ' of thirst' on a badoit ad struck me particularly ...unfortunately the subtitlers on my DVD copy missed that altogether but they showed it on filmfour...However the film on the whole is fantastic cinema with every scene relevant and shot beautifully from the molotov cocktail at the start to said's distraught face at the end....kids....go see this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film Scorcese would be proud of to make - Exceptional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Haine for me was the pinnacle of how a film should be put over in it's true message of intent in a political sense. La Haine is a brutal, bold but simple film, which intelligently interweaves between three unique individuals.Highlighted throughout are the burdens and painful encounters with the much resented Police, but most of all themselves.The hatred that engulfs this film is found within one certain character 'Vinz' who breathes and speaks hatred everywhere he goes. The directors intention of this film was to give us the viewer a more prominent knowledge of the pain that many poor Parisians live in. Kassovitz does not want to confuse his viewer nor does he want to make us think simple thoughts of it. Instead he wants to make us think for ourself and let our imaginations see the anger and problems which face these people. In some peoples opinions La Haine is reminiscent to Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing', to me though La Haine is more. Lee's film is very one sided and although racial abuse comes from both sides the film does not give the viewer a concrete choice to follow. La Haine on the other hand shocks the audience into having no choice but to sympathize with Vinz and his peers. When you look around at their bleak and desolate existence you must think to yourself "what would I do in their position?". If you can see beyond the typical genre of mindless 'hood' films then you will come to realize that this film is a political statement that has the sole intention of changing this world. Once you have seen this film it is up to you to either carry on you're life not caring or actually feel some aspect of condolence for these people, if you do so then at least this film was not made in vain. While we interweave within each character we become manifested in the hatred and mental tiredness in which the films characters experience. La Haine gives a stark implication of how life really works for the less fortunate; Hubert had the chance to walk, Vinz was damn unlucky and Said was the helpless bystander. Vincent Cassel is vibrant and very believable as a man who is portrayed as a living time bomb. Hubert Kounde puts in an exceptional performance as a man intent on punching his way to freedom. Said Taghmaoui requires less ability in his role but he plays the character very well providing the balance between the other two characters. The finale to this film simply enhanced it's power over me as the viewer, intense and thought provoking it was. For this strong feeling I plead with you if La Haine has not yet been viewed by you make sure you watch it. It is brilliant masterpiece, which is amongst the most poignant films of it's nature to be brought to our screens. "How you fall does not matter, it is how you land" will always be something of a strong reminder that for some life is a never ending circle of pain and hate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Le Monde Est A Vous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!"Le Monde est a Vous", ("The world is yours"). One of the most poignant moments in the film is when African French character Hubert reads this message on a billboard, and is virtually reduced to tears with the realisation of how much the world has denied him.This is a brutal film, both shocking and amusing, that depicts life in a housing project in a Parisian suburb, and how three youths each of a different ethnic minority live there. "La Haine", (Hate), is what they all feel to the police, in particular Vinz, (Vincent Cassel), and life in general. In the aftermath of a riot which has left a friend in a coma Vinz vows to kill a policeman if the friend dies. He will do this with a gun he found, a gun dropped by one of the riot police during the riot.His friend Hubert, (Hubert Kounde), has seen his gym destroyed in a night, after working two years to own it. Even so, he appears more level-minded than Vinz, until he assaults an officer.Their Arab French friend, Said, seems somewhere in between. What is certain is that they all feel la haine in some way or another. This is hardly surprising, as they encounter violence at every turn, and their future looks desperately bleak, (reflected by filming in black and white).The film is set over a single day, and shows just how quickly life can change in a rough city suburb. The social awareness raised by the film apparently had an effect on the French government who were prompted to investigate the reality of the situation.The film employs some of the most intriguing camerawork I have seen in recent years. It has a feeling of immediacy, in an almost documentary style approach, which feels more real, and draws the audience closer to the characters. I felt real sympathy for all characters in the film, and the life such people have to endure. If there is any sign of hope for the future, i.e. Said altering the sign, "Le Monde est a Vous" to "Le Monde est a Nous", (The world is ours), it is soon extinguished at the next turn.As an Englishman trying to learn French, I feel I would appreciate this film more if I could understand it as it is spoken, as so much is lost in translation, however "La Haine" remains effective even when subtitled.I rate this film very highly, and as a Film Studies student studying world cinema, I was impressed by my first real look at French cinema. The acting from all three leads is excellent, (Hubert Kounde shines), and emotions run high. 9/10I look forward to watching more French films. "La Haine" will almost inevitably be the film I measure them against, and I hope there are many more this impressive. Jusqu'ici, tout va bien!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool b&amp;w style, awesome soundtrack, and flawless acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw La Haine in an empty movie theatre in Iceland, probably in 1996. I had wanted to see La Haine for some time, and one day I decided to go see it on my way home from school. As I sat alone in the darkness of the movie theatre, I was blown away by the amazing soundtrack, the documentary black and white style, and flawless acting.The screenplay is simple, but very powerful at the same time. There is also a certain abstract weirdness to some scenes, which help to make La Haine unforgettable. The scene on the rooftop involving Hubert and the Eifel Tower and Vince's hilarious encounter with the cow, are such scenes. La Haine is almost poetic in this sense, a piece of art, beautiful to watch.The anger in the juvenile Vince is something that many can relate to. However, the cool style and the unique location is what I think makes this a movie worth recommending to anybody remotely interested in movies.La Haine remains my favorite.p.s. A good night at the movies would be to rent La Haine and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost dog. These two go well together.Halldor</fullReview>

The structure of the movie is brilliant, even though it doesn't come apparent until the very end. I could very well rant on about the structure and it's meaning and effect, but since someone who hasn't yet seen the movie might read this, I won't risk spoiling it.Neverthless I can say that this movie has one of the most surprising and emotionally affecting endings that I've come across.

		<shortDescription>Impressioning movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Haine is a movie that is hard to forget. I am not going to give you a whole summary, that is what the IMDB description above is for. The last commentator who wrote about this movie called it superficial. La Haine is an exact portrayal of some poor suburbs outside of Paris. This movie speaks of real problems. As a Franco-American who has spent a good chunk of my 18yr old life in Paris- I was very impressed how accurate the characters were. There are many cultural nuances, I think this is why I appreciate this film so much. One of the characters is Jewish (Mathieu Kassovitz) and the other Arabic, whose family is from North Africa. My family is a Jewish Sephardic family from Algeria who moved to Paris after the war. The expressions and stereotypes were right on target. I loved how the director chose to mainly focus on the three peoples friendship, stressing each of their backgrounds. It adds so much genuinity to the film. TWhat striked me was the joke's tagline "Up till now, everythings fine" -which is the characters' method and mentality to deal with poverty, and above all France's stinging racism, which is in a distinct league of its own. Mathieu Kassovitz is brilliant. This film is dolorously raw, real, yet hilarious. Another excellent and very differnet movie with kassovitz is Amen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very easy to miss the point with a film such as "La Haine", as the comments on this page and the views of my friends clearly show.Vinz, Said, and Hubert all come off sympathetically; as wholly human, for all their flawsThe police do not come off sympathetically; aside from the cop who helps out Said.Whilst you may have anti-working class bias as a viewer, Mathieu Kassovitz as the FILM MAKER does not, and so implanting your own prejudices mars a beautiful film.The central strength of La Haine is that it is not purely polemical. It has polemic elements in its treatment of the police, but more it comes off as a fable for the new generation, a stark warning of "a society in free-fall"; but ultimately only that, and not an overly moralising piece.I love everything about this film, and if only more people had seen it</fullReview>

The only black and white isht I've seen before that was "the lil rascals" back in the 80s. Anyhow, soon as the movie came on and I saw the black-n-white, I was halfway turned off and ready to turn off the vcr. The movie turned out to be my favorite reality film and in my top three ever list!The dialogue, the issues touched upon, the settings of the film, the camera work, the adventures.. just the whole setting, feel and story of the film made me kiss the TV. This was the exactly the type of film I was waiting for. I'm always a sucker for movies based on urban, smart/streetsmart youth.1/4th of the way through the film, I forgot it was in black-n-white. Now I want to make movies in black and white! I love this film! I love this director! I love this writer. I'm going to watch this right now! If you love urban, gritty flicks (ala "Kids" or "Gravesend") with a little more of a mental aspect to it, then take it from Kae and get La Haine(Hate). I love it!</fullReview>

With this movie he proved his mature shooting a film, and especially the way he does it!This movie tells us a story from the hood in Paris, France. The way people eat, live and die.....

		<fullReview>To suggest this film is of interest simply as a reflection of American culture transposed to a European setting is to completely miss the central themes of the movie, not to mention an incredibly Amerocentric stance to take. It deals with the racial tensions that are unique to the setting, although possessing a universal nature that allows the outsider a quite unique look at the dynamics of a Parisian ghetto faced with the pressures of racial integration across a polarised society. It is not an action gun movie, and the "slowness" in places provide moments for genuine thoughtful examination of the futility of the lives of said, Hubert, Vince and by extension all locked in the cycle of poverty. It may not be to everyone's taste, but suggestions of any formulaic recycling of American gang movie is farcically short-sighted. That the French cabinet felt compelled to watch this directorial debut movie to gain a clearer understanding of the situations in their most depressed areas should reveal enough about the nature of the film to anyone considering a viewing. Watch this movie, but not just to see how we simple Europeans adapt to American cultural imperialism.</fullReview>

Every scene is tense and built up beautifully. I couldn't get myself to take a breath during the last sequence of the film.Another brilliant touch is the use of French slang which adds another layer of realism to the story. The metaphors, the imagery, the use of language and music is all handled in an effective way to tell the very sad story of 3 friends as they try to survive another day in an unforgiving environment full of racism and violence.This is definitely one of the best films ever made to address police brutality and racism to say nothing about life in a ghetto or trying to live outside of it where you're not accepted.

The black and white cinematography is dazzling, providing a stylish realism to the bitterness of the landscape. The director, Mathieu Kassovitz, tries too hard to adopt a feeling of innocence towards the characters and the viewer might be deceived by their lack of solutions: we immediately understand that these boys were driven to violence, so we might accept their own violence as a natural response to their cruel and ruthless world.

At least for younger people. This is the simplest, jew boy, black boy, arab boy parable ON THE BEST DOPE EVER SMOKED. BEST SHOT EVER - look for Edith Piaf mixed with NWA (YES, f*#$ the police) FLYING OVER THE FRENCH GHETTO. Did I mention the BEST FILM SHOT EVER, (not counting the entire 'Russian Ark'). This film also takes the distinction of making Black and White film not only worthwhile, but the best choice. (Those that singularly prefer B&amp;W are sentimental fools - "when men were men, and film making was FAR MORE ELITIST than it is, even today".) La Haine is the ONLY film to see before you die. Unless you are gay and then you'd better also see 'Brokeback Mountain' and if you are super gay, 'Prayers for Bobby'. No kidding, certainly no Homophobia, I loved those two films as well. But am I being far too influenced by 'Family Guy', persistent gay jokes? Probably not, Seth McFarlane DEFINITELY has something repressed there, and me, I was the classic, "Gay guy with a straight guy hiding in the closet", post modern freak show: 'Mum, I like Trannies.' 'Yes son. See that you understand how difficult it is for her, with the operation, they suffer a lot of trauma.' 'YuuuuuuuuuuuK. OPERATION, Mum? No way!' Making a fist that comes from the elbow embedded in the pelvis. 'I don't want no "girl", post some mutilating operation, mum.'La Haine, if you read this, and don't click that it helped JUST because I didn't tell you scene by scene - (Jeez Louise, ANOTHER thing the losers on IMDb do, way too much) - you need your head read. Trust me, I ain't selling you cars, I am telling you that this is equally the finest piece of art for you to go and see, ALREADY. AND it should really appeal to anyone from high art lovers down to action-needing, problematic, even stupid, young men. All that and it could probably help you from wanting to commit suicide! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performances in this regular film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was going to be a better film because this movie sometimes gets in the top 250 IMDb but I think people give it a high rating because of its performances instead of the movie itself which is entertaining but just regular in my opinion.The performances of the three leading actors are really good who look like real housing project's teenagers with problems and confusions common of their age;the plot is good, I liked also that it was filmed in black and white. What I didn't like so much was how it was developed, sometimes it looked like a documentary, and there were parts that I found a little naive and boring.Vinz is a problematic teenager who lives in a housing project and has in his possession a gun and he is always saying to his closest friends that he wants to kill a cop in revenge because one of his friends was hurt very bad by one policeman.I recommend to watch this movie specially for the performances of Vincent Cassel and Sa?d Taghmaoui. I think If you liked "Rumble Fish (1983)" you will like this one too. Even though I would advise you to watch "Blackboard Jungle (1955)" with Glenn Ford &amp; Sidney Poitier too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one of those odd films, which keeps you gripped throughout its duration, but leaves you with a slightly hollow feeling. I've watched it a good few times, and still can't put my finger on exactly what it's lacking...La Haine grinds through the aftershock of a riot in a miserable housing estate, with the lightning bolt of its protagonists discovering a lost CRS (or thereabouts) gun. The results fold out beautifully, with the central characters now having the means to make violent alterations, but doubting whether they have the courage of their convictions.However, the film sheds some of its identity by clutching at US cinema - most notably, 'Do the Right Thing' - and gives in to a few cliches which it really didn't need to resort to.There is, by the way, an subtitled version which changes the name of the character Asterix to Snoopy - for no good reason - and alters a reference to Le Pen to a comment on Nazis. If you see this version, you'll be forgiven for not giving the film a moment's thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a powerful film. Assuming as the previous commentor does, that this film demonstrates the American influence of "life in a ghetto in Paris" or gang life is somewhat arrogant. Class struggle, gangs and the styles assumed by kids in Europe are not defined by the United States of America.One of the things that makes this film intriguing is the subtle uses of background props. Consider the Escher poster in the background in one of the scenes. This conveys a world turned upsidedown. Early in the film we hear Vinz mention that he feels isolated and insignificant as an ant floating out in the universe. Later we see the boys walking into the background while the camera keeps a poster of the World as seen from space in the foreground. This is an ingenious representation visually of the idea we heard expressed earlier.There is some irony in that Jodie Foster helped bring this film to fruition. We see Vinz acting out the role of DeNiro from Taxi Driver in front of a mirror one scene. This made me think of Jodie Foster's Army (a punk band from Phoenix) and Hinckly's assassination attempt on Reagan... are all these kids "catcher in the rye" types waiting for their chance to snap? Not likely. Regardless of these ramblings, it is a film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shocking relevant and at times funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those high impact films that I remember watching when I was younger. I don't think I've seen it for at least 10yrs. I barely remember it, but I thought it was a lot more violent and shocking. Yet on a new viewing, I find it too be perhaps less shocking and full of humour. Despite the storyline of riots and violence, the three characters are just regular guys when it comes down to it, they are just caught up in far from perfect world. They are, between run-ins with the police very entertaining: Said trying to get his hair trimmed was hilarious, his voice raising ever higher as he panics about how much has been shaved: The three guys trying to steal a car, with the aid of a drunk passer by are fine and funny moments. But these lighter interludes are shattered by hints of dire things to come. The cops roughing up Said and Hubert is horrid to watch and as the film progresses you can feel a sense of doom coming closer. The encounter with the skinheads for me was the moment you know the ending was not going to be good and then boom. It takes a lot for me to physically feel something from a film, but as that gun fired into Vinz, I shivered. The ending alone is enough to put it into that high impact category, but as a whole it is a still relevant piece about social conditions and the suffering caused by them.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film Executed With Bare-Knuckled Force, Dynamically Examining How Hate Breeds Hate and Remaining Extremely Relevant For Today's Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Haine, when translated to English quite literally means "hate", and just from this title you know straight away the kind of film La Haine is. Inspired by other masterpieces such as, Do the Right Thing and Mean Streets, La Haine is a French film taking influence from American, urban cinema. Just like the two films I have previously mentioned, La Haine is a ferocious film, fuming with a controlled rage which will resonate for hours after your viewing. To this day, I can still vividly recollect my first-viewing of La Haine. I was completely taken-a-back by the experience and left in awe at what I had just viewed. Not only this, but I quickly realised I had watched one of the most poignant social-commentaries to hit modern cinema, a film which was so honest and reminiscent for today's society.Set within the space of a day, La Haine places the viewer inside the French ghettos. The film quickly centres itself around three protagonists who have little-to-nothing in prospects as they grow up on a working-class council estate. The film is set around the day after a huge riot, whereby the three teenagers and police become subjected to a boiling tension, after their friend was hospitalised from the police brutality of the riot the night before.La Haine is not a glamorous film, nor does endeavour to make its characters seem admirable; rather it puts a social-dilemma into a perspective which enables you to feel empathy for "thugs". La Haine pressurises the viewer undergo and endure a study of social-class, and how an environment has a significant affect on the way a person behaves in life and one's morals. The film requires you to concentrate on acknowledging why these young people behave in the way they do. Highlighting many social-dilemmas, La Haine does not stray away from depicting the deprivation of poverty-stricken ghettos. La Haine focuses on themes such as, corruption in law-enforcement, to a youth's attempt at rebelling against a flawed system. The film dwells over some of the most significantly relevant problems with today's youths.Filmed in its brutally prominent black-and-white, La Haine captures the authenticity of the urban life; bringing to light the brutality that many youths are subjected to. The black-and-white is also a wonderful metaphor for the variety of cultures combining together. The addition of Mathieu Kassovitz's gorgeously smooth camera movements captures the characters that are stuck inside an urban jungle. Ultimately, you automatically become part of the gritty environment, and an eyewitness to events which are simultaneously occurring across the globe. It is more than just "comparatively apparent" that Mathieu Kassovitz is horribly aware of society's decline. Plus, the confrontational editing used in La Haine is extensively affective. La Haine captures the bland and grim concrete jungle through Mathieu Kassovitz's knowledgeable vision.Just as the narrative is multi-dimensional, so are the fantastically crafted characters, which are all remarkably layered with their diverse emotions. The characters are all people you are able to pity, due to their situations in life. A Hollywood film would either make these characters appear as gangsters or despicable thugs, while La Haine makes its characters seem humane behind their thuggish appearances. Arguably these are not characters, but are instead a representation of the people that we are all surrounded by in our lives.Each character can be studied for the way in which they deal with situations and the way they feel towards the society who has deemed them of lower status. Personally, I have always felt Hubert (incredibly acted by Hubert Koundé) is the most interesting of the characters, because even when he is not delivering his lines and the camera is poised on his face, you know what he is thinking. Of the three protagonists, he is the one I consider the most sensible and mature, and is a person who feels disillusioned by the environment he is growing up around, and wants to move away from it to seek improved opportunities. As is suggested from the scene where Hubert's pregnant (subtly hinting a stereotypical portrayal of large families on a low income) mother is talking to him in the kitchen, quite possibly my favourite scene in the film.The film's centrepiece character is Vinz (brutally performed by Vincent Cassel), who is another highly interesting character, and evidently the most mentally-troubled of the film's three youths. Vincent Cassel captures the madness of his character with a remarkable ease, distancing himself from the other actors' characters. He captures the feeling of an oblivious youth without incentive, overwhelmed by his machismo, self-indulgence, anguish and rage. His intent is to be heard and not ignored, which his method of getting back on the life he has grown up in. This is a subjective view from Mathieu Kassovitz who clearly feels that the government is ignoring youths who are begging for the sympathy they deserve.Few films can hold such a strong amount of audacity and succeed in every single aspect of the piece. La Haine is bold, fearless, charismatic film-making at its best and reminds you just how dangerous society really is and a testament to excellence of French cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most amazing films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to think of a film made over ten years ago that's still incredibly relevant today, but La Haine is definitely one of them and not just because of the 2005 French Riots. Because this film isn't just looking at the situation in Paris or in France it's asking what happens when a country ignores a whole mass of people. The answer is presented through our three lead characters, Vinz, Said and Hubert each from a different background but all living on the same estate in Paris. Neither of them are bad people, but with no one to guide them, the only things they are know are drugs and violence. The situation is exacerbated by the brutal actions of the police which further alienates the three from society. In fact it's kind of worrying when you think how many cities this film could be set in, London, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Berlin, Sydney, the list goes on.All of this is presented in just one day in the lives of these three, following a riot on their estate. Vinz is out for revenge while Hubert is trying to work his way out of the neighbourhood. The story is told more like a documentary but with some comic elements in a few places. But all of this builds up to an ending that will leave you on the edge of your seat long after the credits have rolled.</fullReview>

Once they understood the project, they accepted the idea of the making of the movie. The movie has been made in color then post pro ducted in Black&amp;White, the deal was a movie in theater in Black&amp;White, and if the movie wouldn't work in Theather, it would get released in color in home support. Hopefully it worked in theaters.I like this movie for many reasons, one of the few is the way Paris is in this movie, i'm always glad in the movie when they go to Paris and go away from where they leave.City Of God (La Cite De Dieu, Cidade de Deus) is a movie in the same kind of way in the sense as it shows you a side of Brazil (Rio) not very known.The credits at the end are short because the director wanted a quick lights on in the theater, for those who wonder.I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

Why is that so ? The decision to exclude La Haine from DVD space is due to the fact that France is the only nation in the world which relies heavily on its past glory.In our modern international world,it still talks of Moliere, Balzac etc knowing fully well that no one (at least French youth) is interested in them.France has nothing latest,recent,modern, contemporary to showcase to the whole world.French language books are always devoted to its writers,singers,new wave cinema etc.There is no chapter,no description of its immigrants,ghetto life and racism. Whatever that has been depicted in this film is the naked burning reality.Such was the impact of this film at the time of its release premier Alain Juppe had to call for a special screening to know what all the fuss was.One final word:three male leads:one Arab, one Jew and one Christian, isn't that bit intentional as well as obvious.May be Kassovitz wanted to reach as many communities as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film that points out inner-city social fragmentation that can be appreciated worldwide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mathieu Kassovitz's 'La Haine' is a film that deals with the major social concerns present in the French banlieues or suburbs, where social fragmentation in the society and hatred to a system that rejects the inhabitants have resulted in gangs of multi-ethnic youths. They fight each other for street cred or unite in their common hatred for the police system to take part in violent riots. The racist police are shown as a collective body representing the state, hating the youths right back in a vicious cycle of hate breeding hate.Kassovitz effectively captures the frustration of the youths and presents his own negative views of the police through his representation of them in the film. The film came out in 1995 at the same time as serious rioting in the banlieues in France. The film acts as a way of showing the serious issues in a way that prevents the government from just ignoring that they exist, which is what they had been doing, although Kassovitz said that he wasn't making a political movie.The film follows three youths, Vinz, an explosive Jew, Hubert, a thoughtful powerful black and Said, a streetwise Arab who represent the different cultures brought together by location and class. They reject French culture and look to America for their escapism through the film industry there and hip-hop/street culture. They even adapt their language to resemble black 'hood' language as they call each other 'homeys' and 'homeboys' regularly through the film. This is because they see themselves as being 'disowned' by France, their own country has pretended they don't exist and ignored the social problems present in the inner city areas. The result is environments that are like a separate country in the middle of big cities where the culture and motive of the inhabitants is very hostile to the outside. The proximity of this world to the financially successful, structured, policed areas breeds a hatred that may be subdued on the surface on both sides but inevitably overflows in outbursts of heavy violence, and the balance of peace is very fragile. At the beginning of the film we see the protesters being peaceable but making their points while the police are seen preparing for violence. Then we see a policeman throw a missile at the demonstrators kicking off the violent riot, so the police are shown by Kassovitz as being the perpetrators of the violence in the film.Mathieu uses the conflict between the police and the youths of the banlieues as a pointer to people in authority across the globe, as similar problems occur in most if not all major cities in one degree or another so the film is very relevant. A major reason for the films huge DVD sales in different countries was this relevance that people can associate and recognise with problems nearer to home.The film is cinema-verite as it aims to show a realistic portrayal of inner-city life, and it does this effectively. Kassovitz also uses some stylized touches in the film such as the Molotov cocktail hitting the world and blowing it up, which is imagery designed to symbolise the violence in the film, the image of the world means that this kind of violence and hate is a problem worldwide, a point I mentioned that this film is particularly relevant as a socio-political text throughout the globe.Kassovitz uses techniques used by Hitchcock in 'Vertigo' (the zoom in pull out shot) and Martin Scorsese with almost completely diegetic music reminiscent of 'Mean Streets', which is Kassovitz favourite film of all time. The film is filmed in black and white, which has been a feature of a few 90s French films. The effect of using black and white film stock is realism, but it also makes the film come across as 'arty'. I personally feel that the filming of this film in black and white was Kassovitz following a trend and seeing that people would view the film as being 'arty'. It is a little irritating and I much prefer colour film.All in all, this is a film from an era of French cinema that reflects the new freedom of directors to reject the previous romantic films that provided escapism for audiences and make films that highlight the darker, often shunned aside aspects of life. I feel that the film has some nice touches that reflect cultural interest across the world and that the actors really managed to immerse themselves into their roles in portraying believable frustrated youths. The film is a little tedious as not much happens, right up until the very end, but this reflects the lives of the youths, it is just time passing by doing nothing. If you're looking for a couple of hours of sheer escapism, don't choose this film, but if you are after some mental stimulation it's worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am studying this film for my exams in January, i was a little downhearted to begin with as I'm not world cinemas biggest fan, and wasn't looking forward to watching it.How mistaken could i be, this film has the gritty realism that reminds me of films like Trainspotting, with the style of guy Ritchie, but under this hides a very important statement about french life.the film follows three friends through a day, a day which started with their friend in intensive care following riots during the night, where he was beaten by the police.The start of the film was great, the shots taken seemed as if they were real footage from riots, and was accompanied by a great Bob Marley song 'Burnin and Looting' The three characters are all visually introduced then you see them cause trouble, and be obnoxious, Vincent Cassell plays the part of Vinz, a lad who had found a cops gun in the riots, and has an obsession with using it,Hubert Koundé plays Hubert, Hubert and Vinz don't see eye to eye in the film and seem to have very different outlooks on the present situation, but start to become closer as the film progresses Said Taghmaoui plays Said, not as a strong character as the other two but is very important as the film gives the impression it through his eyes, as it opens with his eyes opening and closes with, yes you guessed it, his eyes closing.I wont tell you the end, i heard an absolutely ridiculous comment about this film from a film critic who labelled the film as predictable!! anyone who has seen this film knows that is certainly not the case.if you haven't seen this film yet, go out and get it. its certainly worth it, its changed my pessimistic views on world cinema.A beautiful and stylish film, but not surreal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French cinema at its most shocking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bold, violent, provocative, La Haine is a remarkable, mesmerizing achievement, a raw punch in the face. Few other movies are this socially relevant, and if you want to learn something valuable, I suggest you watch this film. It was made in 1995, but has lost none of its strength.The movie takes place in the Parisian suburbs, where three angry, confused and frustrated young men live. These three (Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé and Said Taghmaoui) have different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and don't feel very French. They also don't have any idea of what they wanna do with their lives, unless it's got something to do with drugs, thefts or riots. Then one day, one of their friends, brutally beaten by the cops, ends up in a hospital, with little chance of survival. Life tries to go on normally, but Vinz (Cassel) wants to avenge his buddy. It's up to Hubert and Said to make sure a blood bath won't start...Writer/director Mathieu Kassovitz (also behind the first Crimson Rivers flick) gives a very realistic look on everyday life, which isn't always a joy. Despite some really funny moments (a dealer named Asterix, Cassel doing a Taxi Driver impression, the Tarantinoesque discussion about Tom &amp; Jerry), this black and white milestone of French movie industry remains a very serious, brutal, unflinching film. The bleak ending is just the definitive proof of what the entire movie is trying to teach us: hate and violence will only cause more violence (this aspect makes La Haine quite similar to Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing).This movie should be shown to everyone, so that people can understand what doesn't work in our society.Films with a strong message keep being important even 20 years after their release. La Haine is such a film.</fullReview>

Already set my mind to go a movie, i purchased ticket to this La Haine -viha in finnish, without knowing anything about it than what the movie poster showed in the lobby of the movie theater.Powerful beginning with the riots in the streets, together with Bob Marleys song was very promising. Soon after the scene where Said opened his eyes and in a way wrapped us, the movie audience into to his world, in the suburbs of Paris. Just like that, simple effect and together with sound and puf, you're in the never neverland and the journey can begin.Throughout the movie, every single detail (yes, even the colorful cow in a movie otherwise black and white) seemed the get their place in this movie. Flawless storytelling, intense acting and mastery in directing this film by Mathieu Kassovitz is truly a modern masterpiece which value, i am sure, will grow as the years go by like a vintage wine.Unique storytelling also remembers to end the story well, this is often neglected in modern movies. You may have seen movies which are great but the ending spoils everything, but in La Haine this is also in good hands and when the subtitles goes by after the movie has ended, you literally still remain seated because it takes a while before you understand that you are not in the world of this movie, but your own.La Haine: my top 5 movies number 1.PS. the others are: Apocalypse now, Sideways, Lost In translation and American Beauty - i recommend warmly to see these movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film La Haine is considered to be one of the most controversial, powerful and innovative films of the 1990's. It won the Best Director award in the 1995 Cannes film festival and won film of the year (1996) at the Caesar awards. La Haine (which in French means 'hate') was considered innovative because it is part of a very underused style of French cinema called 'Un Cinema de Banlieue' or 'Cinema of the Suburbs' which depicts the grim reality of France's run-down suburbs. Other films from this genre include 'Etat des lieux' (1995), and 'Bye Bye' (1996).It was considered different at the time because most French films from this period were either heritage films like 'Jean De Florette' (1985), 'Cyrano de Bergerac' (1990), and 'Manon des Sources' (1986). Or they were from the 'Cinema du Look' based on 'slick' visual style which includes such films as 'Diva' (1981), 'Nikita' (1990), and 'Subway' (1985).The cinematography in the film is very personal, and is shot almost in a documentary style, in that whenever a character or group of people moves the camera moves with them and when they stop the camera stops with them.There are also some outstanding shots in the film that continue the films theme of showing an horrific, real life situation but presenting it in an unreal way. The first of these shots is when a DJ opens his window turns his decks on and mixes Ice T's song 'Cop Killer' with old French records. As he is doing this, the camera goes over his shoulder and out of the window; it then flies over the entire estate as the music is playing in the background just to give the viewer a perspective of the dilapidated state of the estates. This is used to give the viewer a real understanding of why these people are constantly rioting against the police because they feel trapped in this urban jungle and that the police actually keep them down rather than help them.There is another shot where Vince and Hubert are standing on a raised level with the streets of Paris behind them. As they stand there the streets zoom in closer to the camera and they zoom out ever so slightly. This is a technique, which has been used many times in films, was pioneered by Steven Spielberg in the film 'Jaws'. Ever since that point it has been used by directors as a way of showing fear and tension in one shot. But typically Kassovitz inverts this theory and uses it as a way of showing how small and insignificant these characters become once they enter the big city. It is also another example of the film going against what Hollywood sets out as the norm.Another great example of the films theme of reality versus surrealism is in the way it is shot in black and white. If it were meant to have a documentary feel then it should surely be shot in color, but again Kassovitz goes against the rules of filming and shoots it in black and white to give it an unreal, dream like feel to the whole film. It also portrays the film as being straight and unrelenting, in his idea of the film as a metaphor for life, there is only black and white and no grey or colorful areas. It is also a wonderful way of making the projects in the Parisian suburbs seem even worse than they already are.The Mise-en-scene of the film plays an important part in reinforcing the traits and very individual characteristics of the main characters. The most important being Vince, the Paris native who believes himself to be from the streets and something of a rebel. His strange fixation with violence is only ever present when he is acting out violence; we see a great example of this when he is at home, in front of the mirror impersonating Robert De Niro's character from Taxi Driver. He acts out the scene in almost perfectly and at the end holds his hand up to the mirror and pulls the imaginary trigger, but we actually hear a gun shot go off. This is another hint towards Vince's delusion that his hand is a real gun and that he is some kind of thug. The same thing happens later on in the film when Vince points his hand at a cop and fires, in his mind he kills the cop but in reality nothing happens. Whenever Vince is confronted by real life opportunities to use the gun he backs out and realizes that he is nothing more than a normal man with a bad attitude.The editing in the film is kept quite simple, as to not detract from the documentary style of the camera work. However sometimes we see different speeds of fades and cuts and occasionally fades up from white instead of the usual black. This is to give a sense of surrealism and make the audience feel like this is a real life situation portrayed in an unreal 'Hollywood' way.The sound is also a very important part of the film as it gives more hints towards the influence of American Culture on the film and its inhabitants. During the scenes in Hubert's room we hear Barry White singing, which is a hint towards Hubert's wish for a calmer atmosphere, so he plays calmer music. The DJ mixes Ice T's Cop killer song with a lot of old French music which is another hint at the films apparent fusion between French and American culture. The scenes in the streets or in meeting places usually have hip-hop music playing, which is a sign of just how wide reaching American culture has become in its effect on French Popular culture.There are lots of hints towards American Culture and its influence on French Culture throughout the film. Indeed the way the film is shot is almost making fun of Hollywood's way of shooting real life situations in an 'entertaining' and 'easy to watch' way. In many ways it is Kassovitz's way of rebelling against Hollywood, by showing that he can do all the clever camera and editing techniques but accompany them with a strong script and identifiable characters.It clearly mocks Hollywood in a scene where Vince is constantly walking in and out of almost every film in the cinema complex because the films he watches are either riddled with clichés or just simply really bad. This is again Kassovitz trying to make the audience see just how unrealistic and bad some mainstream films can be. In doing so he has created a film that is everything some Hollywood films try to be, cutting edge, realistic yet surreal, humorous in a dark way and extremely powerful and poetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'La Haine' is a great French movie, a lot better than most US movies that deal with this issue. The movie is strong and feels like a real story with characters that could exist. The acting and direction is terrific, the story is very good (we follow the three main characters for only 24 hours) and especially the black-and-white cinematography is great. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Things Fall Apart" in La Haine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in high school, read the book Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe in my English class. The novel follows the life of a Igbo tribesman and his kin as they adjust to the arrival of Christian missionaries and struggle with the impact of British colonial rule. It's a great book that illustrates Western cultures' largely grim history towards "less civilized" societies. Better still, Things Fall Apart is not liberal white guilt shrouded in anthropological verses; it's a book that attempts to accurately portray things as they were and as they eventually became. The main character Okonkwo isn't a mindless barbarian nor a noble tribesman but somewhere in-between. Hubert, Vinz and Said, the main characters of La Haine (1995) (roughly translates from French to Hate), are much like Okonkwo. They are not quite saints or sinners, just a gang of French kids with little to do but sit around and watch the world throw insult and injury at their banlieue.But let us start at the beginning; 10:38am. Said (Said Taghmaoui) a young man of Middle Eastern descent is standing outside of Vinz's (Vincent Cassel) house waiting for him to wake up. He calls out his name creating a ruckus Vinz's neighbors don't take too kindly to. As Vinz goes about his business getting ready there is a menorah behind him. They meet up with Hubert (Hubert Kounde) a young black man just trying to keep his nose clean especially since the last riot in the banlieue left many public buildings ransacked and his friends may have been involved. To top it all off, one of their friends Abdel was put into a coma while in police custody and Vinz vows to get revenge anyway he can.The precipitating macguffin is a lost police firearm that the trio get ahold of. Vinz would like to use it to kill a cop if Abdel dies and holsters it like a gangster wannabe. Through the gun, the audience travels with the young multi-ethnic men through nineteen hours in the life. The voice-over forebodingly divulges a tale; "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!" Throughout the day the three have constant run-ins with police; some trying to keep the boys out of trouble, some just doing their jobs, and some abusing their power. It's easy to see how things will land.But to summarize La Haine as a story about men making bad decisions and getting punished for it would be selling the filmmakers short. The movie expands to explore the nature of violence and how it can inhabit minds. Furthermore it explores how poverty, and racism can coax violence from people. The characters are all minorities living in a country that is passively and symbolically racist towards them. They feed off of the violence depicted in popular entertainment and are incensed by the police brutality around them. Yet they have nowhere to release their frustrations. "Hate breeds hate," the sensible Hubert explains as Vinz pumps himself up for possible homicide. It's important to note that much like the Projects of Chicago or New York, the banlieues of Paris are apportioned largely by differences in income distribution and extreme racial segregation. While Said and Vinz would under other circumstances be religiously in conflict, because of their minority status, they interact with the world at large in tandem.Like Things Fall Apart, La Haine follows the same tragic hero outline that certainly doesn't end with rays of sunshine. Still the raw acting talent exhibited by the cast, the stylish bare-bones directing by Matthieu Kassovitz and, above all biting social commentary, makes this film a must watch. I'll leave you with the first part of William Yeat's poem for which the title of Things Fall Apart is based off of which seems apropos:Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhereThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;The best lack all conviction, while the worstAre full of passionate intensity.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would love to procure a copy of this movie to view personally. I just finished viewing it in an African Studies Meeting and I simply adored the acting and film style. I can relate to the characters because I was ONCE a bit of each of them. I can also very much relate to Hubert and his struggles. Growing up, I have gone from the horrid conditions of Africa, to the ghettos of Arkansas,USA and New Orleans, USA to the horrid slums of Haiti, Republica Dominica and Burkina Faso. I found myself in numerous criminal enterprises because the so called "good" people were too busy to aid us poor, starving, low class ghetto youth. I have since cleaned my act up and thankfully never been caught and imprisoned. I have experienced many sides of the French and American colonial aftermaths and I know it is a sad place to find oneself in. The only way I see of beating this thing is by working very hard to overcome it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was not bad..... I had a few mates who thought it was sh*t-hot.... but it's not really my type of film. Very gritty down-to-earth film showing the ganglands of inner Paris.Some good bits but too many bits that seemed to drag on for me though. I'm not saying it's a bad film, with regards to film-making... but I just didn't enjoy it. A similar film I did enjoy however was City of God... which of course has a more South-American flavour to it.Alright... but a 5/10 for me....Dave</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like French films on the whole, and I'm interested in films about disaffected youth; however I couldn't be much less impressed with La Haine. Its characters are unconvincing, and it's plot is directionless - pointless even. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's in black and white - despite what directors may tell you, this doesn't add poignancy or profundity, it is just lame. And more stupidly still, the (fixed) English subtitles are in white with no shaded background so you literally can't read them at all when the picture underneath is light. Duh!La Haine is in stark contrast to Man Bites Dog (Belgium, 1992) - which is also French language and in black and white, and yet thoroughly cool. Rent that instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical left-wing ideological garbage! If this film purports to be a critique of society, it's own aim is foiled by this approach which does itself absolutely no favors.In Australia, Victoria in particular, we have nothing but fairy's for police. We would gladly swap what we have for the decent policing rather than the pansy hand-holders we've got at the moment.Some of these uppity rejects from other countries need a good slap around the ears rather than attempting to hold their host countries to ransom!This film is so biased in its approach, the most it does is to reinforce the stereotypes it so pathetically seeks to dispel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is for idiots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two hours of your time that you can never get back! If you are a high school drop-out, into drugs and have no purpose in life you'll love this movie. Otherwise, just stay away from this bullshit for your own sake!The story is based on how three idiots spend their day doing absolutely nothing good for either themselves or anybody else. And you know what's gonna happen in the end from the first 10 minutes on. The only reason I watched the whole thing is that I never leave a movie unfinished so that I have an idea. I wonder what kind of people voted 10 out of 10 for this movie and made me wanna watch it by putting this crap in top 250 movies of all time. Generally IMDb top 250 movies rarely disappoint me, but this one made me even write this comment which I never do about any movie, good or bad.Such a waste of time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, if i had the choice to see it again i wouldn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is very difficult to understand, for a teenager like myself watching this film was very boring, with subtitles and in black and white you find it very hard to concentrate on. I was watching it in media and i nearly fell asleep! Over all though the message it puts across is rather random, it doesn't set a good example of how you should act towards the police, and what you should do in a similar situation. The content of the film is a lot to be desired, to amount of foul language in it is not acceptable for viewers especially in a another language. I didn't like it..Wouldn't see it again if i had the choice.</fullReview>
