		<shortDescription>Edward norton does an excellent job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had just gotten done seeing the movie Fight Club when a relative of mine said " If you like that movie, you'll like Primal Fear." I didn't believe him, because I had believed that Fight Club was the best movie on the face of the planet. Well, he just so happened to have a copy of Primal Fear with him. I watched it and was amazed. I was speechless.The movie has so many twists! I was convinced that it was one of the best movies I had ever seen. Gere's performance is average. I say this because it seems that in many movies he plays the same cocky character. Linney's monologue in the courtroom is mesmerizing . It was just great. And Norton? Well this may be one of his best performances ever. The fact that this was made during the starting of his acting career was unbelievable. It was a great film and Edward norton does an excellent job</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet Edward Norton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outstanding thriller on par with "The Usual Suspects", "Primal Fear" is an impressive film about one lawyer's (Richard Gere) yearning for the spotlight. He gets his wish after an archbishop is brutally murdered in Chicago. It appears that choir boy Edward Norton (in his first film, Oscar-nominated) is the killer, but there is more to this case than meets the eye. In the end, Gere is going to learn that what he thinks he wants (fame and fortune) is not all that great because of what he has had to go through to get there. "Primal Fear" was one of the more interesting films of 1996, but was ignored by almost everyone. Richard Gere does some of his best work ever. Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard, and Frances McDormand are all good in supporting roles. However, it is Edward Norton who proved to be the discovery of the 1990s. He keeps the audience on their toes and he adds depth and emotion to a film that would have looked much different if he had not been in it. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of a star and the resurrection of another</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often that viewers get a chance to watch a star being born - that a talented unknown actor's performance that is so spectacular it leads to the A-list in one role is rare: Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, Brad Pitt in Thelma &amp; Louise to name a recent few. But Edward Norton's turn as the "defendant/victim" in Primal Fear is one of those "Wow" moments that leaves the audience salivating for his next performance. In this feature debut, Norton outdistances his role, as does Richard Gere, in a resurrection no less impressive than Norton's star-making turn. Heretofore, Gere has specialized in assorted intelligent professional cad roles. Here, he gets a chance to inhabit one that not only wears his dubious character on his sleeve, but wears it, drives it, drinks it... revels in it. Yeah, sure somewhere there's a heart of gold, but like his client, the layers on top serve him better, and the heart of gold is tarnished. Gere is at his peak, comfortably, cheerfully inhabiting the role.Laura Linney deserves extra credit for often being the ice-queen foil which propels the two male characters' development; her own character is rather one- dimensional, but she herself squeezes as much dazzle as she can from it. Even though everyone else obviously falls for whatever Gere's Vail purrs into their ears, it's merely enough time for Linney's Janet to get a drag on her ubiquitous cigarette; another step in what will (hopefully) someday be film's love affair with her. Wasted, sadly, are fine character actors like John Mahoney, Steven Bauer, Maura Tierney &amp; Andre Braugher who could have lit up the screen had they not been handed scripts with generic character stereotypes.See it to watch the ascension of Norton and Gere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just another court room drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was convinced that "Primal Fear" would be the type of courtroom drama that Hollywood seems to use to pave the streets with. You know what I mean: Someone gets wrongly accused of some mischief, he can't pay a lawyer, but of course there is one who is really interested in the case and he is prepared to defend the poor guy anyway. The defender finds some wholes in the police investigation or in the statement of the other party and knows to prove the innocence of his client and even get a big indemnity. Well, I was wrong, for once this was a courtroom drama that had a bit more to offer than the usual story line and twists. In fact, this was even a very enjoyable movie.Even though I'm not really a fan of Richard Gere (I'm not a woman, so no I don't like him because the way he looks, I only look at his acting), I have to admit that this time he really did a very good job as the slick, media-friendly, arrogant lawyer Martin Vail. Still, in my opinion the real star in this movie is Edward Norton. He's really excellent as the altar boy who is accused of murdering a Catholic bishop. For once the story isn't as predictable as usual. At first the case seems rather clear: an altar boy is running away from the home of the bishop, with blood all over his clothes. No doubt about it you think, he did it, case closed, next movie! But than the first interesting twist in the movie appears: Yes, he was at the murder scene, but he can't remember anything about the grisly murder, because at that exact moment he got a blackout. He's convinced that there was a third person in the room. That third person must have killed the bishop, he's innocent. His lawyer tries to prove the third man theory in the court room, but as the process comes nearer to the end, some new evidence will make everything a lot clearer and more interesting...As I already said, this movie is more than just worth a watch, thanks to the rather innovative story line and characters. For once, this movie didn't annoy me more than I could ever like it. That's already worth a lot, so I give it a well deserved 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Norton Shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this strong, twisting court room crime drama thriller, a young Edward Norton shines with this performance that makes the movie a strong, unsettling movie. The dynamic tension between Richard Gere and Laura Linney lends to the underlying swirling dance of political and emotional turmoil that lies beneath the surface of District Attorney and high-profile attorney Gere. While by today's standards (2006) the storyline is now pretty typical, it retains a resonance because of the plot and storyline as well as the acting. Still, the edges of the movie are almost too polished. Some of the technical matters overlooked. Alfre Woodard has a credible role as the courtroom judge and Frances McDormand provides a decent hand as a psychologist (though this key role was a bit weak in comparison to the rest of the movie in terms of the crucial nature that it plays). Gere's tangled relationship with his own team is also fascinating to watch though again a bit torn and tattled with a few lose ends but the supporting cast does well. Overall, this is a solid courtroom crime drama with a nice ripping ending. Eight out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Smartest Guy In Town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Richard Gere has one of his juiciest roles in Primal Fear, the best performance by far is that of Edward Norton who got the film's only Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a stunning debut picture. It's the kind of debut that any player would like to make and the trick is to keep up a high standard you've already set for yourself. Which Norton to his credit certainly has in his career.But as to Gere he plays Martin Vail, a top criminal defense attorney who will let everyone know it if they haven't figured it out. It's a tricky part because a guy this arrogant has to maintain some kind of surface likability or else you'd never believe he'd ever win a case in front of a jury. As for movie viewers they must have a rooting interest for him as well. But Gere's definitely a guy who they make lawyer jokes about.A young altar boy has murdered the archbishop of Chicago, a mush mouth kid with a Kentucky twang played by Edward Norton. He's part of a choir of street kids that the Chicago archdiocese shows off on many an occasion. It was a particularly brutal murder, multiple stabbings and the carving of a cryptic message in the chest of the deceased.Gere makes no bones about it, he's wanting this case because of the headlines it will bring him. But when F. Lee Bailey or Johnnie Cochran offers to defend you for nothing, you don't ask questions. Which brings us to Norton who has you might have gathered is not all he seems. He's a street kid and he's used to getting over on people himself. It's one of the darkest characters ever done on screen, maybe a bit too dark for Academy tastes. That might have been the reason that Cuba Gooding beat out Norton for Best Supporting Actor with his much lighter role in Jerry Maguire.One in this film you will notice are Laura Linney as the Assistant District Attorney who Gere was once involved with and is getting a lot of pressure to bring in a guilty verdict for understandable political reasons. I also liked Alfre Woodard as the very patient judge at Norton's trial and Frances McDormand as the psychiatrist who examines Norton.If you think you've figured out what's behind Primal Fear, rest assured you haven't from this description. Let's just say everyone gets good and played here.Which brings to mind the dedication for this review. Gere's attorney character is likable, but arrogant. Back in the day I knew an attorney who was arrogant without any real reason for the arrogance. He'd love to have been Richard Gere, I'm sure he saw himself that way. So to you Ron D'Angelo this review is dedicated to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Talented Mr.Norton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal Fear is how Ed Norton left is mark to show that he is an acting force to go up ahead. Not only did he prove that he can run with the big dogs like Richard Gere but have the ability to play the audience like a piano. Primal Fear is a solid, courtroom drama that involves a hot shot defence lawyer who loves being the centre of attention and Richard Gere does a good job of being cool, cocky, suave and letting us know he can't lose. However he has his work cut out for him when he meets a young, geeky alter boy who has been involved of the murder of the priest and the game unfolds as he is up against a lot of big-wigs including his ex-girlfriend who happens to be the prosecution lawyer. Although by this time , the film would appear to be dated but the performances from the cast still make this well worth viewing. For those who enjoy court room drama's and thrillers.PRIMAL FEAR - 8.1 OUT 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN, WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOODNIGHT !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My fiancée suggested I watch this, and when we found it for sale at a good price, we bought it right away. I must say, this is a marvelous and quite well-crafted film. The acting is top-notch all the way. Gere manages to make us care about a type of person that few like. O'Quinn is somewhat underused, as he is a magnificent actor, but apart from that, everyone gets a good chance to perform well, and they all live up to it. I would have to say that I now have a completely new-found respect for Norton... and I had a great deal of respect for him before even knowing of this movie. The plot is well-written and has good layers to it, especially for a movie of two hours(running time does put quite a limitation on the level of detail and intricacy of the plot). The pacing is really good, the movie never moves neither too fast nor too slowly. This is the second film I've seen that was directed by Gregory Hoblit... and the second that I've really, really liked(both have received 8's by yours truly, and very deservedly so), so I will most definitely keep an eye out for any future works by the man. I haven't read the book of the same title that this is based on, so I can't comment on how accurate and true to the tone this film is. I urge anyone intending to watch this to steer clear of any spoilers on it, because the plot is too good to ruin. I won't detail it here, I'll just say that the film has many court-room scenes, and deals with a very violent crime(and it's not the only occurrence in the film of a violent nature). For that same reason, since it is depicted graphically in the film(but not too much... there was nothing gratuitous about it), I urge anyone who believes they may not be able to handle seeing such to consider if they should watch it or not. There is also quite a bit of language, as well as a brief scene of sexual nature, so if such bother you, you may want to watch a censored version, if you are interested in seeing it. I recommend this very warmly to any fan of court-room dramas and thrillers. If you enjoy an engaging and involving thriller with surprises, this is the movie for you. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely underrated thriller; Not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****SPOILER ALERT***** I was surprised looking at the IMDb top 250 movies that "Primal Fear" isn't among them while the more elaborately made and overrated thriller "The Usual Subjects" is listed as #17 among the all time best in motion picture history. Both movies have narratives that build up to a shocking and surprising ending but the movie "Primal Fear's" ending fits right in with the story that it's presenting and doesn't take anything away from it. While at the same time when you see the movie again for any clues for the surprise ending as hard as you try you can't find them because the ending was, in the true sense of the word, a total surprise."Primal Fear" is really one of those movies that has a good story that builds up the suspense level with acting and directing and delivers a shocking ending. The film climax not only stuns the audience but makes total sense and doesn't take away anything from the story that you saw up to that point when it hits you. Where as "The Usual Suspects" surprise ending seems totally contrived and completely negates the story that you were seeing up to the part that you were hit by it that the movie plot that you were watching becomes utterly senseless.Marty Vail, Richard Gere, is one of Chicago's top defense attorneys who likes to take on high-profile cases for a hefty fee or Pro-Bono as long as it gets him publicity and embellishes his already envious reputation. Marty also believes that everybody no matter how repulsive their crime, which there accused of deserves to be defended to the utmost of his ability. One morning in a bar watching the TV Vail sees a live news report of the police chasing down a young man who is reported to have murdered a very powerful and popular man from the Catholic Church Archbishop Richard Rushman, Stanley Anderson. Smelling publicity in defending that person, if he's not killed by the police or ends up killing himself, Vail uses his connections to get on the case defending him. At the jail-house talking to the young man Aaron Stampler, Edward Norton, he finds out that he's a 19 year-old altar boy at the church that the Archbishop was in charge of. Stampler tells him that he blacked out, lost time as he puts it, when he came into the Archbishops office when he heard that there was someone else there. Stampler blacked out but when he woke up from his unconscious state he found himself covered with blood and the Archbishop was dead! Seeing that he just panicked and ran. The state wants the death penalty for Stampler and assigned to prosecute the case Janet Venable, Laura Linney, who once had an affair with Marty Vail and is very surprised that Vail is handling the case for Stampler's defense. Before he's to go on trial when Stampler is examined by a defense paid psychiatrist Dr. Molly Arrington, Frances McDormand. It's then discovered that he has a split personality and is not in control of himself when his other self takes over his mind and he becomes "Roy", a completely different and violent person! Marty Vail later also finds this out the hard and brutal way about Stampler's condition by being banged around by "Roy". It's determined by Dr. Arrington that Sampler is a very sick person and should get help in a mental hospital not in a prison but since the trial is already on Vail can't change the plea from not guilty to innocent by reason of insanity. Vail later finds out that Stampler was sexually abused by the Archbishop by tracking down a video tape with the Archbishop having Stampler and other altar boys and girls engage in sexual activities while he watched. The tape would not only be very embarrassing to the church but to a lot of high powerful people in the city and state government if it were released.Vail sends a copy of the tape to the prosecutor, Miss. Venable, so it would force her to use it at the trial. At the trial State Prosecutor Venable has the tape played,to the total shock of those in the courtroom, to show that Stampler had cause and reason to murder the Archbishop. Just as Vail expected, by releasing the tape to Venable, the case starts to backfire against her. It's then when Vail puts Aaron Stampler on the stand to be cross-examined by Miss. Venable who aggressive and belligerently questions him on the archbishops murder he goes completely berserk. "Roy" takes over Aaron's mind and attacks Miss. Venable and almost ends up breaking her neck. Everybody decides, the Judge as well as the prosecution, that Stampler is insane and not responsible for his actions and drops the murder case against him. I's agreed that he needs to be in a mental hospital and not in a state prison ;but the story is not over for the movies shocking and surprising ending is just about to happen. One of the best crime/court dramas ever made with outstanding performances by, of course, Edward Norton, Richard Gere, Laura Linney and everyone else involved with the acting in the movie. Don't miss seeing it you won't be disappointed, you'll be rewarded with one of the best crime/court dramas and surprise ending movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Norton delivers the chills...(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PRIMAL FEAR is a good old-fashioned thriller with a modern twist. The plot concerns an altar boy accused of killing a clergyman who molested him and a sleazy lawyer who sees a chance to make tabloid news by taking the case. What he doesn't know is that his client can be just as cunning as he is.RICHARD GERE seemed to specialize in playing these kind of low-down heels (typecasting does have its perils), and LAURA LINNEY as the prosecuting lawyer has her hands full trying to play a game of one-upmanship against him during an intense courtroom trial.The story ends on a chilling note, thanks largely to the clever, intense and totally convincing performance ED NORTON gives in his film debut. As the guy who seems to have a devious split personality driving him to do bad things, he's the kind of actor who makes the audience sit up and take notice of his abrupt mood changes. It's no wonder he pulls the wool over so many eyes.Having said that, it's the climax of the film that is most stunning and brings the story to a totally unexpected conclusion. It's the kind of chilling twist that only the most clever scriptwriters can devise and make seem probable--but it succeeds here.Summing up: The kind of film you'll want to revisit once you know the whole score. Gere, Linney and Norton deserve high praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent thriller that relies heavily on a solid cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****Here's a film I remembered being a huge fan of back when I first saw it in theaters in '96. Seeing it again for the third time since, it doesn't quite live up to my fond memories. Aside from Edward Norton's scene-stealing performance as suspect Aaron Stampler, there's really not much about the film that separates it from most of the genre. The plot, concerning the murder of a beloved archbishop at the alleged hands of an innocent-looking altar boy and the eventual high-profile trial, is certainly rife with potential but is never executed beyond the level that's expected of a competent pulp thriller.But credit should be given where it's due, especially the first hour of the film, which does a pretty solid job of setting up the film as an engrossing mix of murder mystery and courtroom drama. The performances are all solid, with Richard Gere providing yet another effective variation of the slick, cocky persona (this time as a "big-shot attorney") he's mastered and Laura Linney acting convincingly stressed out and aggravated by the understandably vexing situation her character's been placed in.But with all the pieces in place in the first half, the film never quite results in the tight, suspenseful thriller we expect. The most noticeable problem is excess baggage, with the film too often straying from the case at hand and veering towards less interesting tangents. There's just too much chaff here, with subplots that include the romantic tension between Linney and Gere, the writer doing the article on Vail, and the housing development project that simply takes up too much of the movie's already overlong running time.Equally problematic is a major plot twist halfway through which, while effective in its own right and allows the opportunity for Norton to stretch his considerable acting talent, ultimately lessens the speculative tension that these thrillers usually rely on. From that point on, most of the enjoyment is derived from Norton's performance, and though it's not quite the show-stopper I once considered it to be (probably doesn't help I just saw this flick after his absolutely incredible performance in American History X), it's still one of the better debut performances any actor has ever put forth.It's with some relief that I can at least say the film saves its best scenes for last (the last three minutes are quite memorable), and definitely finishes things off on a high note. Primal Fear was directed by Gregory Hoblit, who's actually proved himself a pretty skillful filmmaker when it comes to crafting thrillers. This one's merely competent, no more and no less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of holes but still enjoyable and inventive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When an altar boy, Aaron Stampler, is accused of murdering a priest, the media-friendly, arrogant lawyer Martin Vail takes the case (and the headlines). However he discovers that the boy is not all he seems and that there may have been a third person in the room when the priest was murdered. However his plea is fixed and he must work the case to turn things back to his advantage.Years ago, the UK did a day where the Government subsidised cinemas to offer all tickets for ?1. On that day I had nothing I wanted to see but I thought (like thousands other) that a saving of ?3 (at the time) was too good to miss, so I went to see this film despite my caution when it comes to courtroom thrillers. The plot here is so very full of holes that it is a wonder that the whole film doesn't fall into itself, however it just about manages to succeed by being quite clever and significantly different from the usual courtroom stuff (although it does still have the same faults as the rest of the genre).The film is a lot darker than many courtroom thrillers; first of all, Vail is not a sympathetic character - he is arrogant and conceited, and the film never really offers him redemption at any point. Likewise the climax of the film is not the usual genre twist - or rather, it is, but not in the usual way. The film's main weakness however is that it is at least 20 minutes too long. The revelations about Roy happen but then are forgotten for about 10 minutes and then raised again before being put aside again. I really can't even understand why the film feels so padded at points in the middle when really that was when the Roy thing kicks in and the film should have stepped up a gear in a flash. That it doesn't is a problem, but not an insurmountable one, as it does slowly get faster towards a downbeat conclusion that is enjoyably different from the usual Perry Mason style twist (although it is a twist).I'm by no means a Richard Gere fan, but he does a very good job here. He never wants to be a good guy here and he plays it well. However the film is driven by a great performance from Norton, marking himself out as one to watch in coming years. His dual roles are great and the film would have failed if he hadn't been able to carry it off. The support cast is surprisingly deep with people who were either well-known at the time or became famous later. When a cast includes Mahoney, McDormand, Woodard, Linney, Seda, and Braugher then it is worth a look - although some of them have very small roles there are no weak links. However it is a credit to Norton that he stands shoulder to shoulder with all of them and is the one that sticks in the mind long after it finishes.Overall this is an enjoyable courtroom thriller that only struggles in the middle with an inability to really just let rip. It's ironic, but I enjoyed it because it was less showy and so on when compared to others of the genre, but it could have benefited from knowing when to let go sooner. However the cast is top notch and the unlikely plot is held together by a low key Gere and a fantastic central performance(s) from Norton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Norton could not have picked a better film in which to debut.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal Fear, directed by Gregory Hoblit, written by Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman is based on the book by William Diehl. Primal Fear is one of the few examples of a psychological thriller with young, new talent shinning in a film with a great script and excellent direction. Edward Norton could not have picked a better film in which to debut.When Arch Bishop Rushmen is murdered in his office, a young parishioner, Aaron Stampler, is found running from the scene covered in blood. The police follow him to a train yard where he is eventually arrested. When Stampler, expertly played by Edward Norton, is captured by the police he is obviously terrified, unexpectedly meek, and can't make eye contact. Stampler's prominent stutter and introverted personality make his guilt difficult to digest.Richard Gere's character, the smarmy defense attorney Richard Vail, sees the capture on the local news and decides to represent Stampler pro-bono for the publicity. He leaves his cover page interview to get to Stampler's cell before any other defense attorney does. The first half of the movie plays like a thrilling murder trial drama. District Attorney, Janet Venable, played by Laura Linney, tirelessly and doggedly pursues Stampler. Evidence is covertly and excitingly collected. Light is shined on different aspects of the case by both the DA and the defense attorney.Vail tracks down another alter boy who tells him the sins of the Arch Diocese and that he taped them. Vail gets the video and it rocks the case from a simple church slaying to a complicated case of blame the victim. This is only one of the first masterfully written plot turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat and unable to truly grasp the situation fully. Vail orders a psychological evolution for Stampler. The interview brings to surface a Stampler's mental illness. When Stampler's mental illness (I won't ruin it for you) is revealed to his psychologist, it is horrifying and rocks the viewer with an unexpected jolt. His guilt or innocence is no longer easy to figure out and isn't a case of black or white. The rest of the courtroom drama rests on your perception of the guilt or innocence of Aaron Stampler. Courtroom drama isn't the only drama. Interrelated to the case there is a subplot about rich business men, murder, church corruption and mobsters. Yeah, it could go downhill fast and sounds cheeseball but it works. The subplot gives Vail motivation for passionately defending his client.Richard Gere flawlessly plays the grandiloquent Vail. Vail must believe, disbelieve, question, and wonder about Stampler's guilt. Even so, Gere's acting never misses the mark. He gives new meaning to smarmy and surprise. Even so, his acting is far outshined by Edward Norton's disturbing performance.Edward Norton's character ranges from pitiful to downright scary. The challenge of Norton's character is portraying a man who might be guilty but making it so hard to conceive that your mind can't get around it. Portraying a person with the mental illness (I'm still not going to tell you) Stampler has is extremely difficult to do with out turning the part into a poltergeistic mess but Norton leaves you with your mouth hanging open, unable to speak. It is no wonder that Norton was nominated for an Academy Award for this role.Gregory Hoblit's direction is worthy of applause. The fragile nature of all the relationships is a thread he had to walk like a tightrope. Each actor's performance would have devastated the film if it were over or underacted. Still, Hoblit was able to get passion and coldness at the exact level the character, the relationships and the film required. It was as if he wanted his direction to cook the perfect omelet. Too long in the pan and it's rubber, too short and it's soupy, just right and it's breakfast. This film is an exceptional work of cinematic art. Every character is multi-dimensional, perfectly written and wonderfully acted. I could watch this movie over and over again and it doesn't lose a thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking Film Brings Out Acting Talents Of All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll always think of this movie as the one which introduced us to the acting talents of Edward Norton. In other words, this movie made him a star, as the cliché goes.But Richard Gere should be credited, too, with another fine acting performance. For quite awhile there, Gere acted in one good movie after another and I believe this was one of his best efforts. Sometimes his "pretty boy" image masked the fact that he has been a pretty darned good actor in a number of film.Not only is the acting superb in here - by everyone, not just Norton - but the story is very involving, too. I remember being riveted to the screen while seeing this in the theater. Some of the scenes are quite shocking, particularly when we discover the real "Aaron Stampler" (Norton). If you wait awhile (at least five years) and see it again, it's still shocking even if you vaguely remember a few things.The bad side of this - to me, not to most people, is the overuse of the Lord's name in vain in here (mostly by Gere, who is ridiculous in this role in that regard) and the obvious anti-Catholic bias in here. Once again on film, we discover that a priest turns out to not only be a sexual deviant but also the cause of Aaron's murderous mindset. I also didn't find Laura Linney's character, "Janet Venable" to be entertaining, just annoying. There's something about Linney's smug looks that really turn me off. I have found that unlikeable characteristic in some of her other films, as well.Overall, if language or Catholic-bashing doesn't bother you, this is a super film. Even if it does, it's a pretty intense crime movie and certainly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About that ending... *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw PRIMAL FEAR years ago and I remember not liking it, but not why. Now, I'm not supposed to ever watch this movie again (an actor friend was thisclose to getting the role that made Ed Norton a star, which is why AMERICAN HISTORY X and FIGHT CLUB are also banned from discussion). But PRIMAL FEAR was on TV the other night, and I wanted to see it without bias.I still don't really like it. Norton, of course, is magnificent, but the movie is plagued with flaws. The murder was unnecessarily graphic (did we really need to see blood spurting from severed fingers?), and the second act was slow, muddled, and, when all was said and done, rife with red herrings (nothing bored me more than the talk about fluctuating real estate prices, which ultimately didn't factor in the plot's resolution). And then there's that final revelation, which raised several unanswered questions.Ok, if Aaron was faking it the whole time, then how long had he been affecting that stutter? The whole time he was an altar boy? If that's true, then he was planning the murder before he even met the archbishop - which means he would at that time have no reason to murder him. However, if he created that speech pattern after the murder, surely there would be plenty of people who'd know he was lying.Other problems. Was there no effort at all to locate the missing girlfriend? What happened to Alex after he divulged the existence of the incriminating videotape? And wasn't that abnormally large bandage on his ear a too-obvious way for Gere to spot him? And couldn't that perfunctory chase sequence have been eliminated? We know they would have caught him so he could supply crucial information; if he had gotten away, what would have been the reason for the scene?Still more. Speaking of that videotape, why would the bishop record every sexual encounter on a single tape, only to tape over the previous meeting to record the latest one? Wasn't it awfully convenient that he was killed before he could erase the important evidence? Did he tape others too, or just the three relevant to the plot? Also, wouldn't the judge have been required to order a complete psychiatric evaluation for Aaron before having him committed? Even though Aaron claimed to not have remembered his assault on the Linney character, couldn't he have easily heard about it from a guard or someone? (Of course he didn't - we'd have no surprise ending if he did.) And what's the probability that this kid could have duped all those intelligent, educated professionals so successfully?If you can answer these questions for me, I'd love to hear from you. And, while I'm nitpicking, there's something else in the movie that annoyed me - Laura Linney's smoking. It was terribly obvious that Linney is a nonsmoker. Every time she lit up she would awkwardly hold the stick near her face while never taking a drag (the scene in the bar after she receives the videotape is the prime example). Sure, she'd occasionally put it between her lips, but the camera would always cut away before she inhaled, and the one time I saw her breathe out, there clearly was no smoke being exhaled. Why have her character smoke? As a smoker, I cannot tell you how distracting this is. Whenever I notice this in movies, I am momentarily taken out of the story and instead am watching a documentary of an actress unconvincingly holding a lit cigarette. (Another example that comes to mind is Ashley Judd in DOUBLE JEOPARDY.) Add all this to the stuff there we've all seen before in courtroom dramas - surprise testimony, murmurs from the peanut gallery that cause the judge to pound his/her gavel, a personal relationship between the prosecution and defense attorneys, a less-than-honorable John Mahoney (anyone else remember SUSPECT?) - and I now know why I don't like PRIMAL FEAR. It's the type of movie that needs about fifteen minutes trimmed from it (that chase scene can be the first to go) while requiring a couple of additional scenes to clarify plot points. But while I mentioned DOUBLE JEOPARDY here, I am in no way comparing the two; PRIMAL FEAR is twice as good as DOUBLE JEOPARDY - a 4/10 instead of 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Norton's Explosive Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that we all have different tastes when it comes to movies and that we all see greatness in a variety of ways. I will be the first to admit that I was totally lost when watching the Matrix and possess absolutely no desire to sit through the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. I am not trying to take anything away from those movies because I also understand that a large percent of the movie viewing population see the Matrix and LOTR trilogies as masterpieces.That being said, it is beyond me why Primal Fear never made it to more people's "best" or "greatest" lists. It has received positive ratings on this website, but overall the movie enjoyed very quiet success. This movie is spectacular from start to finish. The ending is a doozy and Edward Norton's performance is Oscar worthy. Not only did his performance blind side me (who the hell is this guy?), but it was also a sign of great things to come from Edward Norton. He is one of our greatest actors.The plot, an altar boy is accused of murdering a priest who as it turns out was molesting him, seems even more relevant 10 years later than it did in 1996. That is the basic plot, but there are so many subplots and side stories about political corruption and cover ups that make for one incredibly satisfying story.The performances are top notch all the way down the cast. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Steven Bauer and even Terry O' Quinn turn in stellar performances. The movie takes place in Chicago and I believe it perfectly captures what I consider to be the Chicago mood or attitude (I live in a western suburb of Chicago).Of course the movie is about more than an altar boy who may or may not have committed murder and political corruption. The movie's central character, Martin Vail (Gere), is a defense attorney who because of his high profile cases enjoys a minor celebrity status. His name is always in the newspapers and his face is always on the TV news. He can't get enough of this attention either. Martin is a great defense attorney, but he's definitely too arrogant for his own good. When a reporter asks, "When do you realize you have them? When do you realize you've won?" Vail responds without giving it much thought, "The minute I accept the case." I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in the theaters. A lot of movies promise a "truly shocking ending" and that "THIS movie will keep you guessing until the very end." The trailers for Primal Fear said none of that. Sitting in the theater there was no expectation on my part for a twist ending. Perhaps that is why during its initial viewing it was more shocking to me than even the twist in The Sixth Sense. With The Sixth Sense you KNEW there was something to figure so for two hours that is exactly what you did. You tried to figure it out. Primal Fear's ending totally sucker punched me. The twist isn't revealed until the final minute or two of the movie, so up until the minute it is revealed the viewer honestly trusts everything they have just seen. There are no hints that what you are being told may not be true. It's a masterpiece. Hitchcock would have loved it and it's Edward Norton's performance that really makes it work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gere's sheister-lawyer will have you wondering "What IS the difference between a lawyer and a whore?!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal Fear(1996) takes great care at first to paint its protagonist Martin Vale(Richard Gere) as an arrogant, high-profile ambulance chaser--largely through the rather obvious narrative device of having him be interviewed for a magazine cover-story. Nevertheless director Gregory Hoblit ("NYPD Blue"(TV), Frequency(2000)) teases out a sheister's midnight musings--telegraphing that Vale is missing something--when he has the lawyer tell THE lawyer-joke ALL WRONG during the fade-in: the correct punchline to "What's the difference between a lawyer and a whore?", is "-The whore stops scr**ing you after you're dead".This is Vale's emotional journey: how he became a sheister, whom he left behind, and whether, if we scratch his surface, he still has an ethical heart beating beneath his cocky-and-selfish exterior. Gere does his usual good job, delivering a solid performance elevated by terrific chemistry with his leading lady, even providing the movie with a stunning ending--but Primal Fear has become Edward Norton's star-maker, and an instant classic for it.It's now the stuff of Hollywood legend how Norton was so impressive during his reading for the part of Aaron/Roy Stampler, that Tinseltown fell all over itself offering the unknown its meatiest parts even before Fear was "in the can". He's had a golden career since, being allowed to direct his 6th film (Keeping the Faith(2000)); and his fast rise in Hollywood has seemingly impelled Ed in private to question if this is all there is. But Norton doesn't carry the acting load all by himself--that's spread out evenly among the top-notch cast assembled by Deborah Aquila and Jane Shannon. Laura Linney's edgy and "pi$$ed-off-as-hell" lone female lawyer certainly deflects much of Norton's glory.Linney(Absolute Power(1997), Kinsey(2005), Jindabyne(2006)) for my money steals the movie, amply evidencing her Julliard training. Her Janet Venables is Vale's cynical nicotine-sucking ex-protégé, still plugging away at the State Attorney's Office long after he quit. Vale resents her lack of equal conviction, yet pines for her, having previously abandoned their romance. Unfortunately--or fortunately--she is still smarting from his arrogant self-serving attitude, and now gleefully baits him at every opportunity.She has plenty, since they're opposing counsel in the Stampler case, and Linney delivers a wonderful 'bit' as she angrily apes Stampler to Vale: "I gotta admit, that FACE is GREAT--you prepping him to take the stand? That stutter is p-p-p-p-priceless"!As noted, there are many familiar faces, mostly from TV: powerhouse Andre Braugher ("Homicide--Life on the Street"); soft-spoken Joe Spano ("Hill Street Blues"); prototypically-Irish-yet-deceptively-broiling John Mahoney ("Frasier"); sublimely blasé Alfre Woodard ("St Elsewhere"); and even pixyishly competent Maura Tierney (Liar Liar(1997)).As in all the best courtroom-dramas, Fear is both socio-political and character-driven. It's packed to the brim with backstory for every character, thanks to its previous incarnation as a William Diehl novel. The gutsy Ann Biderman/Steve Shagan screenplay, combined with Hoblit's intelligent direction, allows the human relationships to be complex and to have lots of history, often with each other.At just over 2hrs, Fear is a riveting education in the routine abduction of our legal system by the rich and powerful. They usually turn out to be the city fathers. John Shaughnessy(Mahoney), the State Attorney, knows he is the pivot of considerable financial skullduggery amidst the intimate secrets of all the usual players when he claims that "this city doesn't burn because I won't permit it".This subplot recalls the notion of "menschkeit" from Ken Lipper's similarly-intentioned City Hall(1996). The sudden, surprising fate of Vale's other client Joey Pinero (Steven Bauer, aka the skinny "gerbil" from Running Scared(1986), Det.Sigliano) serves as silent exposition to Shaughnessy's m.o.: it's a clue as to why Vale quit Shaughnessy's office in the first place.Such lightning-bolts do make Miss Venables' determination to stay actually hard to comprehend, but her resultant tensile-steel-composure among men speaks volumes. Her tough-minded presence in "the enemy camp" offers Vale one last opportunity not to underestimate her. When he doesn't, it's the best compliment he could've paid her, relieving much of his earlier guilt.We discover Shaughnessy's surprising personal stake in the Stampler case way late into the last quarter, as Vale FINALLY introduces it in court. The overdue explanation seems somewhat annoying, since the financial skullduggery represents a powerful motive for all those not on trial.Stampler's backstory, too, must be as interesting as his awesome portrayal by Norton. His remark to Vale's psychiatrist (the surprisingly dull Frances McDormand (Fargo(2000)) that his father WAS not a nice man, is significant. He is making a distinction between the deaths of his father and mother, essentially "burying the lead".There is one more clue about Stampler's feelings towards duplicitous people: his resentful flash of emotion upon being forced to admit that the archbishop's bending of altar-boy rules on Stampler's behalf was "nice of him". In hindsight, it's possible to guess at Stampler's tortured--and terrifying--inner world.All this propels us towards the closing dilemma. We witness Vale's satisfaction at uncovering one onion-layer of truth as he finally exposes his former boss, but then lose his own righteous certainty once he realises that complete faith in innocence is also misplaced. This becomes the sheister's lament: "Why gamble with money when you can gamble with people's lives?!" Where do you put your faith when no-one is "clean"?Credit must go to DoP Michael Chapman for Fear's profound epilogue: it depicts Gere's cuckolded lawyer trying to grasp his own humanity. Chapman visualises Vale's (suddenly) topsy-turvy-world with a tracking-overhead shot using a hothead mount, as Vale walks from the courtroom. The scene restores to a normal dolly shot as his cold stop--and bewilderment--jolts us into desperation, wondering if this hadn't just been Martin Vale's very LAST attempt at compassion.(10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is THEE Thriller...period!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal Fear will always be on of the best movies I have ever seen. I remember the first time I saw it, I remember each and every subsequent time and each time it's equally as incredible. As thrillers go this is the be all and end all!! Drop dead powerful performances, a moving story, captivating courtroom drama and scenes and an ending that makes The Sixth Sense look predictable. In this review I WILL NOT reveal the ending in any way, shape or form because if you have not yet seen this movie I would never deprive anyone of the incredible shock that this film delivers. Richard Gere is one of my favorite actors, always has been. He has a screen presence rivaled by very few and his performance in Primal Fear is no exception. Martin Vail will always be one of his best performances. Vail is conceited, hopelessly stuck on his own ego. He believes himself to be unparalleled in the world of law and he can't wait to sink his teeth into the media story of the century. A young man and alter boy has been arrested following a brutal murder of a beloved arch bishop. Perplexing thing is this boy is the most soft spoken, stuttering, quiet, innocent boy Vail has ever seen and he immediately sees fame attached to this case. Without a doubt Gere's character goes through the greatest transformation in this film as he quickly discovers the difference between truth and lies, defense and offense and that not everything is black and white.Primal Fear is the story on many levels of people who wear "masks", different sides of themselves to different people. Each character wears a different mask throughout the film. Vail wears the mask of being pompous and confident but in fact is scared, fragile, and emotional. The defendant Aaron wears the mask of being the innocent, scared little boy but has the evil alter personality that protects him. Laura Linney's character Janet Venable also wears the mask of being a confident, strong lawyer while in fact feeling her world is falling apart and of course the victim himself Bishop Rushman who to the city was a beloved man who helped many but in fact performed horrible perverted things on his children behind closed doors. Laura Linney is quite good as the rather shaken prosecutor who is really fighting for her job in trying to vindicate Aaron while taking on her former love Vail in the courtroom. She has something to prove and a huge chip on her shoulder and makes for some intense debates in the courtroom between Gere and Linney. Frances McDormand is also very good as Aaron's psychiatrist Dr. Arrington, she's very believable and handles the role with great intelligence. All these amazing performances in this film and they still don't even come fathoms close to touching that of then newcomer Mr. Edward Norton in his Academy Award (and hugely deserved) nominated role as Aaron Stampler and his protective, brash, angry, violent alter personality Roy. Norton is so believable as Stampler and to watch his scary transformation to Roy, his performance draws you in exactly like he's doing for the main characters in the film. You're feeling everything that Martin Vail is feeling as you watch this movie. Every single person's performance in this film is so brilliant that it adds into one amazing film. Other notable smaller performances are Maura Tierney, Alfre Woodard, John Mahoney, and the great Andre Braugher. None of these performances should be ignored.Director Gregory Hoblit at the heart makes a courtroom drama with lots of behind the scenes investigation that puts the action and thrill into the film. But that doesn't stop when it hits the courtroom. The drama and fire ignites in the courtroom with the battle back and forth, further facts, new evidence, a story unfolding before us about this Bishop and his brutal murder. From beginning to end this is one entertainment at it's absolute best. In my opinion I state this as one of the greatest films ever period!! It's absolutely one of my top ten for certain. It's just powerful, moving, well acted and thrilling. It's exactly what you want a film to be...it's what movies are all about. Everyone must see this brilliant movie!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal Fear shows how good acting can sometimes outweigh problems in other areas?like logical loopholes large enough to sail a barge through, for example.The characters in this movie are so good that such difficulties just don't seem to matter. They can make not completely unexpected plot twists seem like classic surprise shockers. They can make a murder mystery story weighed down with all kinds of extraneous baggage like city political corruption and church scandals seem to flow like butter. I'm talking about GOOD acting! From the major to the minor parts, and everywhere in between.At center stage is defense lawyer Martin Vail (Gere) who will defend anyone of anything, especially if he stands to gain either financially or in TV exposure. So when a revered archbishop is brutally murdered, Vail offers his services to the frightened young man arrested for the crime. For free, no less. He knows this will be a sensational trial.But it turns out to be even more sensational than either Vail or we expect. And that is mostly due to newcomer Norton. He plays the defendant, a stuttering, seemingly simple Kentucky boy in the big city who protests his innocence, in spite of being found running from the murder scene covered in blood.Anyone who has liked Gere previously, even a little, will enjoy his performance here. But even those who don't particularly like him might be intrigued by Vail. He's slimy but intelligent, sexy yet occasionally vulnerable. It's the best role I've seen for him in a while (and I'm one of his fans).But Norton is really something else. He's got the kind of talent that makes you hope you can say, some years from now: "Oh, yeah, I remember seeing his FIRST movie." That's actually the best reason for seeing Primal Fear, now that I think about it.(Squeamish viewers might want to wait and see if his next film is less disturbing, though. Primal Fear includes some gory footage toward the beginning, and some disturbing sexual discussions, along with a pornographic "video" that is quite gross).And those minor characters are worth mentioning, too. You won't believe how creepy John Mahoney ("Frasier's" funny dad) can be. Alfre Woodard is outstanding as the trial's judge. And Linney, although she's put in the trite situation of being Vail's former lover AND courtroom opponent, makes more of her character than you would expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward Norton's debut was outstanding in this film, and his work since has confirmed his substantial talent.Richard Gere was equally-proficient in his role as the big-shot defense attorney defending Norton's seemingly hapless "Aaron."And Laura Linney - although in a role with less screen-time, was also equal in her performance as the prosecutor, and Gere's courtroom opposition and former lover.The supporting roles were well-cast and played, and perhaps the only criticism to be given would be some brief sub-plot elements which weren't necessary to the main story, but really didn't detract from it significantly.This film provides an excellent combination of courtroom- and psycho-drama - each excellent in its own right, and superb together in this presentation's plot.Gripping, thoroughly-enjoyable entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, with a then unknown Edward Norton, who steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Norton truly is a genius. He carries a lot of this film's magnificence and is the most memorable actor in this film. The story itself is of course not bad either and the performances of the rest of the cast are good too, but there was not a lot of excitement in this film. Nor was there a character I could relate to in a way. Still this film is pretty good and that is due ONLY to the great performance of Edward Norton. Norton is (my guess is as good as yours) the actor of the 21st century, for he had played a number of truly memorable and great characters. Though his films are no blockbusters he is a recognised and worshipped actor, not only by fellow actors, critics (two Oscar nominations at the age of 31), but also among the people around the world for his roles in The People vs. Larry Flint, American History X, and Fight Club. Maybe even Rounders too, but that is maybe his worst performance. I have not yet seen Keep the Faith which he also directed, produced plus starred in, but I'm sure it is good and I know I will see a lot of other good films featuring this young, fine actor. As for this film, this is the worst of the five I have mentioned and seen Edward Norton in and what is my verdict then you wonder, well hold on to the grade Norton's ?worst' film gets from me.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior courtroom drama with a star-making turn from Edward Norton...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PRIMAL FEAR was a surprisingly effective courtroom drama which will always have a place in history because of the electrifying performance from Edward Norton in his first major role. Norton is nothing short of astonishing as a former Chicago alter boy who has been accused of murdering a celebrated priest with a checkered past. Richard Gere has one of his best roles as Martin Vale, an arrogant yet capable attorney who agrees to defend Norton because of what the victory would do for his resume more than belief in the young man's innocence. It is the complicated twist and turns of the trial, Gere's surprisingly solid interpretation of a rather complex character and most of all, the amazing performance of Edward Norton, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor that, that make this film sizzle. Mention should also be made for a strong supporting cast including Laura Linney as the prosecuting attorney and former protégé of Vale's, Alfre Woodard as the judge, Frances McDormand as a court-appointed therapist, and Andre Braugher as Vale's leg man. Steve Shagan's solid screenplay and Gregory Hoblit's uncompromising direction are the final touches on one of the better courtroom dramas of the 90's but what you really go away from this film remembering above all else is the performance by Edward Norton that made him a star.</fullReview>

It's about discovering complex characters that don't make the plot interesting through their acts, but through their nature and Richard Gere and ,of course, Edward Norton do it so through pure, great acting. This two combined make a perfect couple that make the storyline and the movie interesting and captivating - in short - it makes you watch the movie more and more without boredom.

But once you got pass that the plot kept moving along very well for a court room drama movie. Edward Norton was Excellent in his role! I would have liked to seen more of Andre Braugher's character and how his behind the court room scene work helped Richard Gere prepare his case. The ramifications of the underlying story between John Mahony and Steven Bauer would have been an added benefit to viewer. An answer to the question: Did he get away with it?

		<shortDescription>Despite making garbage like Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride, Richard Gere redeems himself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long disliked Richard Gere since he's made so many bad films and yet remained a first-tier star. PRETTY WOMAN, RUNAWAY BRIDE, American GIGOLO, FIRST KNIGHT and KING David are all wretched movies despite the large numbers of the public who went to see these films. Just because people see a film does not mean the film is worth seeing or that the public is right. If you believe in the public and its collective intelligence, then perhaps you can explain WWI and WWII! So, people are, at times, quite stupid and Richard Gere is one of many actors who are inexplicably popular.BUT, despite my long rant above, I was actually very shocked that I found a well-written and intelligent film starring Gere!! But, given my jaded view of the public, this was of course, not one of Gere's more successful films to date! Gere plays a sleazy defense attorney that takes the case of Edward Norton who is accused of a violent and senseless murder. What I loved was that Gere really didn't care at first if Norton had done it or that he posed a huge threat to the public. Instead, he saw this case as a great way to get publicity. And, after a while, he starts to believe that maybe his client actually WAS innocent! Instead of going into the movie in more detail (since this will ruin any suspense), I want to talk about Edward Norton in the film. His performance was brilliant and chilling. The writers of the movie really did their homework and with Norton created a wonderful example of a true sociopath. His performance alone make this a must-see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primal Gere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beloved archbishop is brutally murdered, and an altar boy (Edward Norton) is seen fleeing the scene, covered in blood. All evidence seems to point to the boy as the culprit. A stereotypical Richard Gere/Tom Cruise character (played by Richard Gere), a hot-shot, high-powered, ruthless attorney, decides to go for even more fame and fortune and defend the boy.Everyone in the city, nay, the universe believes Aaron Stampler is responsible for the slaying, which of course isn't just a cold-blooded mow-down; no, it's also mutilation, as numbers were carved into the archbishop's chest and his eyes were gouged out. But Martin Vail (Gere) believes he can get his client cleared of all charges; his thoughts on Stampler's actual guilt, he thinks, are largely irrelevant.Opposing Vail as the prosecuting attorney is an ex-flame, Janet Venable, played by Laura Linney. (Side question: Has anyone seen Laura Linney and Joan Allen in the same room?) Oh sure, of course she's an ex-flame, because otherwise it'd be tougher to build up sexual tension between the two lawyers, which you apparently must have in courtroom dramas nowadays. The character of Venable seems to exist basically as a foil to Vail; she stomps about angrily, trying to assert herself as a woman lawyer while under the constant threat of job endangerment while somehow avoiding the incredible, awesome charms of Vail himself. I'm sure it was tough.Vail's gotta find a way to give the jury a reasonable doubt. At his service he has trusty employees played by Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney, but there's only so much they can do. Just when Vail thinks he's succeeding, he's smacked over the head with reality; in other words, like most any other courtroom drama you've ever seen. Will Vail prevail? Did Stampler do it? Well, there IS a twist to the movie; two of them, actually. The first comes a little more than an hour into the movie, after an analysis by a shrink (Frances McDormand); the second, naturally, comes in the waning minutes of the film. Neither is Earth-shattering, and you might even be able to see the second one coming from a few miles away.On the plus side, Gere seems to be having plenty of fun. I know, it's such an unusual role for him, the know-everything Superman who's just sooooo much better than anyone else and doesn't mind letting people know. Quite a departure from his other roles as a know-it-all cadet (An Officer and a Gentleman), a know-it-all stockbroker (Pretty Woman), and a know-it-all reporter (Runaway Bride). Still and all, he turns in an engaging, appealing performance. It's not like he'll knock your socks off with his emoting; it's more like he's just kind of fun to watch. Linney, who's very talented, does a good job as well, although she would get an eerily similar role in 2005's The Exorcism of Emily Rose (reviewed on this site recently). In that film, she was the defense attorney who was trying to assert herself as a woman attorney while under the constant threat of job endangerment. Both movies had the theme of priests in peril; here, it's a murdered archbishop who might not have been an innocent anyway, and in the Emily Rose it's a priest accused of murder by neglect. Well, at least Linney's not being typecast.Probably the best aspect of the movie, though, is the emergence of Norton as a powerful on-screen presence. This was his first movie, but you'd never know it by his work here. He's not tentative, he's shifty, perfecting essaying his character's plight and innocence. A strong indication of things to come, as it turned out, as he's become one of America's finest thespians.Overall, Primal Fear is a decent yarn carried by strong performances, but the plot twists are nothing to write home about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see excellent acting in the service of an involving well told story this is a good place to start. Across the board there is not one weak performance. Gere has one of his very best roles as a fame loving attorney who chases a headline case that is more than he bargained for. He and the Laura Linney spar and parry both in and out of court with wonderful brio, she is his equal even if he is loath to admit it and the actress's personal strong persona fits the role perfectly. In a star making performance Edward Norton grabs his part by the throat and runs with it, a brilliant job and one that marked him as a true talent to watch. Each secondary roles is filled with top drawer character actors-Frances McDormand as an understanding therapist, Maura Tierney and Andre Braugher as Gere's assistants and on and on all deliver quality work. Alfre Woodard deserves special mention as the no nonsense slightly cantankerous judge who tipples a little on the side. She takes what could have been a throwaway part and makes her both memorable and humorous. A little overlong you won't notice so good is the acting and once it gets going the story keeps the interest level high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Primal Fear" is irresistible to anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas or psychological thrillers as it has a twisted plot that remains both gripping and immensely entertaining from beginning to end. It's really well written, well acted and also has an exceptionally good ending. The characters are particularly interesting and three of them are gradually revealed to be significantly less straightforward than they first appear.Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a very confident defense attorney who loves publicity and seeks out high profile cases which are likely to get plenty of media coverage, so when a young alter boy called Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) is arrested and accused of having murdered the Archbishop of Chicago, Vail offers his services on a pro bono basis.At first Vail's chances of success appear to be slim as all the available evidence points strongly to Aaron's guilt. Things seem to change, however, when Vail discovers that, not only had the Archbishop been involved in some dubious land deals in which a number of powerful people had lost a great deal of money, but also, he had subsequently received numerous death threats.Janet Venable (Laura Linney), who happens to be Vail's ex-lover, is assigned by the D.A. to prosecute the case and is instructed to press hard for the death penalty. The D.A.'s own actions are then called into question by Vail when it comes to light that he had been one of the people who'd lost money in the shady land deals.When Vail finds out that the Archbishop had also sexually abused the alter boys and that Aaron had been one of his victims, he's initially uncertain what to do with the information because making it generally available would give his client a strong motive for the crime and the lack of an apparent motive was the only real weakness in the prosecution's case.Vail's dealings with Aaron and the information he discovers about the activities of the Archbishop and the D.A. lead him to believe in his client's innocence and the means by which he proceeds to defend Aaron against the prosecution's accusations turns out to be highly unorthodox and extremely fascinating to watch."Primal Fear" has many moments of suspense and humour and also features a talented cast who provide some fine performances. Richard Gere's role enables him to display more subtlety than he's generally required to show and Edward Norton's Oscar nominated screen debut is utterly sensational. This movie stands out so strongly against others of its type that it and Norton's amazing contribution are both truly unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Norton strikes again !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I saw "Fight Club", I have never witnessed such a performance by this great actor named Edward Norton. The great performance of the "double sided blade roll" of Aron/Roy is done with extraordinary finesse since he is known for his dual-sided acting skills when playing calm/aggressive or good/bad figures. Putting aside the fact that I heard and read about the big sacrifices that Norton did for the filming of "Fight Club" (losing 20 kilos and gaining the fit and full of muscles body in just 40 days) I wouldn't bee so amazed of the Aaron/Roy performance in "Primal Fear". Edward Norton leaves us stunned again. He plays the role of a 19 years old altar-boy in a catholic church with such a grace, that even a bad-ass serial killer would be jealous. Seen the movie, loved the performance and did another bow to Edward Norton!</fullReview>

I really liked Richard Gere's character, especially his intentions as a lawyer, which he quotes in the bar after getting drunk; thought-provoking words... Gere's acting in this film was better than his average performance. But the real star of this movie is definitely EDWARD NORTON!!! He makes you a slave to the screen and blows you away at the same time. I'm really frustrated by the fact he didn't win the Oscar here; he received a Golden Globe though...

Like another Gregory Hoblit film (Fracture), you have to accept a certain amount of implausibilities. Like the murder itself, for instance, around which the film evolves. But also like Fracture, this is another (earlier) and surprisingly good take on lawyers and prosecutors (Richard Gere and Lara Linney) and the elusive perfect crime. As well, is the part played by Edward Norton. He's got that backwoods hardscrabble menace down about as well as anyone since those Georgia hillbillies in Deliverance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Richard Rushman, the Archbishop of Chicago, is brutally murdered, Martin Vail, one of the city's leading criminal lawyers takes on the task of defending the only suspect, an altar boy named Aaron Stampler. There are, however, some strange features about the case. Rushman was a highly popular individual, and Stampler appears to have had no motive for the crime. Indeed, Rushman showed the young man great kindness, saving him from a life of destitution on the streets. Stampler is put on trial, but as the case progresses disturbing facts start to come to light. There are hints that the late Archbishop may have been involved in sexual, financial and political corruption, and Vail starts to doubt both his client's sanity and his innocence. (The film has gained in topicality since 1996 as more scandals involving paedophile priests have come to light).Recent years have seen a large number of courtroom thrillers, but this is one of the better ones. Richard Gere gives a good performance as Vail. His voice is sometimes too soft, making his words indistinct (a common failing with this particular actor), but he is well able to convey the two sides of Vail's character's, his smooth plausibility and his arrogance. Vail is a brilliant but conceited lawyer, convinced that he is the only man who can save Stampler from the death penalty. (The film was made before Illinois introduced a moratorium on the use of capital punishment). There is another good contribution from Laura Linney (an excellent but often underrated actress) who plays Janet Venable, Counsel for the prosecution. In a plot development typical of this sort of thriller, she turns out to be Vail's ex-girlfriend, now determined to prove herself a better lawyer than her former lover. (Don't the American Bar Association have rules to prevent this sort of conflict of interests from arising?) I was already familiar with, and admired, Edward Norton's work in films such as "Fight Club" and "Kingdom of Heaven". Here he plays the part of Stampler (his first movie role) and gives what is probably the best acting performance in the film. Stampler has two distinct sides to his personality. On the one hand he is normally a quiet, inoffensive young man, shy, stammering and inarticulate. On the other, when under stress he can be assertive to the point of aggressiveness and rudeness, speaking loudly without any hint of a stammer. It is never clear which of these personalities is his "real" one, and the possibility is raised that he might be suffering from multiple personality disorder, which in turn raises questions about his accountability for his actions. The scenes in which Stampler suddenly switches between one personality and another are brilliantly executed; Norton brings out the contrasts between the mild "Aaron" and the aggressive "Roy" so starkly that one might think that two different actors were playing the two different personalities.Some of the plot developments seem rather implausible; in Britain it would be perfectly possible for a defendant to change his plea from a simple "not guilty" to "not guilty by reason of insanity" if new evidence about his mental state came to light after the trial had begun, and I can see no reason why things should be any different in another common-law jurisdiction such as the United States. On the whole, however, this is a very watchable and exciting thriller. Even the sudden twist at the end (I won't say what that is) does not spoil the film, as such twists sometimes do. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Law and the Demonic Altar Boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The life of an altar boy is not an easy one. Worse, when the altar boy has been sexually abused, the anger embedded is deep and dark. Years later when the boy has grown to adulthood and can retaliate against the abuser, the black fury of the past results in a gruesome, violent murder. Thus the premise of Primal Fear is realized in the film of the same name. Richard Gere plays Martin Vail an attorney with superb legal abilities and an inflated ego. However, the motivating power of the movie emanates primarily from the demon plagued Aaron Stampler, superbly played by new comer Edward Norton. The heinous murder of an archbishop sets the stage for a media swamped sensational trial in which the prosecutor seeks the death penalty and the defense tries to explain how two distinct personalities exist within the tortured soul of the young man accused of the crime. Still, a very subtle and unsuspecting nuance snakes itself into the story line, like a threatening viper and if not detected will strike your soul as does the film's conclusion. Great movie and superior acting makes for a worthwhile reason to watch it. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young stammerer man, "Aaron" (Edward Norton) is accused of murder. A lawyer, "Marty Vail" (Richard Gere) decides to defend him because he's completely convinced of the innocence of his client. He's not out of the woods...Yes, American film-makers are generally keen on filming trials but in this movie, the film-maker Gregory Hoblit succeeds in making the trial entrancing and fascinating and in increasing the spectator's curiosity. Besides, the sequences that take place in the court are the best ones of the movie.The movie also enjoys a good performance. To start, obviously with Richard Gere, very at ease in his role of lawyer, even if by moments, he's going over the top. But he isn't the main center of the movie. This place goes definitely to Edward Norton,, the discovery of the movie. For his very first role in the cinema, he showed talent and conviction.But "Primal Fear" is also a movie that gives back credibility to the thriller because Hoblit introduces here, all the usual ingredients: a murder is committed, a suspect presumed guilty, the apparition of revealing clues that make the story progress and of course, the inevitable trial. The set gives a suspense skilfully lead thanks to a rich and clever screenplay that leads the plot towards an amazing conclusion.At last, one of the last trends of these last few years is to surprise the spectator by introducing in the screenplay, an element that can challenge the whole movie. "Primal Fear" is a good example. Indeed, the end of the movie is absolutely unexpected...Perhaps, the only mistake that the scriptwriters made was to sketch a love affair between Gere and the public prosecutor. I think a situation like this one doesn't lend itself to a rather gloomy story. Nevertheless, this is an excellent thriller and one of the best movies made in 1996</fullReview>

I don't comment on many movies but this one is by far one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen. Edward Norton, who no doubt is one of the most talented men alive, stole the screen in this crime drama about the alleged murder of the Archbishop of Chicago by an alter boy (Norton). The case is picked up by a defense lawyer (Gere) who was formerly employed as a prosecutor for the state of Illinois. The state prosecutor on the case (Linney) was intimately involved with Gere's character.This movie does not have a boring predictable story line up to the one twist at the end. The twist at the end is just icing on the cake with this clever film. Richard Gere's performance was outstanding. I am not a Richard Gere fan and I have no respect for him because of Runaway Bride (I still can't believe that anyone as talented as him could do such a film).If you haven't seen this movie you must.

		<shortDescription>Quality Murder Mystery Thriller Based on William Diehl's Novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gregory Hoblit's 'Primal Fear' is a quality murder mystery thriller based on William Diehl's novel. Starring Richard Gere as 'Martin Vail', a lawyer who transforms from being a prosecutor at a major firm to an independent but successful defendant. A battle of moral consciousness. From a man searching for frenzied media attention to a man searching for the truth. Via his inner most thoughts being conveyed to a reporter throughout the movie, the audience, like a jury, try to make a judgment on his character.But the stand out performer was the rookie. Edward Norton. He delivered his character 'Aaron Stampler' with amazing credence. An incredible display of acting. And it had to be. This supporting character was really the cornerstone character of the movie. The supporting cast was great. Laura Linney, who played 'Janet Venable', Vail's love interest and opposing prosecutor, was also very good.Hoblit's direction was typically solid. Nothing too experimental. Just the basics. But he didn't let the story become too slow which is a major problem for any thriller. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good murder mystery thriller. Also anyone who wants to witness a potentially great actor (Edward Norton) perform for the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin (Richard Gere) is a very successful attorney in the Chicago area. However, his workaholic and limelight-seeking tendencies ruined one relationship with an underling (Laura Linney). Now comes the case of all cases. The archbishop of Chicago has been brutally murdered and the suspect is an innocent looking vagrant named Aaron (Edward Norton). Martin decrees that he MUST represent Aaron so he offers the young man his services pro bono, knowing the publicity for the trial will place them both squarely in the news for weeks and weeks. Yet, there is much evidence against Aaron. Despite his stuttering and guiltless demeanor, is Aaron truly not the killer? And, what is more important, justice or winning a case? This is a great, great movie, in many diverse ways. First, the performances are outstanding, with Gere giving a fine turn as the hotshot lawyer and Norton truly jawdropping as the murder suspect who looks like a choirboy. Linney does a nice turn as the district attorney and the other cast members are very well chosen, too. The Chicago setting shows the place as it is, a mixture of both wealthy and dismally poor neighborhoods. Costumes, especially Gere's lawyer garb, are very nice. Then, too, the script, based on a novel by William Diehl, is first rate and full of twists and turns, with a stunning maneuver at the finale. There are a few brief scenes of graphic violence, as the murder itself comes quite near the film's beginning, so there may be moments when you need to look away from the screen, if you are a bit squeamish. Also, if you are Catholic, there may be some parts of the story that are a bit offensive. But, all in all, if you love Gere or you long for interesting, intelligent thrillers, you should not miss Primal Fear. Why don't you speed off toward the video store and pluck this winner from the shelves tonight?</fullReview>

I wasn't expecting it, and having that first fascinating twist sprung on me really made the movie just a little better. EdwardNorton's Aaron was an absolutely adorable altar boy with a Kentucky drawl and stutter that just made you love him more, and then he was Roy, angry, brash and violent.Let me back track a bit. Aaron's been accused of slaughtering a prominent Arch Bisoph (and it appears as though he really did it too). His lawyer, a money and fame loving sleaze with a gold tinted heart (played by Gere)originally took the case in hopes of getting his name plastered on even more magazines. However, now he's becoming emotionally involved with abused and exploited Aaron, who suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder.I don't even have words to express how much I liked this movie. The courtroom scenes weren't boring and drawn out and just when you think it's all resolved and justice has been done, 'Primal Fear' turns completely around and you are left thinking "Oh my God... what the... AWESOME!" I seriously urge Edward Norton fans, psychological thriller fans and film fans in general to rent (or buy) this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Primal Fear... A movie based novel. Sooner or later a man who wears two faces forgets which one is real. I strongly agree with that about this dramatic, twisting, mysterious courtroom crime movie. In this powerful thriller, Edward Norton in his late twenties plays a young, quiet altar boy that is accused of murdering a priest. His performance completely glimmers which sets the stage to make this movie very strong and powerful. I was glued to my seat from the get-go. Richard Gere and Laura Linney play aggressive and energetic attorneys going out of their way and beyond to put pressure and force stress upon each other all while seeking what matters most to the both of them at heart... justice. The plot, the storyline, the acting, you name it... it's all superb. While watching this movie, I found little things that can be overlooked by many to be extremely moving and extremely inspiring. Richard Gere's difficult connected bond with his own associates depends on time, calmness and maintaining his own composure, while aggressively aiding them to do the same throughout the trial. It's all overall one praiseworthy courtroom crime drama, including lots of things outside the courtroom, with a nice twisted ending that you would not even fathom to believe! I've watched this movie around 5-7 times and I assure you, it will be captivating, spellbinding and intriguing to any fanatic of drama, crime investigation, jury, mystery, murder trials, psychiatry, psychology, justice, revenge, deception, love, gore, anger, psychopaths, and manipulation.

His acting is nothing but brilliant and even genius and even here you can understand why he's one of the best actors to ever grace the screen. You have to see it to understand, since I do not want to spoil the story for you. The supporting cast is also very solid, and I loved seeing John Mahoney (best known for playing Martin Crane, in sitcom "Frasier") as the corrupt Maire of Chicago.

		<fullReview>Primal Fear (1996)Part Mind Game, Part Courtroom AnticsA fast paced film with Richard Gere in the kind of role he does best (an arrogant lawyer) and with Edward Norton in a startling performance as a potential criminal worth the admission alone. That there are familiar tricks and tropes and a subplot of almost no significance might be expected--it's not a great film by any measure--but it's packaged well and never flags.There are some secondary characters who don't quite click into the film, mainly the opposing lawyer played by Laura Linney, who can be really good. The law office sidekick (Andre Braugher) is thin, the psychologist (Frances McDormand) is strong enough but has a canned role, and the tough and predictably evil politician (John Mahoney) all keep the film in the box. These are talented people, so maybe we can shift to the direction by Gregory Hoblit, as able as it is, failing to make the movie first rate, depending on surface effects and following a plot line that is just a variant on other plot lines. In fact, Hoblit's creds to this point are a few high quality television episodes, and there is a feel of an overblown NYPD Blue or something to this movie.But there remains one main twist, pulled off brilliantly, brilliantly, by Norton, Gere in tow. It's a completely enjoyable trip, if your expectations are in line.</fullReview>

The plot looks simple but it has tremendous under currents and one of them is the mental condition of the suspect. For almost half the movie, the director is able to convince the viewer that the boy may be innocent. But the finding that the boy himself has killed the priest because of his multiple personality disorder shocks everyone . Ya, the plot may remind you of the Akshay Khanna - Ajay Devgan starrer Deewangee .Certain scenes of this movie are brilliant especially the change in characters by the boy in a split second. Richard Gere as the Lawyer has played his part well. But the man who stole the show is Edward Norton who plays the mentally -ill boy charged with murder .

		<fullReview>Primal Fear has a great deal to offer as a film. It has a compelling plot, interesting twists and some amazing acting, notably by Edward Norton. In contrast to many court room dramas, Primal Fear avoids getting itself bogged down in the court room and instead focuses on character and events around the murder which, in my opinion, is far more interesting.The way the plot continuously unravels throughout the film is a definite strong point and is the films method of maintaining the attention of the audience. The conspiracies surrounding the murdered Bishop are disturbing and done very convincingly. The court room scenes are all done very professionally and give the actors a real chance to shine individually. The film is paced very well which prevents a single boring moment, very accomplished direction.This film boasts a very strong cast and all give good performances. Richard Gere once again, plays a version of himself and gives his usual, reliable, sleazy performance. Laura Linney is so good in this film, that I can not help but hate her anytime I see her in another film (even Love Actually!). Linney excels in the court room scenes; cutting a great image of the bitter, ruthless prosecution lawyer. Her performance is out shined, however, by Edward Norton. Norton is a great actor and this is definitely one of his standouts. He is so believable and the way his character constantly goes through a metamorphosis is very convincing. Frances McDormand and Steve Bauer do a great job in support, adding further class to the film.The best thing about the film is the ending. I won't give anything away but it's well worth the wait. Top film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The art of the good suspense film often seems lost, but Primal Fear manages to grasp that art and milk it for all it's worth. For start to finish, it offers a brand of "hold your breath"-ness that really grabs you and squeezes.As an actor, Edward Norton (Aaron/Roy) never ceases to amaze me. He's different in everything I see him in, and this is no exception. To see him morph from mild-mannered alter boy Aaron into terrorizing Roy and back again is something that makes you think, "If I were in Richard Gere's place, I'd be afraid for my life." Definitely a show-stealing performance.</fullReview>

After seeing this movie, especially the surprise ending, you just knew he was going to be a star---and he's made quite a few movies since then. It's no wonder he won an academy award in his first major role. This movie definitely holds your interest throughout and ranks #1 in my opinion, with "Fatal Attraction", "Reindeer Games, &amp; "Sleeping With The Enemy".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be Edward Norton's finest of all his films. His ability to convey facial expressions and body language makes this film even better than it already is. He has proved himself a formidable actor in this film, even though I think this is his first major movie part.His role as Aaron Stampler/Roy is just what I'd expect from the book. His ability to switch easily between the 2 characters and become 2 different people is just amazing. Not that the other actors are necessarily any worse - Richard Gere put in a commendable performance as well as a cunning attorney who also has a heart.All in all, it is a must-watch, and with Gere and Norton in this form, it becomes one to put in the home video library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Excellent Debut of Edward Norton in a Great Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The archbishop of Chicago is slaughtered with seventy-eight stabs in his bedroom and the altar boy Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) is arrested by the police force trying to escape from the crime scene covered by the archbishop's blood. He alleges that there was a third person in the room and he had fainted, and did not witness the cruel murder. The famous lawyer Martin Vail (Richard Gere) decides to defend Aaron, looking for the publicity of the case. His plea is that Aaron is not guilty. The story has many sub-plots, evolving powerful persons of Chicago society and their economical interests. The truth is revealed only in the last scene. This movie is the excellent debut of Edward Norton in the cinema industry. The complex story is great, but watching this movie for the second time, I noticed that there is a great flaw in the plot: neither Martin Vail nor Janet Venable (Laura Linney) have carried out any investigation with the other altar boys or the boys from the archbishop's savior house to know how was the behavior and the personality of Aaron Stampler in the daily life. The first time I saw this movie, I did not pay attention to this fact, but now I have realized that it would be very important to become aware about Roy and resolve the crime. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `As Duas Face de um Crime' (The Two Faces of a Crime')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder mystery at it's finest with a classic debut by Norton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An exemplary example of not only the courtroom drama but the murder mystery thriller sets of sub genres, Gregory Hoblit's 1996 classic Primal Fear is a movie that to this day stands the test of time thanks to an anchoring turn by the once A listing Richard Gere and the firecracker debut by the ever young Edward Norton in his freakishly good role of troubled, murder accused youth Aaron Stampler.In this modern day and age of courtroom/murder mystery thrillers there is a tendency to be either overly simplistic in there set ups or over complicated to the state of losing the plot, but Primal Fear is that rare moulding of everything coming together in not only a surprising way but a believable way. Director Hoblit (who never really went on with the promise he showed here, even when trying to replicate similar results with Fracture a few years back) is in control of the not only the story transpiring but the actors inhabiting their roles. From bit players John Mahoney as slimy government official Shaughnessy, Laura Linney as hardworking lawyer Janet Venable and Gere as justifiably arrogant hot shot lawyer Martin Vail who does believe in the righteousness of innocent until proved guilty, the whole cast really is solidly on song. While all these elements combine to create a memorable movie set up it was in the Oscar nominated turn of young Edward Norton where this film has grown into the revered classic it is.As stuttering choir boy Aaron, Norton wholeheartedly took control of this young man who SPOILER ALERT hides a dark alter ego below the surface who completely masks Aaron's shy and unconfident demeanour. The film's ace up its sleeve is not even revealed until past the half way mark and it's a credit to the confidence of director Hoblit and Norton that the appearance of this alter ego named Roy makes such an impact in severely limited screen time. It's a master class of acting what Norton does and come the much talked about finale there is no question what one has just witnessed is a reveal that absolutely pays off. It was a turn that well and truly deserved it's Oscar nominated recognition and till this day must be one of the most fully formed debuts by a young star in movie history.Primal Fear is a mysterious thriller at its best and a fine example of a cast coming together to create a memorable believable ensemble. In concerns to Norton, this is a fantastic example of an actor that in his career has produced an abundance of stunning turns that in Primal Fear struck gold in arguably his most memorable performance and in a catalogue that includes Fight Club and American History X, that is quite some feat.4 and a half bloodied pumped up kicks out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining and well acted court drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal fear benefits first and foremost from rock solid performances by all involved. Richard Gere is cool and confident as defense attorney Martin Vail, and brings a lot of charm with his performance. Laura Linney portrays Janet Venable, the cold prosecutor that was once romantically involved with Vail, and this sparks competitive chemistry between the two.Edward Norton's Aaron is unquestionably the standout here. All of his little quirks make for a very curious alleged murderer; he is a very effective character.The plot is clear and easy to follow, aided by concise dialogue. The film doesn't rely on a complex story, it instead chooses to rivet you as Vail tries to dig deeper into a case that seems like a foregone conclusion. The film is primarily a court drama, but it finds time to delve into darker territory in moments.The ending is the big payoff it wants to be, though I wont get into detail because tension is built masterfully up until all is said and done, and when the credits are rolling you will be very satisfied. This is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full of twists n turns yet predictable for the most part, managing to keep the thrilling vibe in tact from start to finish, and bolstered by a spectacular performance from Edward Norton in what is his debut feature film, Primal Fear may follow a generic route but what puts it ahead of other examples of its genre is the attention provided to its characters.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Primal Fear follows the case of a young altar boy who's accused of murdering a famous Catholic Archbishop and is represented by a Chicago defence attorney who's always looking for cases that guarantee public spotlight but soon becomes convinced that the case is far more complex than it looks.Brilliantly directed, smartly written, effectively paced, nicely photographed &amp; mesmerisingly scored, the best thing about Primal Fear remains its performances for Richard Gere turns in a wonderful work, Laura Linney has her moments as well but the biggest contributor to the film's success is the utterly convincing &amp; show-stealing performance from Edward Norton.On an overall scale, Primal Fear works as a fine courtroom drama &amp; a captivating thriller but other than Norton's strong debut performance &amp; that final twist, there is nothing memorable about it. Narrated in a manner that keeps the audience busy, Primal Fear may not rank amongst the finest example of its genre but is definitely an entertaining sit that's worth a watch for Norton's input alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would rate this as one of top court room films I've ever seen. Even after having seen it 3 times, and knowing the plot twists, I find this film to be "riveting".Begin with a darned good story line. Young man who has been living under the auspices of a Catholic Archbishop murders the Archbishop. Immediate conclusion -- the Archbishop is have sex with older alter boys. Oops...not quite...but there is sexual angle...just not the one expected. Then, someone murders the prelate...an alter boy is arrested because he appears to be fleeing, had access, and eventually we learn he had motive. But...he has a split personality...so he gets off with time in a mental hospital. But then...In addition to a superb script and excellent dialog, what made this film click for me was a terrific cast. Richard Gere is in top form as the defense attorney...certainly one of his very best performances. Laura Linney is just as strong as the prosecuting attorney (and former love interest of Gere...which adds spice to the interplay between the two). John Mahoney ("dad" on "Frazier") appears to be a suspect and does some pretty good sweating on the stand. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the Judge. Frances McDormand is good as the psychiatrist. And, Edward Norton is interesting as the suspect. Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney are along as good assistants to Gere. Frankly, you can't ask for much more in a cast.To be honest, it's difficult for me to think of anything to criticize here. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Edward Nortons first movie and his debut role. As his first movie he did absolutely incredible. Ed Norton is just such an amazing actor. He was brought into this movie with the expectations of being nothing spectacular but he blew all those exspectations away with this bang up performance. This is about a young man (Norton) who is accused of murdering a bishop of a church. This is one of the most important cases happening so big city lawyer (Gere) offers to take up the young mans defense probono. As the two talk they become friends but the lawyer is in for a surprise from this quiet southern boy.This movie is absolutely incredible. It has a great story line and fantastic acting. Usually im not a big fan of Richard Geres but he did great here. I find it funny how Richard Gere didn't want Norton in this movie because of his lack of acting experience but i feel Norton stole the show away from Gere with his phenomnal acting.This is a great movie. It does not have much action it is more of a crime coutroom kind of movie. So therefore it may not be for everyone. Though if you are a hardcore movie lover who doesn't need explosions to make a movie and want a solid story and great acting then this is for you.</fullReview>

Each character plays such a significant role in decisively shaping the storyline, with a display of perfect chemistry centered mostly around Richard Gere and Edward Norton. Every moment of Edward's performance in particular is necessary, present, and intelligent....satisfying the ultimate objective of the script. It leaves the viewer in a constant state of certainty, only to be thrown one calculated left hook after another as you unravel each part of the thriller/mystery in seemingly similar time spans as the character's themselves. In this regard, Richard Gere serves his purpose, supporting the development of our understanding of Roy/Aaron, while enabling a compassionate interest in the relationship that they develop.</fullReview>

If you take movies like Primal Fear, Fight Club, The Usual Suspects, and Seven for example, they were all exceptionally well written scripts that all delivered the knockout punch at the ending. One should never underestimate the importance of a good twist. A great writer, director, and actor will have you leaning one way during the entire movie only to sweep you off your feet at the very last minute.

I've only seen Norton in a couple of movies but he always makes something out of his role. He's a genius when it came to his performance in "Primal Fear" which was nothing short of Oscar worthy.

		<fullReview>Well whaddaya know!? Richard Gere must have a new agent. Finally he's appeared in a half decent film. Never mind that both his character and his performance are a non-plus, and never mind that it is only Ed Norton and the fabulous plot that carry the whole thing. At least Gere has stumbled into a watchable film at long last.From William Diehl's novel comes this immensely watchable tale (adapted by Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman) about a prominent Catholic priest who is brutally murdered in his luxury home. Caught red-handed at the scene is altar boy Aaron Stampler, a stuttering, shy southerner who appears to be the obvious culprit, until it is discovered the victim was involved in some very shaky property dealings.Edward Norton is outstanding as the accused assailant, a young lad who vehemently denies the allegations of murder, claiming he saw someone else in the room before he blacked out. His performance, along with the brilliant story, makes the entire show. Richard Gere, Laura Linney and the rest of the cast are barely background, and are unable to make anything of their cardboard characters. The possibility of depth to their respective personas is briefly touched on, but never fulfilled.Director Gregory Hoblit has made the transition from T.V. to film very well, concentrating as he has on the strengths of the script and Norton's strong turn. Backing him up is some sound cinematography from Michael Chapman and an effective score by James Newton Howard. Editing is also astute.Friday, May 10, 1996 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Primal Fear tells the story of a seemingly harmless altar boy who is accused of murdering Chicago's most beloved archbishop. Big shot lawyer Martin Vail takes the case to prove his client's innocence, and ends up digging up clues that prove the archbishop wasn't so great. He also discovers that due to his client's repressed personality, he has developed a second, more brutal personality. Now the lawyer wants the insanity plea, and to prove that the archbishop brought on his own murder. This is an intense courtroom drama, and a very well made film that makes you think.This movie is one of the best courtroom dramas/thrillers out there. It is well made with a chilling plot and great dialogue. The style in which the film is made reminds me of the classic mystery/courtroom films, except with a darker, more modern twist. The movie is dark and violent, but it never goes too far over the top to push people away. It's a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final shocking scene.The acting is great. Richard Gere is as good as always as the big shot lawyer. This is Edward Norton's first film, and you can tell straight away that he was going somewhere. He is amazingly talented.Overall, this is a chilling film, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller, a good courtroom drama, or a plain old good movie.9/10</fullReview>

So the first thing you think about when you think about this movie is the twist; I love twists, but so often they come off no better than a cheap prank. This one is as good as they get, though. I guess I got fear from this movie, but I do not know about "primal fear." What was so primal about it? Movies about corruption in the Catholic church are usually intriguing, but this one is especially interesting because it was made before the Catholic Church took its scandalous reputation to a whole new level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph for Edward Norton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not as great a triumph as "American History - X", which I would award 10 stars, but still an impressive achievement. Incidentally, I didn't at first realise it was the same actor in both films, not because of a little facial hair on the Neo-Nazi, but because Norton appears to be able to perform highly convincing acts of metamorphosis. This comes in especially handy when playing the alleged schizophrenic in "Primal Fear". Nevertheless, Norton's rôles in both films have a lot in common: both characters have had traumatic childhoods, and both kill their enemies in a highly gruesome manner, but neither is an unmitigated monster unworthy of our sympathy. In addition, both are extremely lucid and shrewd. The "enemy" in P.F. is an archbishop who is both morally and financially corrupt. He grossly abuses the trust of his adolescent charges in a highly perverted manner, and is no great loss to the world when ritually exterminated. Despite his horrific childhood,the Norton character has no criminal antecedents, and limits himself to this one, arguably justifiable, criminal act. This seemingly highly inferior human being, Aaron, as the Norton character is called, skilfully strings the brilliant but cocksure barrister/attorney as well as the gullible, inexpert psychologist along, until the startling dénouement, when Gere does not for a few seconds realise what has hit him. Thereupon,with the facial expression of a condemned man (very convincingly done), he feels his over-inflated self-confidence irrevocably punctured,and his glorious illusion of getting a victimized and essentially innocent underdog off the hook utterly shattered. I strongly suspect that Aaron's slip of the tongue which let the cat out of the bag - to thoroughly mix my metaphors - was quite intentional. He too wanted an appreciative audience to his dazzling performance, albeit an audience of one man forced to conceal from others what he had just learnt both for reasons of legal ethics and personal embarrassment. However, Aaron was quite safe to show off anyway because of the law of double jeopardy. He had put on a dazzling act that had fooled everybody. Richard Gere gives a consummate performance as an enteprising lawyer, bumptious, but far from obnoxious, greatly enamoured of cash but heart in the right place. Laura Linney seems lacking in charisma, which I suppose is fitting in one who functions as a foil and a scapegoat,except when she provokes Aaron into a fit of "personality-fission". Though why she helped out the defence in this way I don't understand, especially as she had already been made the unwilling tool of the defence in the matter of the video-tape. Another thing that puzzles me is the title "Primal Fear": what on earth does it mean? The English translation of the Spanish aka would read "The Two Faces of Truth", which is quite explicit and appropriate, but does not relate to the American one at all. My apologies for adding to this already oversubscribed entry. I hope I have, at least, introduced a few original ideas.</fullReview>

It was an interesting story that kept me interested all the way through. Every one of the actors and actresses are very good. It is always interesting to see an actor play a role that is very different from the person's real personality. Usually when I read reviews written by other people, I see that people have already said what I would say, but this time, nobody mentioned that jaw dropping scene that I thought was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Primal Fear is one of those movies you are likely to enjoy. I enjoyed it, it was a pleasant watching experience. It's a well-done, semi-intelligent thriller with a phenomenal performance by Norton (whose performances continue to fascinate). Still, it's not a great movie. In fact, it's one of those "Hm. I've seen Primal Fear, jolly good then" movies. Why? Well, it's generally by the book, with an ending that is easily foreseeable and unfortunately pokes a ton of holes in the story. Still, watching it once (and probably only once, or maybe a second time but that's it) you'll be entertained by it. It gets the mind going a bit more than the usual drivel the commercial machine spews out and it doesn't bore. It also attempts to pose some questions about the nature of justice (almost as if it feels it has to have an agenda) and consequently has to answer them, and does so in a very simplistic, awkwardly forced way. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable watching experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie filled with twists and turns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is probably one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made. Although the story can be hard to follow at times, (mainly the south river developement story)it is still fast paced and well done entertainment. i found myself really enjoying it when i saw it on hbo awhile back, then on tv again, then i bought it. now, i consider it to be one of my favorite films of all time. Richard Gere is in top form, as is Edward Norton, who shines as the charming altar boy Aaron Stampler. It was a crime he didn't win an academy award for this performance. This movie has a little bit of comedy, action, and a whole lot of great dramatic suspense and twists. if you our considering seeing this movie, don't consider it. Do it! You will be happy you were a witness to this cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time I saw this movie, and I was pretty impressed. Indeed one of Richard Gere's best performances (maybe the best?). But what a part of Edward Norton! Thank goodness, Leonardo Di Caprio refused the role. One small minor point. The body in the water.... nothing is ever said about that later on in the movie. But, nonetheless, this is definitely one of the best movies I saw this year. Which I didn't think when I started to see the movie. I am not particularly a fan of Richard Gere. Anyway, anyone noticed the similarities with Agatha Christie's play "Witness for the prosecution" ? It is not the same story but I bet the screenplay writer knows it very well. I gave it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not the first movie that shows Richard Gere as a lawyer and it won't be the last one I suppose but this courtdrama really worked well. Not because of Gere as he is just good looking (well at least my wife says), not because of Laura Linney as she's the kind of woman you wanna give a slap on the face the first moment you meet her but because the perfect performance from Edward Norton who plays the role of an orphan who is accussed of having murdered the bhishop who cared about him since he was a child. At least that's how it looks like for the outside world cos inside the church a whole shocking drama took place and it's definitely the kind of cinemafood for religious fanatics. I am not going to write down spoilers but you will be shocked at the end and the director Gregory Hoblit (recently he made Harts War with Bruce Willis) made a cool film about it.... Worth seeing it really....</fullReview>

Good story with interesting plot twists and for once, Richard Gere did a passable job acting, but after hundreds of movie roles he will never be what Edward Norton already was by his first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first watched this, I hadn't heard of it, and to me it seemed like another Hollywood glamorisation of a court case. But by the end of the movie, i thought it was quite fantastic. Why? Well two reasons; the first being the acting is good throughout, especially Edward Norton, who excels in his first film. The other being that the ending is utterly sublime, it's a twist that changes everything you've just watched before, resembling the classic twist in The Usual Suspects. This film is definitely worth watching when you have a chance, especially for the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sadly underrated film. Richard Gere puts in a strong performance in one of his favourite roles - as a lawyer. He comes across a case about a young man denying that he killed his priest despite all the evidence pointing to him. When it transpires that the accused (Aaron played by Edward Norton) has a split personality who claims to be the murderer (Roy, also Norton) it is too late to bring it into court. The film is thrilling right up to the end and the final twist, while expected, did not disappoint. Edward Norton was simply superb as Aaron/Roy. He put in a very powerful performance as Aaron/Roy and did not let down on his first film. He has a greatly versatile acting ability and has shown this in many of his films up to date.On the whole, Primal Fear was an excellent film, with wonderful performances from Richard Gere and especially Edward Norton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blew me away. I haven't seen Edward Norton in many things but I am proud to say that he is now one of, if not, my favorite actors. The change in character that was viewed on camera was phenomenal and the subtleties of the first time that we see Roy was extraordinary. The fact that Aaron seemed to get very anxious and jumpy before Roy came to life are two main factors that helped the audience realize that Roy was about to be released. Norton portrayed that amazingly. If there are any comments that are made against this movie, you should disregard them. You have to see the movie for yourself to understand the real art of this film so I suggest you rent this movie immediately because I guarantee that your jaw will drop so low that it will be on the floor. This film never slows down and is so riveting that you should not ever take your eyes off of it. I didn't, and I am very glad of that. The movie is exciting from the minute it starts all the way to the very last second. See it for yourself. In my opinion, Norton should of won Best Supporting Actor in the Oscars given in '97 and whether you know it or not, after you see this movie, you will 100% agree with me.</fullReview>

Laura Linney pulls off a smashing, and overlooked, turn as Vail's ex. flame, who ends up being (where else?) on the prosecution side.Primal Fear has enough twists, turns, and good performances to send the courtroom-thriller fan screaming with delight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie several years ago on a cable network, and started watching in the middle of it. I was immediately fascinated by it, because soon after I started watching there was the transformation scene where Edward Norton's character Aaron "morphs" into the evil Ray in front of Richard Gere and Francis McDormand. I watched later on as Gere provokes -- manipulates -- Laura Linney's character into displaying anger and frustration in the courtroom. Linney's loud and challenging outbursts cause the desired effect. But at the very end of the movie Gere's character finds out that he is the person who has been the victim of an even more humongous manipulation. I hope that this review does not give too much away. But I really enjoyed the fact that the manipulator got punished in the end -- I despise manipulation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a movie that gives away the ending in the TAGLINE, and yet no one sees it coming. I guessed he was a schizo when he first said he black out, but to find out that it was all a act, is brilliant, and it was brilliantly delivered by a new face, EDWARD NORTON.Norton in my opinion was the shinning moment in this film and GERE gives his average performance yet again. What GERE lacks is what NORTON makes up for in this film. The supporting cast does a good job, Laura gets credit for out doing GERE in my opinion.The script is a little weak and of course has plot holes, but the twist ending makes up for an other wise average story. The direction is good and uses the NORTON character very well, AARON is such a pathetic, innocent character that when we see ROY, we believe that this is real, again kudos to NORTON.The ending leaves little to the imagination, it could have ended a little better in my opinion, tie up some lose knots here and there. Abrupt endings kill a lot of movies.....REVENGE OF THE SITH.I was surprised to see the GORE at the beginning of this film, with the murder of the BISHOP and the language seemed out of place from some characters, but then on the other hand totally in place (ROY).This is a film that has a good premise and great twist, but is left in the shadows of other "TWIST" films, that in my opinion are not as good as this one. This film deserves a little more recognition that it receives and it's a shame it did not. The only person who benefited from it is of course NORTON.</fullReview>

Then I see some of my favorite actors -- Linney, Norton, MacDormand. The premise was great. This has got to be a good one.But the writing was so bad that many times I felt my intelligence was insulted.Examples:In court, Vail (Richard Gere), covers the mic and scolds his client to stop acting like a girl? And the judge does nothing? Come on now. This doesn't happen in court!Then Janet Venable (Laura Linney) loses her job because she lost the case? Not a real-world situation. Prosecutors -- and defence lawyers -- lose cases as a fact of life. They don't just get fired for losing a case, even if it is a big one. Now if they lose ALL cases they handle, that's a different story.There are many other annoying parts, too many to mention here. Real judges and lawyers cannot be as stupid and incompetent as portrayed here.The film was too predictable, too. I always knew what was going to happen 30 minutes ahead.I don't regret seeing this movie, but I will not see it again. That is, unless I want to get mad.</fullReview>

That is fair. The plot is overshadowed by the characters, because we never fully get into the plot as much as we probably should. Many questions remain unanswered.This was the debut role of Edward Norton, and it is a pretty strong one.

		<shortDescription>A great courtroom drama with an unexpected twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty well-crafted courtroom drama with an unpredictable plot twist. Also, it first introduced us to how great of an actor Edward Norton was and how great he was at conveying different moods.After an altar boy is accused of brutally murdering a famous archbishop, his lawyer begins to realize that he has a split personality which causes him to do violent acts. He then has to perform the difficult task of pleading insanity to the jury.This movie is a very good courtroom thriller. It brings its own twists and alterations to the genre and it makes for a pretty well-crafted movie. Although its storyline is pretty typical by today's standards, it is still a great watch because of the plot, twist, and acting.The acting in this movie is very well-done. Edward Norton is able to sound like 2 convincing characters. His performance is well-done and it shows us that he can convincingly convey different emotions and moods. I also really liked Laura Linney's performance. She plays the role of a rude and nasty lady and her facial expressions and the tone of her voice often makes us hate her in several scenes involving the courthouse.The plot twist at the end caught me off guard. I'm not going to spoil what it is but it's really well-done. It doesn't make the movie seem unrealistic and fanciful at all and it changes the movie immensely on your second viewing. The movie gave no nods or clues to it so it's extremely hard to be able to predict it. It comes truly as a surprise.So in conclusion, this is one of the best courtroom dramas in the past few decades. It has a great plot and a great twist. But most importantly, it is the movie which first introduced us to Edward Norton and how great of an actor he was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly routine courtroom drama elevated by an Oscar-worthy performance from Edward Norton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Primal Fear" is a good example of a movie that plucked an actor from seemingly out of nowhere and rode their star-making turn to box office success. In this case, the then-unknown was Edward Norton, who ended up receiving his first Oscar nomination for his multi-faceted performance.The story concerns a high profile defence lawyer (Richard Gere) who takes on the case of an altar boy (Norton) who has been accused of murdering a beloved arch-bishop. He believes in his client's innocence but as he gets deeper into the case he finds that there are factors that complicate matters significantly.Ostensibly a typical Richard Gere starrer, he ended up being upstaged by Norton, no doubt partially due to the latter's unfamiliarity with movie audiences. That being said, Gere was nevertheless indispensable for his effortless portrayal of the slick, morally questionable defence lawyer. Meanwhile, the talented Laura Linney portrayed Gere's rival/love interest and was joined by a pretty impressive supporting cast including Frances McDormand, Alfre Woodard, John Mahoney, Andre Braugher and others.Given director Gregory Hoblit's extensive experience with TV cop &amp; legal dramas, it is perhaps unsurprising that the movie has somewhat of a television feel. Some of the casting choices seem to reflect this as well. So, while the direction is competent, it subconsciously suggests small screen drama at most times. The James Newton Howard score is likewise workmanlike but unexceptional.Apart from the star-making performance of Edward Norton the movie also benefits greatly from a well-executed plot twist. Those two elements elevate what is otherwise a pretty straightforward courtroom drama into something memorable. Fans of courtroom dramas should definitely check it out while others will probably be entertained as well. Like me, you may end up with the opinion that Norton was robbed of an Oscar when the Academy instead chose Cuba Gooding, Jr.</fullReview>

I like courtroom drama, twists, who did what and why movies and especially those that take you somewhere and then drop you like a lead brick. Its daring but if done correctly, works well. This is the case here. See this. Have a snack standing by to compliment the experience. If you see it with someone else, lucky you as you get to look at each other and then share your best parts of the movie laughing, sighing and being surprised between the awe moments of being entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisting Legal Thriller with Stellar Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"No man for any considerable period can wear one face in private and one to the multitude without finally being bewildered as to which may be the true."-Nathaniel Hawthorne, 'The Scarlet Letter'Gregory Hoblitt's adaption of William Diehl's 1993 novel is an exciting legal thriller filled with twists and turns that leave the viewer speechless by its jaw-dropping conclusion. Leading the film's cast is Richard Gere as defense attorney Martin Vail, an opportunist who takes advantage of his clients and the legal system. When he catches wind of the murder of Chicago's archbishop and a shy altar boy, Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), is accused of the crime, Vail quickly takes up the boy's defense. Going mono-a-mono with his ex- lover (Laura Linney) who is prosecuting Aaron, Vail eventually uncovers a web of lies, sex and deception.The film's true star is newcomer at the time, Edward Norton in his first feature film. Chosen from 2,100 other young men, the 27 year old actor brings a quiet, innocent charm to the altar boy from Kentucky complete with an improvised stutter. His transformation into another character midway through the film demonstrates Norton's perfect fit for a dual role and his ability to shock the audience. For his mesmerizing performance, Norton was awarded a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. If you want a psychological thriller that is bound to shock you, journey into "Primal Fear" and you'll be hooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courtroom drama with some smart twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chicago defense attorney Martin Vail likes one thing more than winning: attention. This is a man who desperately wants to be in the spotlight. How does a defense attorney become and remain famous? By defending the most high-profile clients. And in Chicago right now there is no more high-profile client than young Aaron Stampler. Stuttering country bumpkin Aaron is an altar boy charged with the brutal murder of an archbishop. Found as he was with the archbishop's blood all over him there doesn't seem to be much doubt about Aaron's guilt. But Martin Vail doesn't care whether his new client is actually innocent or not. It's Martin's job to get Aaron off on any legal technicality he can. And then he can sit back and bask in the bright lights of fame. If he can get the Butcher Boy of St. Mike's off it will be Martin's crowning achievement. But a funny thing happens. As Martin talks to Aaron, as he investigates the case, he comes to believe Aaron actually is innocent. This leads Martin, and us in the audience, down some interesting paths. Twists and turns ahead.Richard Gere does very well with the role of Martin Vail but there is no doubt that it is the performance of Edward Norton, playing Aaron, which really elevates the film. Norton is spectacular in a very difficult, very complicated role. Norton makes Aaron so endearing you can't possibly believe this guy hacked an archbishop to bits. He's so sweet, how could he kill anybody? The stutter doesn't hurt either, making him ever so more sympathetic. He looks innocent, he sounds innocent. Norton makes you believe, all evidence to the contrary, that Aaron really could be innocent. And that is so important in making the film work. You have to believe that Martin Vail, against all his better judgment, would actually believe this kid, actually start to care about this kid. Norton makes you believe. It was a star-making performance and rightly so. Norton is excellent from the start but as the story unfolds, taking some surprising turns, the true brilliance of his performance becomes more and more clear. Really breathtaking stuff.Gere and Norton are the stars but there are some key supporting roles as well, all performed admirably. Most notable is Laura Linney playing Janet Venable, the prosecuting attorney in Aaron's case. Janet just so happens to be a former lover of Martin's. What a tangled web we weave. There are moments where the film becomes a little melodramatic, some of the courtroom histrionics are a bit much. But it's a smart, layered story. What seemed so simple, Butcher Boy slays bishop, becomes so much more complex. There's a lot going on here. Where does the truth lie? For once in his life Martin Vail actually is interested in uncovering that truth. When we first meet him Martin is so self-assured, so confident, so unflappable. What, if anything, could rattle this man? That is one of many questions Primal Fear raises. Ultimately the film answers its biggest questions in rather thrilling fashion. It is a film with a smart story which is laid out so well. And that story is performed brilliantly by an outstanding cast. Primal Fear has great drama and tension, so many more thrills than your typical courtroom saga. It is a film which sucks you in right from the start and never lets you go. Hard to ask for much more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primal Fear is an extremely underrated thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An altar boy is accused of murdering a priest, and the truth is buried several layers deep. Courtroom thriller about a slick, hotshot lawyer who takes the seemingly unwinnable case of a young altar boy accused of murdering an eminent catholic priest. Roger Ebert wrote "the plot is as good as crime procedurals get, but the movie is really better than its plot because of the three-dimensional characters." Primal Fear is an extremely underrated thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. In my opinion it has one of the greatest endings in cinematic history. For me it is perhaps one of the greatest courtroom films I have ever seen, it truly is that good. All the actors in the film put in outstanding performances which really helps the films credibility. I strongly recommend this film to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a debut from Ed Norton!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the death of an Archbishop, Aaron (Ed Norton) is seen running from the scene covered in blood. The police arrest him and presume that he's guilty. In the blue corner, we have defence lawyer Martin Vail (Richard Gere) who doesn't believe that Aaron is guilty and therefore he decides to represent him - he does this free of charge knowing that Aaron doesn't have the means to be able to pay him. In the red corner, we have prosecution lawyer Janet Venable (Laura Linney) who is a former colleague and former lover of Martin Vail. Both Vail and Venable set about in their defence and prosecution against Aaron, but who will end up prevailing? This really was a film of two halves; I thought the first half of this film was fairly generic, someone is killed, they catch the person who they think has done it, that person protests their innocence. It's familiar territory and it had me thinking that it was just going to be a fairly standard legal thriller which wouldn't have been a bad thing, but merely would have just made it an 'average film'. It is in the second half of this film when things really pick up when certain 'discoveries' are made. The second half of the film is much more interesting, exciting, and engaging and when Vail makes this 'discovery' about his client it becomes both a blessing and a curse for Vali in the context of defending Aaron. The second half of the film focuses more on the courtroom battle and like A Few Good Men, Philadelphia, and The Lincoln Lawyer the court room scenes are well executed and fairly engaging.Then we come to the acting and first we must start with Ed Norton; I couldn't believe that this was his debut motion picture - his performance was absolutely incredible. He's always been good in what's he's been in since, but I actually think his debut performance is one of his strongest. Gere was fairly good in a sort of sleazy and charming type way which is fairly standard for him. Linney also put in a good performance.There were some minor problems with this film such as Vail's desire to represent Aaron (which is never really explained). I also could have done without some of the soppy moments between Vail and Venable which were cringe worthy and a bit pointless. Having said that, it's still worth watching and whilst it isn't the best legal thriller I've seen, it's still well above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primarily engrossing viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard Gere again shows us what he can be capable of, with dramatic roles. Though an overlong film, Primal Fear is rewardingly entertaining. It concerns an altar boy (Norton in an impressive debut) who has been accused of murdering a priest, quite violently too as we see. When caught, as fleeing the crime, so begins a long grueling trial for a show pony of a defendant, Gere, who as the movie progresses, traps himself into a corner, where he's now doubting Norton. Before even seeing that pornographic videotape, I knew what the killer's motives were. I knew the priest was a pedo. From the killer's standpoint, there couldn't of been hardly any other motives, but it was quite a shock itself, to find out I was right. It becomes quite apparent two thirds of the way through, Norton was the murdering hand, so his innocence is no longer an issue, nor is the thriller whodunit element of the movie, where now comes the case of Norton being found insane or not, playing games like he has been all the way through. This change from thriller to just drama aspect is done very smoothly through which we slowly begin to see Norton's our guy. Not many films would have the balls to do this. First timer Norton has approached this role with a lot of professionalism and creativity, and you can see here, by example, how these can be the makings of stars careers. He's downright creepy too. He really f..ks with you, especially in the last moments of the film, after a verdicts been carried out, the final scene, leaving Gere's mind in a spin. But killers have a manipulative side to em' and this what Norton does beautifully throughout. We have a bit of an unwarranted side story, if only to explain this dodgy lawyer character better (John Mahoney), that has him and Gere get into a feud, over a murdered Latino acquaintance. Gere is very good here, Laura Linney better (a take notice performance) as Gere's ex lover, going at war here with him as a prosecutor. What I love about Primal Fear, is it drops the whodunit part, leaves its dukes open, and we except for what it is. This can be seen as a minus or a plus, but for viewers who liked to be engrossed, PF must be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After getting slowly into the movie I was beginning to feel slightly disappointed that I didn't find myself quite as immersed in the story as I had anticipated. I thought Gere's portrayal as a the lawyer who cannot admit to himself that he relishes the fame his occupation brings to him more than he should was excellent but I struggled to see any path of growth and development for the character. Edward Norton on the other hand was the shining star of the movie - his talent as a diverse actor is astoundingly evident in his portrayal of this role. Norton has the special ability to make you feel such a complex range of emotions for his character that you almost don't know how you feel towards him. Though it may have taken me a while to get into this movie I feel it was definitely worthwhile to watch on until the end where the climactic turn of events gives for a captivating conclusion.</fullReview>

Questioning of Aaron reveals a second personality named Roy emerge. Aaron is a stuttering, insecure innocent, while Roy is the opposite, a cunning, confident, and ruthless person. Which one is the real Mr. Stempler? Vail's investigation leads to some shocking revelations, though the last one from Aaron/Roy is the real shocker... Superbly acted(especially by Norton) thriller is well written and directed, though some more astute viewers will see the final twist coming, that doesn't lessen its impact.

		<fullReview>"Primal Fear" from 1996 sports a top-notch cast including Richard Gere, Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard, Frances McDormand, Andre Braugher, Terry O'Quinn, and the new kid on the block, Edward Norton. I think it's fair to say that Norton's performance brought him some attention: a best supporting actor Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. He won the role over 2000 people. The part was so tough to cast that Gere almost decided against doing it because casting was taking too long.Gere plays hotshot lawyer Martin Vail (can you think of anyone more perfect?) who takes a pro bono case against a shy young man, Aaron (Norton), when he's accused of killing a prominent Chicago cardinal, Cardinal Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Aaron is seen running from the scene and when he's apprehended, he's covered in the victim's blood. The Cardinal was stabbed 78 times.Up against Vail is an old girlfriend, Janet Venable (Linney). What the prosecution lacks is motive. Soon, Vail has dug up an alternate theory of the case after finding out that investors lost a lot of money when Rushman, who was investing funds for the church, refused to go ahead with a planned condominium development.This was a good film strictly because of the acting. This film was released in 1996 -- in 2013, you'll see part of the plot coming a mile away. The other problem I had was that the failed romance between Janet and Martin was too stereotypical. Why must every working relationship between a man and a woman have some romantic undertone. There's either a physical attraction, or they're divorced from one another and the spark is still there, or it is for one and not the other, they're ex-lovers, or they're secretly seeing one another. And now they're adversaries, sparring. Anyone who has ever worked in an office can tell you that this kind of thing doesn't happen every time you work with or against a member of the opposite sex. This stuff gets old. It's lazy writing."Primal Fear" is an okay film, but seen today, it doesn't hold the surprises it perhaps did for the 1996 audience. Nevertheless, see it for this cast, which also includes ER's Maura Tierney, as well as Joe Spano. And Edward Norton - his breakout performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When one big ego defends two opposite ones ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Primal Fear" opens with Richard Gere as a lawyer named Martin Vail. He loves being in the spotlight and brags in front of a young interviewer about his idea of justice: winning the case, at any price. He's the kind of lawyers, how to put it, had he defended Max Cady, there would have probably be no "Cape Fear". But he fools no one, the man is driven by his own ego.And it's fitting his character to see him putting on a tuxedo to assist a Charity event, sponsored by the Church, and where all the big shots of Chicago's Court are present. Vail's charisma leaves no doubt, he's admired and loathed by his peers, on the top of them, State's Attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), whose protégée and most valuable prosecutor is Janet, Vail's ex-girlfriend, played by a young Laura Linney, and the way both interplay suggest that there are still some romantic vibes between them.The sequence is a school case of exposition, showing also what a respectable figure the Archbishop is. He doesn't know it yet, but after making a little joke about corrupt lawyers, he'll be the posthumous revealer of Law's darkest sides. And a young choir boy standing behind him will help.The day after, his body is found gruesomely murdered, and the Chicago Police quickly finds the mysterious altar boy (Edward Norton) running away, highlighting the typical guilty-until proved-innocent case. Aaron Stampler is his name and when he appears on TV, exhausted and all blood-covered, he instantly catches the eye of Martin Vail, who more than anyone, anticipates the juicy implications of such a case in terms of publicity : he offers his services pro bono.At that moment, as viewers, we have all the evidence against Stampler, but it's hard to believe such an angelic face, with a severe stammer, can be capable of such barbarity. There has to be something.Stampler's version is also intriguing, he doesn't remember anything, let alone having killed the priest. Vail is convinced there was a third person, but for the rest of the world, on the top of them again, the late Archbishop's friend Shaughnessy, Stampler must be sentenced to death. He assigns Janet as the prosecutor. So, let's get this straight, "Primal Fear" is a formula movie: many plots point happen too conveniently, and fit some characterization we're familiar with: the corrupt powerful man, the cocky lawyer, the workaholic young female upstart etc.But what Gregory Hobblit, the director, knows is to hook you to the story: just when you ask yourself where this is going, when the love-and-hate relationship between Vail and Janet becomes a bit redundant, he keeps your interest back on the track with the surprising metamorphosis of Aaron as "Roy", a sociopath who claims to have murdered the priest. Naturally, it's at that moment that the camera stopped recording, failing to provide a piece of evidence for Vail. But the diagnosis from the psychiatrist (Frances McDormand) is categorical: Aaron's dual personality put him in an amnesic state when "Roy" controls his body, like he did, when he murdered the priest.Too convenient again? Not quite.Vail realizes that he was half right, there was indeed a third man, but only one killer, but the 'insanity plea' is impossible when you just pleaded 'not guilty'. The situation gets tricky until a revelation about the Archbishop's activities, the kind that a videotape can prove, comes to his hands. Again: a new dilemma, exposing the videotape would provide a motive for the adversary, despite making the victim look sympathetic. He can send it to Janet, but would she ruin the priest's reputation, loses her job, just to win? The film gets delightfully cynical as far a justice procedural are concerned, one is governed by his ego, another by higher instances, never the idea of justice seems to guide their actions.The plot intricacies get more and more exciting, although sometimes distracted by an unnecessary subplot about the priest' connections with the mob, and it also distracts on Norton's spectacular performance as Aaron Stapler, which finally explodes at the film's climactic confrontation. I wouldn't dare to spoil that moment, many viewers expected it and got it, just like Vail who knew which button to push to win. But just when you believe that things go too easy, and some lessons are never taught, the film's conclusion is perfect to put his cynicism into perspective and allow us to look at him with more sympathetic eyes.I'm very careful with my words because anything I say can become a huge clue, but even if you expect the final revelation which is not quite a twist ending after all, but more of a twisted one, there's another revelation that the film carries: it stands on two names: Edward Norton. All the actors did a terrific job, but Norton, in his acting debut, reveals an extraordinary potential by playing such a wide range of emotions in one person. I was already impressed by his work as a lawyer in "The People vs. Larry Flynt" and I wondered why he didn't get an Oscar nomination, I got my answer with "Primal Fear". No one could look as innocent and menacing in one role.There are two categories of courtroom dramas. Number one: movies centered on a crime mystery where the main purpose is to prove that the accused is either guilty or innocent. Number two is the more interesting, the one that questions the ideal of justice and its compatibility with Law's technicalities, it generally offers a disillusioned lawyer a path to redemption or confront an idealistic one to the limits of the system. "Primal Fear" is an interesting case, because it has all the ingredients of the first category, but the taste it leaves is ?definitely- of the second one.</fullReview>

The theatrical debut of Edward Norton, who took most of the awards and nominations for this film, including an Academy Award nomination for his performance. He is the accused, the "Butcher Boy" that allegedly killed the Archbishop. But, it is not just Norton that shines. Richard Gere gives what is probably his best performance as a defense attorney that chases the sensational cases. Sure, it's a police procedural, but it is so much more because of some great performances. In addition to the two mentioned, there is Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard, Frances McDormand, and Andre Braugher. A super cast! The surprises that come out will have you riveted to the screen. They are amazing! Boy, did Martin (Gere) set up the DA (Linney).

		<shortDescription>Getting too attached to your client</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess the first thing I need to say about this movie is that the law is reasonably accurate, and the statements made by the main character, who is a lawyer, suggests that whoever wrote the dialogue, knew what they were saying. The movie is a courtroom drama, and the style is quite tight and true to form, and as such, based on the legal aspects of the movie, quite well done.The archbishop of Chicago is murdered and the prime suspect is found, covered in blood and cowering in a rail yard. All of the evidence points to him, but his lawyer, a high flying defence attorney, believes that he is innocent. The truth does come out in the movie, and it makes for quite a twist.At the beginning of the movie, our main character describes what it means to be a lawyer. This is something that I was told right from the beginning of law school. Being a lawyer means that you no longer differentiate right from wrong, you work mainly on what your client wants. In the case of criminal law - that is to keep your client out of gaol or even defeat the charges. It does not matter whether your client is guilty or not, you simply are being paid to defeat the charges. Meanwhile the prosecution is completely the opposite, it is irrelevant whether the accused is innocent or not, it is to make the charges stick.The main element in this movie is that it explores what happens when the lawyer forgets this. As I said before, he comes to believe that the suspect did not do it, and as such he becomes attached to him. There is a lot of interesting twists in the case, and a lot of things that we don't know, which are slowly revealed in the end. What we do know is that he has become attached to his client because of the cute, innocent look about him. Whether this is good or bad, does not matter, because in the end it doesn't matter.As I said before, this movie takes its theme seriously, and it tackles the issues realistically. Generally I don't like court room drama's, and when I first saw this, I really didn't like it, but after a second time, I realised that there was a gem behind this movie that I totally ignored at first. It is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

Although it is a little predictable, this should probably be said with hindsight as there have been many films since which exploit its basic premise, so I can't mark it down for that. In 1996, I think it would have been a fresh &amp; new concept Edward Norton in his very first major screen role is absolutely convincing as the accused altar boy, Aaron &amp; it is little wonder that this film became a springboard for his successful future career. He's a superb actor &amp; easily outshines Gere! Great story, excellent acting &amp; is well cast, with Linney &amp; McDormand among others, delivering the goods. Superb film all round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a best selling novel by William Diehl, Primal Fear stars Richard Gere, as a high powered defense attorney, who decides to take on what appears to be an open and shut case, just so he can get his face on Television. The case is intriguing and did what seldom movies can do, surprise me. There is an ending to this film that will just completely blow you away. As for the rest of the film, it was extremely entertaining thanks to the outstanding cast, that features both Richard Gere and a very young, Edward Norton, in one of his first roles. At the time Norton was a no-name, while Gere was the big star. Who would have thought that eventually Norton would become the bigger name? Well, anyone who saw this film and the absolutely tremendous performance Norton gives. To be honest, most court room dramas don't surprise me. You can always tell if the suspect is guilty or innocent, and there is usually some kind of twist in the story. Primal Fear was not so cut and dry, I kept going back and fourth on the suspects guilt or innocence myself. That's because this is a powerful movie, with an unrivaled cast, written by a professional novelist, as opposed to some amateur screenwriter. Primal Fear is a perfect example of what it takes to create a great movie, and after you watch it, let me know if you can figure out where the title comes from. It took me a while to get it, but eventually I did.</fullReview>

Well-Written, Well-Directed &amp; Very Well Acted, 'Primal Fear' is, without a shed of doubt, amongst the finest films from 1996.'Primal Fear' Synopsis: An altar boy is accused of murdering a priest, and the truth is buried several layers deep.'Primal Fear' begins superbly &amp; culminates, shockingly, leaving the viewer absolutely awe-struck. The Scenes in the Court-Room are marvelous &amp; the drama gets better with each passing scene.Steve Shagan &amp; Ann Biderman's Adpated Screenplay is taut, with a culmination that's unexpected &amp; absolutely shocking. Gregory Hoblit's Direction is Top-Notch. Cinematography, Editing &amp; Art Design, are proper.Performance-Wise: Richard Gere is Brilliant in the lead role. The Under-Rated Actor delivers a knock-out performance, that deserved him some accolades. Edward Norton, who earned an Oscar-Nomination for his performance, is first-rate. Laura Linney is remarkable. Frances McDormand is ever-dependable. John Mahoney is utterly convincing. Maura Tierney is decent. Terry O'Quinn leaves a mark.On the whole, 'Primal Fear' is a winner all the way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that viewers get a chance to watch a star being born - that a talented unknown actor's performance that is so spectacular it leads to the A-list in one role is rare: Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, Brad Pitt in Thelma &amp; Louise to name a recent few. But Edward Norton's turn as the "defendant/victim" in Primal Fear is one of those "Wow" moments that leaves the audience salivating for his next performance. In this feature debut, Norton outdistances his role, as does Richard Gere, in a resurrection no less impressive than Norton's star-making turn. Heretofore, Gere has specialized in assorted intelligent professional cad roles. Here, he gets a chance to inhabit one that not only wears his dubious character on his sleeve, but wears it, drives it, drinks it... revels in it. Yeah, sure somewhere there's a heart of gold, but like his client, the layers on top serve him better, and the heart of gold is tarnished. Gere is at his peak, comfortably, cheerfully inhabiting the role.Laura Linney deserves extra credit for often being the ice-queen foil which propels the two male characters' development; her own character is rather one- dimensional, but she herself squeezes as much dazzle as she can from it. Even though everyone else obviously falls for whatever Gere's Vail purrs into their ears, it's merely enough time for Linney's Janet to get a drag on her ubiquitous cigarette; another step in what will (hopefully) someday be film's love affair with her. Wasted, sadly, are fine character actors like John Mahoney, Steven Bauer, Maura Tierney &amp; Andre Braugher who could have lit up the screen had they not been handed scripts with generic character stereotypes.See it to watch the ascension of Norton and Gere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My fiancée suggested I watch this, and when we found it for sale at a good price, we bought it right away. I must say, this is a marvelous and quite well-crafted film. The acting is top-notch all the way. Gere manages to make us care about a type of person that few like. O'Quinn is somewhat underused, as he is a magnificent actor, but apart from that, everyone gets a good chance to perform well, and they all live up to it. I would have to say that I now have a completely new-found respect for Norton... and I had a great deal of respect for him before even knowing of this movie. The plot is well-written and has good layers to it, especially for a movie of two hours(running time does put quite a limitation on the level of detail and intricacy of the plot). The pacing is really good, the movie never moves neither too fast nor too slowly. This is the second film I've seen that was directed by Gregory Hoblit... and the second that I've really, really liked(both have received 8's by yours truly, and very deservedly so), so I will most definitely keep an eye out for any future works by the man. I haven't read the book of the same title that this is based on, so I can't comment on how accurate and true to the tone this film is. I urge anyone intending to watch this to steer clear of any spoilers on it, because the plot is too good to ruin. I won't detail it here, I'll just say that the film has many court-room scenes, and deals with a very violent crime(and it's not the only occurrence in the film of a violent nature). For that same reason, since it is depicted graphically in the film(but not too much... there was nothing gratuitous about it), I urge anyone who believes they may not be able to handle seeing such to consider if they should watch it or not. There is also quite a bit of language, as well as a brief scene of sexual nature, so if such bother you, you may want to watch a censored version, if you are interested in seeing it. I recommend this very warmly to any fan of court-room dramas and thrillers. If you enjoy an engaging and involving thriller with surprises, this is the movie for you. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward Norton gave one of the best big screen performances of anyone who had never previously worked in a film prior to that, he hadn't even had a TV credit to his name yet. The role he played where he was playing a guy with multiple personalities wasn't an easy one to pull off convincingly to begin with. Norton absolutely commands attention in every scene he appears. Richard Gere and Laura Linney while being the leads and still do a solid job in their roles don't absolutely steal the show like Norton does in his role. How he can so convincingly be an innocent "aw shucks" character in one scene and a stone cold killer in the next is truly amazing.</fullReview>

We're talking about the classic American thriller in many ways, because it doesn't take one step outside the patterns, but instead it just does its job very well. As you would expect, the actors are not only playing at their best, but also got the charismatic suit on and the lines are smart. I enjoyed watching it, and it is fun for a night when you're sick of too much fancy intellectual stuff or "original approaches". A good film, but don't expect it to be more than it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!For starters I really liked the movie..But a thing I do with movies I like..is go read the worst reviews for it. I have to admit that there are some really good points about mistakes in this film such as the stuttering of Aaron. Really why wasn't anyone called to testify that this was not the way he used to speak? But on the other hand we there are some pretty good reasons: Taking into consideration that his lawyer was convinced that Aaron did not do kill the priest and on the other hand we find the blonde who was having trouble on finding "motives". So how could anyone think so much further outside the box and start investigating on another direction?But as far as the acting goes I think that Norton showed some serious acting skills. Gere did a pretty good job as well. The blonde lawyer was representing her role as a modern age successful woman really well too.As far as the ending goes..I would like to meet just one person that could predict that he was faking it that whole time.I really liked the movie and I am glad I did not rate it with a 10 because seriously why didn't anyone bother looking for his girlfriend? Also pretty poor camera angles.All in all though 8/10 is a really good score for my taste. Most people will really enjoy watching this film.</fullReview>

Not only does all the evidence seem to point to Aaron's guilt, but the case is further complicated when Vail's adversary turns out to be old flame and former protégé Janet Venable (Linney), who still happens to work for Vail's unscrupulous former employers. Gere is perfect as the self-important lawyer, Norton (in his screen debut) riveting as his client, and Linney gives an effectively understated performance as a prosecutor who can hold her own. An absorbing, well-acted, and believable courtroom thriller with just enough twists and turns to keep things interesting throughout. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Publicity-Seeking Lawyer Learns His Lesson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Vail is a prominent defense attorney in Chicago who jumps at the chance to represent Aaron Stampler, a young, stuttering altar boy accused of murdering the Archbishop. At first interested primarily in the publicity that the case will bring, he comes to believe that his client is truly innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor,Janet Venable.In the process of Vail's investigation,he discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the District Attorney, have lost millions in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop certain church lands. The archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. He also learns that the archbishop had been sexually abusing altar boys, including Stampler.Introducing this evidence to the court, while it would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, would also give his client a motive for murder, something the prosecution otherwise has lacked.The trial does not proceed well for the defense, as there is considerable evidence against Stampler and public opinion holds him almost certainly guilty. When he confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Aaron breaks down and transforms into a new persona, a violent sociopath who calls himself Roy,who confesses to the murder of the archbishop and throws Vail against the wall, injuring him.When this incident is over, Aaron appears to have no recollection of it.The psychiatrist examining Aaron, is convinced he suffers from multiple personality disorder due to childhood abuse by his own father.However, he cannot enter an insanity plea during an ongoing trial.Then,Vail sets up a confrontation in court. After Venable questions him harshly, Aaron turns into Roy and charges at her, threatening to snap her neck if anyone comes near him. Aaron is subdued by courthouse marshals and is rushed back to his cell. In light of Aaron's apparent insanity, the judge dismisses the jury in favor of a bench trial and then finds Aaron not guilty by reason of mental insanity, and remands him to a mental hospital.In the final scenes,Vail visits Aaron.But in the turn of events, Stampler reveals that he has been pretending to be insane the whole time. But he didn't make up the identity of Roy, he made up Aaron and now admits to having murdered the archbishop, as well as his girlfriend, Linda, whom the cleric also had molested. Stunned and disillusioned,Martin Vail walks away.Thus ends the courtroom thriller,Primal Fear,an adaptation of William Diehl's novel of the same title. It was one of the best films when it was released.Or I even consider it as one of the courtroom thrillers ever released.It stars Richard Gere as Martin Vail;Edward Norton as Aaron Stampler and Roy;and Laura Linney as Janet Venable.It was directed by Gregory Hoblit.Watch the movie for the performance of Edward Norton,in his film debut,as the schizophrenic murderer alone for he is simply outstanding.I believe the he should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor instead of Cuba Gooding Jr. in his portrayal of an athlete in Jerry Maguire.With regards to the attack of the movie to the sexually abusive priests in the Catholic Church,I think that it never in a way presented the institution as an immoral religion.They were simply baseless.I think that just as the novel was fiction so as the characters in the film although one cannot deny that there are some evil-doers among Catholic priests.Finally,the story provides great suspense from beginning to end as the immoral and publicity-seeking lawyer learns his lesson.Definitely a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Primal Fear" is another courtroom drama involving eternal argues between the lawyer and the prosecutor, and in films, always ending with the lawyer winning the cause. Richard Gere plays a famous lawyer who gets a strange case of murder for free. His character apparently likes to be in the newspapers. Laura Linney plays a funny and stressed prosecutor who tries her best to incriminate Aaron. Aaron is an actor who uses all his acting talent to get away with murder, leaving the spectator speechless, since nobody could see he was lying all the way through. A classical twist in the end.Thought it's 129 minutes long, the time flies with a good written story and well developed characters; and I really wonder why some judges are that arrogant. In Brazil there are several judges like this Judge Shoat. Also, they made a good job in Brazilian's title; they translated it to "The Two Faces of a Crime", making a nice quibble suggesting that the crime has two sides of the story, when actually who has two faces is the defendant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Primal Fear in 2000 when I was 16 or so, it was on the telly and I was about to go reading in my room and saying good night to my parents when I saw the face of Ed Norton on telly. I had just seen Fight Club at the theater the night before and had been extremely impressed by his work, though I didn't even knew who he was back then.I decided to watch the whole movie, just because he was in and boy did I enjoy it! Not only for his performance (I'll go back to that later), but firstly because of the court game. I really liked to see the mechanisms of how the defense and the prosecution play, the tricks, twists and turns between Mr Gere and Mrs Linley were great to see. As for their acting, I couldn't really tell how good it was, since I first watched it dubbed (I'm French).Now, even dubbed, Edward Norton's performance just blew me away. The change in his look, from stupid to downright scary, his whole body language, all of this was just mind-blowing, particularly considering that it was his first job.I have reviewed it in Original Version since and enjoyed the other actors work far better.My only complaint is that, considering how the film was shot, it now looks "old" and a bit aged, with a direction that seems a little flat.However, the movie still has one of my favorite twist endings (Usual Suspects still ranking #1 in my book).</fullReview>

Playing the attention-seeking and arrogant yet sincere lawyer, Gere gives arguably the best performance of his career, making his character slimy yet likable. Linney is terrific as the DA prosecuting the case. In an audacious film debut, Norton is fabulous playing the accused murderer. Although the script may prove to be flawed under close scrutiny, this is a clever and absorbing courtroom drama. It does go on a bit too long; the secondary plot thread concerning Bauer detracts from the main story and could easily have been trimmed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gregory Hoblit's intriguing thriller 'Primal Fear' keeps the viewer in suspense as the mystery unravels right till the revelation in the end. The story unfolds, like a complex puzzle, with the introduction of each character. Steven Shagan and Ann Biderman have written a clever screenplay where they take the audience into a darker world, that appears safe on the surface. I can't say much about the story because that would be risking spoilers. Hoblit has assembled an enviable cast that includes a fiery Laura Linney, a resentful John Mahoney, an authoritative Alfre Woodard, a sincere Frances McDormand, a gullible Jon Seda, a patient Maura Tierney and a naive Edward Norton. Richard Gere is cast in the lead but he is clearly overshadowed by each and every one of his co-stars, particularly Edward Norton. It's not that Gere has done a bad job. He's quite decent. It's just that everyone else does a better job. The courtroom sequences are very well executed and given a fine touch of humour. 'Primal Fear' has all the right ingredients for a successful thriller and the result is very satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For its genre, this is an excellent film. It's creepy, tense and disturbing, but that is its intention. The cast is topnotch with the likes of Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard and others, all "at the top of their game"! It is Oscar Best Actor nominee, Edward Norton, who steals the show. The film is tautly directed by Gregory Hoblit and the cinematography by Michael Chapman is exceptional for an action thriller. The city of Chicago is also a star as it shines brilliantly, thanks to Chapman's eye. Gere plays a hotshot attorney, looking to be in the limelight, and is attracted to the case of an Archbishop's bloody murder. Linney is the prosecuting attorney who has a "past" with Gere, who defends the only suspect. A subplot involves Gere's dealings with a Spanish gangster who may or may not have ties to the Archbishop case. I usually don't appreciate bloody, creepy movies, but this one has its merits and it is quite involving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primal Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without the ingenious psychological aspect of the film's plot, "Primal Fear" would most likely be just another courtroom drama. True enough, it does have many clichés indigenous to this genre and to the 1990s in general, but overall the film has aged well, an attribute that can be boiled down to the killer script (no pun intended) and the performances of the cast, Ed Norton in particular.To summarize the plot, we have Richard Gere as hotshot defense attorney Martin Vail. He's loaded with cash, he's handsome, and - as he displays time and time again in the courtroom - he's got brains. When the archbishop is found slaughtered in his quarters and a blood-stained altar boy, Aaron Stampler (Ed Norton) who was very close to the archbishop is found running from the scene of the crime, most people dismiss it as an open and shut case. But Vail is intrigued, and he offers to serve as the boy's attorney at no cost. He finds soon enough that the prosecutor in the trial is Janet Venable (played expertly by Laura Linney), a female lawyer whom Vail trained and then dated for a number of months. Vail seems to have everything under control until Aaron's dark secret comes out, and the truth begins to reveal itself.The film is worth watching, if nothing else but for Edward Norton's performance alone. His portrayal of Aaron's dual personalities is unrivaled in its complexity and depth. The differences between Aaron and his alter ego Roy are shockingly significant, almost as if Norton is playing two completely different characters. Richard Gere gives a solid performance as well, though nothing out of Gere's usual range and basic character type. Though he is undeniably the "main character" and is the character with whom we as viewers empathize with the most, Edward Norton steals the show in such a way that even the legendary John Mahoney is struggling to keep up in his role as Janet Venable's boss. Steven Bauer surprises with an unexpectedly likable portrayal of Joey Pinero, a former client of Vail and locally-known gangster. But the only other breakthrough role in this film, apart from Edward Norton, is Laura Linney as Janet, the confident, savvy lawyer who thinks she knows Vail inside and out. Prior to her role in "Primal Fear" Linney was relatively unknown, and it's not difficult to see why after this she went on to "The Truman Show" and then to become an A-list star. Her performance is near perfect (granted it is not a very likable or understandable character) and she delivers lines with such coy sincerity that even a single word can convey her thoughts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was an excellent film that truly illustrated just how flawed the justice system can be. After seeing the film it is fair to say another story comes out of the plot in the movie, related to the movie. That plot is that a hit man, in the case of the movie, a hit teenager,is hired by a prominent figure in the justice system to remove a particularly messed up also prominent figure in Chicago society. The hit person is caught and manages to make a fool out of everyone. A modern day fable? I think so, and also a cautionary tale that things don't always get resolved after the final bang of a gavel,well, that idea is really nothing new, but the way this film expresses it, is something quite well done. The judge in this film had the truth by the proverbial you know whats and lets that go in favour of charging the misled but trying hard to correct things lawyer a hefty contempt of court fee. Good going. Sink that eight ball. Depressing in a way, as I think it does happen. Maybe a bit dangerous in that it would tend to paint anyone charged with a serious crime look quite completely guilty while at the same time the movie calls the whole legal game a charade from top to bottom. A must see for fans of contemporary dramas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bishop was brutally murdered in his luxurious apartment in Chicago and the police made an instant arrest, after having found the 'suspect' - Aaron Stampler (Norton)- hiding near the scene of the crime.The damning physical evidence against Stampler (Norton) meant that, unless there was a miracle, he would be heading for the ultimate punishment; the death penalty. Stampler's defence, in what obviously looked like an 'open and shut' case, was assigned to the city's most successful and prominent criminal lawyer - Martin Vail (Gere)- by his political enemies, in an attempt to 'humble' him for having 'nailed' the state and county for several million dollars in a previous case involving a narcotics felon. ... After all, there was no better way to bring him down 'a peg or two' than making him defend a lamb that had already been given a place in the slaughterhouse! Vail (Gere) and his team find themselves racing against time and against all odds to gather evidence of Aaron's past and build a plausible defence scenario, but as the story unravels and they delve deeper into the innermost thoughts of a disturbed mind, they realise that not all is as it seems.The story reaches a harrowing crescendo, as the battle of the 'titans' commences and we witness the defence -Vail (Gere)- and the prosecution, a dynamic assistant D.A - Janet Venable(Linney)- who is yet another shining star in the legal arena as well as Vail's nemesis, as they collide head on for who will 'come on top' and rip the fruits of glory..!Excellent performances all round, followed by some brilliant dialogue!</fullReview>

This thing was too smart for its own good; witty believable dialogue, an intrigueing storyline, rich deep characters who don't just get up and flap their jaws. Amazing. And Norton's performance was remarkable. Everything clicked, nothing felt forced, and yet it was shocking and suspenseful. Highly recommended. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, it made me a fan of Ed Norton, He is a good actor coming into the movie business, it is one of those pictures that gives you a big surprise at the ending, if you saw the picture, I feel that the character that Mr. Norton played was to smart to have made a stupid mistake of saying something that gave him away, again, it is truly a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few thrillers that actually sent chills up my spine. Richard Gere gives his only great performance as a hotshot lawyer who defends an alter boy(Edward Norton), who is accused of murdering an arch bishop. Although all signs point to Norton, there is still the possibility of another killer. This is one heavy duty mystery/thriller with an outstanding cast and performances. Although the twist at the end did cross my mind before the ending, this is still a great, thrilling movie. One of the best ive seen in awhile. ***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING-SPOILERS THROGHOUT!!Primal fear would probebly have rated a 6 or 7 no matter WHO played Aeron/Roy-However the fact that Ed Norton was the chosen one elevates this pic to unforgettable status.I'm not saying anything most probebly don't agree with-Richard Gear and Laura Linney were perfectly good but this picture was carried by Norton and Norton alone.In addition to having one of the most outstanding surprise endings in movie history, Primal Fear has to it's credit one of the greatest actors around who gave one of the best performances I;ve ever seen. He steps into Aeron/Roy's skin and Aeron/Roy in turn gets under our skin in a way we don't even see coming.This is one of the rare times when I would say the movie version is BETTER then the book. Primal Fear the book just doesn't make the same impact as the movie.This was a story that was MADE to be a movie and Norton was made to play one of the most fascinating and frightening psychopaths in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an outstanding drama. It works as a murder mystery, a courtroom drama, and a character study (of the Gere character). Any attempts to read statements into the movie, such as about capital punishment, are misguided. Sometimes people can see a very good movie like this and not be satisfied. They have to keep looking for further meaning then what is provided. The acting is quite first rate. Richard Gere as the lawyer full of himself possibly gives the performance of his career; this coming two movies after the dreadful mistake of Intersection in 1994. His performance in Chicago 2002 is almost a spoof of the same type of character. Laura Linney as the prosecutor was too personally involved with Gere to try the case in real life. It weakened her resolve and made her far less creditable than she might have been otherwise. There is great support from John Mahoney, Frances McDormand, Alfre Woodard, and Steven Bauer. Edward Norton was Oscar nominated for this in his debut role; he is simply astonishing. I have seen all the nominated supporting performances from 1996 and feel that this is the best performance. I think William H. Macy in Fargo was also more worthy than Cuba Gooding, Jr. Those are the Oscars for you though. The script is based on the novel and is outstanding. There are times when it seems to go off on tangents, such as with the John Mahoney/Steven Bauer subplot, but these further define Gere's character and resolve. Several viewers have questioned the title: Primal Fear. I took it as the primitive fear we all have when we are employed, doing our jobs. That fear is the fear of being wrong,inefficient, unable to control or predict what happens in one's line of work. I think that's what Gere is afraid of and most of his actions, if not all of them, are reactions to this. This is why he fights so ferociously against Laura Linney, John Mahoney, etc. He is not motivated by benevolence and neither is Laura Linney for that matter. She is more concerned with beating her ex-significant other. This is what provides the groundwork for great characters: motivations which are unique to them, preventing them from becoming symbols or mouthpieces. What makes this film even more astonishing is that it's the debut big screen film of the director, who made a few TV movies prior to this, including Roe vs. Wade. The film is over 2 hours long but well worth your time. I have one criticism and that is the material on the videotape within the film does not seem to be consistent with the Norton character in retrospect. ***1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a must-see film for Norton's performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward Norton earned his stripes in this crime thriller that sees him transform from actor to character. Although I will voice criticisms in this review, I must start by stating that any serious movie fan should see the film for Norton's performance. It is a benchmark by which all young modern actors can be judged.Although other films do a better job of portraying the intricacies of courtroom drama, and the police procedures are shoddily written, those elements are not the heart of this movie; struggles for power - Gere's Vail struggling for notoriety, Linney's Janet struggling for independence, Norton's Stampler struggling for control of his own destiny - are central, and play against one another to form the momentum of the plot. That they play out in court seems merely to be a function of several of the protagonists' chosen profession as lawyers.Aaron Stampler is arrested, covered in blood, after he flees the scene of an archbishop's murder. True to 1996 California (I know, I was there), the chase and capture was carried live on several local news stations. Stampler's guilt is a foregone conclusion in the public eye, despite his lack of a criminal history or any apparent motive. His presumed guilt is unimportant to the publicity-seeking Vail; indeed, it's established in the opening scene that Vail would rather not know his clients' status of guilt or innocence. He finds himself compelled by the stuttering, soft-spoken Stampler, though, and we sense that this conviction of a client's innocence might be a wholely new experience for him.This part of Gere's performance is subtle, nuanced and ultimately believable. Where he misses the mark is in his interactions with his former partner (Linney), to whom he merely condescends and bats his eyelashes when he's not trying out his stable of lawyerly tricks on her. For her part, Linney plays Janet as a woman in over her head; how she got to her position seems unclear given her shaky portrayal of a supposedly confident prosecutor. What should be tension between her and Gere instead plays as wooden discomfort. It's hard to understand from what we see on the screen why Gere still pursues her.John Mahoney plays the DA Shaughnessy, a man with too many private pursuits to be a public servant. He is a believably rancorous old boy, and it's a pleasure to see him sharp and unflinching. Younger viewers who know him from Frasier will be shocked by this layered portrayal.Alfre Woodard also provides great support as the presiding judge, and earns our respect by keeping Vail in check when he's flamboyant, but ultimately being fair.If you're prone to nitpicking the details of a police procedural, Primal Fear is likely to give you fits, but despite the 7 I rated it, I still believe it's a referential and influential film, not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Norton saves this movie. Excellent surprise ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A court room drama must have a certain degree of credibility. Primal Fear lacks it. I really cannot believe that no one cares to check out the past of someone accused of murder, that his acquaintances are not interviewed, that the police make no thorough search and analysis on the site of the crime. And yet this movie is worth watching. The reason has a name: Edward Norton. His performance is absolutely brilliant. Let me say this much: It at least equals the one Antony Perkins delivered in Hitchcock's Psycho. Norton actually saves the film and lets the viewers forget the weakness of the script ? for a time at least. Also watchable are the supporting roles of Alfre Woodard as the self confident judge and of Frances McDormand in a appropriately low key performance as the psychiatrist.This leaves Richard Gere and Laura Linney, the opponents in the court room. I have to admit they succeed where The Bonfire Of The Vanities has failed. The two good looking ones are credible as people full of themselves but for the rest play uninteresting characters.Primal Fear has one of the few surprise endings that really surprised me. It is not cheap and truly shaking. Even here all the credit goes to Edward Norton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot not spectacular, Norton is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that combines fascinating character development in a courtroom setting, and it does so very well, though not spectacularly.The lead characters are very good in this movie, though I may disagree with the analysis that the plot itself was supurb (it was not). Evaluating any acting is difficult with Norton on the same screen. He truly is terrific, and viewing this shortly after seeing "The Score", makes for a fascinating way to see his growth.Gere's character did not really go anywhere in this film, though he does play the role well, the growth is not present. His explanation for his actions is not sufficient, and the reality is the courtroom portion of the movie is fairly generic and somewhat uninteresting. Taking the script without the acting, this movie would certainly not rank as high as it does. While, in some cases, the role makes the actor, it is indeed the opposite in this film.Overall, a good watch, if only to see Norton's breakthrough performance. I give it a 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solidly executed courtroom drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's far from outstanding, `Primal Fear' is a compelling and well-told courtroom drama, being more of a character study and search for justice than a campaign against the death penalty. The film is best for it's above average performances from the three leads and supporting players. Richard Gere is well cast and very believable as the slick, hotshot lawyer assigned to the case. While it isn't her best role yet, Laura Linney is totally convincing as an absolute b*tch, even if she is smoking for about 70% of her screen time. But Edward Norton steals the show and makes a great breakthrough as shy, stuttering Aaron and tough, sadistic Roy. The sudden transition is rather like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and he gives a brilliant performance, well deserving of his Oscar nomination. But he was in strong competition with Cuba Gooding Jnr., who won it that year.Frances McDormand is OK as the criminal psychiatrist but could easily have been replaced by any other actress. Finally, Alfre Woodard is relatively passable as a by-the-book stern judge.  What `Primal Fear' is most remembered for is its twist-in-the-tale, smack in the face ending. You can see the scriptwriters wrote the screenplay around this basis. While it does turn around all the events that preceded it, it lifts the movie away from the realms of the average TV movie. So overall it was a good way to conclude the movie. There's nothing particularly great about it but there is very little you can accuse wrong of `Primal Fear' either. In summary, this is a genuinely decent and easily watchable government drama. I give it 6.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gere plays an arrogant attorney who assigns himself to a seemingly open-shut-murder-case involving a Bishop and a young alter man. The evidence is far from circumstantial and almost totally unquestionable, yet twist and turns along the way make you second guess it. Just when a conclusion of the case is established, a final twist occurs, changing the complete scenario of what happened - it's much more warped than how it first appears. Definitely disturbing, and definitely not for children or the squeemish. You don't leave the movie feeling happy about any of the characters. Even despite the revealed outcome, it's worth several viewings for excellent acting by the cast and for the subplot involving opportunistic mob lawyers, corrupt lobbyists, and unsettled scores.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Character Personification With Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too new perhaps to be placed in one of the 'classics' catergories - but have no fear -it will be there with the rest of them. The On-Screen chemistry between Gere &amp; Norton in fact adds very little to the film - Norton *carries* the film very nicely by himself. Gere, although more 'mature' is more of a catalyst in providing the emergence of 'Roy', and the 'nurturing' of the sweet Southern stuttering 'Aaron' - although not an original plot by ANY means, the last ten/fifteen minutes makes up for lack of absolute originality.A good splattering of red herrings throughout takes your mind backwards and forwards. The atmospheric direction is superb at bringing out the tease within the viewer; the guilty/not guilty toys with you as the director takes you around many a corner.The mistakes and factual errors (even the incredible) are easily forgivable as the viewer is drawn into the plot. The (seeming) alcoholic tipple that the judge seems to devour and pass round adds a further dimension of the impossible ready to set you up for the post-court room climax with Norton (Aaron/Roy).The Neurolgical academic for the defense was a little weak &amp; far too ready to please and a little annoying as a character. In summary, perhaps this film certainly teaches you never to judge a book by it's cover alone (you have to look inside as you'll see in the film). Not so much a film portraying the effects of jumping to the wrong conclusions, but the consequences of doing so.Surprises throughout. Get in a good supply of candy/sweets/beers/soda and sit back and be thoroughly entertained!PS: You'll, love Aaron - you just won't be able to help yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie yesterday after seeing The Score on Friday and telling myself, "You have to see more of this guy's movies!" I'd seen his performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt 2 years ago and came away with the decision that his performance was the saving grace in that film. However, I'd never gotten my butt around to seeing anything else with him. Well, that all changed with The Score. I watched Primal Fear because a friend of mine told me that it was excellent. Unfortunately, she told me the ending! Grrr... But it didn't interfere with me enjoying the film because I could focus all my attention on Norton's performance without having it distracted by getting wrapped up in the suspense and mystery. I was just blown away by it. That guy has loads of talent and right from the beginning! I can't believe that he didn't win the Oscar for it, though I shouldn't be surprised that the Academy looked him over. The scene where he transforms from Aaron to Roy and back to Aaron is a dynamite piece of acting -- something which all young actors should aspire to. I loved this movie so much that I hopped right onto ebay and put in a bid for a copy. Now, onto American History X, Fight Club and a binge of Nortonmania! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Primal Fear is a fantastic courtroom drama that keeps you guessing and in suspense. I'm not particularly familiar with the genre, but something tells me this movie is definitely all the way excellent. I feel almost ashamed for not having seen it before.I'm going to be honest with you. I rented this movie, first and foremost, because Edward Norton was in it. I wanted to familiarize myself with his work, because I really liked him in Rounders (one of my personal favorites) and The Score. And with Primal Fear I was not disappointed. Norton is incredible as Aaron/Roy... endearingly clueless and wholesome with a violent, hostile, uncontrolled and uncontrollable alter ego.Richard Gere's performance was rather good as publicity-hungry Martin Vail. Laura Linney was great in her role.. I figure this because by the end of the movie I was really starting to strongly dislike her character. I think that definitely means she did her job well.I don't have too much else to say about this movie, except that the ending will leave you shocked. Primal Fear is an incredible movie. If you haven't seen it.. which I'm sure most of you have, it's hella old.. then rent it. as soon as possible, even. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Norton is brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal fear is a good movie for one reason, and one reason only: Edward Norton. This is not to say that everything else about it is bad, simply that it needed someone as gifted as Norton to pull it off. Anyway, Norton gives a spectacular performance in a very difficult role. He speaks in a perfect Kentucky twang and stutters like he really had a speech impediment. (It always blows my mind what actors can do with accents, body language, etc.) It's one of those performances everyone who wants to be an actor should see.On the rest of the movie: it was good, but not great, and if Norton hadn't been involved (Leonardo DiCaprio was originally going to play the role, which would have been a total fiasco), the other actors and the director couldn't have pulled the movie together. There's a great plotline, though it meanders a little in places. Richard Gere is OK in his role, but I think all the cynicism is more being himself than acting. Also, he can't stop being a romantic chick-flick guy (as in Runaway Bride, Autumn in New York, others), and when he cuddles up to Laura Linney, I want to yell "Go back to the murder-mystery plot, you fool!" (Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration.) Besides Norton, Andre Braugher (of TV's "Homicide") and Frances McDormand turn in good performances. Hoblit's direction is nothing special, and perhaps a little slow-paced for this movie.The revelation at the end also makes this movie super-great, it's a little reminiscent of the Usual Suspects. If you liked this movie, I highly recommend Usual Suspects. (Actually, I highly recommend the Usual Suspects to everyone.) Fans of Norton should also see Fight Club, another great movie, though Norton's performance isn't near the caliber it is in Primal Fear.All in all, I give Primal Fear 775/1000.P.S. Anyone know where the title came from? Was it something from the book that didn't make it into the screenplay.</fullReview>

So you look at the actors involved here : you think Richard Gere is going to give one of his non acting job, that all the female characters are going to be as useless and boring as always and that the so-called "newcomer" will turn out to be one of those tasteless Matt Damon types of actors... But, again, you have to face the facts : Gere is incredibly believable and tasty, Liney, McDormand and Woodard are close to perfection and Norton makes a stunning screen debut (probably the most impressive one since Timothy Hutton's performance in "Ordinary people")...

		<shortDescription>Edward Norton is Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just rented the movie last weekend, and I thought the whole movie was really good. I rented it mostly because I love Edward Norton, he is such a fantastic actor. Every movie I've seen him in has been awesome. The role he played in this film was also outstanding. It's the kind of movie that has you thinking one thing, untill the very end, and it hits you with a surprise left. It was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie twice because I liked Edward Norton's outstanding performance as Roy/Aaron. It seems to me that Norton is now one of the best young actors in the World. He had also a very good performance in People vs. Larry Flynt. I hope to see soon some other movies featuring him. I understand that now he is directing/producing a new movie. Good luck for him !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong performances by Gere and Norton highlight excellent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into Primal Fear I had heard much about the movie, most people liked it and many complemented Edward Norton's performance. The film stars Richard Gere (Red Corner, Pretty Woman) as a hot-shot defense attorney who will do anything to win a trial. While at a bar he witnesses a foot chase by the police chasing down a blood-soaked murder suspect. The local and well-respected archbishop of the Catholic Church had been brutally murdered. The police catch the suspect an altar-boy, played by Edward Norton (The People Vs. Larry Flynt, American History X). Gere then rushes to get the case and receives it by working for no pay. Soon he uncovers many different clues and twists to the case. Gere delivers a very convincing performance as the lawyer. Good support is turned in by Alfre Woodard (Down in the Delta, Miss Evers' Boys), John Mahoney (She's the One, The American President), Andre Braugher (Glory, City of Angels, Laura Linney (The Truman Show, Congo), and Maura Tierney (Liar Liar, Primary Colors). But the best performance is by far Edward Norton's. He delivers a stellar take on his troubled character. Whenever he is on camera the movie goes from good to excellent. It is also preposterous to see that Cuba Gooding Jr.'s solid performance in Jerry Maguire won the Oscar over Norton's stunning performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Primal Fear is directed by Gregory Hoblit and is adapted by Steve Shagan &amp; Ann Biderman from William Diehl's 1993 novel. It stars Richard Gere, Edward Norton &amp; Laura Linney. With support coming from John Mahoney, Frances McDormand, Alfre Woodard, Andre Braugher, Steven Bauer, Terry O'Quinn &amp; Maura Tierney. Cinematography is by Michael Chapman and the score is composed by James Newton Howard.High profile lawyer Martin Vail (Gere) loves his own press, hugely successful he never misses the chance to further his profile. So when altar boy Aaron Stampler (Norton) is arrested for the vicious slaying of a prominent archbishop, Vail spies an opportunity for major publicity. However, it looks a slam dunk case of guilt, Stampler is a simple kid who was caught after running from the scene of the crime-covered in the archbishop's blood. But Vail comes to believe Stampler to be innocent, something that baffles the prosecution, led by Vail's ex lover, Janet Venable (Linney). A turn of events will further complicate matters and Vail finds that the longer the case goes on, the dirtier the whole episode gets.Now seen as the launch pad to Edward Norton's career (for this his debut film he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and won a Golden Globe Award in the same category), Primal Fear is a tightly written thriller that sits with the better modern day entries in the court room based genre. The secret to a successful court room thriller is being able to keep the drama flowing before the verdict comes to pass. Hoblit's film does this because it has a ripper (no pun intended towards the nature of the crime) of a case at its core and that in turn is developed expertly by an on fire cast. The makers are also aware that the very best court room thrillers are able to make the viewers part of the jury. Again Primal Fear scores high marks here as we are privy to many secrets, we are involved with all the major players, yet crucially we don't know the truth as there are no give aways. We have intently watched Stampler, looking for clues as to if he did it, hung on his every word, his expressions and so forth. But the makers, and Norton give nothing to us, what surprises come, are just that, surprises, because they have not been clumsily set up earlier in the movie.Norton is terrific, it's actually a performance that pays bigger rewards on a revisit to the film. For then you see just how he had to play his cards close to his chest throughout the piece. It's not all about Norton shining, tho. Gere is always a watchable actor, especially when he's playing a competent-power player type character that blends smarm with charm. It often gets overlooked just how comfortable he is to let the actors he works with dominate scenes he shares with them. One of the most reliable and unselfish actors of the modern era, watch his interplay with Norton and see how Norton positively feeds off of Gere's lead work. The support cast is solidly deep, with an early Linney performance to savour as she gives Janet a spikiness that makes for a formidable opponent to Vail's assuredness. Michael Chapman's photography deserves a mention for keeping the film tonally dark throughout, while the smooth editing by David Rosenbloom is particularly impressive for the out of court scenes as the many characters are woven into the story.A taut film with genuine moments of suspense, smart surprises and backed up by two contrasting, but equally great, lead performances. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cast makes it work (major spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Primal Fear" is proof that performances alone can make a film succeed. The storyline is convoluted and the details of the murder mystery are often sensational. Yet, it works due to a strong cast. Richard Gere delivers a solid performance as an opportunistic lawyer, who takes on a widely publicized case only because it puts him in the spotlight. His character is genuinely interesting, and it's sometimes fascinating to see this wise guy struggle to cope with the fact that he's taken on something bigger than he bargained for.The Aaron Stampler character would not have been plausible without Edward Norton at the helm. While I often questioned the details of his split personality, the strength of his performance nonetheless made me interested in his plight. I suspect David Fincher had this movie in mind when he cast him in "Fight Club."Laura Linney actually rivals Norton in the strength of her performance. She shows she can be both tender and coldhearted, sometimes in the same scene, such as that part in the bar shortly after finding the incriminating videotape. Finally, Alfre Woodward offers excellent support as a tough judge who would do Judge Judy proud.*** (out of ****)Released by Paramount Pictures</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really great performance from Edward Norton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novel "Primal Fear" freaked me out. The end was so unexpected that it actually scared me, though its not 'scary' in the traditional sense at all. When the movie version was being cast, I remember reading that Leonardo DiCaprio would play Aaron and that seemed like a great idea. Then he backed out and this kid I never heard of, named Edward Norton, took the part. Richard Gere was cast in the lead and I had mixed feelings about that, but at least it wasn't Bruce Willis, or someone else who has that wise-ass act downpat. Then seeing the movie was almost as good as reading the book, which very seldom happens. Norton was extraordinary and deserved the Golden Globe he won, followed by the Oscar nomination. All the supporting actors were very good, too, and this movie is worth seeing. Don't ruin it for anyone, though, cause that takes the fun out of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an absolutely amazing film. However, it is also tragically underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal Fear is one the best films that I have seen in years. Richard Gere portrays a glamorous attorney handling a case that has horrified the public and which seems to be a slam-dunk. He seems to be the only person who believes that young Aaron Stampler did not murder Archbishop Richard Rushman, a grisly crime which is tastefully portrayed at the beginning of the film.Edward Norton, in particular, was startlingly convincing as Stampler. This was really his chance to let the world know what a phenomenal actor he was and still is. Unfortunately, this film did not get the recognition that it deserved, which may have been a reason why Norton's next film, American History X, was also not as big as it should have been. Edward Norton was about 98% of the reason to watch both of these films, which were both absolutely amazing and intense. Primal Fear is a film that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. The story is so well-told and well-acted that it holds your attention firmly and does not even begin to let go for all 130 minutes. It easily achieves the level of intensity that is desired by all mysteries and thrillers, with an ending that is both shocking and disturbing. Primal Fear is destined to become a classic, regardless of how relatively unknown it may be. This can be said about an extremely small number of films, but no matter what kind of movie you enjoy, if you haven't seen Primal Fear, go out and find it. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

I found Laura Linney's character neurotic, annoying and unconvincing. There's a subplot regarding the victim's business deals which never really goes anywhere; and as for the final plot 'twist', you can see it coming a mile off.

		<fullReview>Primal Fear is without a doubt the movie that put Edward Norton on the map, It's unique, It's frightening, hell It was even worth an Oscar nod but ... Richard Gere and Laura Linney weren't that great. Don't get me wrong the plot of this movie is both gripping and brilliantly intense. It truly does keep you guessing to the very end but Gere and Linney just really seem out of place. The plot essentially revolves around a young altar boy with supposed multiple personality disorder under trial for the murder of a priest. Gere plays Aaron's(Norton's character)lawyer as Linney, Gere's ex plays the role of the prosecutor ... and they just bore the viewer. As said given the fact that It turns out Aaron was a false name as well as a false person altogether and Norton's character did fully willingly kill the priest, and Norton spends the entire movie convincing the audience he's a victim, Norton truly does give a fantastic performance but literally everything about Gere and Linney's characters in the movie is such a dull bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has problems, but keeps you guessing until the very end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not knowing very much about this movie going into it definitely enhanced the experience of watching it, because I didn't know what to expect for the most part. That said, expectations are vital to keeping the audience's interest with this story. All of the evidence points to a simple answer: Aaron killed the archbishop. But as the audience, we know intrinsically that there has to be more to it than that or else the story wouldn't take two hours to tell. So naturally we expect that Aaron is innocent and begin concerning ourselves with what piece is missing. Martin Vail does this as well, and he comes up with some missing pieces, but not the ones he is looking for. But our assumptions get played with throughout the movie as more and more evidence comes forward.I would doubt that most viewers will particularly like any of the main characters. All of them have their bad sides exposed much more than their good sides. However, this does not mean that you cannot like the story that they are a part of, or that you cannot be interested in their motives. Martin's egotistical motive of gaining renown through the court case drives the plot a decent amount and accounts for most of his actions and his treatment of people. Janet Venable's motives are also important to how we view her in context of the larger story.One thing that could be rather problematic is the subplots that are involved with the story. Some of them contribute well to the through line, such as Martin and Janet's previous romance, the investigation of Aaron's psychological stability, and the issue of the archbishop's dark side. However, there were a couple of others like all that stuff going on with the housing projects and Shaughnessy that didn't make that much sense. I think they were actually important somehow, but I was never interested in the scenes that involved those subplots. Perhaps the subplots were an attempt to make the story have higher stakes of more universal importance, especially since the whole degenerate clergy scandal was not formally uncovered until six years after this film's release.The script was okay in terms of dialogue, and did a pretty good job giving the audience information at the right times. But the acting is what really stands out here. Everybody talks about how great Edward Norton is in his first big role, but all of the actors really do a good job. I hated Richard Gere's character, but he sold the part very well which is probably why I hated him.This is a very interesting movie that keeps you guessing, but is driven almost entirely by plot twists. This isn't really a bad thing, but I know that it can be problematic for some people. It also means that you should pay close attention the first time you watch it, because it will not be nearly as good the second time you see it. The beginning hour is a little slow, but I would encourage you to stick with it even if you get bored. It picks up later on. Overall Rating: 8.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>twisty court procedural with one big performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a sleazy publicity-hound Chicago defense lawyer. Naomi Chance (Maura Tierney) is his assistant. Tommy Goodman (Andre Braugher) is his associate. He's eager to take on the case of altar boy Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) charged with killing Archbishop Rushman. Aaron is found blood-soaked with Rushman's ring but claims to have blacked out after seeing a third person. He was a street kid until Rushman gave him a place at Savior House. State's attorney Shaughnessy (John Mahoney) assigns the case to Janet Venable (Laura Linney) and wants the death penalty. Venable worked under Vail until he quit in frustration. He hires psychiatrist Molly Arrington (Frances McDormand). He uncovers suspicious land deals, sex scandal, and multiple personality.This is a solid twisty court procedural. It throws a lot of material on the screen. The main problem is that nobody is particularly likable. Newcomer Edward Norton announces his arrival with a mind-bending performance. That brings something beyond what the material is actually worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Laura Linney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sorta enjoyed the movie, seeing it on TV several times. But, what really impressed me was Laura Linney. She is amazing. The scene in the courtroom where she describes to Edward Norton on the stand what she would do if the priest did to her what he did to him and ending with 'But that's me' is awesome. Sometimes, I sit through the movie just to catch that one scene. Miss Linney can be cold, frustrated and testy playing a character and still be very appealing. There is a difficult to describe quality in her that comes across beyond just the dialog. She doesn't work at being lovable or appealing or attractive but she is all the way.Norton is great and I loved when he reveals that it's he, not Aaron that is the real person with such a delightful wickedness after watching him portray the other character so well. Perfection, Mr. Norton. I can't imagine Matt Damon or De Caprio doing it as well.Richard, Richard. I don't know what to say. You are so busy, self consciously 'acting' that it is a distraction in nearly every one of your movies. I have rarely seen you do anything naturally that other men might do in real life. I don't know how you can keep up the artificial acting style for so many years and still get work. But, what the heck.Although there was a surprise plot twist that was good, the movie was more a character study than an absorbing courtroom drama such as 'A Few Good Men' which really had my interest in how the case would go."But, that's me".</fullReview>

As with too many TV dramas (of the Law and Order variety) things become a bit pat. Maybe there is nothing new under the sun and that's the problem.

		<fullReview>I put off watching this movie for a long time, seeing that it had Richard Gere in it, who I haven't found appealing in other movies (too much of a pretty boy.) But I'm now glad I finally watched it. Richard Gere has grown up here, in my opinion. Here he has the tough job of playing a character who is not entirely sympathetic but has to remain interesting to the audience, seeing he's the character in focus for most of the movie. And he does this task admirably - I bought him as a determined and somewhat selfish man. Speaking of performances, I though Edward Norton did a good job here as well.The story is an interesting one, even while we have seen elements of this mystery (such as priests with secrets) in other movies before. It takes almost an hour before the trial actually starts, but there's plenty of interest before that point. There are a couple of twists that take the movie in directions I did not expect. The legal manoeuvring is interesting as well - I learned stuff about the American justice system that I didn't know before.The movie also looks good as well, polished yet not overly slick. Well-scripted, well-made, this movie is worth the more than two hours of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Norton's vehicle and I don't think he will give a performance like this again. He played the innocent altar boy so well. And his first role! Whoever decided to cast Norton as this character deserves an Oscar themselves. Brilliant insight! I can see casting Gere for the role of Vail. Gere would be an obvious choice as a player due to all the beautiful women he's seen. But what is it about Gere that women love and men hate? He just seems so bland and phony that it ruined the movie. Very unconvincing. When he was on the screen, my attention strayed but I was electrified when Norton appeared. Gere simply paled in comparison.Great story with scandal, politics, mobsters, murder and the church. The player getting played is a great touch. I would give this movie almost another two stars rating if another actor rather than Gere had played the role. But if you are a Gere fan or can see past him, definitely see this movie for Norton's performance alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but not totally convincing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Primal Fear" is another entry in a long list of suspense thrillers with a big twist in the end. It's an overcrowded genre, but it has produced some great flicks like "Usual Suspects", and also a lot of drivel like "Along came a spider". This one falls somewhere in the middle.The strongest point is clearly the cast. Richard Gere is not always that great, but here he fits his role as a slick lawyer very well. The supporting cast, including Maura Tierney and Frances McDormand, is also doing a great job. The best part of the cast is, though, is without the doubt the excellent performance by Edward Norton, showing already his potential that would later be fully realized with movies like "American History X" and "Fight Club".For the most part, this is a very enjoyable movie. The characters are mostly likable (the once that are supposed to be, anyway), the dialog is amusing, and the pace is fairly high.In terms of plot, it's pretty much by the numbers though. In a movie like this, you know that there is more than meets the eye, and with that in mind it's really fairly easy to predict what's going to happen. The story also is not one hundred percent believable at all times: the court room scenes in particular didn't really seem all that convincing (especially the one where Frances McDormand's psychiatrist is utterly ridiculed by the DA...no judge would ever allow something like that to happen in reality). The movie also doesn't shy away from a fair amount of clichés and plot devices.Most of this is forgivable though. The tight direction and crisp pace, combined with Norton's masterful performance, make it easy to glance over some rough spots in the script. In the end, I was certainly entertained by this movie, even though it wasn't totally satisfying.***1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

Edward Norton plays a difficult character dominated by a squizofrenic dual personality. He was victim of sexual abuses by the priest. That kind of experiences have provoked a serious mental damage. His lawyer (Richard Gere) must weight up his personal idea of justice and the rights of his customer. He try to justify why he must defend people when he knows they are guilty. Laura Lynney's work is also remarkable. The end results, in fact, very predictable, but is a good film and may be recommended to everybody except people who look for something more likely the last Richard Gere's romantic comedies (very different from the fantastic American Gigolo).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, Okay, yes, I admit it, it´s hard but I do: Richard Gere WAS good in this one. but that says nothing! He just had a good `day' . Anyway he totally got stolen the show by Edward Norton anyway who gave a superb performance as Aaron Stampler who should have killed a priest, Gere plays his lawyer who tries to promisse his innocent, what isn´t easy since Aaron was found covered with blood in the room of the killed priest.It was Edward Norton´s first movie he was chosen out of 500 people and it was one of the best choices a casting director could have done because he or she found one of the very best actors of recent cinema! I can´t believe Ed lost his Oscar to Cuba Gooding Jr, who was good but nothing more, no comparision to Norton´s play. The movie itself is very solid done, it had some very boring phases, but thank god the actors save it with great performances. And I am glad there are a lot of twists and big surprises created. So the screenplay was very good, thumbs up for that. The movie is basing on a book ( well it was a law movie, that isn´t basing on a Grisham novel but on a novel by another author, that IS something special ) the story was original yes, at some points at least that´s what I liked. Always when I think about this movie I see Norton´s innocent child face whioch is probably the best evidence for his brilliantness, a totlaly newcomer could `sell' could lead a movie himself, without him it just had become an average thriller like there are millions out there, it is hard to imagine this movie without him because I can´t see another actor who could have played his part.Again, thank god for this casting director ! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie about a year ago for the first time and I really, really liked it. It was entertaining, slowly pulling you in, lots of suspense, and a great twist ending.I watched it for the second time last week and was really bored. Knowing the ending, the 130 minutes passed really slow.If you've never seen it before, go out and rent it but it doesn't have much replay value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, underrated film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only drawback to this film is that it stars Richard Gere. Without him, it would be unspeakably good. This film has everything: incredible plot, great pacing, good cinematography, and one of the most amazing supporting casts that I've seen in a long time. The story is nothing short of brilliant; a Usual Suspects style thriller where one is left guessing all the way through as to how it will turn out. It's one of those films where you change your mind constantly throughout, trying to work out the details of the mystery, only to find out you were wrong, or you were right in essence but messed up the details. But rest assured this film cannot measure up to the Usual Suspects. And the main reason for this is Richard Gere. Half the time he's over-acting, the other half he's under-acting, and he's *always* posing. I've made up my mind: Richard Gere simply can't act. At least Kevin Costner could play himself (see: Field of Dreams/Bull Durham) but Richard Gere has a hard time even doing that. I've yet to see *any* film starring Gere where I'm even satisfied with his acting. But this film is saved by an outstanding and astounding supporting cast. Ed Norton should have had an Oscar for this one, because he outshines everyone else, especially Gere. And the scenes with Frances McDormand and Norton together are fabulous as they play off of each other perfectly. Also outstanding are Homicide's Andre Braugher as Gere's main fact-finder, who saves an otherwise laughable scene where Gere tries to act tough and macho (give me a break!) and Braugher's acting pulls the scene through, and Maura Tierney as Gere's assistant. My only qualm about Tierney is that she should have been on screen longer, as she's always so expressive. John Mahoney was the biggest surprise for me, playing a very out o character role as a corrupt State's Attorney, slightly reminiscent of his role in Say Anything, but much stronger and better defined. He played the part brilliantly and each scene with him had me nodding my head in approval. And I normally don't like Mahoney very much, so it was twice as stunning. Laura Linney wasn't as good as she could have been, but I think that was mostly Gere's fault as he ruined any opportunity they had for chemistry. Her courtroom scenes were quite strong and her scenes with Mahoney and Terry O'Quinn were strong as well. The plot was simmering...I can't say enough about how well-paced this film was, especially considering it was 2h40. This film was much better than I expected, and the cast manage to outshine the star so much that they don't allow his bad acting to ruin the otherwise fabulous film.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>....wonderful film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I come late to posting this comment; I thought I already had.Reading many of the comments already posted, I totally agree that Edward Norton ("Aaron/Roy") was the right actor to cast over so many who auditioned for the role, including the spectacular talent (at that time) of Matt Damon......not the same actor we've become accustomed to seeing in action-films. Norton was tremendous in this role and definitely should have won the award he was nominated for. For more of his skill in doing "stuttering" playing an afflicted character, see "The Score".....another great role.Director Gregory Hoblit certainly kept his cast centered on the movie he directed. The script by Steven Shagan was without fault, providing good character-building for every role. I saw none of the "holes" some users saw - I thought (and think) the film wasted no time in telling the story. If you've read some of my other comments, you'll know I am "story"-oriented. Whether-or-not Mr. Hoblit directs another film as brilliant as "Primal Fear," I'll have to determine that when I see it.I also fail to see how some commentors feel that Richard Gere ("Martin Vail") did not deliver what this role called-for: a narcissistic attorney, looking for every opportunity to advance his career. Doesn't everyone? I thought the tension between he and prosecutor "Janet Venable" (Laura Linley) was well developed and kept the tension of unknown twists right on target. Ms. Linley was stellar in this role. Her vulnerability in being dismissed if she didn't deliver a "win" in this case to crooked politician "Shaughnessy" (John Mahoney) also contributed to the intensity of the story. Their romantic relationship provided insight to one another's personality and reactions. Alfre Woodard ("Judge") was excellent, in that it provided an insight that even judges like a little tonic in their glasses. Her cool but strict demeanor in the courtroom was right-on. Frances McDormand ("Dr. Molly Arrington") left nothing to the imagination......she, like "Martin" felt "Aaron" was innocent, but her quick realization that he was about to undergo a total character-change during one of their sessions was a testament she was analyzing his statements with clarity. Anyone who didn't see her move toward the door wasn't paying attention. The scene between "Aaron" and "Martin" during "Roy's" appearance was riveting and revealing to "Martin" perhaps he had the wrong conviction in his belief his client was totally innocent.All of the plot-twists intensified the story: the scene under the freeway, the murder of the gangster (which caused "Martin's" intention to expose "Shaughgnessy" as the crook he was); all of the "unnecessary" scenes were relevant. I did not find the "sex-scene" distasteful - hey, it happens !, even with Archbishops/Cardinals. The minute I heard "tape"" and "he wanted to get-off", the whole plot came-together for me.I am at a loss why people find court-dramas not to be entertaining. I could find little to criticize about this film. That NO ONE gave-away the ending twist shows everyone was shocked and felt it would be wrong to deprive future viewers the privilege of experiencing it for themselves."Primal Fear" is a distinct lesson for ALL young people to understand there is danger in idolizing religious leaders. Have faith, indeed - comply without question, no. I think this is a film for the whole family to enjoy together. I own it and watch it often. Every film-library should include it - I give it a 20......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, But Could Have Been Better (spoilers, kinda)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four minutes after seeing Primal Fear (USA Network just finished airing it) I have to say This movie was good, but at the same time, it was lacking. The story line was clever, as was the split personality concept. The in court scenes, as well as both attorneys' planning their strategies, were clever and well done in my opinion (although I'm certainly not a lawyer). The ending, where Roy revealed he was the only one, was also clever, although somewhat predictable. What killed the story for me was the romance between the defense and prosecuting attorneys. That piece of the story seemed pointless and uninteresting. It also complicated the plot as it seemed to lend nothing to the overall story of the film.Overall, I would give the film a three of five stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was generally good and the plot was interesting, but some of the courtroom stuff just doesn't really make sense. Please note I am not American and I'd be grateful if someone would explain:[warning spoilers]Why did the defense not know of the book with the underlined passage? They shouldn't have to find out for themself. I thought the defense was supposed to be notified of all evidence the prosecution uses.The cross-examination by Janet was rather unreal. Firstly, when Martin was examining John at the stand, the judge told him to stop getting personal and warned him for it; yet when Janet cross-examined Aaron and started getting extremely personal, aggressive and irrelevant, the judge just sat there and did nothing. Secondly, Janet's previous performances in court weren't aggressive and were at a pretty normal tone; and yet when she cross-examined Aaron she became extremely violent and shouted--it was almost as if she was trying to get Aaron to do his multiple personality thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Norton leads, everyone else follows.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal Fear tells the story of a high class Chicago lawyer, Martin Vail (Richard Gere). Picking up the case of a young troubled altar boy(Edward Norton) accused of murdering the priest of his church, Vail undergoes a transformation upon realizing that his career is perhaps not the most important thing in life. Going up against the lead prosecutor and ex-girlfriend (played by Laura Linney), Gere takes us through the usual cliché courtroom drama that seems to be prevalent in today's crime based movies and t.v. shows. The story is good, adequate at the most. It reminded me more of a extended episode of Law and Order, which isn't bad per se but I expect more from a major motion picture.What really carries this movie, however, is Norton's performance. Brilliantly played, it put him on the map and made him ready for bigger roles in movies like "Fight Club", "American History X", and "The People vs. Larry Flint". Playing two characters essentially stuck in the same body gave Norton the opportunity to stretch out and show everyone what he really is capable of. It was great to watch him slipping in and out of different characters all before my eyes in a way that seemed convincing and not overacted. Check out the scene where we first discover Aaron's secret side. The transition from Aaron to Roy happens before your eyes and it showcases Norton's acting ability. Bravo to Mr. Norton. If it wasn't for Norton's role in this movie, it would be a well below par courthouse film.Rating 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Casting + Must Read FeverDog's Review Here on IMDb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb user "FeverDog" has written an excellent review on this website. Why should I restate this person's excellent points of contention with this film? This person's review zeroes in on every problem I had with the film. I highly recommend reading that review. Here are just a few of my comments about the casting:Richard Gere smiles way too much. He closes his eyelids for way too long at critical points in a scene. He's no heavyweight when it comes to actors. In 1995 the movie "Heat" came out starring Pacino and De Niro. There's two guys who could nail the part of Martin Vail. Actors who would've been well known in 1995-1996 that I would've cast are as follows: Armand Assante, Ray Liotta, Andy Garcia, Michael Douglas, Denzel Washington, Jeff Daniels, John Travolta, Vincent D'Onofrio, James Gandolfini, Judd Hirsch, Robert Redford, and many more. Also, I have never liked Laura Linney's acting. She looks and sounds like a kindergarten teacher. I was also distracted by her inability to smoke a cigarette. This so irritates me when actors and actresses smoke on screen and they're clearly not smokers. I know, I know, it's nitpicky. Actresses who were around in 1996 who could have played this role are as follows: Marisa Tomei, Ashley Judd, Diane Lane, Christine Lahti, Susan Sarandon and many more.Can you tell I had a problem with the major casting in this film? I must admit that I do have my favorites. I mean really, it comes right down to who do we like to watch on screen?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way this movie ended was very disappointing. Before the end, I had thought that the movie had some flaws but they wouldn't matter because the end would be spectacular. I actually thought I had figured it out. Yes Aaron/Roy has a dissociative identity disorder. Two people live in the same body but when one comes out the other blacks out. Aaron couldn't remember anything when Roy was around. BUT, he could remember seeing someone in the bishop's house. Aaron would have no reason to lie and even if Roy had come out and killed the bishop, Aaron had seen a person before (otherwise he could not remember it). So there actually was a third person and that would turn out to be the real killer. That would be a twist ending right? But you know what? Aaron was just playing with us and for some reason Vail didn't realize the memory contradiction until the end. And when he learns the truth he just walks out. Wow, that's our hero! Furthermore, Roy seemed to remember talking to Aaron while Aaron didn't even know who Roy was. How is that possible? And is it really so easy to fool a psychiatrist? All it takes is to be a good actor? And what about the case with 60 million? It seemed an important thing, but after all it had no effect at all. This movie had numerous flaws. The only good thing was Edward Norton, the only reason I don't regret seeing the movie. He was spectacular. Apart from that, just a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, it is impossible to talk about this movie without observing Edward Norton's wonderful performance as Aaron. And believe me, this character and the way he is played by Norton, is the best part of this movie! Without him, maybe it would be just another crime's movie.Aaron has apparently a personality disturbance, calling himself "Roy" every time he blacks out. As a secondary effect, he loses his memories during the disturbance.That is a perfect scenario for a crime. A boy, apparently sick and the only witness of a murder, with no memories of the happening, is prosecuted to commit the murder of a catholic church archbishop, apparently surrounded by enemies from corruption's business and sex scandals.I liked the screenplay, it made me stop and try to figure out what was happening until the end. The only thing I did not really like was the way the lawyer played by Richard Gere discovered everything and also, the disconnection between the other solutions to the crime proposed during the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Primal Gere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Primal Fear (1996): Dir: Gregory Hoblit / Cast: Richard Gere, Edward Norton, Laura Linney, Frances McDormand, John Mahoney: Although it resembles the standard courtroom drama, it seems to regard what is hidden underneath the surface. It stars Edward Norton as an alter boy suspected of murdering a Priest. A case such as this is too good for a lawyer, played by Richard Gere to pass up. He feels so comfortable in front of the camera that he offers to defend Norton for free. Laura Linney plays his ex-girlfriend and opposing lawyer. Norton is seen as shy and nervous and unable to handle emotional strain. The Priest video taped sessions where Norton and another male were in sexual conduct with a young female. Gere suspects third party involvement especially when a specialist reveals shocking information. Structured like a courtroom drama with a clever conclusion. Directed by Gregory Hoblit with a fine performance by Gere who is met with grim facts by the conclusion. Norton steals the film as the accused who also carries a secret throughout the film. Linney as the opposing lawyer is crucial despite standard material but she soon meets her match. Frances McDormand is featured as a specialist but the role is straight forward and standard. There was a lot of potential for a thriller that looks too much like a courtroom drama. Average thriller about traumatic study of disorders. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Primal Fear" has a very well-written story which targets a very fundamental question that we all are struggling with in our lives, what is right and what is wrong. Is it justified to do something immoral to achieve a right goal? Almost every character in this movie is dealing with this question and they choose to go in different directions. My main criticism to the movie is the casting. Richard Gere is playing the main role and Laura Linney is the main actress. They both are very wonderful actors but I believe they were not a suitable choice for the roles in this movie. For example, the character Richard Gere is playing is a passionate, arrogant lawyer that would suite better to someone like Al Pacino or Paul Newman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The TWISTS are actually PLOT HOLES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I accept that the acting was very good from both Richard Gere who could have been more arrogant but anyway he was a sweet guy inside in this movie and also Edward Norton who made a very good acting with his split personalities.But now let's focus on the movie how it was written.We have a boy who may be convicted with murder and everything points that he was the murderer. His courageous and famous lawyer want's to save him because he thinks that the boy didn't kill anyone.The only thing left is mental illness so a shrink is there to diagnose him. The shrink discovers his problem "split personalities". IF THIS IS TRUE THAN THE BOY DOESN'T END UP IN JAIL BUT IN A MENTAL INSTITUTE , JUST GET A COUPLE OF OTHER DOCTORS TO PROVE THIS AND CASE CLOSED.Here is our plot hole together with the twist : twist- split personalities (good twist but raises questions afterwards)plot hole - can't prove the split personalities (not true because all the lawyer should do is ask the judge and a couple of doctors can come and give a final decision about the kid )Instead of asking other doctors Veil thinks he should prove that in the courtroom like it a show of some kind. Here we are in the courtroom the kid is being asked by the prosecution lawyer where he gets up punches his own lawyer and threaten that he will break the prosecution lawyers neck. Now everybody is convinced because of that little show that the kid is actually sick NO REAL PROOF NO DOCTORS.In the final scene the kid appears to be normal and everything was a show for him to escape the punishment.So this is the second twist and plot hole :twist - no split personalities hole - no doctor actually proved anything of this kind being or not being split personalities, and the jury doesn't need any more evidence because they are all doctors and they know what they are doing.So in conclusion this movie tries to be smart but it falls in it's own thinking. Actors are really good but they look bad from the writers.I understood who was the murder in the moment where the boy talked about his mental illness or when he gave that hateful look to the shrink. At that moment I started hating the movie not because I knew that but because of the twist that were major plot holes that made those good actors look stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wastes a good premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gregory Hoblit directs "Primal Fear" and "Fracture", two legal thrillers. Both films watch as hotshot lawyers wage war with master criminals. In "Primal Fear" our lawyer's played by Richard Gere, a slick defence attorney who takes to the courtroom and locks horn with the even slicker Aaron Stampler (a debuting Edward Norton), a conniving psycho with blood on his hands."Fracture" tells a similar tale, Ryan Gosling playing a cocky prosecutor tasked with taking down the even cockier Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins plays a genius who brazenly admits to killing his wife, knowing that the prosecution has no direct evidence against him. To say anymore about the plots of both films would be to ruin things.Both films work fairly well as popcorn potboilers, up until their last acts. At this point "Primal Fear" turns into a poor-man's "Usual Suspects", whilst "Fracture" ditches popcorn thrills for a melodramatic subplot between Gosling and a lover. Bizarrely, "Fear" spends most of its running time aiming for "Chinatown-esque" complexity, only to then jettison all its subplots in favour for a cheap "twist endings". Hoblit also miscalculates in his handling of Hopkins' character. Hopkins plays a rehash of Hannibal Lecter ? always boasting and always wildly taunting his opponents - when he should be playing a far more ordinary and tragic fellow; a simple engineer driven to madness by love and lamentation. Still, Edward Norton is excellent in "Fear" and "Fracture" sports an original premise, even if it does ultimately waste it.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard this movie described as "brilliant" and the ending as "the best I've ever seen" and even "one of the best in movie history." That is completely exaggerated, because this movie isn't even close to brilliant. It's mediocre. The plot is entertaining the first time you watch the movie, and even comical in some parts, but if you actually pay attention to what is being said you will realize that a lot of it doesn't even make sense, especially the idea that Aaron has multiple personality disorder.The fact that Martin actually believes him is surprising because in the scene where they first meet Aaron tells him that he saw a figure in the room where Rushman was murdered before he blacked out. Later the other person in the room, the one who killed the archbishop, is determined by Martin and by a psychiatrist to be his other personality, Roy. So he saw the other person...then turned into him? This may make sense if Aaron is schizophrenic as well, believing he sees Roy and talks to him. Later, when Roy makes his first appearance to Martin, he knows perfectly well who Aaron is and everything that happens in his other personality's life. However, when Aaron is asked during the trial if he knows who Roy is, he says he does not. So Martin should not be so surprised when Aaron/Roy reveals that they are the same person.That element of the story bothered me the most. What also annoyed me is how Aaron/Roy's story was never fully explained. If he did commit murder on purpose, why? Is it because of the sexual abuse? Did he have a disturbed childhood, or was he lying about that? It's up to the viewer to decide. I also didn't like how Martin Vail was never characterized completely. Is he an arrogant jerk, a genuinely kind and compassionate person, or both? Is he an arrogant jerk who's trying to reform? The tag line of the movie is "Sooner or later a man with two faces forgets which one is real." Who is this referring to? Rushman is said to be two-faced because he acted like a saint in public but was a sex maniac who took advantage of the vulnerable, but the story is never seen from his point of view, and we never receive evidence that he forgot which side was real. Aaron is also two-faced, but he knows this. Martin Vail, however, does not appear to be two-faced. The only evidence of a change in his character is when he starts to care about Aaron after at first insisting that he was not really interested in whether or not a client was innocent. However, there is little sign of an actual personality change or that he is forgetting which side of himself is the real one.The one redeeming element of this movie is the acting. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and, of course, the remarkable Edward Norton are all very convincing as their intriguing, albeit inadequately explained, characters.So if you like courtroom dramas despite what little sense they make, I guess I recommend it. However, don't be surprised if you find it isn't very well-done. I watched it with high expectations and was quite disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave a rate of 6, because I find the plot pretty weak. The movie hangs on a very thin wire, a boy brutally kills a bishop, but did he do it? It's pretty obvious he did it. Gere (Martin Vail) has to give the trial a different turn... The first time I saw this picture, I was stunned by it, I really believed the split in personality (Aaron/Roy), and the end of the movie took me by surprise. I only had attention for Edward Norton. A young actor, who would do big stuff after this movie. Gere and the others are not existent next to this guy. He really drove me in the curtains, with his brief alterations. The scene in his cell, introducing Roy to the public, was brilliant, and gave the plot a sincere look. I saw the movie for a second time, and now the movie is bleach, except the performance of Edward Norton still stands. I'm not saying the others play weak, but they cannot grab me enough to get me thrilled. Norton does that. If you became an Edward Norton fan, because of Fight Club, American History X, or Red Dragon, go see Primal Fear. As Aaron he really looks like a scout, but as Roy, he is freaky.</fullReview>

The plot thickens when sinister sides of the Archbishop, the altar boy's story, and the altar boy are unveiled. Good Movie. Gere is spectacular as Vail. A real crime Oscar snubbed him. They should be prosecuted. Realistic courtroom thriller-though in real life I doubt Norton's little temper tantrum on the stand in the end would've been taken for insanity.

		<shortDescription>Tedious for the first half, exciting for the second half, and stupid for both halves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of PRIMAL FEAR, whose title bears no relation to anything in the film, goes like this. Nothing interesting happens for the first ten minutes. Eventually, the Archbishop of Chicago is murdered, and the police chase down a blood-soaked young man named Aaron Stampler who was found hiding in the Archbishop's residence. Martin Vail, a cynical defense attorney, takes on Aaron's case pro bono in order to boost his reputation. Vail's opponent is prosecutor Janet Venable, an old flame who now hates him (groan). A veritable fish blizzard of red herrings is thrown at us, but it's really easy to guess not only that there's more to Aaron Stampler than meets the eye, but what it is that he's hiding.The second half improves the movie immensely, as the predictable twists are finally revealed and the unpredictable ones start arriving. Some people were able to guess the ending in advance, but I didn't, and rather enjoyed it. The acting is also of high caliber. Edward Norton steals the show in the role of Stampler, delivering an extremely natural portrait of a hesitant, ego-damaged young man with anger simmering just underneath. Richard Gere is acceptable as Vail, and Andre Braugher does a wonderful job as Vail's assistant Tommy Goodman, who is ill at ease with Vail's easy ability to warp the truth.However, the acting is not all good. Laura Linney, who did a good job in THE TRUMAN SHOW, is absolutely awful as Janet Venable. Every line she speaks sounds canned and stale. Her part was written to suggest that she still has repressed feelings for Vail, but Linney doesn't let any such feeling show. Her performance improves somewhat at the very end.The writing is sloppy and makes unreasonable demands on the viewers' credulity. If any Chicago lawyer were actually to solicit a client for his own publicity, uninvited and unappointed, as Martin Vail is shown doing, the Chief Disciplinary Counsel would have his hide for a rug before the day was out. Doubling the absurdity of the proceedings is the idea that Vail would try to boost his image by selecting a dead-loser case; no defense attorney ever improved his reputation by having his client convicted. Do you think Marvyn Kornberg, whose client Justin Volpe is now doing well-deserved time for savaging Abner Louima, has clients beating his door down?Adding to the wreckage of our suspension of disbelief is that crucial evidence is still being gathered even as the trial proceeds, when it should easily have been completed weeks ago. But the weirdest part is where Martin Vail, searching in the Archbishop's video library for a secret tape with crucial evidence on it, just picks one tape at random which turns out to be the right one; did it have "SECRET TAPE" in large block letters on the label?Yet another problem is Gregory Hoblit's leaden pacing, which is aggravated by long and useless aerial camera shots. The initial two scenes are among the most boring and needlessly protracted I have ever seen. "They had better be dropping clues that we'll need later," I thought several times, but they're not; the scenes are nothing but padding.If you're a sucker for courtroom dramas, there are worse ones out there than PRIMAL FEAR, but not many. I would recommend it to genre fans only. For them, I suggest sticking it out through the first half; the movie does get more interesting, even though it doesn't get more logical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile, uncompromising vehicle for Gere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cocky, cynical Chicago attorney (a taut Richard Gere) defends a shy altar boy on murder charges; meanwhile, his ex-girlfriend--a rival lawyer--takes her seat on the prosecution's side. The central murder-mystery in Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman's script, adapted from William Diehl's novel, is quite riveting, and the courtroom action is well-staged; however, the sub-plots involving a crooked city official (John Mahoney), a medical academic (Frances McDormand), and a slick hustler (Steven Bauer) are all woefully under-cooked. Gregory Hoblit directed with focus but not much flash, however Gere's solid performance, and a very exciting supporting turn from Edward Norton as the complicated accused, makes the picture worthwhile. Too many loose ends and unanswered questions, but otherwise a notch above the usual. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outwitted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Report to the Commissioner," Richard Gere is so composed he only smiles with contempt when Michael Moriarty threatens him with a snub-nosed pistol, and then he turns and walks away. In "Looking for Mr. Goodbar," Gere is a font of kinetic energy, an irresistible, nearly berserk force. In "Pretty Woman" he wears a smile throughout that suggests some hidden deceit. That just about illustrates his range as a performer. In this movie he plays it sort of mid-range, a grasping and self aggrandizing lawyer, rather like his character in "Power." He parades around and oozes semi-fake charm, an upwardly mobile winner in Chicago legal and social circles. (He couldn't do what Paul Newman does in "Verdict" -- he simply can't be that much of a loser.) But here, like Georgie Amberson, he "gets his comeuppance," outwitted by someone who seems to embody the wit and intelligence of some sort of inorganic object, a flagstone on the garden walk perhaps. Gere's arrogance works here because, in the end, it is not enough to save him and is the engine of his undoing. It's worth watching this movie just to see his character deflate at the end.Not to play down the other performances. Andre Braugher is given an excellent opportunity to walk through his part, as so many seasoned TV performers might do, but he skips it and presents us with a genuine sidekick personality. He is hilarious when he's on the stand testifying. Maura Tierney has such a small part she's barely noticeable. But Laura Linney makes quite an impression as Gere's courtroom adversary and former lover. She is conventionally pretty, and is one long, tall, cool drink of water, and a decent actress as well, at least here, although she's been torpedoed by the parts in some of her other appearances. A lot of praise has been given to Ed Norton's performance, and for good reason. Aaron seems so weak and so disturbed at the same time, that he's hardly there. Brad Dourif was able to do something similar in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," but Norton brings his own twist to the role. Speaking of range, Norton has it in spades, in ways that neither Gere nor Linney do. Both his roles here are convincing. And beyond that, he's a believable neoNazi in "American X". Multiple personality disorder, as a diagnosis, is problematic. It's there in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, and it can't be ignored. But no one really understands what it is, let alone why it occurs. Of course everyone has heard about it, and with a little reading anyone can pretty easily fake it, as one of the Hillside Stranglers did. And there used to be a diagnostic category called "Gansser's syndrome" that cropped up in guys who were given the death sentence and put on death row. They'd start acting "crazy" and wind up in the psychiatric unit, where they would quickly recover, until they were put back on death row, then they'd "get it" again. I'm not suggesting that MPD can be dismissed. There are differing degrees of intensity in role enactment. We are all of us playing roles at every moment of our lives. Our involvement can range from the casual (your friendly clerk at the supermarket checkout counter who tells you to have a nice day) to the extremely intense (there are fairly well authenticated cases of death by witchcraft in some cultures, particularly in central Australian tribes). MPD is somewhere in between these extremes. As Aaron/Roy illustrates so well in this film, the level of involvement can be very difficult to pin down. And I'm afraid that Frances MacDormand's neuropsychologist explaining on the stand that it begins with child abuse amounts to a lot of blown smoke. Anybody can dress up in, say, a Halloween pirate costume. The trick is to convince everyone in the courtroom that you really ARE a pirate, which Edward Norton pulls off so effectively here. Give that kid a bag of Hershey's Kisses.The story we see is gripping in many ways, though it has holes, but it remains strictly in the genre of courtroom/action/murder thriller. It follows the Instruction Manual to the letter, with no delicate touches. Example: Gere and his evil adversary (John Mahoney) are across the table from one another at a restaurant and they have a disagreement. Mahoney stops eating and slowly mutters a vulgar threat. Gere stands up, smiles, turns to leave but then turns back, makes a final riposte, and walks away while Mahoney stares grimly after him. Gere is given what is known as an "exit line." We see them in movies all the time. In the "Dragnet" series they were two for a penny. It's film making by the numbers. The scene could so EASILY have been lifted out of its mediocrity. DON'T give Gere an exit line, or better yet, instead of having Mahoney stare and take it silently on the chin, have Mahoney continue eating his chow mein noodles and pay no attention whatever as Gere stalks off. It would have accomplished so much more. One thing I didn't grasp though. I know it's a small point and I may have missed it while blinking, but -- why was the murder committed? Aaron/Ray is the smart, lying, manipulative, charming, murderous defendant. And he's supposed to have sliced and diced the Archbishop because the Archbishop encouraged him to have sex with a pretty girl in front of a private video camera? Huh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is very well told, with a lot of unexpected twists. Excellent acting, especially by Edward Norton. He outplays them all, as well as his character outsmarts them all. Gere is sleazy as usual.Apart from that I dislike the film for its questionable morals that are being transported in the subtext. Every film has a message. The message of this film is basically that "clinically insane persons" are "faking their insanity". The film implies that they should be toasted on the chair instead of being sent to a medical facility. The message is: pro- death-penalty. The film also implies that women can be smart but they can not control their emotions which makes them weaker than their male counterparts (again: Norton and Gere, completely in control of their emotions).Without the moral implications this film would be a 8/10, but as explained I can not stand the very conservative political image - especially the pro-death- penalty subtext - that's being transferred in the subtext, so I'll give it a 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: **3/4 out of ****. Primal Fear is one of those films that can be dull but it can also be compelling. The film is hit and miss on a few things that need to make a better movie viewing experience. The film has some good supporting performances (with the exception of one that is great) and can be compelling but those are not helped by the uneven pacing and a relatively uninspired lead performance. The first hour of Primal Fear is extraordinarily dull. I was so uninterested in the film that I thought I might not even want to finish it. However, the second hour is very compelling. The movie is finally given some life and is at least a little more entertaining and interesting. For the most, Richard Gere's performance can be described as dull. There are instances when his performance is intense (most notably when he is talking to that friend of Aaron's). However, those are only instances and the rest of the time, Gere is sleepwalking through his role. I never understood why people hated Richard Gere, but after seeing this film I understand. I was impressed by all three of his performances in 2002(Mothman Prophecies, Unfaithful, and of course, Chicago). Gere is completely lifeless here and this is a performance that needs to be forgotten. Members of the supporting cast definitely liven things up. Laura Linney is solid in her role. Despite being underused, Frances McDormand does a good job in her role. However, those performances pale to Edward Norton's excellent turn as Aaron(I think thats the correct spelling). The actor received an academy award nomination for his performance, which was very much deserved. There is a twist at the end of the film that is made better by Norton's performance(then we get a few unnecessary shots of Gere walking away). Despite its flaws, Primal Fear is still worth checking out. It is by no means a great film at all, but see it at least (if not fully) for Edward Norton's performance. The first hour is the only danger of watching this film, once you get by it you will be fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so rife with conventions and clichés from 1996 that it smells to high heaven. As the movie opens, it takes no more than 4 minutes to figure out that (1) a murdered priest will turn out to be pervert. (2) Put upon Edward Norton will be found innocent. (3) The outwardly moral milieu (the Cathloic priesthood) will emerge as corrupt through and through. And that (4) Gere, an apparent dog, will in some way be shown to be a good guy. The good guys think they've made their case when poor Norton turns out to have a split personality (eyes rolling). It comes with little satisfaction that the split personality is a ruse to yank the chain of some enlightened, well-intentioned figures. Stir in the "courtroom drama" genre which always comes with outbursts and surprise testimony, and it's just putrid on putrid. The tacked-on twist ending meant to excuse/reverse all the clichés we've endured is simply absurd. Let's just call it a 'twit' ending.It looks better than a movie like this would in the 60s (location photography) but it doesn't matter. And no, one showy performance by Norton, in a ridiculous part, does not improve or redeem things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING!Countless reviewers before me have praised the performances of cast. Agreed - Norton, Linney, Gere, and company do a superb job in their roles. Although the film suffers from a wealth of annoying inconsistencies and fails to explain many of the significant plot holes, it is forgiven by the casual viewer because of it's compelling storyline. Rather that bother asking "why?" the viewer is content to accept and instead ask "what next?" The film is admittedly clever, though not totally original. (I believe I saw this film 10-15 years ago when it was called "Jagged Edge.") Since many before me have already spoiled the ending (consequently ruining the film for would-be first-time viewers), I admit that the twist was well executed. The only problem is this: It goes without saying that the point of a surprise ending is to shock the audience. When everything you hear about the film makes reference to its "shocking twist at the end," then the effect is lost. How can you surprise someone when they already expect the shocking twist? I think most people already knew exactly how it would end within the first hour or so. I realize that this is criticism not against the film itself, but against the marketing folks. There are many films which rely on a surprise ending (I will refrain from naming any of them), but if the audience expects the surprise in the end, then the effect of the surprise is jeopardized.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Primal Fear (1996), directed by Gregory Hoblit, is an interesting, but forgettable, film. Richard Gere plays Martin Vail, an arrogant defense attorney. Laura Linney as Janet Venable is Vail's former lover, now on the state attorney's staff. Edward Norton does an excellent job of acting the part of Aaron Stampler, a timid young man accused of murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. Naturally, Vail will defend Aaron, and Venable will prosecute him for murder.Other than the courtroom proceedings, the plot hinges on the chemistry between Gere and Linney, and I couldn't find any. Maura Tierney, as Vail's assistant, doesn't do much other than stand around looking depressed. (A role she perfected on "E.R.") Andre Braugher as an ex-cop working for Vail has a demeaning role--not much better than the role given to Charlie Chan's African-American assistants in the 1940's.I found the editing and continuity of the film to be muddled. For example, Gere demands that his client undergo psychological testing before he pleads guilty or not guilty, but the trial and the psychological evaluation proceed simultaneously.All in all, this is a lackluster film that is worth seeing if it's on TV and if you have some free time. In my opinion, it's not good enough to warrant seeking it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me get directly to the point right off the bat: there are vast amounts of films out there about crimes, suspects, trials, and lawyers, so needless to say, a film in this category must be quite exceptional in order to achieve any kind of memorable status whatsoever. Unfortuneatly, "Primal Fear" does nothing interesting or original, causing it to fall in that static area of low-grade mediocrity.The story follows Martin Vail (Gere), an accomplished Chicago lawyer who, in order to gain greater fame, takes the case of a troubled young altar boy (Norton) who allegedly murdered and mutilated a charitable Archbishop (Anderson).Any film like this has a certain amount of inherent potential, but "Primal Fear" just does nothing inventive or intriguing the actors, plot, or visuals. Edward Norton, in one of his early roles, delivers a clichéd performance as the textbook stuttering, innocent down-home country boy with a dark side that we've seen so many times before. Richard Gere is his usual creepy self, and Laura Linney produces a flat performance with zero enthusiasm as a lawyer and former flame of Richard Gere's character, but really, who can blame her? The film then serves up the standard "plot twists", courtroom drama scenes, and moments of unoriginal sexual tension between the two lawyers with a past. It also throws in a few severely underdeveloped characters that just go nowhere and leave you wondering what their purpose was. You can tell director Gregory Hoblit is going for a noir feel here, but it just falls flat with its uninspired characters, uninteresting visuals, and forced dialogue.The film's only redeeming qualities are a good performance from John Mahoney, a fine jazzy score by James Newton Howard, and the viscerally effective murder scene, which I won't reveal the details of in this review.So it goes without saying that "Primal Fear" is by no means a film that elevates itself above all of the others in this genre, in fact, it may very well be below average for this type of film, and there have been some pretty big stinkers, trust me.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I avoided seeing this when it first came out because I hated the novel it was based on, and I don't like Richard Gere. I only rented it when Edward Norton was nominated for his performance here. It's not as bad as the novel, because director Gregory Hoblit downplays some of the pseudo-morality and melodrama which bothered me in the book(not only am I tired of having Catholic priests as sex offenders in mainstream movies, I also hate when the authors of these stories get off on that), and gets some nice interplay going between Gere and Laura Linney as his opponent/ex-girlfriend. And I must admit Gere is good when he's playing cynical in the first half(I especially liked his conversations with the journalist, with lines like, "Remember how your mother always told you to save your money for a rainy day? Guess what? It's raining!"), though that fades when he turns sentimental. And Hoblit can't do much when the story turns outrageous. Finally, there are some terrific actors here(Andre Braugher, John Mahoney, Frances McDormand, Alfre Woodard), but they all have one-dimensional parts to play and have nowhere to go with them.The best part of the movie, of course, is Norton. I had the disadvantage not only of reading the novel(so I know how it turns out), but also seeing this after I saw THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT and EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, so I knew what he was capable of, and I was still blown away. He even almost makes the end work. Still, this is mostly a time-waster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILER WARNING ***From the first moment Edward Norton unconvincingly faked his stutter, I knew how this movie would end. I especially knew it the first time his "alternate personality" revealed itself.Edward Norton is a very overrated actor, perhaps because he has a lisp people think he's delivering lines realistically or something, and if anyone thinks it's difficult to act like a stuttering oaf one moment, and like a psychotic the next, they should realise that this is probably the easiest type of acting there is because your character is so obvious and well defined, all you have to do is go through the motions.Anyway, despite knowing how this would end, it was watchable. You knew the intended "surprise ending" was coming because up to that point, everything had gone pretty much how you'd have expected. So a tuned in movie viewer at this point expects the surprise ending, even if anyone with half a brain hadn't worked it out for themselves. Besides, they always try to pull that kind of jarring of your emotions after what you think was a happy and satisfying ending.Acting deserves no mention, this is a court drama and court dramas never require a lot of acting ability, and Richard Gere has never really been more than the mature version of a Leonardo DiCaprio (ie. someone to attract female viewers, who obviously don't see movies for the plot).I should mention this plot has been done many times before (and done better), in movies like Just Cause, so anyone who found this surprising and original obviously hasn't seen many movies. It was at least good to see the pretty unlikable character (unless you're a shallow female) played by Gere to more or less get his just desserts in the end.4/10</fullReview>
