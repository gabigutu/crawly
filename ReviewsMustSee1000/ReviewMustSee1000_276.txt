		<shortDescription>Confusing, But Still Fun To Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another film I watched when it came out and then later when the DVD was released and enjoyed both viewings, despite the fact I got "lost" several times. It's about time for another look because it's well-worth it and who knows....maybe I'll finally figure it out!If you get a little confused trying to follow the plot, don't feel stupid. This isn't an easy story to follow but it gets high marks for keeping it interesting despite that problem.The interesting characters, good cinematography, fun James Bond-like gadgets, just the right amount of action scenes and one very memorable heist scene with Tom Cruise dangling from a wire all make this an enjoyable two hours of entertainment. That scene with Cruise trying to break into this vault-like room remains as the one of the better tension-filled scenes I've ever witnessed on the big screen.The final action scene with the speeding train and helicopter also is very memorable. John Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Henry Czerny and Jean Reno make it a fun cast to watch, too. Note: stick with this film and forget the sequel. Despite the confusion, this film is still fun to view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tense thriller that is not (despite popular belief) impossible to follow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to reiterate what "Anonymous of Derby, England" said about this film (20th November). The fact that so many people have complained that they "didn't get it" is proof that our brains are being atrophied by so many movies that do all our thinking for us. I had no trouble in following the plot and found the fact that I actually had to concentrate and think things through quite refreshing. Okay, so a lot of the stunts were a bit far fetched but what does it matter when they were so entertaining? After all, it is only a movie; nobody expects us to believe that these things could really happen any more than they expect us to believe that King Kong really existed or that there's a Volcano ready to errupt in L.A. Besides, with the inspired casting of David Schneider as the train driver, Brian de Palma must have had his tongue in his cheek for at least some of the time. He's created a masterful boy's own adventure story, an original "ripping yarn" and that brilliant comic touch added to this perfectly."Mission Impossible" is a visual and cerebral treat. Tom Cruise is excellent as Ethan, Vanessa Redgrave makes a superb villian and Jean Reno is watchable in ANYTHING he does. The only weak link is Emmanuelle Beart, who did a good job of looking beautiful but very little else. What a shame Kristin Scott Thomas couldn't have taken a more central role; she makes the gorgeous but bland Beart look like a waste of space.I give this 8 out of ten and it would have been more if it wasn't for Beart's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very clever thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have not seen the original Mission Impossible, it is a real shame. While the other flicks offer plenty of explosions and cool action sequences, the original remains the best for it's interesting plot twists, some decent acting, and a well developed element of suspense that's lacking in the later pictures.To reveal any of the plot would be a disservice: it certainly has some pretty interesting occurrences that should be seen for full effect. What really makes this great though is De Palma's direction. Unlike the later flicks, key scenes are drawn out: there is a real Spense of suspense that is rarely achieved. Three key action scenes come to mind, and there all extremely cool: it's just a shame that Criuse couldn't enlist the services of more experienced director's later in the franchise.A memorable, well executed thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and stylish action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the TV show of the same name, Brian De Palma's stylish thriller stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt; a James Bond-esquire secret agent working for a certain section of the government. As the title suggests, many of the scenarios in the film are extremely unlikely; but then again, the film wouldn't be living up to it's title if they weren't. It's one thing to criticise it's stunts for being overblown, but if they weren't, critics would be on it's back and calling it things like 'Mission Possible', so really you've just got to go with it. Brian De Palma makes it easy to just 'go with it' by way of an intriguing plot line, a constant array of high-octane sequences and lots of his trademark style! The plot does get a little too convoluted for it's own good at times, and sometimes it's a little hard to follow; but it gives the film a good basis for all manner of impossibilities, so it serves it's purpose. We follow Ethan Hunt and his team. After a botched mission, Hunt finds himself on the run from his employers after being accused of disloyalty. Hunt must now pull out all the stops to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and get to the bottom of why their mission went wrong.The film features a number of stunts, the best of which sees Tom Cruise breaking into the CIA via the roof. This sequence is brilliantly executed, with De Palma managing to inject bucketloads of suspense into the scene. This scene fits the tone of the film as it's brooding and cerebral, but the film ditches that idea for it's conclusion, which sees a bullet train, a helicopter and the Channel Tunnel combine to great effect! The problem with all these stunts is that the parts between the action sequences aren't all that interesting, and at times can slow the film down to walking pace. This isn't a big problem, however, because there's always more action around every corner and that keeps the film going. Tom Cruise obviously has charisma and can lead a film, but I often find it hard to buy him in action roles. This one suits him, though, as although his character is still more than capable, he comes off as being quite vulnerable, and lucky at times, and that suits Cruise's persona. On the whole, while this isn't a great film; it makes for good entertainment and if that's what you're in the mood for, Mission: Impossible wont disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soak up Cruise's Charisma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, there was a time when Tom Cruise was charismatic. Take trashy movies such as Cocktail and Far and Away or great movies like The Firm and A Few Good Men and imagine anyone other than Tom Cruise in the lead role. Hard to do, isn't it? His brash, cocky attitude was once appealing. Now that he feels he's an intelligent spokesman with something to say, he just comes across as an arrogant a**hole. Fortunately, the first MI falls into his earlier stage.This movie would have been just another action flick without Cruise. Sure we have a stellar cast, but did not Mr. Cruise steal every scene? He is perfect in the role of Ethan Hunt, a spy whose whole team is rubbed out in a convoluted cover up at the start. It is up to Ethan to uncover the plot behind the failed mission. The movie is a series of unveiled plot twists that becomes implausible after a while. But that's not the fun behind Mission Impossible. The fun is watching the great action scenes with their suspenseful turns. So much so, we are willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy the ride. And to let ourselves be swept away by Mr. Cruise's undefinable quality to take us there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorite movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite films of all time! I'll never forget watching this film for the first time with a good buddy of mine, afterward we couldn't stop talking about it and spent a great deal of time explaining plot points to each other. We finally decided that we just had to see it again, so we did and all of our questions were answered and our theories proven correct.The story is nothing less than superb! Every time you think you have the movie figured out they throw you for another loop, but not too much as to get you irritated trying to figure out the plot. This is most definitely a film that deserves at least two viewings before you can truly understand and appreciate the story. The characters are all excellent as well, although I was sad to see Jack Harmen (Emilio Estevez) get killed off so quickly, I liked his character.The cast is extraordinary! Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt perfectly! Jon Voight was the perfect choice for Jim Phelps. Emmanuelle Beart was very good in her role. Henry Czerny was superb as Kittridge. Jean Reno was an excellent addition to the cast. Ving Rhames was a very nice touch and really added a lot to the film. Kristin Scott Thomas was lovely as always, although played a somewhat minor role in the greater scheme of things. Vanessa Redgrave was another nice addition to the cast. And finally, Emilio Estevez (as I mentioned above), played a small role, and played it quite well.I can see why some of the big fans of the show wouldn't like this film due to certain plot points that I can't give away, so if you are a big fan of the show, be forewarned, you may have some issues with the film. Personally, I've never seen a single episode of the old television show, so I had absolutely no frame of reference. Which, I believe, put me in a better position to appreciate the story.I feel that I have to mention the action scenes in this film! SPECTACULAR!!! The scene where Kittridge and Hunt are talking in the restaurant...just AWESOME! The entire last 20 minutes of the film...UNBELIEVABLE!!! The filming, the action, the special effects and stunts alone make this film worth watching (but luckily, there is so much more to appreciate).If you are a fan of Tom Cruise, or just crime/mystery/action films in general, be sure to check this one out (at least twice). This is honestly one of my top 20 films of all time, I truly hope that you will enjoy this film. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian De Palma delivers a kinetic live wire suspense filled espionage thriller to open the Mission Impossible franchise. The camera work is exceptional with De Palma's trademark sense of motion applied to suspenseful heists and an amazing train ride sequence during which you really get the sense of speed and danger. Also created is one of the most iconic images from any thriller of recent times Tom Cruise suspended mid heist inches from a pressure sensitive floor. Cruise lives up to his star billing and for me really nails the Ethan Hunt character, Jean Reno, Ving Rames and the stunning Emmanuelle Beart provide able support.My one problem with this film and unfortunately quite a big problem is that the twist in the tale can be seen coming a mile off. Which is a real shame as this film is inventive, fun, stylish and everything a main stream thriller should be.Fun but the twist in the tale doesn't have enough of a sting 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really THAT confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Mission: Impossible when I was 15 and I didn't have a Scooby what the hell was going on. And I considered myself to be smarter than the average bear. In retrospect, it's not that muddled. In comparison to the very-dumbed down sequel it stands out as a better example of film-making made by a director who doesn't underestimate the audience.Brian De Palma is known to be a wildly inconsistent filmmaker. From the over-rated Carrie, to the under-rated Snake Eyes, the classic Untouchables and the downright hideous Mission to Mars and Scarface, he's been through just about everything. But Mission: Impossible was his first true mega-hit. Movies from TV shows are a dime a dozen these days and are rarely taken seriously, I mean look at trash like S.W.A.T. or Dukes of Hazard, but M:I is actually supposed to be a continuation of the show, rather than a spin-off.Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt (no, not cockney rhyming slang) an IMF agent who's entire team is killed in a phony sting operation in Prague. Accused of being a traitor he legs it before they can nab him and assembles a team of rogue operatives to find out who the REAL traitor is. Many double-crosses and double-double crosses ensue.For those who cannot follow the plot there are some really good set-pieces with enough tension and excitement to carry the whole movie. You'll know by now the dangling scene in the top-secret room but the best scene in the movie is the high-speed train rocketing through the English countryside. While other directors might use this as a chance to show off, De Palma keeps it as realistic as possible which makes it infinitely more cooler.Parts of the movie may seem a bit dated now and it's weird seeing Tom Cruise look like a little boy even though he was already 33. He even sounds different. And what kind of supervillian uses floppy discs? They could have tried something a bit more high-tech there.The M:I franchise could be a helluva lot better, I suppose. The second film was terrible and the third merely average. But they're still better than the last few Bond outings, though it ain't quite up to the rugged quality of the Jason Bourne movies.At least it got off to a good start. But can the world tolerate Cruise long enough to ever get a fourth made?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>call it a guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and again, you will come upon a film that you know really isn't the best movie in the world, or even a particularly good movie on its own. And yet, despite its glaring flaws and imperfectness and lack of completion, you do find yourself strangely attached to it because it has a charm to itself that keeps you interested. Call it a guilty pleasure.Mission: Impossible is my guilty pleasure. It's based on a 1960s television series created by Bruce Geller and the movie with Tom Cruise is kind of like a mash-up between The Bourne Identity and the James Bond pictures. Basically, the standard spy movie. Tom Cruise plays a spy who is falsely accused of betrayal to his organization and finds himself working with some unlikely partners to track down the real mole in the system and expose him and clear his name. Now, this is a plot as old as the hills and Mission: Impossible works with it just as well as the others. Not enormously well, but on an acceptable level.Tom Cruise is great as the film's action hero lead, unfortunately his supporting cast is quite uninteresting. Another defect worth noting is the film's convoluted plot, which sometimes is hard to follow. This is caused by a screenplay in need of revisions. That's one of the film's major weaknesses and really the reason why it's just a standard spy movie with lots of cool gadgets instead of something special.But that's really my only significant complaint about Mission: Impossible. Those rather small, unimportant defects left aside, and leaving the movie to its own devices, it works out well especially in its action sequences. Again, it's all been done before, sometimes better sometimes worse, but that doesn't meant it's boring or overdrawn. In fact, sometimes it's very primal. There is one scene in particular that I found intense and suspenseful on a hair-raising level. The scene goes on for an unremittingly long time, keeping us on the edges of our seats, and the best thing of all is that it's silent. The filmmakers could have chosen to go along with some dark, heavy music or some ominous heartbeat sound effects to put us in the same shoes with the characters, but the fact that it's quiet?too quiet for our liking?makes it so much more compelling. I only wish the rest of the movie was like this scene. Then it really would have been special.Nevertheless, De Palma's Mission: Impossible works out well for what it is and unless you're not a fan of the standard spy movies or action pictures in particular, of if you have your standards and hopes up too high, I imagine you will enjoy it. Again, it is kind of a guilty pleasure, but hey, it was a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just the worst!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Palma was trying to take a great TV suspense series and turn it into an action movie, and fails to be either. The plot is too thick and twisty for an action movie (hence, all the confusion for the people who wanted an action movie), and there's too much mayhem and uncontrolled improvisation to work as a tight, suspense filled caper like the original series. For those who wanted an action movie, I'm told De Palma dumbed down the other MI movies, thus moving it further yet from the spirit of the original series.As far as an action movie goes, it's got plenty of action, but it's hard not to roll your eyes at Cruise surviving that bomb blast towards the end. Yeah, real good IMF-type planning there, Cruise. You planned on surviving that bomb blast and getting catapulted up to the next car all along, right? But what REALLY blows is the way De Palma ruined the premise of the series by making Phelps out to be the baddie. Don't let De Palma get a hold of "Columbo", or he'll have the lieutenant become a serial killer, with Tom Cruise, his partner, tracking him down in a car chase and killing him in some fiery explosion at the end. Complete waste of time for anyone who likes either genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as a spy thriller can get,a real thrill ride to say the least!.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission Impossible was a film that I initially didn't care for,during my 1st few viewings. But the latest viewing,it seems I finally got it. Mission Impossible is a film that you have to pay strict attention too,otherwise you will eventually get lost,as it's a very confusing film. It isn't action packed like the sequels are,it's more of a mystery type thriller,but it has plenty of suspense,plenty of surprises,with an explosive finale that will have you on the edge of your seat!. I especially liked the train sequence at the end,it was very well done. I thought the casting of Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt was a bit strange at 1st. Now I am a huge Cruise fan,but he just didn't seem like the Action hero type. He proved me wrong big time,and did what he did best,put on a captivating show,his charisma is a big reason this film worked. The big twist at the end is shocking to say the least. Some would say it didn't make much sense,I personally thought it was a nice touch,because the film needed to end with a big bang,and I thought it did just that!.Mission Impossible isn't as flashy or action packed as the sequels,but as far as i'm concerned it may very well be the best in the series.Performances. Tom Cruise has proved to be one of Hollywood's most charismatic and reliable actors for what seems like forever. Here he does not disappoint. He makes a great Ethah Hunt,he's witty,he oozes charisma,adding the perfect balance of charm&amp;likability to Ethan. He handles himself well in the action scenes too,as I said he was a big reason in making this film work,with his undeniable charisma. Jon Voight is a hell of a presence. He always adds class and excellent acting to any film he's in,here was no different. Emmanuelle Béart is certainly a beauty,but she can also act pretty good too. She was highly mysterious,it kept her character unpredictable. Henry Czerny is full of intensity. His banter with Cruise in the restaurant was chilling stuff,I loved the guy!. Jean Reno is OK here. He is a capable actor,but I didn't much care for him in this. Ving Rhames is a pure bad ass,and while his role isn't as big as in the next two,he still came through. Rest of the cast do fine.Bottom Line. Mission Impossible is an excellent spy thriller. It's exciting,suspenseful and downright unpredictable. Highly recommend,if you choose to accept this Mission.8 1/2 /10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not Impossible to like this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the trend that began in the early 1990's to adapt old television series into major motion pictures, Mission: Impossible was one of the many added to the list. Premiering in the late 1960's, Mission: Impossible was hit series for CBS for seven seasons and brought actors such as Peter Graves and Martin Landau to popular stardom. In 1996, superstar Tom Cruise collaborated with director Brian de Palma to bring the modern film version to life, and despite some critical drubbing at the time, Mission: Impossible proves to be one of the better television to motion picture adaptations to grace the screen to date.Mission: Impossible, the series, was very much in the same mold of the modern police procedural Law &amp; Order: it was almost exclusively plot driven. Sure, the same characters reappeared episode after episode, but none of them were ever fleshed out or significantly developed. The series was exclusively interested in telling it's tale of a team of U.S. spies using subterfuge, theatrics and make-up to confuse and confound their mark and obtain their goal. With Tom Cruise in the lead of the film version, it seemed unlikely that this format would hold, and while the film does give a little more depth to it's leads, it is still pushed along by the tale more than the people.The film opens in Prague, where the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) have gathered to perform their latest mission: to prevent a double-agent from selling off a list of the secret identities of covert agents operating in Europe. The team is comprised of leader Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), key man Ethan Hunt (Cruise), electronics expert Jack Harmon (Emilio Estevez), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott-Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), and Jim's wife, Claire (Emmauelle Beart). Part way through the mission, things begin to go horribly wrong, and before the night is out, all members of the team except Hunt are killed by an apparent assassin. Hunt contacts the head of his division, Eugene Kittredge (Henry Czerny) and discovers that the whole mission was designed to capture a suspected mole in the agency, and since Hunt was the only one who survived, he is labeled the mole.Hunt escapes capture and is determined to prove his innocence. With the discovery that Claire did not die during the mission, Hunt makes contact with an arms dealer named Max (Vanessa Redgrave) who the real mole was dealing with and makes his own deal: he will secure the information that Max wants if Max promises to deliver the real mole to him. Hunt recruits former members of the IMF who were discovered during previous missions and had to be "disavowed' by the U.S. These include super hacker Luther Stickle (Ving Rhames) and helicopter pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno). Together, the group plans their heist, but things quickly become complicated and not everything with this whole operation is as it seems.At the time of it's release, Mission: Impossible was criticized for being so complicated as to be undecipherable, and while it is indeed complex, it is not impossibly so. The film does weave a complicated plot and requires the audience's attention, but that is actually one of the film's strengths. It doesn't proceed in an entirely normal manner, hitting all the usual beats you would expect from a Mission: Impossible story, so while it follows the formula to a degree, it also manages to stand that formula on it's head. If the film does fall short, plot wise, it is principally in one area involving a central twist to the story. From the moment the backstory for this twist is introduced early in the film until the plot finally reveals it, there is nothing terribly surprising about it. The final scenes of the film do suggest that it is not what it would seem to be, but even still, the fact that so major a plot element in a film that is supposed to be a suspense thriller is so easily deduced is a bit of a let down.Mission: Impossible is also not an action film in the literal sense. There is one major action set piece, but it is late in the film's running time, and up until then, the film has had no major car chases or fisticuffs. It replaces those with one major sequence of suspense, in which Ethan Hunt must attempt to retrieve information from a computer in a room littered with sensing equipment, including pressure sensitive floors, temperature controls and audio sensors. This sequence, played largely without dialogue and no music, is effective in building tension and literally putting you on the edge of your seat.Mission: Impossible is not really an actor's movie. All the leads, from Cruise on down, are competent and do their jobs well, but nobody really takes hold of your attention. Cruise is his usual suave self, Rhames is entertaining as Luther Stickle, and Reno is appropriately shady as Kreiger. There is the suggestion of a possible romance between Hunt and Claire, but there isn't much chemistry between the two.Mission: Impossible isn't a great film, but it is a good, effective one. It does require the audience pay attention and, emotionally, it doesn't pack a whallop, but it is good summer popcorn entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fashions fade, style is eternal." - Yves Laurent Filled with super-slick visuals and impeccable compositions, this big-budget thriller looks better with each passing year. While the 90's action movies of Cameron, Spielberg, Donner, Harlin, the Wachowskis and the Scotts have started to lose their shine, De Palma's exercise in mainstream mayhem ages like fine wine (or maybe just good grape juice).It's all about style, of course. Gloriously wide compositions, extreme close ups, canted angles, split-diopters, whip-pans, point of view shots and four slick set pieces...watching this film is like attending a masterclass in camera movement.De Palma's not just good with surfaces, he's obsessed with them. Villains are dressed in 1950's PI/spy coats, the heist scenes outdo Dassin's "Riffi" and Melville's "Bob The Gambler", the film is shot in luxurious black and whites and all the while De Palma's camera glides from one perfect composition to the next. To get this kind of fluid camera work, this seamlessness, you'd have to turn to Pixar and their virtual cameras.Of course, the irony is that for a director so obsessed with achieving perfect images, De Palma is constantly reminding us how fallible images are. All his tics and themes are here, albeit in a condensed fashion: truth needing to be reassembled, the unreliability of the image, the camera that lies, voyeurs (the first shot is a close up of a digital screen), conspiracies, false identities, doppelgangers, the need to reconstruct the film's opening murder etc.The only thing missing are some operatic sex scenes, which were actually filmed but deleted when producer Tom Cruise, not wanting to chase away the teen audience, had all romantic scenes with super-lush French actress Emmanuelle Béart removed.Author James Ellroy (sometimes he feels like the only other person on the planet who actually loves De Palma's "Black Dahlia") perfectly describes De Palma's style when commenting on the director's adaptation of his novel: "De Palma's films circumscribe worlds of obsession. They are rigorously and suffocatingly formed. No outer world exists during their time frame. Colors flare oddly. Movement arrests you. You forfeit control and see only what he wants you to see. He manipulates you in the sole name of passion. He understands relinquishment. The film-goer needs to succumb. His films are authoritative. He controls response firmly. His hold tightens as his stories veer into chaos. He stands and falls, coheres and decoheres, succeeds and errs behind passion. He was the ideal artist to film The Black Dahlia." Later he says: "Bucky Bleichert is a fictional cop and a doppelganger/writer-filmmaker. He's the man writing out the great adventure of his life and the voyeur viewing sex with a camera. Bleichert is me. Bleichert is De Palma. He's standing outside momentous events. He's lost in scrutiny. He wants to control. He wants to capitulate. His inner life is near chaotic. He needs to impose external order to countermand his mental state. It's Homicide Investigation as Art. He needs to take malignancy and render it something his own." And then: "The Black Dahlia spins off the axis of De Palma and Hartnett. It's a three-mode constellation: thriller/noir/historical romance. The design is near-German Expressionist. It's L.A./it's not L.A./it's L.A. seen by Dahlia fiends in extremis. The film commands you to savour every scene and revel in your visual entrapment. This textual richness symbolises the Dahlia's hold on us. We can never look away. She won't let us." 8/10 ? While "Casualties of War's" camera shifted stance with each vertical plane (underground, plateau, hill, bridge), here De Palma's camera changes stance when we jump from Prague to London to the Channel Crossing that links them. Complaints about silly plots and actors are valid but inconsequential. This is about De Palma's camera, Tom Cruise a prop that need only turn up and look appropriately intense.Worth three viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mission: Impossible", a 1996 film directed by Brian De Palma, is a great film. I do know others have found it jarring with a confusing storyline and I have to somewhat agree. However, there are many other elements which make this a very enjoyable film - first and foremost, I love the cinematography - the tilted angles which shows how chaotic the situation that Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) is put in. Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight) expertly plays his mentor in an interesting role. Ving Rhames stars as Luther Stickell (the only other character besides Ethan Hunt who is in all 3 films so far). Emmanuelle Beart as Claire Phelps also makes an appealing love interest. The action sequences are top-notch (especially the helicopter sequence at the end!) and the music is very fitting (by master composer Danny Elfman). I would recommend this film - a high 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting espionage thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible tells the story of wrongly disavowed secret agent Ethan Hunt trying to prevent the theft of a list of all the secret agents in the world with the help of two other disavowed agents played by Ving Rhames and Jean Reno. While all this is going on, he must find the true mole in his agency that set him up.Mission: Impossible is the perfect film for anyone who enjoys a good spy movie. The plot is quick and to the point. It never lets up for a minute. Unfortunately when it comes to spy movies, I'm left stumped with some of the details. With Mission: Impossible, even though they talk about things that are hard for the layman to understand, it can be easily figured out before the end of the film. But who cares anyway? The action scenes are amazing, particularly the famous sequence of Ethan Hunt dangling from a ceiling and catching a sweat droplet so it doesn't trigger the alarm. Since I'm young, I never had the pleasure of watching the TV show, but if it was anything like this movie, I'm sure I'd truly enjoy it.All the roles in the film are played very well. I particularly enjoyed the fact that Ethan Hunt's team is made up of well established actors such as Jon Voight, Emilio Estevez, and Kristen Scott Thomas. You're saying, "Great cast. This should be good." Then, without a moments notice, they're all dead in the first 10 minutes.Mission: Impossible is an amazing thrill ride movie, just what you'd expect from the director of Scarface and The Untouchables.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone seems to complain that the plot in this film is too confusing, but just because you don't 'get' it doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I thought that the plot was superb; it may be a little difficult to follow, but with a little thought it isn't at all hard to understand. It is refreshing to have a big budget thriller with a clever plot, not just masses of pyrotechnics and gunplay.</fullReview>

But there are some REALLY good sequences here, and there is even one that I consider to be one of the very best and most suspenseful parts of any movie - the part where Cruise is in the vault. Beautiful and nerve-racking.Not much else to say, though - it's an action movie, and it's a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie since I was like, 10, so I decided to watch it again- since I didn't really know sh*t about films back in the day, and passed this off as just another Tom Cruise film. Wrong. I put this into my VCR last night (I bought it for about a dollar at a used store- it was much cheaper than renting it) and I expected the worst. Normally I try to stay neutral, but knowing Tom Cruise, and knowing the kind of films he does- such as Top Gun (thats right, I said it) I just didn't know what to expect, or remember enough of it to pass judgment on it. However, I am a huge DePalma fan, and love his style (which is just a LITTLE different than Hitchcocks, I understand). Well anyway, This is about a crew of spies, namely the point man named Ethan Hunt. While on a mission, every one of his members are killed, and he is framed with being a corrupt agent. Hunt, to clear his name and get his parents out of jail, sets out for the real mole by way of the book of job. Overall, this is a film is one of Tom Cruis' best. He doesn't have many, mind you, but this is one of the few. Brian DePalma DOES NOT disappoint either. This movie looks and feels awesome. The direction is awesome, and it has the little "DePalma" trademark that we all love (or just me?). If you want a mindless action flick, watch mission impossible 2- if you want one with a semi-complex storyline (I don't even know if I would call it that. Not that hard to follow, but certainly more hard to follow than Mission Impossible 2)- watch mission impossible. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the only problem with this movie was that the plot was too advanced for a one time viewing. What made it more complicating were the names that they used. But if you watch the movie a couple of times, you will discover that there is a good strong plot, and that there are no missing holes in the story. Everyone seems to say that this movie has no plot or doesn't make sense even though everything else about it makes sense. After you understand the plot, the movie will be so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I truly, on the whole of God's green Earth, the only person that understood the plot, ignored the implausibility of the stunts and simply just sat back and enjoyed this film. I guess so and I'm proud of it. This film must finally prove something that I've long suspected, movie audiences are slowly being sucked dry of their brain cells. All the people I've talked to about this film have complained about not being able to follow it. Well I consider myself a normal, average person and I got it. I enjoyed following the twists, loved the way that the writers and director slowly peeled the skin back with flashbacks to reveal the fruit underneath and rejoiced at an action film that wasn't a mindless bloat of special effects but that actually had something inserted into it called a 'storyline'. People that have a problem with this, "ID4" is at your local video store, "Godzilla" isn't far behind. Go look at them for a while. Pretty aren't they. And then of course there are the stunts. Yes, the helicopter thing is impossible. OK, the CIA heist is preposterous. And alright the cafe scene is ridiculous. But, damn, they were exciting!!! The people that ridicule these impossibilities are no-doubt the ones who got narked because their single-digit IQ's could no longer handle the plot and just decided to pick faults at otherwise brilliant scenes. If you can't sit back, get carried away by the stunts and just enjoy a film like this then I don't know what you're doing in the theatre in the first place. The bottom line is that this film is great. It's an action film for fans of "Chinatown", "The Usual Suspects" and "The Godfather". People that didn't like M:I will neither have seen or heard of these. That hardly surprises me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I am a loyal fan of De Palma. OK the man basically did the Untouchables, Scarface, wise guys, Carlitos Way, Carrie, casualties of war!!! Many people judge a director by the work as a whole, not the history of his all works, diversification, and elements of one work. Well if you focus on these three elements, you will find from the movies I named above that De Palma has done it all! Let us see: Mission Impossible I was the best of all three and it was the only one directed by De Palma. The second was directed by John Woo and the third by J.J.Abrams. If you watch the second you will see a touch of face/off from Woo but nothing that teases your brain. If you watch the third, well nothing is good about it. However, the first one is a movie that almost everyone I know who watched it the first time wasn't capable of understanding the plot quite properly! It's one of the very few action movies that requires full attention and respect to the plot. We all know action movies' plots! So, anyone who didn't like this movie is simply one that didn't understand the plot with its minutest details that need a proper viewing. De Palam, hats off to you for you master any work you put your hands on.If you like brain teasers, if you appreciate great directors, if you enjoy plots that put your wit to test, then Mission Impossible I is the right movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An engaging piece of Cold War histrionics set in fine motion by DePalma and his stellar entourage of fine actors. To me, it stands far ahead of the two sequels, primarily because it is more subtle and cerebral and less visceral than the others. The cast itself is not laden with merely young hot-shot actors inserted into screenplays for box office appeal. Rather, it is almost too politically correct in its casting as all the demographics seem to be represented here: young, old, Black, White, male, female, American, European etc. Yet each of the principals and the supporting cast fits into his/her respective role quite well, with little wasted motion. It's as if they each have their own "raison d'etre" as it pertains to the overall story line.The sophisticated spy-vs.-spy plot line is not only enhanced by the thespian talent, but also the inventive camera work that allows us to revisit "flashbacks" of prior scenes that are taken from perspectives other than the original. To wit, the Jon Voight bridge scene gets a few once-overs, if you will. Also, the European locales are well shot with no gratuitous indulgence, which helps to embellish the story line. Lest I forget, a sweet job by Danny Elfman adapting Lalo Schiffrin's "MI" theme to the soundtrack, especially during the ending credits where he shifts the theme's normal 5/4 tempo to a funkier, bluesier 4/4 time signature!Tom Cruise takes a nice turnabout from some of his earlier more "cutesy" roles. His role here demands of him technical expertise as well as strength of character in order for him to merely stay alive. J. Voight and V. Redgrave are in fine form in their complex and beguiling portrayals.In summary, this episode of the "MI" series characterizes what I consider to be a triumph of substance over form, of subtlety over the obvious. Maybe this attitude is a "no-no" for modern audiences, but it remains one philosophy that I will always endorse.</fullReview>

It's really just a big star vehicle and money-making enterprise for Tom Cruise.Sure, it's an entertaining mindless romp that will keep your brain happily in neutral for a few hours and that may be all you're after.The revelation of who is the true villain will anger some fans such as myself. It really wasn't anything like the 80s "Mission Impossible" I remember. What about the comraderie between characters? What about the team effort thing? These things are missing because it's Tom Cruise Vs the rest of the world.The best thing about the film is Larry Mullen Jnr and Adam Clayton from U2 being on the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission Impossible is the movie that could only come from DePalma and Cruise. The former is a hack and the latter is a real drip. The plot is set in motion when the good guys "knock list" is stolen. But the thieves learn it was a bogus knock list, so it's vitally important to replace the knocklist or the bad guys will realize their goods are bad. Mostly the plot is an excuse for characters to say "knock list" a lot, and you get to see Cruise play an unbearably cocky ass in Eruope for a change. Plotwise it's pretty stale; One guess as to who turns out to be the bad guy; yep, that's right, the person who was supposed to be the good guy. Gee, that's fresh. Cruise projects the kind of phony confidence of the guy who knows the "right" answer to give to those idiot job-interview questions. You know what I mean... "What's your worst habit?" followed by the correct answer that cloaks your success in flaws clothing: "I drive myself too hard." or "I cry myself to sleep at night over my lack of flaws." The type of deeply phony horse-sh*t that makes you roll your eyes and fills you with revulsion for the ass who would actually say it; the type of person who would give those answers and really sell it, not realizing that an impartial observer would retch over his teeming phoniness.Keep your eyes on Cruise though. The heyday of this type of this meathead tripe has lasted anachronistically into the era of the metrosexual. It's due to expire some time in the next 3 months. Cruise hasn't figured out that this kind of sales job makes him look really old, not young. Chicks with fake boobs, guys who drive hummers, and those who wish to join either group will like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lalo Schifrin, Meet Danny Elfman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of the original summer blockbuster re-imagining of Mission: Impossible is a virtually unfathomable maze of post-Cold War duplicity, though the fine points barely count. It's all an arrangement for exciting chase sequences and a skilled computer theft procedure, intercut with that most dependable of spy movie supplies, the midnight meeting under a street lamp in a frosty foreign city.Cruise is Ethan Hunt, specialist spy, whose mission is to stop the stealing of a computer file holding the aliases and true identities of all of America's infiltrators. It's not sufficient to just obstruct the guy. Cruise and his team are supposed to snap pictures of the opponent taking the information, and then pursue him until he drops it off. This procedure concerns a check list of Cold War chestnuts: Bifocals with incorporated TV cameras, hidden microphones, laptop computers, agents in ornate disguise, exploding cars, shankings, shootings, bodies falling into a river, and the like. Naturally the entire sequence focuses on an embassy party in Prague.Self-consciously baroque and formal as always, this is nevertheless still certainly one of director Brian De Palma's very best works. Rather than trying to bring his preference for stylistic flamboyance over substance to material of substance, Mission: Impossible is perfectly suited for him, as it affords him the ample playground for his often subtly deceptive and reflexive exploration of voyeurism. It comprises a chain of impressive set pieces. Any deeper engagement with the film is overpowered by the strict adherence to spectacle.There are so many double-blinds in the first 45 minutes that we're trained to judge nothing and no one merely by facade, not even their facades, because they may be ornate Adrian Messenger-style latex masquerade. And the drive of the visuals stops us from asking commonsense questions like, Is actually reproducing a computer file onto another disc the one way to get it? Don't you guys have hackers? Like most De Palma films, this Tom Cruise vehicle is all polished lather and procedural dexterity. The characters are not terribly intriguing, save Vanessa Redgrave as an information broker, who extracts a trace of melancholy in a film too impulsive for apathy of any sort. The assorted stratagems of Cruise and his associates and enemies don't hold water under analysis. And that makes little difference.This is a movie that lives in the moment, and we must be in the moment to take pleasure in it. Any off-putting doubts from earlier in the film must be resolutely subdued.De Palma is proficient at grand, slow-moving vistas of tension and violence. This $100 million action film gives him the chance for more modern versions of the vintage wordless action sequence. There are three here: The introductory scenario at the ambassadors' soirée, a fragile feat of computer burglary and an absolutely incredible bullet-paced climactic chase that I would call a masterpiece were it not scored overmuch. It's where a helicopter trails the express London-Paris line into the Chunnel with Cruise and the now revealed ultimate villain clutching on top of it.The computer burglary scene will strike a loud chord with anyone who has seen Rififi or Topkapi, both by Jules Dassin, who became renowned for his extensive heist sequences executed in utter silence. Topkapi also shares in common with Mission: Impossible the method of hanging a thief from an opening in the ceiling to circumvent ultra-sensitive security mechanisms on the floor. This time, De Palma gives us a computer safe room engineered so that sirens will wail at any sound above a particular decibel level, any weight on the floor, any variation in temperature.Naturally it's handy that the decibel level is set high enough that it isn't activated by the sound of a computer copying a disc, which is exactly what it should be resisting. Fitting, too, that the infra-red rays safeguarding the ceiling hatch can be so expediently contended with. And quite opportune for the audience that the rays are made discernible to the untrained eye. If you want to see infra-red rays thoroughly explored in a caper, watch Grand Slam.The main thing is, Cruise looks hip and holds our interest while doing clever things that we don't completely grasp, doing them so rapidly and with so much elegance that we put our questions on the back burner and glide with enjoyment. When the movie ends, it turns out there wasn't anything apart from the wind. Our relief, apparently, is that we enjoy ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weakest of the Series but Still Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible (1996) *** (out of 4) American agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is framed for the murders of his crew so he decides to try and find out who really sold them out. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is a pretty interesting film to watch today, after viewing the three sequels, this one here really stands out simply because it's more thriller than action film. It's always been rumored that star Cruise and director Brian DePalma had different views on how the film should be and I think there's some reason to question how much pull either one had on what we're seeing. I say that because there are moments that come across as pure Hollywood action film while other moments where it seems like DePalma wanted a straight thriller with no action elements. These rumors seem more than true today once you see how the sequels turned out as they were more in line with what Cruise wanted. With all of that said, there's no question that this is still an entertaining film even if it is the weakest of the series in my opinion. I think the film is a tad bit too uneven at times and there's no question there are moments when you're wondering how they came up with the story. Not to mention there are a few plot holes and in reality, if you think about what's going on here it's all a bit too easy and especially the raid on the CIA building. Speaking of this sequence, even though the ease of how it happens is questionable, there's no question that this is the highlight of the entire film. The sequence contains some very big moments of tension and it's beautifully shot, performed and edited. The reason people love DePalma is on full display during this sequence but it's shame his skill wasn't put to better use throughout the film. Cruise is very good in the lead role as he has no problems playing the action here. Ving Rhames, Jon Voight and Vanessa Redgrave all add nice support and it's fun seeing Emilio Estevez early in the picture. Even with its flaws, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is still a fun picture but at the same time you can't help but think it should have been better considering the talent involved.</fullReview>

If its true, I applaud his decision.Despite that, I thought it was a good film.

OK, the stunts may have been a little implausible (most movie stunts are anyway) and it may have deviated significantly from the ensemble nature of the series, but I thought that it stood up well on its own as a spy film. Some found it too difficult to follow, but to me that kind of challenge makes for interesting viewing.What really ticked me off was the treatment of the Jim Phelps character (I guess the film's been out long enough to reveal that they made him the bad guy). This simply wasn't nessesary. Not only did they make the good guy of the old series the villain of the movie, they made him a particularly vile and nasty one. This is a bit like having Batman team up with the Joker or James Bond decide to go for the bucks and to hell with the rest of the world. Although I enjoyed the movie, I will always hold a bit of a grudge against it for such a lapse of good judgement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish TV remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Carlito's Way, all of Brian De Palma's movies have been more about style than content. When the plot and characters weren't good enough to keep the film interesting, we got crap like Femme Fatale. When, on the other hand, De Palma had an intelligent script and a reliable cast to work with, the result was quite pleasant. Mission:Impossible belongs to the second category.Based on the popular TV show from the '60s, the movie starts with Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), leader of IMF (Impossible Mission Force), preventing the latest terrorist plot before receiving a new assignment ("This message will self-destruct in five seconds"): he has to locate and arrest a double agent. The problem is, his whole team, including himself, gets wiped out during the mission. Only Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is left, which brings his superiors to a "logical" conclusion: he has to be the traitor. Alone and on the run, Hunt has to prove his innocence and find the real dirty agent. He will receive some help from Claire (Emmanuelle B?art), Jim's wife, computer whiz Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and mercenary Krieger (Jean Reno). An impossible mission? Perhaps...As I already said, this film relies heavily on style, and De Palma artfully delivers when it comes to staging an exciting thriller. Two scenes in particular prove the Scarface director was the right man for the job. One sees Ethan trying to rob a maximum security vault whose alarm basically reacts even if you have to scratch your nose. That scene is loaded with suspense and is one of the best ever directed by De Palma. The other memorable bit is the final set piece (I'll just say three words: train, tunnel, chopper), which proves things can really get impossible in these movies.As for content, David Koepp's script is brilliant as long as it deals with the various conspiracies, but rather shallow in terms of character development. Take the IMF team at the beginning: they're so hastily introduced it's hard to feel for them when they're all killed five minutes later. Apart from Cruise, who manages to turn an otherwise one-dimensional protagonist into a charismatic lead, the only characters worth watching are Phelps (a superb Voight) and Max, a criminal mastermind, masterfully underplayed by Vanessa Redgrave.All in all, not as good as De Palma's earlier works, but nonetheless quite stylish, charming and enjoyable, not to mention a really good adaptation of a TV series. If only other remakes (Charlie's Angels, for example) were this good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Cruise rewrites popular culture. The clever, effective intelligence strikeforce of the 1960's is here a group of amoral crumbs (except, of course, for straightshooter Tom); and the most evil is . . . Jim Phelps?!?!? Oh, please. A silly premise (someone is killing off MI team members) leads to a silly theme (Tom must find out who is doing it - all by himself, except for a small army of superspies who he conjures out of thin air join him), which leads to a silly plot device (the CIA has a super-duper secure room, with man-sized ventilation ducts that lead right to it, so Tom and his people use them, then drop a smoke bomb, and conjure up a fire engine out of thin air, and then just walk out of CIA headquarters, while the security alarms are going off -- yeah, right), which leads to a silly climactic scene (in which one of the bad guys is stupid enough to try to fly a helicopter into the "Chunnel"), and a silly unmasking (superspy Jim Phelps is fooled by superdoofus Tom Cruise). What it adds up to is not an homage, but an unintended parody of "Mission Impossible". What is it about Tom Cruise's generation that must try and rewrite (stupidly) their forebear's work? (For surely what is this but his generation trying to childishly claim they are smarter than their fathers?) This trend makes me very angry -- because his generation is my generation, and I'd hate to be lumped in with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Readers, It's hard to explain Mission: Impossible's plot so I'll make my opinion without revealing too much of the plot. Mission: Impossible 1 stinks, or as David Schwimmer would say: 'It tastes like feet!'. Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Ving Rhames, and Jean Reno are completely flat with their performances while Henry Czerny is dull as heck. Danny Elfman does an okay job doing the score but it lacks the awesomeness of Hans Zimmer's hard rock score of M:I-2. There is literally zero action, just people running around. Brian de Palma does a terrible job adapting this series, which stinks because he did an awesome job adapting The Untouchables, which is surely the ultimate TV-Show-adapted-into-movie movie.

		<fullReview>Mission:Impossible is not a bad film if you look at this movie as a whole. If you break it down into pieces, negative things about this movie will unravel. This film is based off the original television series from the 60's. Basically the main character, Ethan Hunt's team was killed and is being targeted as a suspect. He must seek help from other agents to stop him from being targeted. Most of the acting is fairly decent. Tom Cruise was annoying from time to time. Jon Voight and Ving Rhames were the best. The special effects are great, but so are other special-effects movies from the 90's such as Godzilla. I had a few problems with this film. Some of the scenes were boring and pointless. There is hardly any action, just talk. If you want action, I recommend James Bond. This is nothing like the original series, but this film is good to watch and compare anyway. Based of this review, I should have rated this movie 5/10 but I give it a 7/10 due to Rhames/Voight and the special effects.</fullReview>

Mission : Impossible¨ by Brian De Palma boasts a very good cast such as Tom Cruise , Ving Rhames , Jon Voight , Henry Czerny , Kristin Scott Thomas , Vanessa Redgrave Emmanuel Beart , Jean Reno . The undercover unit comes into action with several fine spectacular scenes . The crack undercover agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called into action by IMF staff (John Voight) , his assignment is a crucial mission to prevent the theft of classified material . The outfit formed by stalwarts specialists (Emilio Estevez , Emmanuel Beart , Kristin Scott Thomas) execute a dangerous operation in Praga . But the team is double-crossed and things go wrong , causing Ethan Hunt and his new team to go to clear his name . As American agent , under false suspicion of disloyalty ,he must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization . Meanwhile , Ethan and his undercover new bunch (Ving Rhames , Jean Reno) try to discover who set them up . Ethan and his group carry out a dangerous caper at Langley , Virginia , breaking into the CIA's most impenetrable vault . This energetic movie packs unstopped action , hair-raising suspense , exciting thriller , frenetic pursuits and lots of violence . Well made high-tech hijinks and full of breathtaking set-up with impressive frames such as the climactic train sequence that took 6 weeks to film at the 007 stage at Pinewood Studios . And the exterior shots of the train scene, supposedly with the train in France, were mostly shot in Scotland . Tom Cruise performed a lot of sequences where Ethan Hunt executes his risked missions without the use of a stunt double . As during the filming of production , Tom Cruise did the majority of his own stunts including the CIA vault sequences to show the audience it was actually him ; this would allow director Brian De Palma to have more capabilities with camera angles &amp; not having to hide the fact it is a stuntman doing the stunts . When Ethan is suspended by a cable while infiltrating the CIA vault results to be the series trademark , but it is ripped off from ¨Topkapi¨ by Jules Dassin . As it also appears in M.I. 2 (2000) and Mission: Impossible III (2006), Jeremy Renner also did this in Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol . The film contains an interesting as well as twisted story in flamboyant treatment , worth two hours'time, with screenplay and story written by David Koepp , Robert Towne , Steven Zaillian and based on the vintage characters by Bruce Heller . Lalo Schifrin's classic score television is again well reused here , at a much higher decibel level and adding a stirring soundtrack by Danny Elffman , fitting perfectly to action . Fascinating and luxurious cinematography by excellent cameraman by Stephen H. Burum . As usual, Tom Cruise co-executive produced , along with J. C. Calciano , Paul Hitchcock and Paula Wagner . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Brian De Palma . He's a successful producer , writer and director with a lot of hits such as ¨Sisters ¨, ¨Dresssed to Kill¨, ¨Blow out¨ , ¨Obsession¨ : all of them are outwardly odes to Hitchcock ; furthermore , he also made unforgettable flicks : ¨Scarface¨ , ¨Untouchables¨ , ¨Carlito's way¨ , ¨Femme Fatale¨ , ¨The Black Dahlia¨ , among others . ¨MI 1¨ , rating : Better than average and well worth seeing . The tale will appeal to Tom Cruise fans and unstop action movies fans . The film had big success at the box office worldwide , becoming one of the highest-grossing installment in the franchise .Other installments from this popular and successful series are the followings : ¨ ¨Mission : Impossible II¨ by John Woo with Dougray Scott , Thandie Newton , Richard Roxburgh , John Polson , Brendan Gleeson ; ¨MI 3¨ (2006) by J. J. Abrahams with Philip Seymour Hoffman , Ving Rhames , Maggie Q , Jonathan Rhys Meyers and ¨MI 4¨ by Brad Bird with Paula Patton , Simon Pegg , Jeremy Renner , Michael Nyqvist and ¨Mission : Impossible V¨ (2015) by Christopher McQuarrie with Jeremy Renner , Simon Pegg , Ving Rhames , Rebecca Ferguson , Sean Harris , Alec Baldwin and , of course , Tom Cruise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting But Nothing Like the TV Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The transition that "Mission Impossible" made from the small screen to the big screen ignited considerable controversy. The beloved character that Peter Graves originated on television named Jim Phelps became a treacherous rogue agent that Jon Voight played as a villain in the film that director Brian De Palma helmed. Hardcore "Mission Impossible" fans have never forgiven either Tom Cruise or Brian De Palma for this sacrilege. The first "Mission Impossible" suffers from contrivances galore. Nevertheless, "Mission Impossible" emerges as an exciting, suspenseful nail-biter with three electrifying set-pieces: the opening computer heist debacle at an American embassy, the white-knuckled scene in the vault at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and the chilling train ride sequence as the finale that culminates with a helicopter being dragged by a train through the claustrophobic confines of a tunnel. The CIA vault scene ends up being the best, with the other two are slickly done. The story opens with a brief vignette that features American espionage agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise of "Risky Business") masquerading as an older, mustached man orchestrating a ruse against an enemy agent by convincing his adversary that he has been instrumental in the death of a young woman. As soon as Hunt extracts the information from his disheveled adversary, they incapacitate him, revive the girl, Claire (Emmanuelle Béart of "Don Juan"), who is playing possum and tear down the fake motel. The next thing we know we are introduced to the cinematic incarnation of Jim Phelps, and "Mission Impossible" adheres slavishly to the television formula with IMF chief Phelps receiving the usual briefing from a disc that self-destructs after he is told about his latest mission should he decide to accept it. Phelps relies on his right hand man, Ethan Hunt, to coordinate the operation in Prague. The IMF is supposed to record the pilfering of the CIA's master list of Eastern Europe spies. During the mission, everything goes haywire, and everybody but Hunt dies. Ultimately, we learn that neither Phelps nor his wife Claire died. The Phelps couple staged their own deaths. Naturally, since Hunt is the last man standing, his CIA superior Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny of "Ice Castles") suspects that he may culpable of the crime. The big revelation for Hunt is the discovery that the entire operation was 'a mole hunt' to expose a saboteur. The resourceful Hunt manages to escape from Kittridge when he uses explosive chewing gum to blow up the aquarium restaurant where he met with the CIA chieftain.Holing up in a Prague safe house, Hunt finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place. Eventually, he smokes out an arms dealer, Max (Vanessa Redgrave of "Blow-Up") who pays him to steal the spy list. Since he cannot call on his former comrades because they are dead, Hunt enticed disavowed computer specialist Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames of "Pulp Fiction") and pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno of ""Flyboys") who can fly a helicopter through anything. The theft of top-secret computer documents from Langley ranks as the best scene in "Mission Impossible" with our intrepid hero dangling from a rig in the ceiling to make himself inconspicuous to the vault security gauntlet. Watching Krieger as he uses his muscles to keep Hunt from tripping the security alarms is taut stuff. The exit that they make disguised as firefighters is clever. Like its small screen predecessor, the cinematic "Mission" features spectacles that boast built-in TV cameras, hidden microphones, laptop computers, agents in sophisticated covers, exploding cars, exploding chewing gum, stabbings, gunplay, bodies toppling into a river, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless franchise starter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of each Mission: Impossible movie getting better and better reviews after the 2nd one, some portion of the audience affirms that the saga only gets better with each passing installment. Looking forward to seeing Rogue Nation further down the road this year, and having seen Ghost Protocol and enjoying it, I still say with enormous confidence that the first Mission is still to be beaten and maybe the fifth will do it, but I will talk about that another time. Getting back to the point at hand, this movie truly delivers thrills like no other and an incredibly twisted story that keeps you guessing and guessing. Tom Cruise really nailed a role of a lifetime here as he begins to give us Ethan Hunt, a spy that gets more and more iconic status as he is associated with the likes of Bourne and the top spy himself Bond. But the movie succeeds on a lot more levels than this, ranging from the supporting cast to the screenplay and direction. This is a franchise I very much enjoy (even the maligned MI2), but this is the standard bearer of the series and the more espionage driven movie of them all. Terrific StuffRating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Intelligent Of The Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:DePalma's original was attacked as inscrutable, boring and too long. I thought it really was not that hard to follow. The narrative is straight forward; a mission directly under Phelps goes bad, agents get killed and everyone disperses. Ethan chases the NOC list of covert agents in Eastern Europe. The trail leads to secret and deadly Max played very well by Vanessa Redgrave. The writing is the best of the series by a mile. Also, the cast assembled dwarfs the later sequels. Voight, Redgrave, Czerny, and Reno as the muscle end of Voight's double cross. If you are used to seeing Reno as a hero like in Ronin or even The Professional, you will be surprised how well he plays a very nasty villain. The movie does drag a bit in the middle, but it has a high speed train chase, at the end, that has to be seen to be believed. DePalma's camera angle signature: Hitch's God's eye camera is about the only recognizable aspect of DePalma's fingerprint style. Czerny, Ethan's boss, is convinced he sold the team down the river and tries to arrest him. It doesn't go well: you will never look at chewing gum the same again after this movie.It features the famous dangling from the ceiling at CIA headquarters that is worth buying the movie for. The scene has many close calls that are very suspenseful. When you watch it over, you will pick up more of what you missed the first time. It is true, the first showing you may lose a little of what is going on but that is why you should buy it. This is a many showing movie. DePalma has a very layered, intricate story but it is not 2001. By the second showing, you will know what is going on. Even on first viewing, it has several chases and action pieces. Vought is an excellent actor; it is a bit weird seeing the Icon of the TV show go double agent in the first movie but that is part of why it works so well. Rhames is very good in support. The mystery of who was the rat is so well written. It will surprise you the first time you see this.It is a fair criticism to say it lacks the action of Woo's second installment but it is more intelligent and way better acted. If you are only going to buy one of the series; start with this one. Then, I would skip 4 and 2: buy 3 next. This belongs in anyones movie library. Great Movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The decade of 90's has always been my favorite. Some incredible movies has also made it to the list of top 250. Although this one hasn't it remains to be one of the very good movies of that time. Well, so far i have seen all the for parts of this franchise and i have enjoyed all of them. Mission Impossible series has always been a lot of action with a decent story, so the intention of watching these movies are more to enjoy and less to think. However, the first part of this series, this one, really contradicts the other parts. MI1 has a really interesting story which when seen for the first time can be a little bit confusing due to the interesting twists in it. With actors like, Jean Reno, Jon Voight and Tom Cruise the performances are engaging and convincing to build up on a good script. The movie has very convincing action scenes especially considering it was made in 1996, and so i loved the action scene in the end which is on the roof top of the train. My favorite part is the piece of background score which begins when Ving Rhames asks Tom Cruise "You really think we can do it" on which Tom Cruise replies " We ARE going to do it"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one will never go out of style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could look long and hard, and never find a film more fun to watch than Mission:Impossible. It's classy, stylish, and heart-pounding.First, let me address the frequent complaints about an overly complex plot. This is not true: there are a few lines you shouldn't miss, but pay attention as you watch and you will be fine (i.e., don't wander off to get popcorn).Ethan Hunt is an American agent who has been framed and falsely accused of treason and the murder of his team. He strikes out to clear his name with a group of similarly disavowed agents. Together they must prove that Ethan was set up, and prevent a dangerous weapons dealer from accessing a list that would betray the identities of every American deep cover agent alive.The story is well constructed, without the typical action movie plot holes. The film is well balanced between action and dialog. But the best part of M:I is Ethan Hunt, whom Tom Cruise not only portrays, but lives and defines. A rare action hero with a brain, Ethan is quick, fit, savvy with both a computer and a gun. Driven and determined, he thinks quick on his feet and doesn't look back. But the most rare (and valuable) trait he possesses is his powerful magnetism and charisma: he makes you like him, and instead of coming across as arrogant, his confidence and assurance draw you to him.I almost never give a film a 10/10 rating, but Mission:Impossible is one of those rare films that gets every detail right. There's nothing to dislike, and everything to enjoy...highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spy thriller with a brain. Great way to start the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STORY: Mission: Impossible follows an espionage team known as the IMF (Impossible Missions Force), led by Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), who were on a mission in Prague to prevent a diplomat from the non-official covers list, which is a list of all the secret agents in Eastern Europe.When most of the colleagues in the team get killed, the mission had failed, and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) was the lone survivor after the mission had failed. After that, Hunt embarks on another mission to clear his name.MY THOUGHTS: Although I had never, ever watched the original TV show, I didn't know what to expect from this movie, when I first heard about it.After watching Mission: Impossible for the first time seven months ago, I thought this was a really enjoyable spy thriller.This is one of those movies where you must pay attention from beginning to end because there are some twists in there. If you don't pay enough attention, you'll be really confused on what's going on.I thought the plot twists in this movie were pretty shocking, and the direction by Brian De Palma was great. Also, there were only a few action sequences in this movie that were really gripping. Like the part on the train, I was on the edge of my seat during that scene, and when Tom Cruise is in the CIA headquarters retrieving a computer disk in a secured room with the help of Jean Reno and Ving Rhames, which I thought was really-well shot. I would call that scene as a rather quiet one, but it was still gripping.THE ACTING: Tom Cruise does a great job playing Ethan Hunt. It kind of bugs me that people are saying that Tom Cruise can't act to save a life. Well, try watching these movies, and you'll probably like him.Jon Voight did great as the leader of the IMF. Jean Reno and Ving Rhames were great as the two agents who helped Ethan on his mission.IN CONCLUSION: Mission: Impossible is a great start to the Mission: Impossible series, which it had really good twists, good acting, especially from Tom Cruise, great direction by Brian De Palma, and it had some great action sequences.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great! Definitely a five star movie. Four star at the lowest. Tom Cruise acted really well, it was exciting, and they didn't make it all killing, death, etc. This movie was exciting as it sounded, so there was no rip-off. However, I do think they could have created less talking, and more doing, so it would be very fun, and not exactly like the real thing in life. After all, it is fictional stuff. It's no real. It's not based on a true story. But besides that this movie was good. This movie has very little cuss words, which makes it more easier for more parents to saying yes to their kids on watching this awesome movie. This is a movie for the young and old who love action like this. I personally can not wait to get this on DVD, and I can not wait to see it's sequels, M:I-2, M:I-3, and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. You will want to do all the same. Enjoy this great movie that will always be a great spy classic for years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Mission: Impossible', directed by Brian De Palma, is an Entertaining &amp; Fast-Paced Action-Thriller. It manages to hold your interest, at most times and is truly worth a watch. 'Mission: Impossible' follows agent Ethan Hunt, and his mission to uncover the mole within the CIA who has framed him for the murders of his entire IMF team. 'Mission: Impossible' begins well and only gathers it's momentum in the process. Being an Action-Thriller, this Box-Office Blockbuster, offers the correct amount of thrills &amp; chills. The Screenplay by David Koepp &amp; Robert Towne is well-done. Brian De Palma's Direction, like always, is note-worthy. Cinematography by Stephen H. Burum, is striking. Editing is fair.Performance-Wise: Tom Cruise plays the Main Hero, most convincingly. Jon Voight is quite good. Jean Reno &amp; Ving Rhames, are impressive. Emmanuelle is noticeable. Vanessa Redgrave, Kristin Scott Thomas &amp; Ingeborga Dapkunaite appear in cameos. On the whole, A Winner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched much at all of the original show; I do know that this screws over the fans, and ruins stuff that they loved. Beyond that, it takes a different approach than the series. I guess it had to; the silver screen, you know. You can't do the same thing as on TV, it has to be bigger. Thus, this focuses on one person(not an entire team), and from early on in this, he's without the support of the IMF(were they *actually* called that before these? When did it start, anyway? Is there literally like, a supervisor sitting somewhere, deciding if a mission is quite impossible enough for them to handle?). All of that is really to be expected; if it turns you off to this, then so be it. I urge you to stick with your season sets, and not go for these. This has a complicated plot(with that said, you can follow it), perhaps to outdo the earlier stories. For a spy-thriller, this is quite good. It holds up pretty nicely, there are unpredictable twists, and the suspense is *excellent*. The famous "suspended from the ceiling" sequence *is* as great as you've heard. There is not an awful lot of shootouts or chases, but it is exciting, and the action is cool and well-done. This is a bit of a vehicle for Cruise, and he uses his charm in at least one scene that was probably written once he was cast. With that said, he does well. The characters are credible. Acting is masterful, with few exceptions. Elfman does marvelously, scoring this save for the classic theme. There is occasional moderate to strong language, and some bloody violence in this. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone into tense films that require you to pay attention. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clever, tense and fun summer thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mission: Impossible team is headed by Jim Phelps with point man Ethan Hunt. On one mission his whole team is wiped out in front of his eyes leaving him to only survivor. When he reaches his extraction point he finds that his ultimate boss, Kittridge is already in the town and that this mission was a mole hunt to discover who within Phelps's IMF team is a mole. Since Hunt is the only survivor they suspect him and he is forced on the run to discover the real mole. Using other disavowed agents Hunt contacts the mysterious Max and agrees a daring robbery of files from the CIA in order to set a trap for the mole.Brian De Palma's film version was rushed on us in a wave of hype ? the theme song itself sets the pulse racing a little quicker. The film needed to stand up to scrutiny. Happily the plot is good enough to get through the film. It is complex but is full of holes at times ? but it is enough to stop this being a dumb action movie. Instead it is well set up and has some nice twists and turns along the way.De Palma's direction is good. While he usually is strong in the big set pieces here he manages to do well with them and with the smaller tense settings. The sets are always good and the whole film has a good feel to it. The action scenes only resort to flashy OTT effects towards the end and the most of it is much better tense operations which are much more enjoyable.Although the film isn't great it's clever enough and enjoyable enough to rise above the level of the usual summer movie. Cruise is really good here ? all charm, smiles and determination. Rhames is always good value ? as is Reno. In fact the whole cast do well and hold some pleasant surprises such as a very flirty Vanessa Redgrave.The weakness of this film is in the marketing ? in the original trailer we are shown the money shot of the film. Why?! It was annoying the first time I saw it to see that I'd already seen `the end' months before it had come out! But this is a minor complaint.Overall this isn't a classic but it feels very slick and has a pretty good plot. De Palma's direction is strong whether it be the slanting angles of Hunt's confrontation with Kittridge or the tense robbery of the CIA and the action scenes are worth watching. Wisely, when the film hits a weak point it just turns on the theme music and everything's better again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's too bad the sequel sucked?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible is a great action film. Tom Cruise delivers a great performance as the famous Ethan Hunt, and the technological toys that he has in this film rival many of the toys seen in the James Bond films, very few of which are as good as this film. The story is very interesting, but is also hard to follow at some points. However, the end of the film actually goes back to recap what has happened, pointing out some things that you were almost guaranteed to have missed on the first viewing, and this retelling is flawlessly worked into the movie, so it's not like being told all over again what you have already seen. What makes this movie so good is that the mystery is so well presented, and all of the performances are very good. It's true that a lot of the situations were fairly unrealistic (I don't think I even need to mention the fact that it is physically impossible to fly a helicopter in a tunnel), but the quality of the rest of the film more than makes up for these shortcomings. At least the movie wasn't manipulative. It's not excessively gory, there isn't unnecessary violence, there's no goofball romance, and the twists and turns are unexpected and very effective. And, most importantly, there is a brilliantly written script, with endlessly amusing lines like, `I want him manning a radar tower in Alaska by the end of the day, just mail him his clothes.' Why can't there be more movies with cool lines like that? James Bond sure as hell never uttered anything that clever.Some of the action sequences in Mission: Impossible have become famous, such as the nail-biting break-in scene where Hunt is hanging over the glowing floor in the room protected by the world's greatest alarm system, as well as the less effective helicopter tunnel scene. As a whole, this is a very high quality action film. It does have a few problems, but the rest of the film is so good that you are able to easily overlook them.</fullReview>

It starts with an exciting build-up set in Prague and doesn't become dull at any point, thanks to the complexity of the plot. The most impressive and memorable part of the film is undoubtly the incredibly tense and elaborate scene in which Tom Cruise breaks into the computer room.

Yes, this film was complicated, but to those of us who could follow the plot, it was enthralling. If you didn't like it, it's because you didn't understand it (although many don't want to admit this).

		<fullReview>With all the talk going on about Mission Impossible 2 I watched this one again (for the 2nd time) yesterday as a warm ? up (Mission Impossible 2 is due here next month) and I must say I liked it pretty much.I was one of those folks who went to see this flick in the cinema, almost 4 years ago and I must say, I was pretty much disappointed. The Trailer had somehow made me believe that this was a high ? speed action vehicle in the likes of a Die Hard with a bit of a Bond twist. This was not it. It was even more James Bond than James Bond, as referring to the spy stuff and that I did not like at all. I expected a sort of Goldeneye ? like movie (as much action anyway and as much spy stuff). By the way, why is it Mission: Impossible and not Gadgets: Impossible? Or Events: Impossible? I mean this could be a Die Hard, Die Hard 4: Die Impossibly Hard. But I do not tend to rate movies on their believability, or why else would I love, Lethal Weapon 3, Die Hard 1+3, Goldeneye, The World is not Enough and so on.But hey that was 4 years ago, what did I think this time? Well, it was pretty good. There was a good story, which was at times a bit complicated, but you could follow and there were a few tense and exciting scenes. Yet there was not nearly as much action as in the Mission Impossible 2 Trailer. But that is not so bad after all.The actors all were OK, except one and I do not mean Cruise here, for I don't like him that much anyway. He is too much of a smoothie and he is much too slick for my feeling (please no hate-mail). The best one was VING RHAMES, yes him, he is a very talented actor and one who can always make me smile and laugh. He has got an incredible way of letting his face ?speak' in some way and he always seems to be a jolly and nice guy in this one. Yet he can be mean and dangerous (as in Con Air).Despite all that I was not excited all the time and on the edge of my seat. Sometimes there was too much talking and stuff involved and yet sometimes actors had funny lines, there was too much talking. Don't get me wrong, but I prefer Goldeneye to this one, you now with the standard Bond formula which includes: wits, action, exotic locations and very pretty female companions. This was: spy stuff, talk, plot and twists.Still 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly great movie. Mission: Impossible actually has action, characterization, and a compelling plot. Every time I watch this movie, I figure out something new about the story, which makes you appreciate just how deep and complex it is. But by the end, everything falls into place. The twists, revelations, and plot developments will keep you on the edge of your seat. On top of all that, it has this mindblowing climax. Just an awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the complicated plot, which I just about managed to get, this is a brilliant action movie . The 2 hours goes very quickly and at not one part was I bored. The action scenes kept me on the edge of my seat and I thought the cast was excellent, especially Ving Rhames, Jon Voight and an uncredited cameo by Emilio Estevez.Along with Die Hard with a Vengeance, Speed and Face/Off one of the best action movies of the 90's. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I was pretty confused and I had to see it a couple more times before I understood it all. Many critics hated Mission: Impossible because of this. I liked that it was very complicated, it added to the mystery. I think the part in the CIA terminal room is classic, very exciting. This is one of Brian De Palma's best. He throws lots of surprises at you. Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames are always good together and I liked Emilio Estevez's part. *** 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although many people said they couldn't figure this movie out, yet it's pretty easy to follow, if you pay attention. I will not discuss the plot here as it is better to watch the film. The film is a fast paced spy film with lot's of neat gadgets and near impossible feats. Hence; Mission: Impossible.Tom Cruise is very good in the film as is everyone else, but especially Henry Czerny. That guy rocks. Brian DePalma's fantastic direction is also another reason to see this film. Off angles and bizarre camera work highlight this film.I have also seen the original tv series, so I do have a base to compare this film to. Although different, it's still a great film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission Possible: Turn "Mission Impossible" into a Tom Cruise film franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILER) Going for a theme today by reviewing star vehicles utilising previous source material (eg: a comic, or TV series), as this is more a Tom Cruise movie than an actual interpretation of the TV series. The fact Brian De Palma twisted Jim Phelps' (Jon Voight) character in the movie had some fans up in arms. Now that the films have progressed to three ventures of the Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) centric spy series, this is probably the best film out of the three Tom Cruise driven vehicles. It's also the most surprising and memorable of the three, particularly with Cruise floating above lasers and was good introduction to Ethan Hunt's background, and of the film series for non-fans of the original television series. I, too, was annoyed at the treatment of Jim Phelps, but now the films are just using the "Mission Impossible" to sell a Tom Cruise vehicle in playing Ethan Hunt- then this is the best one out of the three in hindsight, which is not really saying much. Great supporting cast include Ving Rhames, Jon Voight, Kristen Scott Thomas, Emilio Estevez. Nowhere near Brian De Palma's best directorial work, but nowhere near his worst either! If you haven't seen this film, you might as well check it out! *** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's disgusting Tom Cruise turned a clever, fun, ensemble show into yet another big effect vehicle for his mammoth ego. I could hardly believe my eyes when in the first few minutes Cruise (his movie, I hold him responsible) kills off his entire team (which consists by and large of far more talented actors) just so he can do his lone wolf vengeance thing ("this time it's personal!"). In those few minutes, he destroyed any relationship the movie had to the show. It's a disgrace. I've never liked Tom Cruise, but his astonishingly arrogant appropriation and destruction of the Mission:Impossible theme is a new low.Aside from this, the movie itself is utterly formulaic, uniting the implausible with the predictable. Jean Reno is good in anything, but no one can save this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of spyflicks &amp; series and I was happy when I learned that M.I. was to be made but to me it was a complete betrayal of the entire series that Jim Phelps turned traitor. We have followed him from when he formed the unit &amp; his fatherly caring for his fellow agents, I feel that it was totally wrong &amp; outside the character for his betrayal of IMF &amp; his country. A way for the makers of the movie franchise to redeem themselves was to make a new movie in which it turns out that the Phelps that was killed in M.I. in fact was an infiltrator and that the real Phelps had been held captured thus the new mission was to rescue him and destroy his captors plans to implement their own perverted version of IMF. If Phelps was killed it really didn't matter as long as he was still a hero. He might die saving Hunts life thus there would be no conflict with a returning IMF leader. I give this only 5 stars out of 10 due to the betrayal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very much disappointed by this flat action movie and its predictable ending. I am a fan of the old Mission:Impossible series of the 60s and 80s and therefore I think the plot is ridiculous at best. Why should Jim Phelps do what he did? He was always loyal through the many episodes of the series and there he could have gotten much more money if he had betrayed his team.The reason why Peter Graves (Jim Phelps) did not star in this movie is because he did not agree with what I have just said.Anyway this movie is NOT for fans of the series because there is nothing left of the teamwork spirit of the series. It is a one man show for Tom Cruise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malnourished, convoluted, with a couple of decent set-pieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcockian director Brian De Palma dips his hand into the action genre with this malnourished thriller, which, as is the case with many recent blockbusters, is all style over substance. The plot is little more than an excuse to string together a series of familiar action set pieces, none of which will cause the viewer to raise an eyebrow - unless it is at the outlandish activity which occurs at the film's finale. While some may enjoy the many twists and turns as double-faced characters betray each other, it just served to give me a headache. I was partially distracted while watching the film (through no fault of my own, I hasten to add), and this made it difficult to understand the various character's motivations, and especially who exactly was the main villain at the end of the piece. This is definitely one film which is too clever for it's own good.A familiar cast of faces fill out various roles, but hardly any of the actors and actresses are given much to do except mutter meaningful dialogue. Tom Cruise is an able action man, but he is just that: a muscular figure with little or no personality whatsoever. And no charisma. I liked Cruise in EYES WIDE SHUT, but his blank performance here left me cold. Jon Voight enjoys himself in a two-faced, villainous role, but again is given little to do apart from smile or sneer when the film requires him to. Probably the actor who comes off best here is Ving Rhames, playing a character who is never too serious and quite likable. Jean Reno is a good face to have in the cast too, but to my despair I found he was playing a villain and thus dies spectacularly at the end. For the female roles, Kristen Scott Thomas appears briefly at the beginning before thankfully dying: I was glad to see her go, as I can't stand this actress. Emmanuelle Beaurt lends some much-needed class to the proceedings, but her role is almost totally thankless and she hardly appears at all.Amid the fun (if expected) trappings of clever, hi-tech devices and traps (such as explosive chewing gum), there are a handful of action scenes on which the film concentrates. Firstly, the opening scene where Cruise finds his team massacred one by one is well executed, conveying well the despair Cruise feels as time after time he arrives too late to see one of his colleagues die. The set piece of the film occurs when Cruise and his cronies break into a sealed vault to steal information, this is an excellently-crafted moment which sustains the tension right up until the very end. Probably the best bit of the film. The final moments with the helicopter and train chase are fun too, even if they are a bit preposterous and slightly bend the laws of dynamics and movement (you'll know the moment I mean). All in all, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is something of a hollow exercise, but with enough exciting moments to keep it mildly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never gave "Mission Impossible" much consideration twenty years ago (I guess I wasn't yet sold on Tom Cruise) and instead took to the later entries as pure action movies. Truth is, it's a pretty cool movie, working mostly on style and convoluted plot twists. The spycraft is more emphasized here (although that's really in the service of the big set pieces (a gripping vault caper and insane helicopter/train scene). Still, it's the little things that pop; who'da thought Ving Rhames sitting alone at a laptop would yield so much charm? As paranoid espionage goes, it holds up pretty well.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With this Tom Cruise became an action star.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission Impossible, just that ,the first of this franchise which took Tom Cruise of his dramatic roles and make him a believable action star and to say the truth is very well made and its scenes are so memorable that in every movie they have been redone and other movies have copy ,make a reference or parody them. So with the mission impossible six being announce and in pre production and with been twenty years after its release, I though it was high time to review this flick.To start does it hold up with the standards of the action movies nowadays? Yes, definitely and it is even better than a lot of them and even some superhero movies(superhero movies don't count as action flicks). The reason for that is not only it set the stage for spy movies to be more adrenaline fueled and give us spies who aren't just a copy of James Bond, but also it renewed the running man formula, that Harrison Ford made with the Indiana Jones, for real with so much running no wander why Tom Cruise look so young!One more thing is that the story isn't over the top but some what grounded in this world and so despite the lower stakes, the danger is more personal and show you get invested to the characters, who are also very well written and portrayed. In short although it hasn't the greatness of the Golden Eye, which came out one year earlier, I believe that it has a greater impact in cinema than this, just ask any regular film goer and he or she is more likely to have seen Mission Impossible than Golden Eye.Bonus fact the jokes for it are freaking hilarious like : " Franchise Unkillable" ,"We will continue seeing sequel, up until Tom Cruise quiets", " Cardio Cruising" and so on!! ha ha ha!In the end Ithan Hunt is a great alternative for James Bond( or even his son for as we know 007 had a weakness for women) and don't say thinks like "Is just a copy of 007" for it isn't, like Bourne after words ,just continues the spy tradition and it doesn't make spies around the world feel shame for their work.</fullReview>

This movie falls into the later group. I never thought Mr. Cruise would do much with this genre, but I have to do a major retraction...right now, he is my preferred action star. Ethan Hunt starts this series out right. From the first Mission Impossible movie onward, they have just improved. This is an excellent beginning. I understand people might have been looking for 'Paris', or a Barbara Bain Martin Landau type mix...I know I was. And I will admit that I kind of wanted to see a reboot of the old players, but gone are Barney, Willie, Mr. Phelps and the gang. It didn't take long to adjust to the new version. The action, direction and pace are outstanding. Tom Cruise and cast makes this a gem worthy of multiple views. I highly recommend this movie along with future installments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ending needs work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Cruise always brings his best in any action role he plays, and this is no exception. This is the start of a great franchise. Unfortunately the final act is more than disappointing, its ridiculous. It ruins the entire tone of the film. It involves far too many betrayals, randomly appearing skin masks, and an over-the- top, unsatisfying action sequence. Like all action films it ends with a fight scene. But this one just doesn't have enough weight to be enjoyable. It involves a helicopter following a train through the tunnel connecting Britain to France. How a pilot would ever be able to avoid crashing is god's work. And overall the way Ethan Hunt (Cruise) deals with the bad guys is annoyingly too linear. He sticks a 'chewing gum bomb' onto the front of the helicopter jumps towards the train before it blows up, propelling him safely on board whilst his enemies burn to a crisp behind him. I wish the film had a more intelligent ending. Because despite the bewilderingly convoluted story it is a clever film. Mine (and most peoples) favourite scene, has Cruise suspending from a wire, whilst breaking into the most highly guarded building in Langley, Virginia (guess which place that is). That scene has everything, tension, humour, ingenuity and strong performances. There's two reasons I didn't give this film I higher score, 1. The ending is, by definition, impossible (maybe that's what they were going for, but I still find it a mistake), and 2. The plot is overly complicated (which trying to make intelligent) ends up being rather stupid. However, its still an enjoyable 110 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebooting done right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fast-paced thrill ride is a master-class in how to revive, extend and enhance a fondly remembered (if slightly cheesy) property that, in lesser hands, might have seemed time worn. Director Brian De Palma evokes espionage classics like "The Third Man" to lend some -- but not too much -- flair to a twisty narrative full of double- crosses that the story and screenplay writers manage to render coherently. It has aged unusually well for a story that relies so heavily on what was supposed to be cutting-edge technology in the mid-1990s, with only the rendering of Internet communications looking silly (that email address!). The concluding action set- piece, which was one of the first to depict the newly opened "Chunnel," strains credulity still, as it did at the time, but packs a punch nevertheless. The cast is at least serviceable -- Tom Cruise and Vanessa Redgrave really sparkle in their scenes together, Emmanuelle Béart is flat, and everyone else does what they need to do to maintain the story's tension. Danny Elfman's score, thank goodness, makes extensive use of one of the greatest themes in TV history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting but slow mission.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part One in the Mission Impossible trilogy is a steady-paced action movie with lots of talking. There is really no action in the story until a good three quarters in the movie, where Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes on his impossible mission in a high-security computer room at CIA Headquarters to copy a top secret coverts agents list. That scene was an edge-of-your-seat experience.Much of the movie relied on the dialog, suspense and drama surrounding the Impossible Mission Force's (IMF) suspicion of Hunt's disloyalty to the organization and his mission in exposing the real spy and preventing the theft of classified material.As mentioned above, the mission scene was an exciting one, but much of the plot suffers from a slow pace and somewhat mediocre acting (literally with every character), which doesn't help in making the movie more suspenseful or intriguing. It's really a lot of all-talk and no action.The overall story is interesting and there are some plot twists and unpredictable moments. However, some more action and better acting would have been better.Grade C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that started this idiosyncratic spy franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: This review contains major SPOILERS, do not read if you've never seen this film but would like to. The first film in the Tom Cruise produced/starring "Mission: Impossible" film series is still one of the best in the franchise. Though a huge box office success when released in 1996, the film was (I would argue) misunderstood and unfairly maligned by contemporary critics. The 90s were a period where adaptations of old TV series started to become en vogue. Most were more parodies of their source material than adaptations (The Flinstones, The Brady Bunch, and The Adams Family spring immediately to mind). Mission: Impossible doesn't so much parody it's source material as flip it's middle finger at it. It's perhaps one of the most irreverent adaptations of anything I have ever seen, to the point where it's not clear who the target audience was. Criticized during it's initial release for a convoluted and hard-to-follow plot, revisiting the 60s' TV series is perhaps the best way to understand what the writers were going for here. See? Most Mission: Impossible episodes involved the Impossible Missions Forces team leader, Jim Phelps, learning the details of his latest mission, assembling his ensemble team of spies, and thwarting an enemy through disguise (with life-like face masks being a preferred method) and misdirection. The series was an ensemble, held together by Mr. Phelps but anchored by the idea of teamwork. As the film opens, Phelps learns that someone is planning to steal a disc containing the names of all the IMF's undercover operatives and sell it to an arms dealer. His mission, should he choose to accept it, is to replace the list with a fake one, and photograph this enemy agent committing the crime so he can be brought to justice. His team is assembled, and the mission is a go.So far, so faithful. But that's when things take a turn. Unlike in the TV series of the same name, the mission does not go as planned. Most of the IMF agents on the case are brutally murdered during the operation, leaving only Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, and Phelps wife Claire alive. A smarmy CIA agent named Kitridge (Henry Czenry) reveals the thief was a plant, and that the real objective was to uncover a mole in the IMF. Since at this point in the story the only known survivor is Hunt, he is believed by the CIA to be the mole. Hunt escapes his meeting with Kitridge, and the story takes off in earnest. This is where the film (and it's first 3 sequels) reveal their true motivations: to create a star vehicle for two people?Tom Cruise and Brian De Palma (or whichever director was hired). The trappings of the TV series are little more than a gateway to what is in many ways unmistakably a Brian De Palma film, filled with double crosses, murder, some strange sexual politics, and much mystery and noirish atmosphere. Jim Phelps, the hero of the TV series, is later revealed to have survived the opening operation and is in fact the villain of the film adaptation. Most of Hunt's second team (other than Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell) are revealed to be turncoats, leaving Tom Cruise to save the day all by himself atop a speeding train in a scene that doesn't hold up very well 20 years later. What are fans of the TV series to make of this? The film was deeply unpopular with them on its initial release, and later sequels wouldn't so much subvert the trappings of the TV series the way this film does, as just ignore them. The point of this film is to be a starring action vehicle for Tom Cruise, with De Palma making the type of neo-noir he is mostly known for, using the TV series only as a vessel to do what he typically does. Using the "Mission: Impossible" name for a director to stamp his auteurist sensibilities all over it would become the hallmark of this series for it's first four installments.Despite alienating the show's fan base, this film actually works exceptionally well at what it sets out to do. The film looks gorgeous, bathed in shadows and old world architecture. The plot twists are enjoyably outrageous. The performances are largely good, and Cruise gets to shine in what would become known as his "Teflon franchise", which has managed to stay successful even after his star power self-destructed on Oprah's couch in 5 seconds. The film is also worth commending for having a script where the writers actually seemed to care about the story. This is where my criticism of its initial critics comes into play, and I noticed I'm not the only one who's taken to IMDb to point this out. Despite being maligned as convoluted and muddled (the film was actually nominated for a razzie award for worst adapted screenplay), the film deserves credit for assuming you'll be smart enough to figure out what's going on without overexplaining the action. It also deserves much credit for subverting it's source material to such an extreme degree. No, it's not muddled, you simply need to pay attention. How nice that in 1996 a summer blockbuster assumed you wouldn't turn your brain off while watching. How nice a film based on a well known property didn't pander to it's fans, but subverted their every expectation. That's rather rare these days, and now our multiplexes are filled with ginormous budgeted schlock who's plots are, well, muddled, and filled with cheap "fan service". David Koepp and Robert Townsend wrote a smart script and were unfairly maligned for it. In the end, this film was the starting point for a series that took at least 15 years to truly find it's footing and hit it's stride. But it's a great start, and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many will be surprised that I am reviewing this film, especially twenty years after it was released, but it was Directed by the legendary, Brian De Palma, making it a must see for me. In general, I find these huge franchise films to be fun, some are better than others, but that's usually based on the writing and the cast. In watching the first of the Mission: Impossible films, my expectations were very high, and while Tom Cruise didn't disappoint, Brian De Palma certainly did. The king of mystery could have developed a better story than this. The action sequences were impressive and the special effects were way over the top, but I still felt the story could have been developed a lot more. Maybe being the first film in an eventual franchise, producers wanted to give the series as much action and explosions as possible. If that was the case, they should have called Michael Bay, this film has all the makings of one of his films, not a De Palma film. That being said, the bottom line is that first mission is exactly what you'd expect it to be. Student replacing teacher, in a film that's one chase and fire fight after another. It was entertaining, but not something that requires a whole lot of thinking.</fullReview>

They told me they fell asleep during it. I finally watched the movie myself when I was 13, and I must say, I can see why.This movie is mostly just a snooze-fest. The plot is very convoluted with a very predictable twist and the slow pace makes it even harder to get into. The lack of action for most of the running time also makes it really boring.It really takes off in the final 10 minutes, however. The climax on the train is as exciting as it gets and practically redeems the entire film.Tom Cruise was good as Ethan Hunt. He certainly knows how to be the man of action. Many the supporting performances are also good. It's just a shame they didn't have a more coherent script to work with.Overall, I was extremely disappointed.

For example Tom Cruise dangling on a wire in a vault. Also the ending scenes with the chase, was very tense and made me sit on the edge of my seat which is very rare for me, it just makes you want them to succeed at the end, and you can really feel what each of the characters are going through, which in my opinion is key to a great movie. After watching this movie it just makes me want to watch the next one and the one after that as if it can live up to this movie they will be just as good.

		<shortDescription>More To Like About This Movie Aside From The Obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can never quite figure out what makes "Mission Impossible" such a film that attracts me like it does. From the other viewers out there, the scenes that they're pining over the most include the break-in at the CIA headquarters and the chase scene at the Chunnel. These fans think that those two scenes are the reasons for seeing this movie. And though they are correct in that perspective that they are memorable scenes, but that's not the only reasons why I like "Mission Impossible". In fact there are far more better reasons why I like this movie a lot. Why do I enjoy this movie so much you may ask? Well for starters let's start with the leading character Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). Unlike James Bond, Hunt refrains from being a spontaneous trigger-happy spy, who boozes on martini's and sleeps around with any female cohort who aligns with him. In this movie, he only handles a gun just one time, but never opens fire with it. It's a shame that John Woo who took over as a direction after this one had to go in that direction in the sequel. The top dog in the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) Ethan's fight plans are smart and methodical rather than casual and slick. He doesn't just randomly kills people one by one. Another characteristic I found so attached to Ethan Hunt was his decency towards female co-workers like Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart) who goes as far as respects the fact that she is a married lady who happens to be married to his boss Jim Phelps (Jon Voight). In fact this spy movie doesn't have any sexual activity provided in this movie which makes it all the more refreshing. And these idiosyncrasies plus the precarious situation he's been put in, Ethan Hunt succeeds in being a relatively likable character. I'm only just observing the heart of the movie.Many people have blasted this film for being overbearingly convoluted, but that's a misnomer. If you have meagre attention spans, you may not like a film of this magnitude or those who were expecting a plethora of exciting flashy thrills or action effects. The film's intentions are for us as a viewer to be involved with the character/s and follow through within each scene. All the scenes, set-pieces and props all flow in a very immaculate perspective. Being antsy to watch something wow will likely never happen here. You feel like part of the action with Ethan and when things start to unfold, you'll react just like the way Ethan does.What were my favourite scenes in "Mission Impossible"? Well as much as I agree with the Chunnel chase as being very exciting, I thought the best scenes were his interactions with Phelps in the final scenes. "It was Kittredge". Phelps was so convincing, and we all know Ethan knows that's far from the truth. We see him summarizing all the events from the Prague mission in his mind. It's not that easy to contradict someone like Phelps because he's Ethan's superior. Then he asks this esoteric question, "Why..Jim Why"? Which translates to "Why would Kittridge do it, when really the question is why would YOU do it?"It's the more deeper content of "Mission Impossible" that make this movie all the more special. This movie is not the "all style and no substance" that most viewers have complained about. But to hell with them, I won't let them deprive me from enjoying it. Even after 20 years, this movie never gets old. If anyone wishes to disagree with me feel free, but your opinions will not change my opinion about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Departs significantly from its inspiration but still provides some thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian de Palma's adaptation of "Mission: Impossible" marked the beginning of a hugely successful franchise that's still going strong almost twenty years later. More of a Tom Cruise vehicle than a faithful adaptation of the highly regarded ensemble TV show, this 'Mission' was brought up to date with the latest (now, somewhat quaint) technology.The connection to the TV show is tenuous, since only one character features in both and, even then, the characterization is completely different. One could argue that this was an ingenious way of defying expectations but others (myself included) might counter that the movie may as well not have been an adaptation to begin with. That being said, despite initially veering off into a completely different direction, we do eventually get a legitimate 'impossible' mission in the spirit of the TV show.Tom Cruise is the undisputed star of the picture and he does a decent job, though this is definitely more of a showcase for Tom Cruise, movie star, rather than Tom Cruise, actor. Meanwhile, Jon Voight is always a welcome presence in any film and Vanessa Redgrave proved to be an astute casting choice. The various team members are generally well chosen; however, the least interesting character (played by Emmanuelle Beart) gets the most screen time.Brian de Palma's direction is as expertly handled as always and he produced at least one iconic scene (ie. the heist at CIA headquarters). The action set-pieces are well done, though the climax is wildly over the top. The music wisely re-uses (and revitalizes) the TV show's memorable theme.All in all, "Mission: Impossible" is fairly enjoyable but, for large chunks of the movie, there's a nagging feeling that the filmmakers have strayed too far from their inspiration. I've only seen one of the sequels, so I can't really compare them but this first outing is an adequately entertaining popcorn movie, if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>eh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this movie, I was excited because it looked really entertaining. You got Tom Cruise and Jon Voight, some cool action, it looked pretty entertaining. What really got my attention, unfortunately, was the backlash that it got from actors of the original series, with one walking out of the theater and still proclaimed it as a terrible movie until his death. This...this should be fun.There is one way to describe the effects of this movie: dated. Really, really dated. The effects, especially during the train sequence don't look good or convincing today. Plus, I'm convinced that the IMF is either blind or stupid. The whole movie is set off due to one plot point about the leadr (Voight)getting killed, though we later found out he did it himself. I think everyone in the audience could tell that his hand was curved. Who are you fooling, really?With that said, I will give it credit that Cruise was really good in this (even though he looked like Wynona Rider from Alien Resurrection) and the one scene that everyone remembers (the highwire scene) is DEFINITELY the coolest. No effects were used and to this day, it will still make you clench your buttcheeks and pause your breathing. In other words, it was really awesome.Bottom line, while there are some really cool things in here, this movie is kinda...eh. Not good or bad...just eh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A suspenseful film with a premise that keeps you interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie for the first time on DVD back in 2006 and really enjoy it. As time goes by, I wasn't sure if this movie would still hold up after looking up everyone's thoughts on the movie, especially the Jim Phelps twist that everyone hates. So I watched it, and I really don't think it was that bad. So the premise of the film is about Ethan Hunt, our main hero, who goes undercover to find out who has framed not only himself, but his team that were killed during their mission. While figuring it out, he also recruits some new team members while teaming up with Jim Phelps' wife Claire as they try to retrieve the IMF NOC list. So, basically, it plays out like a mystery movie as Ethan Hunt has to figure on who did this and why; its not really much of an action movie but I think the movie works on its own level as it plays very low key or a bit in your own opinion of the movie. Also, I have read that some of the original cast members of the original show and die hard fans were very upset that they made Jim Phelps the bad guy. I don't know if its actually a big deal, or what were they expecting for the movie as it first came out but I do know is that I have never watched the show nor have any knowledge to it whatsoever. Furthermore, I wasn't as upset as what the live action "Scooby Doo" movie did when they made Scrappy Doo the bad guy. So I guess you can say that I'm okay with Jim Phelps for being the bad guy, and I thought Jon Voight's performance was really good. The rest of the cast all did fine on their own, and I do say that Tom Cruise who is really good and also being awesome at the same time. I thought the direction that Brian De Palma did was incredibly well done. I really do admire the premise of the movie, and I do find it very Hitchcockian as it keeps you interest to know what is going on. The movie does have some very good suspenseful parts like the scene where Ethan Hunt is being hung on cables as they try to retrieve the list. I love Danny Elfman's music of the movie, and his arrangements of the "Mission: Impossible" theme. The final scene of the movie was alright because I kind of which if the helicopter wasn't CG so that it wouldn't had to be in a tunnel. There were parts that are real, while other parts were not. I guess they were trying to be safe, because it is understandable that using helicopters in movies can be dangerous but it is for what it is. The movie does have some good stunt work, but its Tom Cruise who is actually doing it all by himself. Some of the actors, were just replace with doubles as like what I just said about the final scene is just playing safe. When I look back at the sequels, I'm sure they do better than what this movie as when they are parts that took risks, while others not. I still respect this movie for being low key, but that is just my opinion. So, yeah, I actually still love "Mission: Impossible" and I don't think it was as bad as some of the negativity that I've read. It is a suspenseful film with a premise that keeps you interest. I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Changing World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there a place for time proved methods and principles in today's society? This is a message that is part of the subtext of Mission: Impossible. The film deals with a changing world and how people cannot always change with the world around them. Sometimes the decisions that have to be made lead people to new careers while some people are able to adapt to the changing world within their lives.Over time Mission: Impossible has held up to be a successful example of a film adaption of a television series. Though the production of this film was troubled in finding it's direction and focus. Once Brian De Palma was brought on as director, he was able to alleviate these issues. The production team was able to take a concept and vague character profiles from the television series from the 1960s and translate into an engaging espionage thriller.The story follows an American espionage agent (Tom Cruise) who is framed after his team is killed during a mission. He has to unravel the plot against him and prove his innocence without the support of his government. The film also features Jon Voight, Vanessa Redgrave, Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Kirsten Scott Thomas and Emilio Estevez. The film's plot is in constant motion. It does not stagnate for long and the film does not stop telling the story to hold the viewer's hand to keep up with the plot twists.This film was the first time that Tom Cruise displayed his action star potential. It not only solidified him as an A-list actor but also someone who could be the forerunner for a franchise. He had to display a different range of acting, as at the time a movie such as this was unexplored territory for him; as well as learn to develop physical abilities for his roles which has continued to the present day.. While the direction of the franchise has been doubted throughout it's course this installment set it on it's path.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission: Succeeded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time where a lot of classic TV shows were being given weak cinematic remakes ("The Flintstones", "The Beverly Hillbillies" etc.), Mission Impossible overcame this negative trend by bringing in Brian De Palma do his own take of the series. With the gadgets of a Bond movie, the pacing of a Hitchcockian thriller, and the stunt work of a great American action movie, De Palma was able to breath new life into a classic show and begun one of the most enduring film franchises in recent memory. It stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, a professional spy, who along with his team accept a mission to retrieve an important file and catch the enemy agent who is attempting to steal it. But things begin to go gravely wrong, with Ethan seemingly left as the lone survivor. After this Ethan is suspected of being a double agent and goes on the run from his own agency, setting out to find the real culprit using whatever methods necessary to clear his name.Rather than going the route of more recent spy flicks like "Kingsman: The Secret Service" that parodies the spy genre, "Mission: Impossible" does the exact opposite. Instead it indulges in all the clichés, with elaborate disguises, high tech gadgets, high octane explosions, double crosses, and many surprise twists. Although one problem with these twists is it's quite easy to poke holes in them, since they're often done with no foreshadowing and there's little logic behind the characters plans. But this never really matters, for this is a film that lives in the moment. These twists mostly exist to draw us further into the nail biting tension and succeed at doing so.In spite of De Palma arguably being best known for his iconic shootouts, such as the ending of "Scarface" or "The Untouchables" stair sequence, here our lead never fires a single gun. Instead of using standard action shoot ups or fist brawls, the film delivers tension with 3 unique action sequences: the opening infiltration of the ball room; the vault heist dangling from a wire on the ceiling in the middle of the film; and the final chase involving a helicopter following a high speed train into a tunnel. The ballroom sequence works as a brilliant introduction to this world of spies. We see the cool gadgets, their detailed plans and how similar to other great spies like Bond they keep a sharp wit whilst they do it. At the same time the scene remains unpredictable, with so many things going wrong that it's really uncertain of who will get out alive. Then comes the iconic vault heist where Hunt dangles from wires to steal data from a heavily secured vault. This scene has to stand as one of Palma's greatest contributions to cinema. It may take influence from other great heists like Jules Dassin's "Riffi", Palma still adds his own unique take on the concept. Largely by bringing so many great elements together in the scene with slow pacing, great stunt work from Cruise and the way that the scene juggles so many risks from the worker who could walk in at any moment to the sweat dripping from Hunt's head. Unfortunately the final sequence does not live up to the previous two. The basic concept is cool, with Cruise chasing the villains on top of a speeding train whilst a helicopter chases, but unfortunately it falls flat due to execution. Obviously with a scene like this CGI is a necessity, for actually having a helicopter following a train into a tunnel really would be impossible. But 90's effects just weren't ready to portray a sequence like this authentically. Also whilst the concept of a chase on a speeding train is great, adding in a helicopter just seems like overkill and draws attention to the scenes lack of realism in contrast to the previous tone of the film. Although even with this the chase is still entertaining on a basic level, but just fails to deliver the same tension of previous scenes. Besides this it's far from ruining the brilliance that preceded it, with Palma's brilliant execution mixed with the excitement of a great spy thriller allows "Mission: Impossible" to overcome all the usual expectations of a typical action movie, and is a heck of a lot of fun because of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm giving the Missions another chance. Besides 4, I really disliked them last time I had a viewing. But I want to like this action franchise so here I go. Watching MI again, it wasn't as bad as I remember. Reminded me a lot of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. It's more of a espionage drama than a shoot out. It's also amazing to see how far this series has come over 19 years. The wire scene is still tense as ever and the final train battle is pretty cool. Ving Rhames is the tech guy which is really weird now since Simon Pegg is the tech guy. Watching them all go crazy over a floppy disc is funny. Tom fell right into the roll of Ethan which fits him perfectly. The film slows down in some parts but overall it's a solid action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came out of Rogue Nation thinking "damn that was good but I think the original is still in the classic". Rewatching this now, I certainly think its the classic but by no means is it the best. There are plot holes in this movie that an aeroplane with Tom Cruise strapped to the side could fly through.Brian DePalma has a great style of directing this film. If I ranked the top 10 Mission Impossible franchise's best scenes, I think over half would be in this movie. Its tastefully understated in many places - not too over the top, and so much the better for it. No major gun battles in this film.Case in point, the film's iconic scene in the vault. Its so quiet the film could almost be a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The cinematography as Cruise is lowered into the vault, and Rhames whispering hoarsely and nervously sets the mood perfectly. I almost died three times watching this scene - things as simple as a rat, a bead of sweat, and someone taking a pill could create so much adrenalin-fueled stress. DePalma moves all of his pieces skilfully into position to create maximum impact. I also give kudos to DePalma casting Academy Award nominee Kristen Scott Thomas and teen hearthrob Emilio Estevez in roles that were quickly killed off. The problem with movies these days is top billing of major stars is usually enough to spoil a movie - "boy, I wonder if Samuel L. Jackson is going to die in Captain America 2". Here, killing off Thomas and Estevez made second billed Voight's perishing believable - and his return later in the movie more shocking.I found Tom Cruise solid in this movie - he's not the best part of it like he is in other films, but he's a solid anchor for the rest of the cast. Jon Voight is solid where the screenplay lets him be - see one scene where Phelps turns to face Hunt and approaches him like a zombie (with Hunt appropriately freaking out) only for him to give a racking cough. The cough breaks the tension and confirms that he's alive. I loved that scene a lot. Ving Rhames, Vanessa Redgrave and surprisingly Henry Czerny steal every scene they are in, with the screenplays well written dialogue dripping from their lips with sly charisma. I could hear that trio talk to each other all day.However, Mission Impossible falls apart on its story, which has chunks carved out with wanton abandon. Jim Phelps guns down his wife not two minutes after we the audience learn that she was his partner in crime all along. Why? Because Ethan (acting of his own accord) revealed Jim's presence and she dared to speak? Notes say that a love triangle was cut out of this movie (which makes sense considering another awkwardly placed scene where Claire comes onto Ethan with no set up or payoff). DePalma should have probably realised the climax made no sense without it. Other plot holes: - its never fully explained why they have to go into the vault whilst Donloe is out of the room. Wouldn't it be easier to land on him and neutralise him, then take your time without worrying about heat, sound or pressure? - How did Ethan so quickly put together that Phelps was the villain? If they were supposedly so close why on earth was he so suspicious when Phelps fingered Kittridge? - How on earth did Ethan contact Max? Is there some magical email server where a domain name is whatever you want it to be? - What on earth did Kittridge mean when he suggested that he and Max would work out a compromise? I thought Max was the most wanted?Mission Impossible is largely messy, but if you don't concentrate too hard and just soak up some gloriously directed and wonderfully tense moments, you'll have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Mission Impossible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this is the best movie of the entire series for several reasons.First, unlike the 4 sequels, this thriller is more cerebral. There is less action and the story is holding up. There are maybe not many spectacular stunts but what it lacks about it is regained by the deepness of the characters. Tom Cruise is playing a manipulated man, betrayed by his own boss and who is resolved to get his reputation back by taking down the mastermind who killed his entire team to frame him. The suspense is present all the time and we discover the real villain at the very end of the movie.The second asset is the cast. You wouldn't expect better actors to star in this movie: Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Vingh Rhymes, Jean Reno, Kristin Scott Thomas. This is a five star casting and it serves the plot to the perfection. We're feeling a chemistry between those actors and they play their parts genuinely which was not sometimes the case during the sequels.The third good point is the directing and editing. It's dark and tense just like it should be. There is no time out sometimes we are lost but we always are able to keep up with the story thanks to the directing. I never felt out of the movie I was kept in and interested in. Not only because of Tom but mostly because it's so well shot, keeping us in the story. It's something the sequels lack. They are so focused on the action sometimes I'm wondering if some stunts are really necessary to the plot or it's only to satisfy Tom's ego. I would have wished the sequels would have kept the same spirit than Mission Impossible. Less action but more story instead of a stunts piling up to cover not such a good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team are assigned to retrieve a non-official cover list (NOC list), but they are ambushed by another spy team and killed one by one. Any survivors are left to take the blame for the murders, learning the original mission was a setup designed to lure out a mole. More confusing than it needs to be, but is eventful and well-acted enough to have major replay value. De Palma's use of foreshadowing might sadly go unappreciated to those willing to watch only once. Fans of the television series will likely be displeased with the lack of mind-games among other things. Those who don't hold the show dearly or have never seen it will find this outing quite satisfying.&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;? (out of four)</fullReview>

Cruises Ethan Hunt was sharp, intelligent and made the film what it is. Amazing! There is a bit of comedy thrown in there as well, but it's mainly focused on the action. Speaking of the action, it was brilliant. The gun play, a frickin helicopter in a train tunnel, brilliant! John Voights villain was an unexpected one. He died, then we meet him in a later scene, it's revealed that he caused the deaths of the other agents and faked his own, that was a shocker! Recommend for anyone really!

I've always loved this movie, the first in the Tom Cruise "Mission Impossible" franchise. It's a terrific film that is well made and features a good balance between a well told story and excellent special effects. Not all action movies come across as enjoyable as this film. Cruise's portrayal of Ethan Hunt is fantastic, as are Ving Rhames's and Jon Voight's stellar performances (the rest of the cast does a fantastic job as well--there are just too many to list).All said, I could watch this movie over and over again, and have over the course of the nineteen years since it came out.

		<shortDescription>Good and bad, thrilling and frustrating.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mild spoilers ahoy. Can one really spoil a 19 year old film though?I very much enjoyed this film when seeing it on its initial release in 1996, at the fabulous Empire, Leicester Square, London. Whilst never a die-hard fan of the TV series, I had been entertained and absorbed by it, and I liked that they attempted to introduce many elements of that series into the big-screen incarnation whilst broadening it out with big action sequences (notably the Channel Tunnel finale) to cater for the 90s Blockbuster audience. And this is why the film both thrills and annoys me. The throwbacks are all nice (the masks, the intricate con-job set- ups etc), but ultimately undone by the decision to make an action- leaning set-piece laden film. They were largely jettisoned as the franchise progressed, which is fine, but I felt short-changed here. This may be petty, but having Jim Phelps (for those that don't know, the protagonist and hero of the series from its second series onward) turn out to be the villain was just plainly unforgivable. Imagine if the "Star Trek" reboot had cast James T Kirk as the antagonist. That left a real sour taste in the mouth.I'm surprised that the screenplay was handed in by writers as esteemed as David Koepp and Robert Towne, because much of the early dialogue, notably in the session where the team are briefed, seems forced and unrealistic - Hollywood quippy rather than natural. It's not helped that Tom Cruise's performance oscillates wildly between stern, serious, and meaning business, and toothy grin, over keen to quip and be liked. Maybe it was intended for the character, but it's at odds with how I felt it should be played, and different from the later portrayals of operative Hunt. I like Cruise in the latter films but he's too "Jerry Maguire" here for me. I did love his "disc disappearing" trick in Liverpool St though, and the rest of the cast were all solid. I'm glad Ving Rhames (as Luther) has become a mainstay of the franchise, Henry Czerny fits the mould of every disgruntled MI team boss throughout the series to a tee, Emmanuelle Beart is HOT, Reno is... well, he's Jean Reno, only with more attitude. Kristin Scott Thomas adds a welcome touch of class, and the Lithuanian lady playing Hannah is also one not to KooBoaCN. And of course there's the sublime Vanessa Redgrave... very watchable all round.The plot is not difficult to follow, despite common perception. It's just, frankly, a little silly. The idea that all this confidential information about non-confirmed agents would be stored in one place (even in the most secure room in the world, but with lousy server security) just doesn't ring true. And, incidentally, if it's the most secure room in the world, have they not thought about putting in a simple CCTV camera as well? But that's by the by. DePalma is an infamous admirer of Hitchcock, so I'm not surprised he's happy to hoist such a heinous MacGuffin on which to hang his outlandish, stylized, and highly engrossing set-pieces without too much concern for credibility. But those set pieces are impressive. The Prague setup, the raid at Max's, Langley (despite being so goofy), the train (London Terminus on the TGV - bless!), are all expertly staged and enticing scenes. There's just that niggling sense of "this could have been more" haunting the picture.M:I 2 I'll give a pass to, M:I 3 I think hit the mark completely and utterly, and is still my favourite of the bunch. GP is fun too, and I look forward to RN next week. This first one, I keep thinking about though, because it's not bad, by any stretch of the imagination, it's just not as good as it could have been. This review will self destruct in...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first M:I is still a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This is my first film review in a while and I thought it would be great to review the Mission: Impossible films in preparation for Rogue Nation) When a mission in Prague goes sour which results in the death of an entire IMF team leaving only one survivor named Ethan Hunt who framed as a mole and subsequently disavowed from his organization. In order to discover who the mole is and clear his name he must strike a bargain with the mole's reclusive employer Max and form a team to conduct a huge heist.Looking back on the first "Mission: Impossible" film or "M:I" for short, it is amazing how well that this still holds up as not only a great "M:I" film but a great spy film as well. In the past many people have said that the plot to this film is either convoluted or hard to follow. This is true to some extent but that is only if you are not paying attention and it is great that a summer blockbuster requires you to think. I've watched this film many times over the years and I've enjoyed it for its great plot, atmosphere, suspenseful sequences that live up to the franchise name "Impossible" and good acting by the entire cast including Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Béart, Henry Czerny, Jean Reno, Ving Rhames and Vanessa Redgrave. Tom Cruise's charismatic performance a Ethan Hunt proved that he could carry an action film and the fact that he does his own stunts makes the action sequences all the more engaging. The rest of the cast does a great job with their roles.U2's updated take on the classic theme song is still great and catchy. The director is Brian De Palma and he understands how to put suspense and atmosphere into a spy film. Many sequences are directed with refined style. One sequence in particular is the best and iconic part of the film where Tom Cruise is hanging from a wire. The combination of acting, music, camera work, sound mixing and camera work easily make this (in my opinion) one of the best suspense sequences put onto film. The rest of the film is great cloak and dagger intrigue with good plot twists. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing, but entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible is a pretty good film, with top-notch performances from the cast and entertaining action sequences. However, some parts of the plot are confusing,such as what exactly Phelps' plan was. He faked his death, but I never understood why. Why did he become a bad guy, and who was Claire working with him? Also, some of the acting was sort of below-average, but Tom Cruise's performance of course made up for it. Its those type of things that make me dislike a film, but nevertheless the Tom Cruise-led spy flick was overall pretty enjoyable. The over-the-top stunts added suspense to the thrilling sequences. The action was pretty well-done. I will say that the stunts/action are unrealistic and sometimes even physics-defying, though. But Mission: Impossible was a very entertaining film, and I am looking forward to seeing the rest of the franchise. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission: Impossible... to be very interesting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to go on a bit of a tangent: A lot of people think that the first Superman movie is boring, slow-paced, and uninteresting. While I agree that it has a slow pace, I still think it is a very entertaining movie. The reason I bring this up is because those thoughts people have against the first Superman movie are pretty much the same thoughts I have on the first "Mission: Impossible".It's not a terrible movie, it's just a terribly uninteresting movie. Maybe because its sequels (mainly M:I-III &amp; Ghost Protocol) are much more amusing to watch. Tom Cruise's stunt work is always great to watch, but it's surrounded by a bunch of boring scenes and a very predictable plot. There are scenes I love, like the white room break in, and even the convoluted/preposterous Helicopter chase at the end, but I always end up losing interest after the first 40 minutes.The cinematography and theme song are both fantastic, but they're not enough for me to recommend this movie. I'd say skip to the sequels... or at least M:I-III...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most suspenseful action movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible is directed by Brian DePalma and was released in 1996. Almost 20 years after the movie's initial release, I am very glad to say the movie still holds up very well for the most part, which is not always easy especially for action movies, since they are almost always heavy on special effects.This was the movie in which Tom Cruise showed the world that he could be an action star and how much he actually encouraged doing his own stunts. He owns the role of Ethan Hunt and gives an incredibly charismatic performance. The directing and cinematography is still pretty solid, although the movie suffers from a very big flaw that is pretty common in spy movies: the plot is convoluted, sometimes even messy. By the end of the movie, director Brian DePalma really tries to tie up loose ends, but doesn't fully accomplish it. It's just a very hard plot to follow and, in the end there's just more confusion.But aside from that, I believe Mission: Impossible is a very good movie, which set the standards high in the series. There are two scenes in this film that are by far some of the most suspenseful scenes I have ever seen. I'm talking about the scene in the restaurant with Hunt and Kittrige and the scene where they steal the disk in the IMF headquarters. In the second one, the lack of music and just silence for almost the entire duration of the scene really pays off, and increases the suspense.Mission: Impossible is a movie that could have easily been a lot better if they had just put the plot together more tightly than the end result, but overall, it is a very strong first entry in a successful series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Mission: Impossible' is summer action movie fun, with a bit more complexity than usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the mid 60s to the early 70s, a TV show existed by the name of Mission: Impossible. The series ran for seven seasons and followed a group of agents working for the IMF (Impossible Missions Force), as they attempted to do the impossible missions, of course. The show was well-received, and in the mid 90s, Brian De Palma resurrected the series in a film format. The film version, named after the TV series and released on May 22, 1996, was a commercial success and the critics gave it mostly positive reviews. So, in preparation for the upcoming Rogue Nation, let's see if critics and audiences alike are correct in their evaluation of this film. Mission: Impossible follows IMF agent Ethan Hunt as he is framed for the murder of his team members after a mission in Prague to get a list of all of the undercover agents fails. As he goes on the run, he gets help from fellow disavowed agents to clear his name and find the true person responsible for the murders of his team members.The acting in this film was pretty good, in my opinion. Tom Cruise did a great job as Ethan Hunt. This is the film that cemented him as an action star, and thank god for it. Jon Voight does a great job as well as the leader of the IMF team that Hunt is a part of, Jim Phelps. Emmanuelle Beart does a good job as Phelps's wife, Claire. Henry Czerny does a good job as the director of the entire IMF. The actor, aside from Cruise, who really shines is Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. He was great in this movie, and I'm so glad he's going to be alongside Hunt in the future films, because that just makes me more excited to see the next few films. Stickell is awesome.I really liked the story and how complicated it was. Some may think it was confusing, which I don't agree with at all. I was able to follow the film fairly well, and if I missed anything, it was cleared up by the Wikipedia summary afterwards. I think where people saying it's "confusing" comes from is the fact that it's a summer action movie that requires you to think, which most films back then didn't. It also requires you to pay attention to all the dialogue and everything that's going on, which I also really liked.Hand in hand with the story comes the screenplay, which I really enjoyed. The lines were greatly written, and two scenes in particular: the café scene with the IMF director and Hunt, and the station scene with Hunt and Phelps, are two of my favorite scenes in the film. Not just because of how De Palma filmed them, which is a great plus, but because of how engaging the dialogue is. The music, done by Danny Elfman, was great as well. I really enjoyed how it worked in a lot of the scenes, and it really did enhance the film a bit.I really also liked the pacing of the film. The infamous scene in the CIA building in Langley, which I won't spoil, is really well done. The scene lasts about ten minutes and yet, you never feel bored. De Palma's choice to have little music and no sound in most of the scene was a bold one and a great one, as it worked so well. The action sequences were all well done, and it didn't even occur to me until the film had no shootouts during the entire film, which is kind of amazing considering how commonplace they are in action films.Perhaps my biggest flaw with the film is the special effects at times, particularly during the end fight. There's just something about that scene that doesn't really sit well with me, especially how it looks. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but the effects don't look that great. Another thing that bugged me was the Internet usage in the film. I get that back then the Internet was relatively unknown, but it's one of the things that really dates the film and kind of bugged me as the film went on.Overall, however, Mission: Impossible is a fun, action film that requires you to think. While the effects are a bit hokey at times, and the Internet usage bugged me at times during the film, the acting, dialogue, screenplay, pacing, action sequences, music and the story were all great and really elevated the film above the usual summer drivel. If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out as it really is the thinking man's summer action film.9/10. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission: Impossible Is Nearly Impossible To Follow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most popular films of the 1990s that catapulted Tom Cruise into the league of Hollywood's biggest stars, Mission: Impossible is an intriguing, entertaining &amp; seemingly engaging spy-thriller that packs in enough action spectacle to satisfy its viewers but also suffers due to its convoluted premise, illogical twists &amp; unfleshed characters.The story of Mission: Impossible follows Ethan Hunt; the point man of a secret government agency who's suspected to be the mole within the organisation after he turns out to be the sole survivor of a mission gone wrong. Fleeing from the scene to avoid arrest, Hunt enlists the help of two former agents to find out the real culprit and prove his innocence.Helmed by Brian De Palma (the director of Carrie &amp; Scarface), the storyline is quite difficult to follow for there are many twists n turns in the movie that don't make much sense. Even the script is poorly written for the plot &amp; characters lack considerable depth &amp; substance, and the only thing that saves it from being an absolute disaster is the inventive action it has in store.Set design is very much in sync with De Palma's style, Camera-work is fluid &amp; is at its best during the action sequences, Editing provides a steady pace for the events to unfold but makes the narrative too complex, background score is fitting, special effects is impressive and amongst its cast, only Tom Cruise is the one who puts in some effort to stay out of the complaint zone.On an overall scale, Mission: Impossible may give the illusion of a clever &amp; intelligent spy- thriller but beneath that false sugarcoating is something that's hollow, mediocre &amp; absurd. The action segments do a terrific job in hiding its faulty layers, and most viewers won't even mind its lacking elements as long as they are entertained but its shortcomings are exposed on multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: Brian de PalmaWriters: David Koepp and Robert TowneStarring: Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Béart, Henry Czerny, Jean Reno, and Ving RhamesRelease Date: May 22, 1996MPAA Rating: PG-13 for some intense action violenceRuntime: 1 hour and 50 minutesStudio: Paramount PicturesWe have a new Mission: Impossible film coming this year: Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. In anticipation for that film, I am going to be reviewing every single Mission: Impossible film, prior to that one. I'll be honest here, Mission: Impossible was a film that I didn't really like at my first viewing. It had some entertaining moments, but I found the film to be too slow for my taste. After reviewing this film, in anticipation for Rogue Nation, I've come to like this one a lot more. I still consider the last 2 to be the best ones, but this is much better than what I first thought it was.The plot of Mission: Impossible is based on the T.V. show, of the same name. Jim Phelps is the leader of an Impossible Missions Force (IMF, for short) team, consisting of Jim, Ethan Hunt, Claire Phelps (Jim's wife), Sarah Davies, and Jack Harmon. One time, the IMF was sent to stop a traitor from stealing the non-official cover (NOC) list. Unfortunately, the mission goes wrong as most of the IMF team are killed. The only survivor is Ethan, but after he returns to IMF director Eugene Kittridge, he learns that the job was a setup: the NOC list was a fake list so that a mole could be lured to the IMF. Kittridge, with evidence, suspects Ethan for killing the rest of the IMF team. Knowing that he's not the killer, Ethan escapes and with the help of an arms dealer codenamed "Max", Phelps' wife, Claire, who is revealed to have survived the killings, and two disavowed agents: Luther Stickell and Frank Krieger, Etahn must find the man who framed him, to clear his name.Being one of the best action stars of the 80's, 90's, early 2000's, and even this decade, Tom Cruise delivers great lead performance as Ethan Hunt. He is very convincing in when doing stunts, and I believed him, when he wasn't doing stunts, as well. Jon Voight and Emmanuelle Béart really solid as Jim and Claire, but I didn't really care for their characters. The same can go to John Reno and Ving Rhames, who are both really solid (especially Rhames entertaining comic-relief character), but they're not well-developed. Despite the lack of well-developed supporting characters, this film at least has an engaging lead that you can root for: Ethan Hunt.The action sequences are pretty awesome and that's mainly due to Brian de Palma's direction. Tom Cruise wanted each Mission: Impossible film to have different director, so that each of them have their own different style and feel to it. Wit this first film, de Palma uses lots and lots of nail-biting suspense in the action sequences (which, in my opinion, makes the film feel more like a thriller, than an action movie). The 2 standout sequences, in my opinion, are the hanging sequence and the climax, which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen this film.Whilst the script for this movie is not perfect, it's still a very solid screenplay. The main reason why I like this film is the plot. It can convoluted at points, but it's still consistently engaging, attention-grabbing, and keeps you guessing, until the end. There are many surprising moments that I didn't really expect. The pace flows very well, and the film is always entertaining. It's not perfect though: most of the supporting characters are pretty underdeveloped, the villain is pretty weak, and the film does have a bit of a sloppy third act, as the plot gets really convoluted, at that point. Still, the climax is just...wow!Overall, Mission: Impossible is a great start to an awesome action movie franchise. It's not the simplest film ever, but it's very unpredictable, consistently entertaining, highly suspenseful, and just a lot of fun. I really recommend this film, if you want to get into the franchise.I'm going to give Mission: Impossible a B+ (8/10).</fullReview>

It is hard to know the suspense in the film.Though film was entertaining through its Gadgets planing and acting the film's Suspense is not well shown to people they have somewhat ruined it I think.But otherwise film was good the direction acting was good but the film's minus point is its way of opening the suspense which cannot be understand by some audiences I think so!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me a film becomes boring if it becomes predictable - especially if what was predictable was supposed to be a huge twist for the film. Even though I sometimes write spoilers I'm not going to spoil who the villain of the film is (I knew in the first 15 minutes of the film) but that doesn't really matter since it is so easy to figure out.I noticed that this film set a lot of precedents for action films made after this film. For example, if you have seen the first Spider-man film with Tobey Maguire then you probably remember the scene where Peter's single drop of blood signals Osbourne to become suspicious of his environment, and it is a very tense, simple scene. Well, in Mission: Impossible, Tom Cruise is breaking into a room which will sound an alarm if the tiniest amount of weight is added to the room, even a drop of water, and Cruise starts sweating, and the scene becomes tense when a single drop of sweat is about to fall from the glasses he is wearing.This movie seems to think it is being overly smart which gets annoying when you realize the story is pretty simple. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on a mission at the start of the movie that goes haywire and results in the death of most of his team members. Somebody who is higher up than Hunt in this business calls him to a meeting immediately, where Hunt learns they think he is a traitor, so he has been set up. The plot then focuses on Hunt trying to contact the actual mole in the agency by referencing a specific bible verse from the book of Job (something was mentioned about a "job" in his initial meeting with the executive) and in my mind it is kind of confusing how he knows exactly what to say and who to e-mail to try to find the mole. It becomes like speaking in riddles and I do not think the movie needed to be this "smart" when its purpose was to be a fun action movie.Towards the end of the film, the CGI is just plain terrible in the climactic action sequence. Not to say that the action itself is not fun, but it just breaks the illusion of the film and you realize you're watching a movie (a movie should allow you to get lost in it). This is especially noticeable when Cruise's character flies towards the camera at one point, and you notice that the Cruise coming at you is computer generated for two thirds of the jump. The one effect I was astounded by, however, was the use of masks in the film - I'm not sure if the masks were real masks, but damn, they were elaborate masks that copied exactly how other characters in the movie looked, and I have to say bravo.I didn't enjoy this action movie since it wasn't as fun for me as other action movies, but perhaps this is your type of action movie; who am I to say?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible (1996): Dir: Brian De Palma / Cast: Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Kristin Scott Thomas: Based on the popular T.V. series about secret operations of difficult proportions, and it stars Tom Cruise as a professional spy. The names of America's double agents are contained on a computer disc and he must prevent it from being stolen. Before that, he and his team must photograph the evidence of the theft taking place. While certainly entertaining the story derails into implausible action scenes as oppose to the cleverness of the TV show. It is unfortunate that this is the biggest hit for director Brian De Palma. He is a skillful director whose talent has been applied to better films such as Sisters and Dressed to Kill. The film is well made technically but perhaps more on the spy mission would have elevated it to a more intelligent level. Cruise holds his own as the spy but the same cannot be said of the supporting players. Capable actors such as Jon Voight, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno labour under flat material. Kristin Scott Thomas makes an appearance amongst the less fortunate in the pointless opening. Filled with exhilarating action that are as far fetched as they come but its biggest fault is subduing itself in the action as oppose to clever writing. To actually hire a real screenwriter would be an impossible task I suppose. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Cruise stars in the rebirth of a 60s TV staple as he brings "Mission: Impossible" to the big screen. The popular TV show is infused with new blood as we follow the trail of Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) as he is framed for the death of his team while on a mission. He looks up disavowed members of the force to form a new team to help him clear his name. Standout turns by Jean Reno and Ving Rhames as new members of his team, they look to find the "mole" who has betrayed the Force as well try to find out who is looking to steal the list of identities of all the IMF agents. Brian DePalma directed this initial entry of the new film franchise, which was controversial upon its release due to its treatment of one of the original characters, Jim Phelps, played by Jon Voight. Although fans of the original TV series were up in arms, the film was still enjoyable, with enough intrigue and twists to keep viewers interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Now that I've reviewed Mission: Impossible III, which I just watched, I decided to go back and review the first two MI movies, and give you my thoughts. I understand how someone would like this movie more than I do, and I can see myself liking it more on a future viewing, but as it stands now, I just think this movie is okay. I think Tom Cruise does a pretty good job as Ethan Hunt, but, and you won't hear me say this often, I thought the movie was shot poorly. The way it was shot, and just the general look of the movie made it look like it was made in 1960. Maybe that's what they were going for, but it kind of threw me. Another thing that threw me, and I get that this was intentional, was that there was almost no fighting. There are suspenseful scenes, which I will get to in just a minute, but there aren't any shootouts, and there is only one brief fistfight and a chase scene, that's it. I like that they tried to make a different spy-thriller type movie, but they could've included a bit more action, though I do think this was an interesting idea. I'm not saying it was necessarily bad, I'm just saying I expected something... different. Despite my complaints against this movie, I can't deny that I had an absolute blast watching it. The break-in at the HQ building was very tense, but also very funny. The two don't sound like they'd work well together, but I think they mixed the two styles very nicely in this scene. The investigation was rather confusing to me, maybe I just missed some crucial plot point, but I was lost for a large chunk of this movie, which might have hurt my opinion a bit. This movie also doesn't really have a villain, exactly. It's more about Ethan on the run, and trying to figure out what's going on, but the villain, Job, is in the movie... maybe ten minutes, and it's not like he's even an opposing force when he's not on screen, there's just... no villain. The fight on the train though, that was an excellent scene. Action- packed, suspenseful, and very entertaining. Unlike 2 and 3, this movie is certainly not playing it with a straight face, this is obviously going for a humorous tone, and I think they pulled it off well. In the end Mission: Impossible was a fun movie, despite my problems with it, it had good characters, some good tension, and a smart, if confusing story.</fullReview>

The story is a complete maze full of gadgets, chaos, traitors and twists that's still as hard to comprehend the second, or even the third time round. De Palma has Cruise at the rudder of every scene, taking on an impossible mission to single handedly uncover the mole who betrayed him and his team. The organisation suspect him to be the rat, so choices are limited. From Prague to Washington and then to London, Ethan Hunt's hunt is cool, full of trust issues, face masks, Emmanuelle Beart's gorgeous agent trying to prove Hunt's innocence, tense set pieces and adrenaline fueled action. One particular nerve-racking scene sees Hunt infiltrating a secure vault with sound detectors and a touch sensitive floor. One of the tensest scenes in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty mainstream spy thriller. One of the stronger films in the franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this isn't the strongest of franchises, even in context of the spy genre alone, this re-imagining of the sixties TV show isn't too bad. So far Ghost Protocol is my favorite in the series, though it could get passed by Rogue Nation this summer. Still, this first installment is much better than 2 and 3, though they both fixed a couple of things that were wrong with the first film. Despite having the least action of the four, the movie is still predominantly action driven. It's overall quality is fair with an equal amount of flaws and strong points.The story is complicated, but not in a Prestige-esque way that makes you want to see it again to figure it out exactly. The confusion comes mostly from a number of technicalities that are hard to keep track of and are kind of vital in order to understand the story. It is possible to follow everything, but it takes so much concentration that it's likely to detract from the overall experience. But, as I said, it's action driven, so all you really need to know is that it's Ethan Hunt and company against everyone else and a couple of shifty allies. The area that the screenwriters could have improved in the most was the character interaction. We see that Ethan feels betrayed at various times by Kitteredge, Jim, and Claire, but the technicalities of the plot and slightly lacking character writing gets in the way. That's not to say that they did a terrible job writing the characters, but it just could have been better.Though it's considered an action film, the quantity of action is more fitting for a thriller. There are long stretches where we are deprived of any kind of fight scene and there is a lot of dialogue. The action sequences mainly come at the beginning and end. The more exciting scenes in the middle are just sort of tense and might feature some spy gear, such as the iconic scene where Ethan breaks into the IMF to get hold of the NOC list in the ultra high security room. Even almost 20 years later, some of the spy gadgets are still pretty cool like Jack's "gum" and the video glasses. There are no true fight scenes like in the subsequent three films (but that saves us from the annoying amount of slow motion used in MI:2).The acting is fair, with Tom Cruise giving the best performance. I thought Luther was played pretty well, though Jim and Claire both could have stepped it up a notch. Kitteredge felt rather clichéd, like a cross between an overly official Bourne antagonist and a threatening Bond villain. Since I viewed it long after it's release, I can't say whether the technical execution is good or bad, but it feels satisfactory given the technology at that time.It's not as good as the Bourne films or the Daniel Craig 007 installments, but might be appealing to fans of either franchise. Again, it's confusing and has less action than you would anticipate, which are both things for prospective viewers to be conscious of. I've heard that it isn't very true to the old TV shows, but given the thirty year hiatus, that isn't terribly surprising. However, the old theme is modernized well and from what I've read, nobody is very intent on comparing the show to the films. So I would probably recommend it to any action fan, especially if you want to get caught up before seeing Rogue Nation in July, but it won't top your lists. Overall Rating: 8.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget James Bond, meet Ethan Hunt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An updated version of a classic spy-themed series from Brian De Palma is a classic itself now. But this first installment is not my favorite, albeit it contains all basic elements of a good action flick. The focus of story is a spy game with everything that follows from that: gadgets, hacking, betrayal, and so forth. For me, unfortunately, the whole story moves quite slow, and even we have some really great actors here (most notably behind Tom Cruise, is Jean Reno, and Ving Rhames), they can make this film interesting, but not amazing. De Palma's vision of "MI" is significantly different than any other director who has been involved in franchise development, and he tends more to thriller rather than action movie. And we can, of course, remember at least two really thrilling sequences here: famous "hacking secret data in the air" episode and the final confrontation on a train. But, except for this, rest of the film is pretty slow-driven, relying more on actors and screenplay than SFX or high dynamics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very solid spy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission Impossible has become well known for its theme song and also for this being Tom Cruise's franchise, but this film is a really solid spy thriller and it does a really good job of introducing this franchise. This story starts off when special agent Ethan Hunt ends up with his team all dead on a mission and he is accused of conspiracy against the American government and on the run for his life. Now this really is Tom Cruise's film and he is fantastic as Ethan Hunt and does a really good job of being a serious action star who the audience can relate too which really brings out the best in the film. The supporting cast is pretty poor though really, an exception to that is Jon Voight as Jim Phelps, even though it is a bit of a smaller role he does a great job in the role and alongside Cruise he does a great job. But then to the rest it is not my favourite, the woman they got to play Jim Phelps wife Claire isn't a very good actress and she doesn't do a very good job in the role. Also the guy they got to play the head of the CIA would have been better had he had a bigger role as he wasn't given enough time to establish his character. Jean Reno also plays another fugitive and I didn't really like his character either as he just seemed like a weird add on that wasn't really necessary. The story is a huge plus with loads of twists and turns that make all the characters add to the story and make them seemingly important. The script is okay with Cruise having some really good lines but some of the other characters lines are not that good at all. The style of the film is great with obviously the iconic theme song being great but also the action scenes seemed realistic but also exciting. This is a really good solid film that I hope sees even better in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, exciting, classic and the weakest in the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably my least favorite of the franchise but still miles above most other "spy" movies except for those Bourne ones. This series also gets better with each subsequent movie. #1 see's secret agent Ethan Hunt framed for the deaths of his espionage team and fleeing government assassins across Europe to find the truth.Everything is well done and the result is fun and exciting despite a kinda choppy story. Great locations, a top notch cast and filled with awesome stunts (the giant fish tank explosion in the restaurant, the now iconic Cruise suspended mid heist inches from a pressure sensitive floor, and the amazing train ride/helicopter sequence) which by the end goes way OTT but looks cool and as I said its fun so who cares. 9/1/14</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling action scenes and a not-too-obvious plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually like action movies, but this one managed to captivate me with its heart-stopping action scenes and fairly intelligent plot! Tom Cruise put in a splendid performance as CIA agent Ethan Hunt, whose team members all die on a mission to nab the guy who is out to steal the list of names of all agents in Eastern Europe. The mission turns out to be a decoy, all for the purpose of tracking down the mole within the CIA. Suspicion is naturally cast on Hunt, who sets out to uncover the mole's identity and clear his name.The action scenes and camera-work were amazing, from Hunt hanging from a vent and nearly hitting the ground when the rope suddenly loosened, to the helicopter and train chase scene. Just as importantly, the plot made sense and all the action scenes had a legit purpose, which isn't always the case with quite a lot of action flicks. It wasn't that easy to guess who the real bad guy was. And of course, the famous theme music really added to the thrill! Good entertainment for an afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Phelps was sent to Prague to prevent the theft of classified material. His wife Claire and his trusted partner Ethan Hunt were members of his team.Unfortunately, The mission failed, leaving Hunt the lone survivor. After he reported the failed mission, the head of the agency suspects Ethan of being the culprit for the failed mission.Now, Ethan uses unorthodox methods to try to find who set him up and to clear his name.....Probably the most successful transfer from TV to big scree, MI is the epitome of a summer blockbuster, it's big, full of wonderful set pieces, and makes no sense whatsoever.It's about a list containing information, and Cruise is suspected of turning (Freud would have a field day), and he assembles a rag tag team to clear his name.That's it. The rest of the film is full of Cruise doing his own stunts, and showcasing himself. Which isn't a bad thing, because after Top Gun, this movie made him the biggest star on the planet.De Palma give the film his classic sheen, and makes the film feel a little more urgent than it seems.All in all, it's a load of old cobblers, but it's fun, and we will all remember it for Cruise dangling on a wire, catching his own sweat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mission: Impossible" is the first movie of the Mission Impossible and it has to do with an American agent who is a suspect by his own organization and he wants to discover and expose the real spy of his organization without any help.I liked this movie because it's a movie with plenty of action and suspense in whole of the movie. I also liked it because it was so unpredictable and because of the storyline. I also believe that the interpretation of Tom Cruise who plays as Ethan Hunt and he is really nice on it. Another good interpretations made by Ving Rhames who plays as Luther Stickell a friend and partner of Ethan Hunt and Jon Voight who plays as Jim Phelps.Finally I have to tell you that I really recommend this movie because of all the above reasons and I believe that this movie is a strong start of a new era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is full of stars, including two of my favorites, Jean Reno and Kristin Scott Thomas.The plot is a little difficult to follow, with all the double-dealing, but not to worry. It has all the usual spy stuff: spyglasses, hidden microphones, laptops, elaborate disguises, exploding cars, knifings, shootings, bodies toppling into a river, etcBasically, a mole has broken into the group's inner circle; the mission was an attempt to flush him out. But instead of exposing the real culprit, it throws suspicion on team member Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), who is forced to go underground to prove his innocence.We've seen some of this in Jules Dassin films, but not even Bond has a chase scene like the one here.The bottom line on a film like this is, Tom Cruise looks cool and holds our attention while doing neat things that we don't quite understand</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An American agent (Tom Cruise), under false suspicion of disloyalty, must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization.Although the original cast disliked this new incarnation, I think they missed the point in a way -- this was not to be a strict continuation but more of a new beginning. Those lines might have been blurred if the old cast reprised their roles, but they did not, and I do not see this one in any way detracting from the television show.Stephen Holden of the New York Times wrote, "If that story doesn't make a shred of sense on any number of levels, so what? Neither did the television series, in which basic credibility didn't matter so long as its sci-fi popular mechanics kept up the suspense." I feel like this really nails it. The key is the suspense and not the plot. While more something you expect from Joel Schumacher than Brian De Palma, I think De Palma" got it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite of the series (Ghost Protocol 2nd). This film scores high marks all the way around. The story, acting, and directing all are first class. I read that many people who have seen the movie for the first time were confused by the plot. So was I, but after screening it a second time I was pleasantly surprised at the many subtle nuances to the story there really were. It's a story that doesn't treat you like a child. So many movies (directors) think they have to go out of there way to spell everything out for the audience. Scenes that have no other purpose than to drive home an obvious point. Not this one. If I had my way Brian De Palma would have been involved in the other three. De Palma was the only one who captured the feel and the look of what I thought the movie should have been. If you've only seen it once see it again and enjoy it for the classic that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Action Scenes and Convoluted Filler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what roughly equals one third of Mission: Impossible, I could only ask myself, "What the heck is going on?" Mission: Impossible can be so hopelessly convoluted at times, it's impossible to understand the film's plot. This is especially odd, as the plot isn't even especially complex, it's just presented in an needlessly complicated way. Still, all story and screenplay issues are easily redeemed by the thrilling action scenes and nifty (and dated) espionage scenes.Ethan Hunt, framed for murdering his entire mission team, is out to clear his name. And while that's the gist of the film, it is very possible that you won't understand what's going on for significant portions of the film.There are several "twists" throughout the film, but few of them really register as surprising or stunning, as the audience is often scratching their heads, wondering what just happened. Mission: Impossible does not have a strong story, but it's made worse by a poor script and convoluted story-telling.Thankfully, the action scenes are fun enough to make one temporarily forget the filler in-between. Sure, they're all a bit ridiculous (not to tell a bad joke, but Mission: Improbable anyone?), but they're reasonably entertaining, and at times, highly suspenseful. Still, one feels like the impact of the action scenes could've been heightened by more interesting characters. There is not a single memorable character in this film (with one exception, though it would be a spoiler to say whom this character is). The characters have absolutely no personality, which hurts the film dramatically.As a result of the bland characters, the performances are bland, but at least serviceable. The actors and actresses try to get as much out of their weak characters as possible, but it doesn't make anybody more memorable. The score, composed by Danny Elfman (utilizing themes by Lalo Schifrin) is really fun at times. The use of the Mission: Impossible theme is great, but the score doesn't rely entirely on the use of this theme, which is refreshing for a film like this. The only problem with the score (which doesn't have anything to do with Elfman himself) is the ear-bleedingly terrible arrangement of the Mission: Impossible theme during the credits by Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton.While Mission: Impossible is heavily convoluted and not especially original (one scene involving a telephone call is highly reminiscent of 1993's The Fugitive), but there's enough entertaining action sequences to make up for this. Mission: Impossible isn't exactly sophisticated fare, nor is it as breezily fun as other popcorn flicks. But it's got enough thrills to justify a watch- and enough issues to justify a pass.</fullReview>

The mission was actually a mole hunt, and the agency now thinks that sole survivor Ethan is the mole. He must fight to clear his name, and find the real mole.Director Brian De Palma has built an intense convoluted story. It's best not to think too hard. It doesn't really give you time to think. The clues, the new characters, and the action keeps coming without easy explanations. Tom Cruise is such a powerful presence that I don't actually question the story.

		<shortDescription>Let's make a movie where somebody flies a helicopter into the Channel Tunnel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First this movie is a remake of an old series, and secondly it has Tom Cruise in it. Tom Cruise is not a bad actor, it just annoys me that movie is focused completely around him, as if he were God. No wonder the Germans hated this movie. Anyway I will give away the plot in this movie because I feel that you really don't need to see it. The only reason I taped it and watched it was because Jean Reno was in it, and he is quite a good actor.Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt, the member of the IMF team that performs impossible missions. During a routine mission everything goes wrong, and only Hunt and the wife of Jim Phelps (the leader of the team) escape. The American government believe that Hunt is behind it, and is a mole selling out to the enemy, so order him arrested, but he manages to slip through their fingers, and even breaks into CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia. It ends up that Jim Phelps is the mole and that Jean Reno is the agent who is in it for the money. The movie ends in a scene in the English Channel tunnel, where Reno flies a helicopter through it and Hunt tackles Phelps on the back of a train.This movie follows the theme of the end of the cold war and thus the intelligence agencies are no longer needed. This is not an action packed movie, but tries to follow the tenseness of the original series. It is more about people trying to get into places which are very difficult to get into it. As such it follows the style of Sneakers, which I believe is a far superior movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read reviews on here from die hard fans who knock this film. Some have even gone as far to rate it a 1? Are you kidding me? Its insanely difficult to make even an okay movie I think nostalgia is winning the day with the old fans of the show. The show was cool but let's face it..its not all that its now cracked up to be by the fans. It hasn't aged well at all and is hokey at times. the sequels to this film are a fun watch but ultimately crappy. Ill agree with that assessment. This film is superior to the sequels, however.I'm sorry, I disagree with the people that have a heightened sense of nostalgia regarding this material. I can understand. At least be fair, though. Also, Tom gets a bad rap from the older gen born in the 60s. I grew up as a child in the 80s to early 90s. From my perspective he is a fine actor.. always giving it his all. I of course watched him as an impressionable child so my perspective will be different. I'm sure people are justified in their not being fond of him and even I was initially hungry to judge him down a notch when he went all nutzo in front of the nation. His ego I can imagine is quite huge considering he's been so privileged for so long. Just the same.. we don't have to be friends with him do we? I think its cool that perspectives can be so different and its very telling. I say tom is worthwhile from where I've been sittin and I refuse to pass judgments on the man. This movie is great. Id rate it a 7.8 or 7.9 easily if I could. I don't know about an 8 so ill put down a strong 7 as my rating. Maybe ill change my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie combines pacing similar to Indiana Jones (that is, quick, each scene directly leading into the next) with the plotting of James Bond (that is, telling a fairly simple story in the most convoluted manner possible) to create a very entertaining experience.I know very little of the television series that it's based on, but this movie definitely stands alone. Despite a few callbacks (the self-destructing tape, Jim Phelps), the film introduces completely new characters.Even after a brilliant opening half hour, during which Tom Cruise, IMF agent becomes Tom Cruise, rogue ex-IMF agent, the film continues to bring in memorable characters and set pieces (and also fails to mention exactly what IMF stands for)The movie's best scene comes when Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, is infiltrating CIA headquarters. Like the rest of the film, it looks good and has great suspense, even if you can't think too much about it (if the room is, like, completely sealed, why can you use the computer without setting off the alarm?)</fullReview>

The film begins OK, But then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that Hollywood churns out so often. Cruse is totally miss-cast and unconvincing,the point of the series was it's cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things. This was just the biggest disappointment on film I have seen, apart from the even worse 2 follow ups. I am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film, but Mission Impossible it is not. And Jim Phelps turning traitor? Please!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission Impossible is one of those movies pretty much everyone knows, along with Dirty Harry, Die Hard and the like. And rightfully so, as it is a very solid action piece with memorable scenes, interesting plot twists and masterfully recycled classics and clichés. It's one of those movies that define a genre, in this case an action/heist genre.Of the listed good qualities, I'd definitely pick the memorable scenes as the one thing that keeps this film in people's minds. This film is full of iconic scenes that have been remade, praised and parodied ever since. From the hanging computer heist to the chase sequence on top of the train, I'd say that if you haven't seen the original, you've probably seen many of its scenes in slightly different variations in other films. They're that good. Other memorable and well-done things include the score, obviously, and the story that's not terribly original or new, but which has been given a different spin to make it feel like it's original and new.On the downside, the characters aren't very good, in my honest opinion. The actors playing them are terrific, even though I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but they're not given much to work with. The main character Ethan Hunt especially just doesn't have that larger than life quality that John McClane and Harry Callahan have in abundance. He's not a bad character, none of them are, he's just not very memorable. He's a set piece, there to move the plot along, more than anything.It's still very watchable movie, but not on my personal list of the top action films of all time. Still, every fan of action movies has seen it at least once, which is pretty much the highest compliment that you can pay to a movie, and it has earned that compliment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brian De Palma is known to be a wildly inconsistent filmmaker. From the over-rated Carrie, to the under-rated Snake Eyes, the classic Untouchables and the downright hideous Mission to Mars and Scarface, he's been through just about everything. But Mission: Impossible was his first true mega-hit. Movies from TV shows are a dime a dozen these days and are rarely taken seriously, I mean look at trash like S.W.A.T. or Dukes of Hazard, but M:I is actually supposed to be a continuation of the show, rather than a spin-off.Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt (no, not cockney rhyming slang) an IMF agent who's entire team is killed in a phony sting operation in Prague. Accused of being a traitor he legs it before they can nab him and assembles a team of rogue operatives to find out who the REAL traitor is. Many double-crosses and double-double crosses ensue.For those who cannot follow the plot there are some really good set-pieces with enough tension and excitement to carry the whole movie. You'll know by now the dangling scene in the top-secret room but the best scene in the movie is the high-speed train rocketing through the English countryside. While other directors might use this as a chance to show off, De Palma keeps it as realistic as possible which makes it infinitely more cooler.Parts of the movie may seem a bit dated now and it's weird seeing Tom Cruise look like a little boy even though he was already 33. He even sounds different. And what kind of supervillian uses floppy discs? They could have tried something a bit more high-tech there.The M:I franchise could be a heck a lot better, I suppose. The second film was terrible and the third merely average. But they're still better than the last few Bond outings, though it ain't quite up to the rugged quality of the Jason Bourne movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a CIA agent who turns rogue after being accused of being a mole by his supervisor."Mission: Impossible" was the cool film back in those days, when it was considered to be so high tech and so full of mind-blowing action sequences. Rewatching it after over ten years, I just don't think it is as good as I thought it was. Yes, the plot is intense with lots of twists; and yes, it has a lot of quite amazing action involving a high speed train and a helicopter. But everything else is so dated. The set, especially in that CIA room where the computer is, looks like a set for a modern day cheap B movie. Not to mention that huge computer, floppy disks (invention of the last century!), and huge mobile phones...they make the film look a lot less cool than I remembered it to be. What a big difference does 15 years make to the film industry, and to the public's expectations!

		<shortDescription>An intelligent action movie; not the best but fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: ***1/2 out of 4.Brian De Palma's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE gets such a bad rap from both critics and fans of the series of its injustice to the source and for how the story is such a complicated mess. Even the cast of the original TV series had a bone to pick with De Palma's revision of the classic. If so, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is best viewed not as the TV series revival but as a stand-alone movie, which it actually is pretty good.While MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is far from De Palma's best works, and it is pretty mainstream from the usually independent director, but it does boast some of his signature styles. The split screens may be gone, but the use of long takes and Hitchcockian suspense sequences (the classic CIA vault break-in is something Hitchcock would have loved to see), as well as his love for Hitchcockian elements as double-crosses, espionage, plot twists, suspicious train rides, and seeing things that are not what they seem (actually, the last one was more De Palma than Hitchcock). In the end, while it is a Hollywood product, it's still very much De Palma.Now, stepping away from my obvious affection for De Palma's style, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is quite a good action movie, even an uncommonly intelligent one. In fact, most of the action occurs momentarily and doesn't consume the storyline as it is often in Hollywood action movies. The film's terrific set-piece, a helicopter chase and a fight on top of a speeding train rolled into one, is saved for last. The plot takes full center in this one, which is about a an operation gone horribly wrong leaving IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) framed for the death of his teammates. The rest that follows will either be confusing to write down or would reveal some of the surprises that the story holds.The cast is quite great, but their not given all that much to do given that the movie is basically plot-driven. There's no romance in this one either which gives the film a "no mushy business" directness but a lack of any human dimension, which is why the film's midsection is quite dull (until we reach the film's now-famous CIA break-in scene). And of Still, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This missions plot would have been more appropriate for a sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this one in the theaters and I have to say while it was not a boring movie, it was rather disappointing. I was expecting more action and such as all the trailers showed that scene with the exploding helicopter that sends Tom Cruise's character flying, however scenes like that are few and far between in this movie. The plot was a bit much too. We are just being introduced to Mission Impossible on the big screen and their first assignment and their first team meet with failure and the lead guy, Ethan Hunt, is suspected of being a traitor of some sort. Meanwhile, Jim Phelps is missing or something, some strange computer heist is having to be pulled off with a new team and for some reason one of the members of this new team ends up being a bad guy piloting the helicopter at the end. Like I said seems more like a sequel plot to me, I much would rather have seen a more straight forward mission that was pulled off successfully first than the bungled mess that was the first caper depicted in this one. I was also disappointed by the fact Emilio Estevez was in this film and quickly removed as he could have added some good humor to this one. This film also suffers from the same problem all the Mission Impossible movies suffer from, the fact that none of them are particularly memorable. This one I remember certain scenes all right and the basic plot and the strange English woman, but a lot of the movie is kind of hazy to me as well. Though the second one of the series suffers from this problem the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie, Should You Decide To Watch It, Is A Pretty Good Spy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ethan Hunt is a covert CIA operative on a secret mission in Prague to retrieve a stolen list of agents' details, when the job goes horribly wrong and all his team are wiped out. With his bosses thinking he's a mole behind the botched operation, he must somehow prove his innocence and find out what really happened.Based on the old TV spy show by Bruce Geller, this is an enjoyable, handsomely made thriller with a strong cast, exciting locations, some great action scenes and an intriguing if rather familiar premise. What lets it down a bit for me is the script, by David Koepp and Robert Towne. The key thing with this kind of material I reckon is when to reveal who the traitor is. If you do it at the end you have to pad it out. If you do it in the middle - as this does - it can sometimes work very well (Vertigo, L.A. Confidential) but it needs to be very clear and simple. The liability scene is the one where Cruise and Voight go over the failed mission and we're bamboozled by the flashbacks which accompany it - are they Cruise imagining what may have happened, or Voight remembering what did transpire ? The plot has other holes - when do Czerny and Cruise team up ? Is it a coincidence that Reno works for both Cruise and Voight ? Is money really the only rationale for Voight's actions (he's reprising the character Peter Graves played in the TV show, but seems to have had a seismic personality shift in the interim). This is weak scripting, designed to set up big surprise scenes, but which winds up just being confusing. That said however, just about every other aspect of the picture is first rate, and there are at least three cracking suspense sequences of the kind DePalma does so well (the massacre on the banks of the Vltava, the heist at CIA headquarters and the finale on the TGV train). Danny Elfman's music is great and makes inspired use of Lalo Schifrin's much loved theme tune, while Stephen H. Burum's location photography of Prague and London is sensational, a sort of Funeral In Berlin meets To Catch A Thief. Cruise is good in the lead (under some wild makeup work by Rob Bottin), with great sneaky support from heavy hitters like Voight, Reno and Rhames, although the women are kinda dull; Béart is a bit of a cipher, Scott Thomas gets knocked off quickly, and Redgrave is fun but extremely unlikely as some sort of Euro black marketeer dealer. This isn't DePalma's (or even Cruise's) best film by some margin, but it's an entertaining, if occasionally annoying, contemporary action spy thriller. Trivia - Estevez as the gadgetry man is unbilled for some reason; he and Cruise first appeared together in Francis Coppola's The Outsiders thirteen years earlier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>De Palma's 'Mission: Impossible' is one of my all time favourite action thrillers. Slick, suspenseful and fun, that's what it is. Think of an excellent spy novel except this time you're watching it. Executed with style and class, it grabs the viewer's attention right from the start. Shot in exotic locations captured by great cinematography, it is a visual treat. The gadgets and gizmos are fun to watch. Thankfully, they are not overdone. There are a few over-the-top action sequences which are very entertaining. The soundtrack too has become a classic. The modernization of the theme track is very impressive and the tune stays in mind. Tom Cruise defines Ethan Hunt. It is only a pity that the sequels miserably failed to be anything even remotely close to the quality of this one but here Cruise totally nails the part of a smart spy who is wrongfully accused. Jon Voight, Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are spot on. The beautiful Emmanuelle Béart is alluring and plays her deceptive character superbly. Henry Czerny is the only weak link. The rest of the cast do a fine job. Vanessa Redgrave and Kristin Scott Thomas particularly stand out. 'Mission: Impossible' is a must watch for fans of espionage action thrillers. Forget the lacklustre sequels and enjoy this wild ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A distinctive action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not the most remarkable movie of Brian's,it is impressive enough to watch,though.The director managed to add the personal style of his to this commercial movie.In comparison with this one,the following sequels are too general foe me and lack more highlights.Obviously,Brian made an excellent beginning for the series.To my disappointment,however,the special effects are comparatively weak. Especially the scenes of the climax are too exaggerated.It appears to me that all those stuffs are so inadequate,even illusive. Besides,of course,young Tom Cruise in this movie was so smart,so fantastic and so unforgettable.Maybe you don't like action movies,but at least you are probably interested in young and handsome Tom.So,this movie is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Brian De Palma film so one needs to remember that he doesn't usually care about the plot. Here also, there are numerous plot holes and the film frequently stalls for no reason. Still, its strangely watchable as it concentrates on three major episodes in Prague, Langely (Virgina) and the Channel Tunnel. The acting is adequate though Jon Voight is strangely muted. Tom Cruise has a long but spectacular stunt (MINOR SPOILERS) inside CIA headquarters that's gripping to watch. The climax feels perfunctory and the addition of loud explosions seems a bit forced. In general, it's worth seeing at least once on television/DVD.Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not too long ago, I finally watched this film. If you want to know, is it worth to watch it, then the answer is - yes. The genres of this film: Adventure, Thriller, Action...It's not funny, people. There HAS to be only one and main genre "Fantastic", not in Sci-Fi meaning, but only as a fantastic. The scene at their first impossible mission was very badly filmed, I laugh a lot, while watching it. The technology for their time(which is in movie), is something unbelievable, and in this meaning this movie is also Sci-Fi. But the most greatly filmed, played, created and funny was the last scene with the helicopter. Mother God, how could something like that come to someone's mind...Really, I laughed a lot! The only thing, this film should be proud of, is a story and scenery(with everything, except the last scene, of course!), it could possibly be a greater movie, than it is, if it was filmed a little bit better and in some moments, not only "a little bit"...Because the playing of actors were really good, I liked it. They can bravely go, and take their cockies from the shelf. And one more thing, in this movie is not much music, not so much, as it wanted to be! But that's only my opinion. If judge the film by the three main things : "story, actor playing and by how movie is filmed", then, I think it is worth of 6 stars! If you haven't seen this movie, watch it, and hope you'll like it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They weren't wrong with the tagline: Expect the impossible. I've never seen helicopters flying in tunnels despite oncoming trains, and I've not seen people break in to the CIA headquarters as firefighters.But the film starts off well, and I very much enjoyed the idea of having a mission that messes up to start everything off. From then on, Ethan (Cruise) tries to find the man responsible for the ambush and death of 4 of his agents. He does this whilst being hunted by his own organisation which suspects him of being behind it. There are plot inconsistencies - why does Ethan decide to infiltrate the CIA's vault just to arrange a meeting with a cyber-terrorist who knows who the mole is? Why when he knows who the mole is, does he not go after him? Some loved the final sequence of a helicopter attached to a train, but it was that kind of enthusiasm that led to scenes like Boeing jumbo jets being split in half by lasers in later action films! Note most of this film is about Cruise being a hero with that occasional trademark smile. He does a good job of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission Implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an edge-of-the-seat roller-coaster ride. Cruise and Voight head a capable group of actors through a labyrinth of pyrotechnics and special effects and some needlessly graphic violence. The whole thing is so completely overblown and implausible that the acting is franked by the same stamp. There are situations that could scarcely be imagined outside of the movies, let alone anticipated, and so it would be impossible to imagine how one might react. As a result, human behaviour is of the the most banal, juvenile comic-book kind. It's how children would behave.The story is suitably complex. There is wheeler-dealing and betrayal. And of course suspicion and discovery. It is a cosmopolitan effort, too, with some nicely selected locations, after the fashion of that equally preposterous James Bond franchise. America's most secret facilities are juxtaposed against a very grubby old back-street near London Bridge, with which I am readily familiar. And later there's a pub in Rotherhithe from which I've had the pleasure to wobble home a couple of times.There is also a burglary so blatantly ripped-off from the older and more believable 'Topkapi' that I'm surprised it wasn't mentioned in the credits.I don't mean to criticise this movie out of hand. It's what it is: impossible - comic-book nonsense. Sit back and enjoy the ride. My only grumble is that this style is becoming increasingly perceived as 'normal' in a movie context. There is so much 'Matrix' style hokum finding its way into movies in general that reality itself seems to be in danger of ending-up on the cutting-room floor. Nothing more demonstrates this phenomenon than baddies with machine guns who seem quite incapable of hitting anything except windows which shatter spectacularly. Fast-moving heroes seem bullet-proof. Even a recent episode of CSI (a series with cerebral pretensions) saw Gary Sinise's character and a female side-kick, doing precisely this when their labs were invaded by armed villains. Then, within minutes they had set-up a bomb that was triggered by an invisible laser Field. Yep - I kid you not. Naturally, as a former lab technician, it's the first thing I thought of.Pretty soon the only believable broadcast will be the test-screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It begins as it means to go on:with a bang. A fuse is lit and the credits literally explode in a rapid-fire barrage of images and music. A re-visitation of the famous 60's TV series with that impossibly cool theme tune and a cachet of catchy catchphrases("This tape will self destruct..."etc), this treats it's inspiration with just the right amount of respect, while at the same time managing to reinvent the premise of a group of undercover agents, working in what is now the cold war-less 90's. The plot is a contortionist's delight:a spider's web of stolen computer discs, moles, mayhem, double-crosses and murder that begins in Prague with Cruise's Ethan Hunt and his impossible missions force(including Beart, Emilio Estevez and Kristin Scott-Thomas), under the direction of Jim Phelps,(Voight in the Peter Graves role), called in to intercept a traitor and a disk containing the identities of every Western spy in Europe. When the mission goes awry and his team is annihilated, Cruise suspects he's been set up, only to find himself accused of being the mole. As Washington, London and finally the channel tunnel all go by in a blur, the rest of the film is taken up with Cruise, aided with Beart, all lips and tits, out to prove his innocence.There are, of course, gadgets galore, Cruise peeling off various cool disguises, and that piece of music at regular intervals. De Palma, undisputed master of the set-piece, pulls out all the f-stops this time around, with edgy camera angles and a series of extended tension-building nerve-jangling sequences- including one in a white-walled vault resembling something out of 2001, a space odyssey, where Cruise is suspended on wires above a touch-sensitive floor. At a little under two hours this fairly zips by, but when the script, by David Koeppe and Robert Towne, moves from action to plotting and concerns itself with upping the levels of paranoia, you'll be left scratching your head trying to decipher the twists within twists within twists. ****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We All Know That It's about Nothing But 2 Memorable Sequences !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The problem of this film is that (Brian De Palma) razed the very main theme which the whole series was based on; and I mean the idea of the team's spirit, or the real unity of those gifted genius agents whom were all killed by him at the beginning of the film in cold blood to make their superior (the old dearly loved character) as the low killer and the actual traitorous !! Moreover, it took us a very long time of waiting to have a Mission Impossible movie. And when that finally happened we found that the popular show had been transformed into the last thing you could ever expect.. A paranoia about the intelligence's men after the end of the cold war !...And you know what ? Maybe (Tom Cruise) will love it and consider it his ticket to the world of big loud action movies that got sequels every summer like (Lethal Weapon) or (Die Hard) !! So it'll not be (Mission Impossible) any more; it'll become (Mission for Tom Crouse) ! Or (The Adventures of The Short American Brother of James Bond) !!" That was my unpublished comment about the movie right after watching it for the very first time in 1996 (I found it lately in forgotten papers of mine) and it just said it all for sure, especially when I read it in 2007 after two sequels already and more destruction for the original lovable (MI) which was a landmark in the TV history and in the espionage genre itself.As for the movie, we all know that it's about nothing but 2 memorable sequences (thrilling heist one, and so Hollywood action one). Because aside from them there was no understandable plot. Even with so deep concentration, there isn't much to catch on or to just catch ! It's a movie about spies, which looks attractive and respectable but surely not that interesting, intelligible or funny. It is Bond, however taking itself so-over-the-top seriously where it mustn't. Imagine double-crossed, too earnest, and avenger Bond played by poor (Tom Cruise) and all of that out of the (Mission Impossible) TV show ??! Just damn! Hence, that was MI without The MI usual. A smart thriller that didn't show some smart plot. A movie with unconvincing lead. And despite being partly watchable this is naturally a shock for the TV show's fans.Wanna explain everything? I'll do it in one line : Cruise was The Producer of all the three movies. And simply the man wanted some space to make his own action blockbusters NOT a movie with 5 stars about team of 5 agents. However, something in you must scream angrily that he just picked the wrong origin to mess with (where the main wrong happened to the show !). ANYHOW. It's a *different formula* this time (named the Short Bond !) which differs from big part of what the famous title tells or used to tell. So if you want its artistic thriller: then this movie is for you. If you want its downright absurd action : it's part 2. And if you want the best of the previous 2 movies; then it's part 3 for you, which is their more perfect, less far from the original TV show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era when thoughtless, mind-numbing, action movies are everywhere, this movie was a welcome departure from that formula. I am a huge fan of the James Bond series, and it disappoints me when films try to rip-off the James Bond formula. The makers of this movie were wise in not trying to replicate James Bond, and instead creating a different type of spy thriller. Fans of the original TV series have complained about how little resemblance there is between the two. However, I think the movie deserves more credit.While many characters are new or have been changed (I won't give away anymore!), the movie is still about a team of covert operatives. I realize Tom Cruise, as the star, was often on his own, but he wouldn't have been able to succeed without the help of his crew - particularly Ving Rhames. The plot is also full of twists and mysterious characters which make the movie more thrilling than more action sequences could. I give credit to Robert Towne, one of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters, for being able to construct an engaging story that was full of intrigue, surprise, and tense moments. It may take more than one viewing before you can really put together what is going on (similar to Towne's masterpiece, Chinatown).The acting is good from all the leads and character actors. Although Jon Voight is underused, he plays his part very well and adds a new twist to the sophisticated Mr. Phelps character. Emilio Estevez was also amusing in a small part.At times, the slow motion was tedious, but overall, the action scenes are excellently done and come together well.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Smart Effective Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In days when big budget violent action films seem to captivate the world in the big screen it's nice to see an action blockbuster that has more than great stunts and effects to support it's weight. Adapted from the highly succesful TV show (Although it bears few similarities), this film sees IMF team betrayed and murdered leaving only agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) to solve the case and discovers more than he expected along the way. Brian De Palma crafted a really great film and Cruise delivers one of those "Great Tom Cruise Performaces" that he perfected in 'Risky Business', 'Cocktail' and 'Jerry Maguire'. It takes a while to get going with a promising first scene let down by several boring ones until the plot really kicks in leaving us with a good feeling as we leave the cinema at the end. It had the chance of being a simple James Bond rip off but, in the first few minutes, proves itself to be a very different kind of film although less complex than some of the Bond adventures. It wasn't until I finished watching it until I realised that there isn't a large amount of action at all in the film. It relies more on it's characters and plot than any action and as the film goes on, Cruise and De Palma pulls us into the increasingly complicated plot but without ever getting us too confused. The supporting cast are a miracle too. Jon Voight proves he's a walking bag of talent and surprises and Jean Reno stands out in his fairly small role. Add to that the likes of Emmanuelle Beart and Ving Rhames and you have an effective hi-tech intelligent thriller that grips you from the familiar theme tune at the start to the reprisal at the end. An excellent peice of filmmaking with an interesting sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comparison of M:I-1 &amp; M:I-2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible 1 is a movie about an agent getting framed and then solving a mystery. It's more of a Thriller than an Action movie. Mission: Impossible II is a completely different kind of movie. It's just like every other average action movie: Lots of action, not much plot, a boring bad guy and a good looking woman.Mission: Impossible 1 is definitely a much better movie than M:I-2. But it does still have quite a few flaws. I often have trouble following plots. But after watching Mission Impossible twice I still don't understand all of what's going on and I don't think I'm the only person who has this problem. This doesn't stop the film from being entertaining, but it's a bit annoying. I think I understood everything in M:I-2, not that there is much to understand.What annoys me the most about Mission: Impossible 1 is the fact that Jim (Jon Voight), one of the most important characters, isn't around for most of the movie. So his character didn't really get very developed. As for Claire, I don't think the movie would be any different if she weren't in it.The characters in Mission Impossible II are more traditional. The villain is someone who used to work with Ethan but has now turned bad. He has a Scottish accent, to let us know that he's the bad guy. If Ethan's boss hadn't said anything, I would have never guessed that the villain and Ethan worked with each other. They seem like complete strangers.My favorite part of Mission Impossible 1 has got to be the bit where Ethan and his gang steal information from the computer in that room with all the high security. I've seen it spoofed in quite a few other things. M:I-2 doesn't really have anything like that. Except Ethan Hunt retrieving the disease. But that wasn't really the same thing and it just turned into a big action scene with lots of guns. Stuff like that isn't very entertaining these days. Most of the action scenes in M:I-2 also involve loads of slow motion. This is just annoying and not cool.Overall I give Mission: Impossible 3/5 and Mission: Impossible II 2/5. I hope Mission Impossible 3 will be more like the first film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, ever noticed the progress in technology in terms of the way Jim Phelps or Ethan Hunt received mission briefings, i.e. tape recorder in the 80s, CD player in the 90s and a pair of Oakleys in MI2?Being a fan of the TV series, I felt disappointed by the way the Jim Phelps character was treated in this movie. Jim's always been the leader and the "good guy", and although a change in leadership would be timely, there was no need to finish him off as a traitor! Now that's really impossible.Also, I support the opinion that MI is turning into a Bond copy. The distinctiveness of the series is that there's no single "super agent", but instead a TEAM of specialists, each with different skills and supporting each other to achieve their objectives. In MI2, it's become "Super" Ethan Hunt and his 2 "assistants", one to hack computers for him and the other to drive him around! At least James Bond could do everything himself!Despite these, I think MI1 is a well-made movie. Europe will always be the best location for a spy flick, a notion most recently proved by The Bourne Identity.</fullReview>

Dont waste your time seeing the second one if youve not seen this one first because, this film is so much more cryptic than the second. Theres a lot more to it. The second film is all hyped up on tricks and stunts and special effects, which can be appealing, but the first film makes you think.

		<fullReview>I tried to give a chance to this film on 3 different occasions.Unfortunately, this movie is so bad that it is impossible to focus on what's going on because watching insects fly by your TV screen is more captivating.The idea of Tom Cruise hanging by a rope not being supposed to touch the ground or the walls was definitely lifted from "The Treasure Of Four Crowns" (1982) and there's nothing less plausible than a helicopter in a tunnel anyway...All in all, this is just another bad movie by very over-rated (yet eclectic) director Brian De Palma whose most successful films had mainly a good story (that he rarely wrote). "Mission: Impossible" is the ultimate proof that a movie is worthless without a good story, no matter how famous the director is.How Emmanuelle Beart wasted her time and talent being a part of this money-hungry production is still a mystery to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfaithful to the TV series which emphasized clever teamwork.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie supports the theory that there is no movie idea so good that it can't be ruined if the producer and director have too much money to spend. Once upon a time there was a TV series called "Mission Impossible" which employed an ensemble cast of actors portraying espionage agents very dependent upon clever strategies, accurate timing and teamwork to carry out their risky assignments. They all had plenty of work to do and, for the most part, played their parts extremely well. It came as quite a shock to me that the concepts of mutual dependence and trust were abandoned in this new movie, replaced by the concept that nobody can be trusted and nothing is what it seems to be. Three of the world's most talented living actresses, Emmanuelle Beart, Vanessa Redgrave and Kristin Scott Thomas, appear in the new movie and none of them have anything significant to get across to the audience. I was especially disappointed that Ms. Beart, of `Manon des Sources' fame, did not have a better part. Her English is almost flawless in an era when many American actors are rewarded for their ability to speak unintelligibly. I hope that she gets a better English language script soon. It's been quite a while since any new work of Ms. Bearet, in any language, has appeared on US coded DVD or VHS! Worst of all, I got sick of seeing Tom Cruse doing most of the espionage work that had previously been assigned to a team of actors portraying specialists in the old TV series. Rightly or wrongly, he came across as an egomaniac.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard so much hype about this from my friends and family, that I finally went out an rented it. I'll say it was an awesome movie, but it could of been so much more than what it was. It started out great, The little sequence at the beginning (and end) with the self destructing message was a good twist to it, making it that more familiar with the original. The first mission was also very good. How much it was thought out and planned and how each character did their own small part which all added up to a big goal was also very good. So much build up here which was all exceptionally good. Than BAM! Something happens (which I won't say) and the movie just stops. For the next 40 minutes was nothing but a mindless swarm of crappy drama which made my eyes water from looking at the screen for so long without anything worth watching happening. It is just plain BORING! though some points in this emotional gap are important to the story, it is just to long and to dull without anything in between to keep the pace. What they needed was a really good fight scene some where in the middle of this dull spot, plus deleting about two or three scene's that made it drag on and on. I have no problem with an emotional aspect to the film, in fact, I think it's important to make the characters seem more real rather than these wooden, glassy characters you get in the average movie, but it was just to much.Finally, after 40 minutes of drag, the movie picks up pace and makes up for lost time. When they sneak into that vault for the computer data was just thrilling. Watching *Jack* hang over the floor like a fish made me nearly jump up from my seat in tension. Very well done. And from there the movie just keeps getting better and better till they reach one of THE best movie endings of all time! The sharp twist at the end was so unexpected, and very shocking. While Sixth Sense did a much better job with the same idea, you just can't compare movies with the Sixth Sense. The last Action Sequence was one of the most original I have ever seen. You expected another martial art blow out just like they do in just about every movie, but instead they did this brilliant 20 minutes of stunning action which, as far as I know, has never been done quite like this. It was thrilling, Exciting, nerve-wrecking, suspenseful and completely unpredictable. However, Those who like it somewhat reasonably realistic will roll their eyes. But look past that and you have yourself some of the best 20 minutes of genuine action.Overall, it's a good movie. Tom Cruise does an Excellent job with his role, as does the rest of the cast. It was brilliantly written and directed, the Plot and storyline were brilliant. It's unfortunate they made that 40 minute soap opera so dull and draggy. It takes a lot points away from my overall rating. They definitely needed some serious editing there. It's a shame, This film had such great potential to being one of the best. But it is an awesome film, and therefore deserves a 7.1/10, but only because of it's ending, the only redeeming factor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible is a great movie. It's hard to understand and you have to watch the beginning to understand the movie. The first time I saw was in theatres, which than I did not understand it. But recently, I watched it again. I stared at the screen for the whole two hours and made some improvement in understanding it. I'll have to watch many times before I have it down pat. Which I don't understand is why so many people complained about the second movie, M:I2. I thought the sequel was also a great movie. It was different in every way. The sequel was a movie with pure action, because it had a director that goes for a fast paced action movie, John Woo. M:I and M:I2 cannot be compared in anyway what so ever. They're both great movies in different ways. I liked M:I2 because of the action sequences, especially the motorcycle part, and the fight at the beach. Some of the martial arts that was performed by Tom Cruise was awesome, even though some of it is physically impossible. So if you want to see an action movie that's easy to understand, see M:I2. Now if you want to see a movie that has that has intensity, you'll want to see Mission Impossible. It's a movie that makes you think, and if you can figure out the whole movie in a quick amount of time, it means that you're good at paying attention. If you can figure out MI:2 in a quick amount of time, it means you're normal, because anybody can. The reason I think both movies are great is because they succeeded at what they we're aiming for. M:I had the intensity and the complex plot. M:I2 had the action and the great stunts (mountain climbing scene especially) and the easy plot. M:I was closer to the original show. M:I2 was more like a James Bond film. Mission Impossible for now gets a 9/10. I prefer action movies more. I also wrote a comment on the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most frequent complaint I hear about Mission: Impossible is that the plot is too complex, too hard to follow. But that's what sets this apart from other gun-shooting, stuff-blowing-up movies. Instead of just being eye candy, like most (but not all) action films, Mission: Impossible has a little substance to it.Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on the run from his own government organization, because he is suspected of playing a part in the death of his entire operating team. He must work as a rogue agent, outsmarting the very men who trained him to become a ghost. The plot twists and turns every which way as the movie progresses, until you are certain that there is nobody Ethan can trust.The cinematography in this film stands out. The action sequences are few and far between, but are completely original and simply fun to watch. And who can forget the famous scene where Ethan enters the white super-security room, tethered to the ceiling? How could you not be on the edge of your seat? I recommend this movie for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie moves with an intense and incredible pace. In fact its so fast that you can't tell what's going on. Some of my favourate films are ones you have to see many times before you truly understand them, Blade Runner for example. Unfortunatly its not so with this film. If you see it more than once its just trying to understand the plot, not the feelings, unlike in the previously mentioned Blade Runner. Its not saying: what's the significance of this? The performances are also quoite good (especially Cruise's and Voight's), but the real reason why you should watch this film is its ending (or at least quite near its ending.) Towards the end Cruise is chased into a helicoppter which is bearing down on him (he's on the train's roof.) The two or three minutes as Cruise blows up the helichoppter with a piece of explosive chewing gum are fiercely intense and amazing! You should watch this film just for the sake of that scene. I know it sound terrible, but for those of you who don't like action there's the plot, the performances, the love interest, ect... The only problem with this film is the plot. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were to discuss the many technical faults with this film, I would be typing for hours. Let me just say that the film is no worse than Casualties of War (1989), and not as good as The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990). Heavy handed, this special effects extravaganza, is condescending, and without question a slap in the face to anyone with a technical back ground of any kind. I admit that the film does have its moments and those moments are fine-ones at that. But I'm commenting on a film and as a such was disappointed by what I was expected to take for granted or overlook in support of the campaign for best exploding fish tank scene. Maybe I have grown weary of invisible shields that save characters from harm. I have never liked James Bond flicks for this reason. Expedience is one thing but asking me to suspend reason as well as belief is going too far. I'm not some ignoramus who needs to be spoon fed enough half baked plot line to get me from one special effect to the next. Yes the special effects are wonderful, but so are Air Shows with huge military aircraft blasting to-and-fro with incredible speed at tremendous decibels. I've said this before and will say it again : the give-away that any film is poorly produced is its dialog. The dialog is not bad, it's not even delivered badly, its just that it adds no value. I've enjoyed all manner of air shows and all kinds of fire works displays, heck I've even enjoyed watching a wrecking crew take down a building from time to time and all without one shred of dialog. Silence is golden and brevity the harbinger of intelligence. The film is also a serious slap in the face of women and visible minorities. You "can" forgive the subordination of females much as you can the subordination of visible minorities in "older films". You cannot do so in modern films. There is no excuse for putting the women and Negroes in this film into subordinate roles. The women in this film are no more than Barbie-Dolls. Brainless Barbie-Dolls who apparently cannot even make coffee correctly. The important stuff is done by the white guys and everyone else is expendable. The film, unfortunately, sends a seriously outdated message to the younger members of the viewing audience. If your looking for celluloid fireworks, this film will deliver the goods and plenty of them at that. If you're looking for a good film, you'll have to look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this the perfect film for Lilly-2 or what? The plot is preposterous, the dialogue absurd, the acting has such wonderful facial expressions, the so-called state-of-the-art technology is, ofcourse, state-of-the-art special effects and nothing more and that WONDERFUL "fish-in-the-Venice-plaza" scene! What other film has ever given us a scene like that? I dare anyone to name one!I always respected DePalma as a great director. I always thought Robert Towne was a superior writer. Tom Cruise is a fine movie-star of an actor and Jean Reno and Ving Raymes are superb character actors, no matter how bad the parts they sometimes have to do bring home those Hollywood paychecks. I like these guys. Well, old John Voight is hard to like. Our Past-Midnight Cowboy should have an enriching career as a bad guy as he ages. Maybe he'll learn to speak Portuguese?Do you think DePalma and Cruise would sign off on a new soundtrack for this film? I mean, you get some young guys from Harvard Lampoon, some Saturday Night Live comedy writers, some guys who are actually funny (leave us old guys out!) and they could put a hip script to this flick that would leave people rolling in the aisles forever.This is THE perfect film for What's Up Tiger Lilly Two. You could not find better footage if you searched for eons. Come,on Tom. Come, on Brian. Whaddayasay????? You don't think people have a right to laugh? There are so few good comedies nowadays.

If you have a laser pointer, turn it on, and point somewhere, you wouldn't see the path of the light.

		<shortDescription>Just a bit different from your average action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action films, they come and go, thrill you while you sit there in the seat and when they're finished, they're gone from your mind. Some however, stick in your mind a little longer, and some you can even watch again, and again, and again.Mission: Impossible is one of those action films. What is it that first made it stick in my mind? Well, it starts off as a typical, though rather high technical, espionage thriller, albeit one with a flashier than usual opening credits sequence. But from this the film plays on your expectations, bred by years of action and thriller movies that have run together on the same clichés, and of course, the original series, and within 40 minutes the audience is left bewildered, breathless and with absolutely no idea where this thing is going to go next. And it lives up to these expectations, throwing the audience into increasingly complex situations, casting questions on the morality of all of the cast members, even Tom Cruise. It delivers surprises right until the end.Of course some of these things are big no-no's for Hollywood, and a lot of people are left confused and in the dark by this movie. Yes, there are some problems with dialouge, and it does sometimes go a little over the top and a little "Yeah Right!" but, hey, it's Mission: Impossible isn't it?OK so riveting on first viewing, but what would make us want to see it again once you know all the surprises waiting? You could argue for director Brian De Palma and Screenwriters excellent build-up of paranoia, but then of course there are the set pieces, the trap at the start, the CIA break in, and of course, that train sequence, implausible, but brilliant stuff. </fullReview>

But dispite that, I still found myself enjoying this picture a lot.I won't attempt to explain the plot but it does involve a lot of high-tech stuff. But lets talk about what Mission: Impossible is really about: globetrotting adventures, high-tech spy machines, international espoinage, double-crosses and shady characters. There are a lot of memorable scenes in this adventure like when Tom Cruise is breaking through super tight security in the CIA or when a helicopter is being towed by the Orient Express through a tunnel. This film is plenty of fun and has a great cast.You proboably won't understand the plot (it took me several viewings) but you will probably have fun with the movie none the less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Your Mission, reader, should you care to accept is, is to follow the plot of the movie 'Mission: Impossible'. Of course, if you fail, you will be forced to join the ranks of hundreds of thousands of other hapless and confused movie-goers..."If you, the leery movie rental connoisseur, feel you may fail at the above described mission, then be comforted by the old phrase, "If at first you don't succeed...' oh you know the rest. My point being, the main point of interest of this movie is the carefully woven plot.If you're not a plot kinda' person, than perhaps you should skip this movie. About all it's good for are a bunch of scenes featuring Tom Cruise with that mid-90's appeal. If you're not a plot kinda' person but ARE a computer junkie (such as myself) then this movie will be more fun than watching a 1970's ESD training video put out by IBM (and that IS funny). References to the `686 with RISC AI chip' and the sight of the 230 meg floptical disk will surely please the geek in you.But seriously, despite what the confused masses say about this film, the plot IS good.... if you can manage to follow it. Watch it once for the action and now pale CGI scenes (if that's what they are) and watch it again for the plot. It's rather satisfying when you finally figure out who's accusing who of what, who's on who's side, and who in the movie is actually more confused than the audience.All in all, `Mission: Impossible' is a good movie and is worth a watch or two. Give it a watch or two and if you're still confused, `all knowledge of you and your mission will be officially disavowed'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silliness trumps action. (warning: minor spoiler(s))</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess it's been a little while since I've seen "Mission: Impossible," and I was prompted to write a brief review solely by my brief amazement at hearing of "Mission: Impossible 2".I shouldn't have been amazed, of course. Mission: Impossible MADE MONEY. And to be honest, it wasn't that bad a movie. Some of my friends thought it was great.Neither was it anything even remotely approaching a great movie. It had its moments, but the movie's climax (?) was, in my opinion, just downright gosh-darn-groan silly. Mission Impossible? Uh, yeah.Tom ("Butt of Triple-Case-Hardened Steel") Cruise is OK as the star. I suppose the movie is somewhat true to the original TV series, in the sense that the plot twists and turns, there are surprises and betrayals, but I was frankly disappointed that the movie basically trashed the whole story line/ original characterization of the series.One good thing is the Mission: Impossible complexity. You really need to watch it a few times to catch all the details of what's going down. And in fact, I did find it worth more than one watch, if only for that reason. Look for a good scene at CIA headquarters and, yes, the ending is intended to be exciting -- but to me it just drowned in the silliness, like my daughter's french fries in ketchup.There are plenty of worse movies. I give it about a 5 or 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definitive spy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very watchable movie that does stay true to the paranoid feeling and complex missions of the original TV series. However, the team concept of the series was pretty much gone from the film, and the action could have been more abundant. The best sequence of the movie had to be the scene at CIA Headquarters in Langley, VA. The intense skill to both act and direct that sequence makes the film truly worth seeing. I don't think I started breathing again until after they sped out of the facility. It was *that* suspenseful and absolutely memorable! Small wonder that scene is on the posters and the movie jacket for the video. Yet, it was only one of a very disappointing few action sequences in the film.The biggest problem that I saw with the movie was that it was too much a star vehicle for Tom Cruise rather than the team chemistry that the original series did so well. Cruise as Ethan Hunt sees his entire team killed and has to trust two former agents who are shady at best as well as the wife of his fallen leader, Jim Phelps. Not to spoil it for those that haven't watched it yet, but I did not really like the producers' idea for the bad guy in this one. It definitely ruins the enjoyment for many of the faithful fans of the original series. Though I admit that I enjoyed this film after numerous viewings, I certainly hope that the action in the upcoming sequel is much more abundant (ABSOLUTELY guaranteed with John Woo directing), and the team concept is back. After all, this is not supposed to be Ethan Hunt, the American answer to James Bond, but the chronicles of the IMF. Cruise was very good as Hunt, but let's face it, this is his first sequel of *any* movie he has ever done and only because he is one of the executive producers. If he didn't have that other title, we might have never seen another Mission Impossible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll spare you a set up the story and just get right to the review:Mercifully, the movie has a very nice, quick pace so it's not as bad as it could have been. The first 20-30 minutes are just plain boring and there are a lot more boring parts to this movie. But besides, quick pacing it does have other shining points. Some of the cast delivers. Vanessa Redgrave is great as Max, the crime boss that wants the NOC list. Her first scene with Tom Cruise is very well done and humorous. It's a shame she wasn't in more of the movie. Tom Cruise is good as Ethan Hunt from when he meets Max to the end of the movie. For the first half hour, he was just awful. And that crew cut just looks awful on him. Very distracting. Ving Rhames adds another good performance into the pile, though he hasn't much to do, he does well with what he has. The rest of the cast is very mediocre.The 2 only action sequences are thankfully fantastic. The first is in IMF HQ in Langley, VA where Hunt tries to obtain the NOC list is very suspenseful as he has to pass 3 security systems to obtain the NOC list. The other is when he must chase down the bad guy (I ain't sayin' who it is for those who haven't seen it) on top a high-speed train, while the bad guy tries to get on a helicopter. And the train is about to go in a tunnel! The mayhem was so exciting!!While it had these good things, there are a lot of bad things to overshadow them. First of all, the overall mediocre acting and the fact that there are only TWO action scenes!! Just two!? No wonder this movie got so boring! They only come in the last 30-40 minutes of the movie! Which brings me to another point, this movie should not have been an hour and 50 minutes. They should have cut out 15-20 minutes of the boring dramatic scenes. The score by Danny Elfman is also incredibly bad. In the very few instances he used the famous M:I theme, it was good and added to the scenes. And Brian De Palma uses some weird camera angles to "enhance" the drama, but it's really just distracting, like Tom Cruise's haircut.To sum up, it had some very good moments, but there were too many boring sequences and bad acting to make it good. It just winds up in the mediocre. It's too bad because this could have been a fantastic summer flick. Barely worth seeing. **?/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being just 16 years old, I didn't really get the chance to see the TV series of Mission Impossible, except for those occassions in the school holidays when they were on at noon. I knew that the series was supposed to be good, so I decided to watch the film version.From the moment the famous theme tune kicks in, you WILL be glued to your seat. The plot, however, is a little confusing (I had to watch it two more times to grasp what exactly what was going on), but Brian De Palma has handled it well enough to create a sense of paranoia around the main character Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise in what has to be his best role since Top Gun).It has everything a 'spy' film should have, including moles, double agents, and a variety of gadgets. The finale is a classic moment in film history, and the twist in the plot is very unpredictable, and in my books unpredictability is not a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't a bad film. TOM CRUISE plays a spy who "must come in from the cold" to clear his name when he is framed for treason. This film features a great cast including JEAN RENO, JON VOIGHT, and VING RHAMES. The one problem I had with this film was the fact that the JIM PHELPS character from the original show goes bad and starts stealing secrets. This didn't work for me. The Phelps character (played in this film by JON VOIGHT) should have been a different character. This plot point diminishes the original series to a certain extent. The film looks great and features a imaginative break-in scene revolving around the CIA's Langely Facility and ETHAN HUNT's (Tom Cruises) need to clear his name and access computer info. Another aspect I like about this film was that some of it was actually shot in Europe, giving it a authentic feel. It's a pity Depalma won't do the sequel as he and Cruise butted heads over this one.</fullReview>

But if you don't really care about matching the old series with this movie (like myself) then give this baby a try- you won't regret it.It is a very good movie as a thriller ("WHO THE HECK IS THE BAD GUY AROUND HERE?!!", "HOW THE HECK WILL HE INFILTRATE INSIDE THE CIA BUILDING?!!", etc) and very entertaining. I also liked that chewing gum that is in reality a bomb.I only found three problems in this movie:1- No movement detector in a top-security CIA computer room??? Give me a break!2- An helicopter... in a tunnel??? Too impossible to be true. You may find it ridiculous.3- The plot is a little bad.So I give this movie a 8/10. I think I am going to watch the Mortal-Kombat-styled Mission Impossible 2, but I doubt it is going to be better than this one. Tom Cruise fighting Kung-Fu or something? I guess he will, who knows...

		<fullReview>Watching "Mission: Impossible" is like watching a two-hour movie trailer: dazzling locales, pulsating music, nifty gadgets,lots of close-ups of actors sweating, and improbable action sequences that seem to be over long before they start. The dialogue is like that, too. Every line is delivered for maximum dramatic impact and was most likely written so that it could "lifted" from the film and easily placed in radio and television ads. All that noise made me wonder if the filmmakers were trying to distract us from the plot, which alternates between intriguing and implausable, cohesive and confusing. Director Brian DePalma makes his usual homages to Hitchcock (a wronged man trying to clear his name) as well as other contemporary espionage dramas, such as the James Bond films (does the phrase "Do you have a match?" ring a bell, "From Russia, With Love" fans?), "Clear and Present Danger" (Henry Czecy's character sure looks familiar) and Robert Redford's "Three Days of the Condor" ("My team is dead!")

I found it great and liked it very much, but...A few things made me sad:That Jim Phelps was the bad guy---; Why? Please tell me...one of the best characters of the series.I missed the 'Plot' tune composed by Lalo Schrifin. This was great music. Not that Danny Elfman did a bad job, but why not let Lalo do it. Like the series were the 'child' of Bruce Geller, so was the music for Lalo.And, ofcourse, I missed the happy end. I know, but I just missed the relief that the mission was ended well, with ALL the team members.Well that was it. I would like to hear your thoughts about the movie and my comments.greetings, M@rlow.P.S. What did you think of the series from the 80's?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission Impossible was far from a favorite of mine when I first saw it in the theater in 1996. It was a movie I saw as an excuse to go out with my Girlfriend. I don't know how much attention I paid to it. However, when it arrived on video, I watched it again and loved it. It is a confusing film, yes, but that's part of it's excellence. Once you get it, mainly that Hunt was working for Kitteridge the entire time, it is a brillant piece of film making. DePalma is a filmmaker par excellence. He knows how to shoot a film. I really do like this film. I like it's confusing plot. I really do. I also think that the scene where they break into Langley is absolutely incredible. I may sound like an idiot, but this is in my top ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible was the second most successful movie of 1996. Although it beat the moderate tornado flick Twister, it lost out to the special-effects display pretending to be a film Independence Day. It should easily have come first. Impossible is one of the most complicated summer movies for a long time, and a lot of people didn't understand it. Even I didn't first time - but I still enjoyed it immensely even though I sat in the cinema wondering exactly what was going on. Director De Palma is far more talented than typical blockbuster directors (i.e. Roland Emmerich) and it shows. The movie has a very mysterious start in the fog-shrouded streets of Prague, and goes on getting more and more tense and exiting until the incredibly cool final climax - and the bit when Cruise leaps onto the helicopter and the music starts- woah...De Palma is a Hitchcock fan and you can certainly tell by this movie, using Hitchcock's favourite theme of a wrongly-accused man on the run. And it's far more entertaining than any of Alf's movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, Entertaining Summer Fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have remarked that the plot was difficult to follow. I cannot agree; I found this to be a straightforward, formulaic Hollywood style action/thriller movie, and quite easy to follow if one pays the slightest attention.That said, though, it was an extremely well done formulaic Hollywood style action/thriller. If you're not expecting deep sub-texts, moral dilemmas, characters deeper than the average puddle, or anything at all very thought-provoking, this can be a very enjoyable flick. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) turns out to be more wily and resourceful than the average action hero. The computer-oriented mumbo jumbo is marginally less awful than in typical Hollywood fare. Many of the individual bits are derivative of other movies, but they are each done well and put together well.The much hyped "breaking into the ultra secure computer room through the ceiling" scene, in particular, was a pretty obvious rip-off of the climatic theft scene in "Topkapi". (I see "Gislef" has commented on "Topkapi," indicating that Mission Impossible was actually BASED on "Topkapi." Well, I guess I learn something new every day.)Bring popcorn. It's that sort of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How in the world could this film ever have been a commercial success? I cannot believe this one didn't die like "The Avengers" the weekend after it opened. But some people did like it. Unbelievable. I don't want to give away anything here, but I really must ask, "Would you accept a story in which Sherlock Holmes turned out to be Jack the Ripper? Would you accept a story in which James Bond assassinates the Queen?" Well, not me. This movie's plot was full of holes, the main character behaved stupidly, and the special effects showed activities that were outrageously impossible. (A helicopter tethered to a bullet train was actually FLYING in a tunnel! I couldn't even laugh at that, it was so ridiculous.) Some misguided souls say they like a movie that doesn't make them think. The trouble with this one is that you MUSN"T think about it, else you will seek out the producers to demand back the two hours of your life you have wasted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE CASE OF THE RED AND BLUE CHEWING GUM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that Brian dePalma had to direct a movie produced by Tom Cruise, I was a little bit astonished and when it appeared that the project was MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, I really expected the worse. How a personality like dePalma would cope with those virtual chains ?As always with dePalma movies, the critics were divided; the scale was zero to ten.I think that we should see this movie by always having in mind that the director didn't have the liberty he used to have in his precedent movies. So, let's search Brian in this blockbuster.Tom Cruise receives, in the first minutes of the movie, a few red and blue chewing gums whose function is to help him to open rebellious key-holes. Cruise uses those tablets twice in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. To open doors ? Not at all, he uses them to destroy glasses, mirrors. How curious isn't it ?And you begin to realize there is very much glass in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE : screens of TV's, PC's, glasses with incorporated cameras, etc... O.K. Brian, we've understood you're here, behind the mirror, behind the masks, one of the other recurrent theme of this movie.Then you can recognize SCARFACE and the hero of RAISING CAIN in Jim Phelps, a man whose thirst of power reveals a multiple personality. And there is this wonderful scene when Jim Phelps tells Cruise what's happened in Kiev unknowing that his agent visualizes the same scene, with an other point of view of course, during his explanation. Isn't it a subtile version of the split-screen process, a dePalma gimmick by essence ?No doubt about it, this movie is one of the three best american movies of 1996.A DVD which is already a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong, tense thriller ... but pay attention!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joining other recent thrillers such as "The Usual Suspects" and "L.A. Confidential" in the realm of mind-twisting suspense, "Mission: Impossible" puts a solid stamp into the genre. While it's not as good as the above two movies, it is worthwhile, intelligent entertainment, though not for the cerebrally challenged.Those who dismiss it as too confusing have most likely been spoon-fed for a bit too long on a few key movie trends as of late. Recently, in order to not baffle its audience, a movie has not only had to present everything such that what is happeneing is exactly but it seems, but everything has to be repeatedly explained in monosyllabic words. Thankfully, the occasional flick such as this comes around that doesn't assume the audience has a collective IQ below 70.For the movie itself, the acting is strong, with Cruise casted perfectly as Ethan Hunt, and a surprisingly effective cameo by Emilio Estevez. The plot hums along, and the heist scene is one of the most suspenseful I've seen in a while. If you are capable of paying attention, and do, this is a very fun movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Cruise said somewhere that this was a film people weren't expected to understand first-go. Sounded like a revenue-raising plot to me, but the film certainly achieves that purpose.Let me hand out the kudos before the raspberries. It is a spectacular extravaganza of a movie which I enjoyed immensely in watching it. Some of the suspenseful moments (of which there are many) are the best edge-of-your-seat scenes one could ever ask for. The action scenes like at the end, though unbelievable, are explosive to watch. And the film does give you a nice, humourous break in the middle, when Ethan Hunt is hanging from the roof. And the music speaks for itself.But the trouble is, all the above is OK for those who just want entertainment and don't care about the plot. However, most people would be hooked onto the plot, and come out rather confused. Part of the problem comes through the dialogue, much of which is in reflective, but inaudible whispers. Ethan Hunt's flashback sequence just does not work. You can work out the plot if you think about it for a while, but the best films are those which leave you marvelling at its execution and how everything is well unravelled.Not this one. You're too busy thinking the plot through. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A baffling and occasionally boring waste of the licence - 65%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It might have taken a while but Brian De Palma's much-maligned thriller has finally been ticked off my List Of Shame. Why so long, you may ask? Well, some films carry the stench of stigma for quite some time (take "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", for example) and this uber-complicated Cold War spy flick is one such effort, blighted by a confusing and muddled plot and not exactly currying favour the original TV cast. But as if often the case, the film isn't nowhere near as bad as you might think. Yes, the script is dire and like most of his films, it quickly turns into the Tom Cruise Show. But if you can ignore or forgive the flaws then you'll be rewarded with a stylish tale of treachery, espionage and genuinely exciting set pieces. I just wish that I could ignore or forgive them.Cruise plays super-spy Ethan Hunt, one of a team of IMF agents operating under the command of veteran Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) in Prague. Their mission is to catch the theft of a list of spy aliases (known as a NOC list) and to identify the mastermind behind the operation. Tragically, the mission goes belly-up, resulting in the deaths of his colleagues and the NOC list falling into unknown hands. Contacted by IMF Director Eugene Kitteridge (Henry Czerny) who hints that a mole may exist in the agency, Ethan quickly figures out that he is the chief suspect and flees in order to clear his name. His only lead is the name of the person who still seeks the NOC list, a shady weapons dealer by the name of Max (Vanessa Redgrave)? In its simplest terms, "Mission: Impossible" is a series of action sequences strung together by long, dialogue-heavy bits in order to further the plot. You could rightly argue that most action films do this but few confuse and confound quite as much as this does ? I could understand what was happened but rarely could I figure out why. Come the film's climax and I'd long given up trying to work out who was doing what to whom and why. The film's opening tells the audience that nothing is to be taken at face value (literally) but then, De Palma tries to get us to do exactly that because if you'd stop to ask any questions then the film unravels faster than a loo roll in a public toilet. The stellar cast (Voight, Redgrave, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jean Reno, Ving Rhames, Emilio Estevez in a cameo) don't get nearly enough screen time compared to Cruise who does the stunt work with his usual gusto and flashes his million-dollar smile. Away from the plot and the action is surprisingly good, even if it is a little far-fetched. For example, any Englishman knows that a helicopter could never fly into the Channel Tunnel or that any aquarium in a restaurant could never have that much water inside, even on the continent. Like the plot, it's best not to ask too many questions because you suck all the fun out of it. When I watch street magic, I'd rather not know how the trick is done ? the same way that I don't bother counting the number of bullets Clint Eastwood can fire from a single Smith &amp; Wesson without reloading.But my biggest gripe is that this could have been any spy film. It didn't need the "Mission: Impossible" tag in order to dupe unsuspecting punters and given the film's blatantly disrespectful approach to the original, it's clear that this has as much to do with the TV show as the Easter Bunny does with Christmas. Aside from the memorable theme music which still sounds as good as ever like most Mancini tunes do, this attempts to desecrate the memory of the show in order to start up a generic action-spy franchise with Cruise as the star, as though he's annoyed that nobody offered him a shot at the role of 007 and he decided to do it himself. It's also dated (the Cold War ended in 1989 so who exactly do the IMF spy on?) and ultimately, irrelevant ? within five years, Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne in "The Bourne Identity" would reinvigorate the entire spy genre to such a degree that even the Bond producers were forced to up their game. All the while, Cruise was still relying on his dangling-on-a-rope routine shown here in at least two sequels. There's no love or enjoyment behind it, as though everyone was simply going through the motions and ticking off the usual spy clichés. Of the first three films, I'd go with the second ? it's more exciting and easier to follow than the others. Given a free choice, however, I'd go with Bourne or Bond any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is the mole?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the odd episode of the television series as a child but it was long enough ago that by the time I came to watch the film I'd forgotten so much about it that I could view this as a totally new product; which is probably for the best. It was clear from early on that this was going to be a star packed adventure as the team included Tom Cruise; Kristen Scott Thomas, Emilio Estevez and Jon Voight? at least it seemed that way until the first mission we see leaves most of the team dead and their target free with the 'NOC List'; a list giving the names and code names of every CIA asset in Eastern Europe! Cruise plays the team's leader, Ethan Hunt, and after that debacle the CIA believes he is the mole? they already suspected somebody and as the sole survivor it must be him? or must it? As part of their mole hunt they had placed a fake list so anybody who uses it will get caught. Soon it becomes clear that there was a second survivor; Claire Phelps. After some distrust he eventually decides that she isn't the mole and sets about finding who wanted the list so he can bait them with the real list and expose the mole.This is an exciting thriller with plenty of twists and turns before the end. The surprises started early when characters played by well known actors were killed off and continued right until the end when we learn which previously trusted characters are in fact bad. Tom Cruise puts in a solid performance as Hunt; it is of little surprise that he continued to play the role in an ever increasing franchise. The rest of the cast support him convincingly as Hunt and his new team work to catch the mole. There are plenty of exciting moments; the best being when they sneak into the CIA headquarters in Langley to steal the real file? if you think too much about the scene it does seem somewhat ridiculous but it is so well handled it doesn't matter? besides this is Mission Impossible after all! Things continue well until the very end then things get unfortunately silly as Hunt chases the bad guy on the roof of a speeding train as it heads towards the channel tunnel? then enters the tunnel with a helicopter attached to it by a cable? there is impossible and there is unbelievable; sadly this was the latter. That said this is just one scene and while it detracted from a previously good film it didn't spoil it for me. Fans of Cruise or of slightly far fetched thrillers should certainly enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this is a very enjoyable movie. There's lots of well paced action, some iconic set pieces (such as the scene where Cruise dangles over the computer, which became an instant classic and so remains). However, it really missed the point of the original series. Mission Impossible was about a team of quirky and talented individuals, working together to overcome impossible odds. This movie is all Cruise, Cruise, and more Cruise. Taken by itself, it's great cinema. But it really has nothing to do with the group dynamic that made Mission Impossible such a special series. Maybe that's a sign of the times, which still continues today 16 years later - it's all about the superstar individual, rather than the team. If you watch this with no preconceptions regarding the original series, however, it's a great popcorn flick.</fullReview>

But to kill off Emilio Estevez so quickly just seemed...abrupt, not to mention cold-hearted. And Phelp's justification of it was not nearly convincing enough. After all, these were people with whom he had worked for decades! However, if someone saw this who had never seen the original, they may enjoy it as an introductory movie. But without the sequels, this would have been terrible. As a launch to the sequels, especially the third, this was halfway decent. Halfway. That's why I give it a five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie, Mission Impossible starring Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, follows his almost impossible task of clearing his name and finding the mole after a mission breaks down and his team is eliminated. The team consisted of Jim Phelps (Jon Voigt), his wife Claire Phelps (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite) and Jack (Emilio Estevez). The mission, to stop an American diplomat from selling off a NOC list filled with the identities of covert agents. With Ethan the only one of his team that appeared to be left standing found that the real mission was the attempt by his unofficial CIA organization to smoke out a mole. He is left to seek the truth by making some unlikely alliances and commit to steal the real NOC list and sell it off to the initial buyers to do some smoking out of his own.The theme of the movie revolves around the idea of the world closing in around someone and in the face of adversity to face it head on and see it through to the end. This can be shown in many action packed sequences in the film when Ethan takes a piece of exploding gum to narrowly escape situations where the audience is felt like he is backed in a corner with nowhere to go. There are other situations in the film where he is trying to prevent the world from closing in around him by placing his own traps to warn him of impending danger. Ethan the hero always tries to stay one step ahead of everyone so that the same repeat of misfortune doesn't rear its ugly head.Mission Impossible falls in the lines of action packed movies like The Bourne Identity or even James Bond movies, smart and inventive keeping audiences on their toes, trying to guide the viewers to think one step ahead with the main character. To emphasize the action in the scenes Mission Impossible incorporates both slow motion and fast paced motion. When Ethan escapes the restaurant after meeting with Kittridge (Henry Czerny), the stick of exploding gum is thrown against an aquarium creating a diversion that follows a slow motion scene of him escaping unharmed. When Ethan is chasing the villain trying to escape from a high speed train to a helicopter, he stops at nothing to make sure that good prevails. Once again the exploding gum saves the day when the helicopter pilot tries to decapitate Ethan with the blades of the helicopter. This sequence, as unrealistic as it seems, is made realistic with the wind whipping the actor's clothes and hair while the background zips by. The sounds are brought to life with the thunderous noise of the train on the tracks, the wind and the helicopter following close behind.The movie isn't a part of my favorite genre and sometimes find myself having to see these action films more than once because there is so much going on. I did like the movie but I can't say it's one of my favorites. It definitely is a must see and recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie with a good plot and action packed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Noc List</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Action packed movie version of the popular 1960's and 70's TV series that has almost the entire "Mission Impossible" team including its top man Jim Phelps, Jon Voight, wiped out within the first twenty minutes of the film.Surviving the carnage Agent Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise, is suspected by his boss Eugene Kittridge, Henry Czerny, in the CIA to be the mole that they suspected infiltrated the Mission Impossible team. It's Kittridge suspicions that Hunt is working for the mysterious arms dealer Mr. Max, who's actually a Mrs, in trying to obtain the NOC List, a list of every CIA Agent in Eastern and Western Europe, for him at the price of a cool 10 million in non negotiable US Government Bonds. We of course know, since he's the star of the film, that Hunt is innocent of all charges but it's up to him to prove it before he ends up getting whacked a a team of CIA assassins!As things turn out Hunt soon realizes that he's in fact being used as bait to bring the real mole out into the open by the clever and anything goes, in finding him, Kittridge. The real NOC List is actually stored in the CIA headquarters computer data base in Langly Virginia. It's Hunt's plan to seal the list and use it as leverage against Kittridge to not only get his dogs, CIA hit-teams, off his back but have both his mom and uncle, (Laura Brock &amp; Morgan Deare), who were framed by Kittridge as being international drug dealers, out of police custody back in the states!***SPOILER ALERT*** Hard to follow at first with the many side plots in it the movie really takes off when Hunt starts to put all the loose ends together and realizes who this mole, code name Job, really is. Playing along with the traitor, to the US as well as Hunt and his fellow agents, Hunt soon finds out that the remaining member of his Mission Impossibe team, who was thought to have be killed in a car explosion, is the mole's back up man or woman in throwing him as well as Kittridge off his trail! This has Max, who thought he was on top of things, misjudge the plan that Hunt had in store for both of them: Max and the Mole codename Job!Tremendous action sequence with Hunt having it out with Job on a bullet train racing from France to England under the Trans-Channel Tunnel at speeds of over 150 MPH. While all this action is going on Job's partner in crime is running interference for him on a helicopter accidentally, by Hunt, attached to the bullet train! The ending has to be seen to be believed with Hunt on the verge of being sliced to ribbons, by the helicopter propellers, turning the tables on Job and his partner, the helicopter pilot, by sticking it to them with a stick of chewing gum that wasn't made to be chewed! But to explode!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable spy flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian DePalma's modern remake of the 1960s MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TV series is highly enjoyable. I find myself re-watching it a lot mainly due to the great set pieces contained throughout the film. A major part of its appeal is the movie-set style cinematography. It doesn't feel like "location shooting". There's a real old Hollywood appeal to the film. It keeps the focus on the characters and situation at hand and gives the film a personal feel. There isn't all this expansive, showy cinematography and crazy effects like in the sequels. It's like the film itself is a multi-act play done on a sound stage or in a studio, kind of a modern day version of those great 30s and 40s films set in foreign places. Yet it still has an appealing modern sensibility.The plot is amazingly simple: a rogue CIA agent plans to steal and sell the non-official cover (NOC) list to the highest bidder on the international market and a team of IMF agents is assigned to stop the transaction. The team is led by Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight) and includes Phelps' wife Claire (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), Jack Harmon (an uncredited Emilio Estevez), and the final member of our team Ethan Hunt(played by the film's star, the versatile Tom Cruise).This is definitely one of my favorite Tom Cruise movies. I always forget about this film in Cruise's arsenal, maybe b/c it's just so enjoyable of a film experience to me and so I forget that I am watching Tom Cruise and just get totally into the film itself. Cruise is truly effortless in his portrayal of Ethan Hunt. He had never really done an action film before this and he is completely believable.Every member of the team (except Ethan) is killed during the mission. The operation was really a mole hunt to weed out the real traitor, so Ethan is suspect #1 in the eyes of the CIA. The rest of the film is Ethan trying to clear his name, so he puts together his own team to find the real culprit. The new team includes Claire (who turns out survived the initial mission), Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). This leads to the best scene of the film: the hacking of the CIA central computer where Hunt has to enter through the ceiling upside down suspended on a tightrope mechanism. I never tire of this suspenseful scene. A DePalma keeper!DePalma directed MISSION IMPOSSIBLE with is usual style of suspenseful, tense, well-laid out scenes, like the CIA break-in where there is the continuous tracking shot of the team going their separate ways to do their various tasks. The film is essentially a series of entertaining, tongue-in-cheek set pieces with tense character interactions as it is hard to know who Ethan can trust in his quest for the truth and THREE memorable set pieces: (1) the early Aquarium restaurant scene in Prague, the (2) aforementioned CIA break-in, and (3) the climactic speeding train scene from London to Paris. I also like the minor tweaks to the MI theme from the 60s series, updated to fit a modern Hollywood film. The plot really plays second fiddle to the action and intrigue, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No classic but an above-average Summer movie that holds up surprisingly well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in Prague before it became synonymous with cheap labor and tax breaks for runaway productions, the initial signs were less than promising for Mission: Impossible - rumors of clashes between Cruise and Brian De Palma, the latter pointedly keeping a very low public profile when the film opened, last-minute heavy re-editing and the dropping of Alan Silvestri's original score (not, it has to be said, anywhere near as effective as Danny Elfman's replacement) - yet the result is a lot more fun than it has any real right to be. There's little relation to the original series aside from the title, Lalo Schifrin's theme music and an ill-done by Jim Phelps, here played by Jon Voight rather than Peter Graves - indeed, the original cast turned down offers of cameos in a film which kills off almost the entire Impossible Mission Force in the first twenty minutes so the star can hog the spotlight. But then, in those days Tom Cruise still sold more tickets than anyone else and the film raked it in - as they say in gangster movies, it's nothing personal, just business.Although it was apparently Emmanuelle Beart's role that bore the brunt of the pre-release cuts, Cruise is in more danger of being overshadowed by co-stars Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, neither of whom get as many close-ups but make up for it with much more unforced charisma and screen presence. The plot doesn't always make sense - there's really no reason to break into the CIA's headquarters in Langley to steal a real list of undercover agents' names to use as bait other than allowing the director to stage a Topkapi-inspired high-wire heist - but it just about serves to fill in the gaps between setpieces, including a neat sequence that's pure De Palma where one character's explanation of events is accompanied by visuals gradually piecing together what really happened and a doozey of an action sequence involving a helicopter in the Channel Tunnel that caused the Bond producers to drop their original storyboarded-but-unshot Channel Tunnel pre-title sequence from the script of GoldenEye as well as boasting a neat line in spectacularly breaking windows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action the order of the day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action is the order of the day when remaking a t.v. smash hit like the ever popular "Mission : Impossible". With this in mind, top line scripters David Koepp, Steven Zaillian and Robert Towne, along with director Brian DePalma, have produced a film complimented with tense, nerve racking scenes and adrenalin pumping action, while the f/x pros supply all the hi-tech gadgetry synonymous with "the team".Tom Cruise, star and co-producer this time, is Ethan Hawke, hot shot point man for Jim Phelps' elite band of covert operatives who undertake those deadly, imperative top secret missions that no-one else can handle. When the team is ambushed and Hawke comes out unscathed, he is immediately suspect and must prove himself innocent of the charge of betrayal, all the while avoiding capture. This catalyst sets the film going as Ethan finds a couple of sympathisers in the disavowed Krieger and Luther. With their help Hawke begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and starts to uncover the identity of the real mole.Whole cast are thoroughly enjoyable, with Cruise leading the way, supported by the lovely Emmanuelle Beart, the increasingly entertaining duo of Jean Reno ("Krieger") and Ving Rhames ("Luther"), and Jon Voight as group leader Jim Phelps. There are a couple of surprise cameos too, form the likes of Kristin Scott-Thomas and Vanessa Redgrave. Obviously it's the look, the pace and the seemingly complex plot that really make the film however.Cinematography, art and sets are all eye catching as the action jumps from one continent to another and back again. Special effects crew (the amazing ILM) save their best for last in the mind blowing finale, set in the London to Paris rail tunnel. Editing keeps the tempo nicely upbeat, while the groovy original theme (Lalo Schifrin) and new music (Danny Elfman) provide fantastic backing.The most effective piece of film making has come from director DePalma and his screenwriters. In presenting the storyline very patchily, it appears to have more depth and intrigue than is the case. The plot presentation is so vague in fact that many viewers have complained about being unable to follow the narrative. In truth, the basic premise and outlay are very simple, yet elusive in detail, thus gaining maximum points from audiences seeking a twisting, winding tale. Careful scrutiny and a little analytical after thought will dissolve the mystery and help you understand what went on.Not quite a master stroke, but "Mission : Impossible" is a flash of genius in the making of an action/thriller form the multi-talented, hit and miss Brian DePalma. Tom Cruise fans, you're in for a treat!Wednesday, July 24, 1996 - Knox District CentreDe Palma's sharply twisting action pic features an expertly arranged screenplay which milks maximum effect from the deceptively complex story. The taut, if stretched, action sequences add to the tension.Lalo Schifrin's original score is cleverly re-worked and it accompanies the enjoyable turns of Cruise, Emmanuelle Seigner, Jon Voight, Jean Reno, Ving Rhames and an uncredited Emilio Estevez.The camera crew and f/x teams add to the spectacle.Saturday, November 22, 1997 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In contrary with its sequels this film is not based only the visuals and action sequences. The director tries to put emphasis also on the storyline and evolution of the characters and resulting in a very good "spyish" atmosphere. OK, also John Woo tries to give style to Tom Cruise, but this results in a ridiculous smooth-macho superman character spiced with white pigeons... This movie also has some ridiculous scenes (like the "I am gonna' kill you with the helicopter rotor, by smashing and cutting you, while you are holding desperately to the back of the train and speeding with 200-250 km/h in the tunnel" scene). But it also has scenes which remained famous and were taken or parodized by other movies (think to the rope scene in the computer room). The movie also delivers a great remake of the famous MI sound theme. The acting is good, Jon Voight, Jean Reno and Tom Cruise are giving stylish performances. Overall, the movie is enjoyable and deserves an above average ranking because the good sound score and it's impact on the action film industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is horrible. Seeing that the average rating on this one at the IMDb is 6.6 at time of writing lends much credence to the oft-held postulate that the planet is increasingly populated by morons.Warrior god Xenu drops nuclear bombs in the volcanoes of the planet Earth only 75 million years ago in an attempt to cure his own civilisation of a slight issue with overpopulation - something on the order of a trillion gajillion zillion of them. This all makes perfect sense. And your mission, Tom, should you choose to accept it, is to go on screen in this shameless waste of a viable premise and make more of an ass out of yourself than even you had been capable of before.You've done everything you could to get an Oscar short of administering group oral sex to the entire AMPAS, so you maybe better concentrate on the green stuff instead - and face the fact your esteemed colleagues just don't like you.Watching Cruise go through the motions of being an action hero is pathetic - and then suddenly it dawns on you: this idiot is so crazy he really believes he's an action hero. He gets to be all the things he isn't in real life. This twit is long gone.In fact, thinking about this - inadvertently thinking about this, it's impossible to avoid, what with all we know today about what a looney tune Cruise is - makes it impossible to take this sorry excuse for a movie seriously.The original small screen formula is easy to research: it's listed here on the IMDb. Perhaps some of the IMDb's bumpkin reviewers would do themselves a service by reading up on it (if in fact they can read - this is open to debate, as we all know, as there is ample evidence they can neither type nor spell).The only light in this movie (aside from the visual delight of Emmanuelle Beart) is Henry Czerny who gets kudos for again (as in Clear and Present Danger) getting the style of the slimy crook down pat. How Czerny does this I do not know: they don't scrape his face as with Le Chiffre - he's always given a robot look and still he can come off as totally threatening. If fact I might even be a bit wary of this bloke if I met him on the street - that's how well I think he does his part.As for the rest of the movie, it's everything the critics said it was - and worse. Far far worse. It appeals only to people with an IQ below zero. Only to people whose brain cells work like amoebas and where Mother Nature is still waiting for that first cataclysmic split. There is no story - none; they dash the premise of the original to smithereens within minutes (leaving one to wonder why they wanted to grab the franchise in the first place) and the plot thereafter makes absolutely no sense at all. Worse, the special effects are horrendous. Cartoons do it better and are more realistic.This is the movie, box office success or no, that finally convinced the world Tom Cruise is nuts. Totally nuts. That he chooses to go out into the world and promote his latest cash cow MI3 while his 'wife' is at home going through labour with her test tube baby is only more evidence that Hollywood have an incredibly unique and totally hopeless loser on their hands.Good night Mr Phelps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no Bond in Mission: Impossible. Instead, the lead character is Ethan Hunt, the point man for Jim Phelps' IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Phelps (played by Jon Voight, not Peter Graves) receives assignment messages from his boss, Kittridge (Henry Czerny), via video transmissions rather than old-fashioned tapes. His group's latest job is to prevent something called a "NOC list" from falling into the hands of an international arms dealer (Vanessa Redgrave). If placed on the open market, the NOC list would put every United States deep cover agent in danger of exposure. However, when they embark on this mission, the IMF runs straight into an ambush where everyone is killed except Hunt and Phelps' wife, Claire (Emmanuelle Beart). Because he survives the carefully-orchestrated massacre, Hunt is suspected of turning traitor.Fans of the TV series expecting a faithful translation may be disappointed. Except for a few nods to its small-screen predecessor, this Mission: Impossible is a vastly different, autonomous entity. Nine years ago, director Brian DePalma used a similar approach for a superior version of The Untouchables, but lightning hasn't struck twice. Teetering on an uncertain edge between action flick and thriller, Mission: Impossible doesn't succeed well as either. There are some high-energy moments, but none offers more than a moment's edge-of-the-seat excitement. Too much of what happens in Mission: Impossible comes across as fait accompli.The predictable plot generates little interest. It's pathetically easy to guess the mole's identity despite the screenwriters' attempts to obscure the issue. The overall storyline contains a legion of gaping holes -- the more you think about it, the less sense it makes. Weak character identification allows Twister to seem like a masterpiece by comparison. In fact, taken as a whole, Twister is a significantly more involving spectacle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a mindless action thriller, it's not bad. Two casting changes would have made for infinite improvement, although they probably would have increased the film's budget by 25%. First, while I don't mean to belittle Jon Voight's abilities and fully competent performance, it just wasn't the same without Peter Graves as Jim Phelps. The second change I imagine any time I watch the movie is replacing Czerny as Kittridge with Leonard Nimoy as (The Amazing) Paris-- but changing none of the lines, save the names. Having a former underling be his current boss would have given far more substance to Phelps's motivations, and Nimoy's quiet competence would have made for a far more effective foil for the energetic Cruise. Go on, drag out this hoary DVD one more time, and try making the change in your head. If you've enough imagination to do this post-production edit with your mind's camera, you'll be amazed how much better the movie turns out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This De Palma film is a true director's highlight. De Palma's stamp is all over this one. It has tricky camera effects(some are definately borrowed from his influences such as,obviously,the spiral staircase shot)that are pure De Palma. He etches out a unique camera style that makes this caper a nice looking film. It's hard to make a film like this move without lulls,but I was never bored. To be sure,the film has a mazelike plot where you have to skim the dialogue for the story to make sense. It depends on story and twists rather than action scenes. De Palma wants to build suspence with tense situations like Cruise dangling from a rope and depending on Jean Reno to hold him..this sequence is pure tease from the director. He has us watch Cruise dangle with the knowledge of knowing that if he lands on the floor(Cruise is having to get a Noc file that consists of codes from a computer in one of those elaborate security sensored rooms)he's in deep crap. Also Cruise is raced against time because any moment the computer guy who operates the system will come in. This whole sequence is pure entertainment. The train sequence at the end is a highlight despite the fact that the whole thing is ridiculous. You have lots of familiar faces getting exterminated,and Cruise is obviously a foil to someone's deception. The film is slick and fun. ****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the somewhat impersonal and antiseptic feel of this summer of '96 blockbuster film, MI is an excellent espionage thriller. It relies more on plot than mindless action. The plot is not incomprehensible. Just pay attention! If people don't get it, it's likely because they are so used to getting hit over the head and expect everything to be spread on a platter without any active thinking on their part. The action sequences feel as if they serve the story not vice versa and among the highlights are the truly memorable break in to CIA headquarters and the sequence on the train. A competent cast brings the various characters to life. As far as box office receipts go, Ethan Hunt appears to have surpassed James Bond as the public's superspy of choice. But will Hunt ever have 20 films? Only time will tell. I look forward to MI:3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission Impossible is one of the best films I've seen. It shocks the viewers into deep concentration and takes them on an amazing journey with Cruise fighting both against time and using all the skills he has obained as a secret agent to his fullest.. showing the world just how courageous and imaginative his character can be.I've read mome of the critiques for this movie by other IMDB users and most of them are really pathetic and subjective. Examples are that the film didn't resemble the original TV series, that the plot was not cohesive and a very silly reason given a lot, that it downplayed the reputation of some of the actor's. Firstly, Who cares!! if the film didn't copy the repeated cliched formula used by the original series..thats what's great and different about this...and what makes it a great hollywood movie. Secondly, I've watched this film over four times now and each time the plot seems to become more cohesive and evermore powerful, so those that argue otherwise ether don't have a clue what it's about or simply don't recognise a good film when they see one. I Personally think the film does very well to represent the old series. It shows how the power of team work can potentially obtain great results in the beginning, and shows the possible flaws in an operation when there is a traitor in the team (something never explored in the original series).. this is what makes the film so great and different from the TV episodes.</fullReview>

This is his show, seeing as he produced it and he's the main character, and he's got the star power to keep you glued to the screen. Almost every other character is incidental.De Palma, as usual, entertains with his camera acrobatics and one or two flawlessly executed set pieces. As other users have commented, this is a perfect return to the old-style spy movie: plot-heavy and intelligent. The location shooting is interesting also.Cruise and De Palma have teamed up to great effect to produce one of the most enjoyable action adventures of the 90's. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: may contain spoilersPeople say that if you can go into Mission Impossible and try to ignore the plot, then the film is fun to watch. And although I can agree that the film is a little laden with what can only be attested to as the banalities of scriptwriting, I have to admit that if you watch this film perhaps for a second or third time, the plot isn't just more clear, it is quite well done. So when the second Mission Impossible was unleashed to us, the makers promised a somewhat diametric film from the first. And that is not always a good thing because I believe this one to be superior to the sequel. Am I going to tell you the exact plot of the film to make it transparently clear for you? No, of course not, I don't think that is possible. I am still confused by some of the film but just suffice to say that where I was once apathetic to the film, I am now in appreciation of it. This is a great action film that has a heavy but interesting story to go with it. If you can listen and decifer what is being said, I think you can have fun with it.The crux of the story is that Ethan Hunt has to prove to his superiors that he is innocent of extortion, cajolery and all those other terrible sounding international espionge words. It seems that IMF, the network that he works for, thinks that his parents have received an unjust amount of money in their bank account. His father has gone bankrupt and all of a sudden a large sum of money has appeared in his account. Cruise has to clear his name without the help of agency but he can still enlist the help of some rogue agents that are willing to help him. This is where some really great casting comes into play when Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are recruited for the job. That is only part of the story. The rest of the story involves the confusing stuff. Who is the bad guy, who lives, who dies, what is on the disc, who wants the disc, why is the Bible involved and so on and so on. Do I have the answers for all of this? No, of course not. But I can tell you that from the opening sequence in the film it is at least fun and entertaining if not a little confusing.Mission Impossible is a pastiche of James Bond films, James Cameron films and perhaps even films like French Connection and Bullit. But that does not mean that it doesn't have a style of it's own. One of the most breath-taking and intensely filmed scenes is the one in the agency. We have all seen this one in the commercials and if we remember anything from Mission Impossible, it is this one sequence. This is a tour de force in directing and Brian DePalma should accept many kudos for his work here. I am generally not a huge fan of his but this film is done with Hitchcockian ambiance in some ways. And this one scene is coup de maitre of the film.Mission Impossible is loaded with great stunts, an admittedly confusing but compelling story and a buffed up Cruise doing what he does best....pleasing the audience. If you toss in Ving Rhames with his one liners and his unmistakably Marcellus Wallace manerisms, Cruise's funny yet serious diatribes like "You have never seen me angry Kitteridge." and enough spy stuff to please any fan of the Bond genre, then what you have is a pretty good movie. At the very least you can say that there is nothing remotely prosaic about the film. This is an action packed story with lots of espionage, double crossing and plenty of missions that seem impossible.This review will self destruct in 5 seconds......7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atmospheric action/spy-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission:Impossible is a kind of movie, that we haven`t seen too much of in the last couple of years: spy-films. Mission:Impossible is a well directed movie and it offers plenty spy-chit-chat to keep fans of agent-movies and quality-movies entertained. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of the IMF(impossible mission force), and something goes terribly wrong during a mission at the Russian Ambassy in Prague. Ethan Hunt is the only member of the IMF-team to escape alive, and his superiors think that he is a traitor. Hunt escapes the interrigation, and begins clearing his name.But it is going to be hard. The story is good, and features double-crossing between the characters like we have come to expect from this kind of movies. The actionpieces are also entertaining and well-directed. The sequel will undoubtfully have better action because John Woo is directing it. Give it a go, you won`t be disappointed! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of things to get out of the way before I start. First of all, I was not familiar with the TV series, so I don't have a history to compare it with like I did with, say, THE AVENGERS. This is not to say I avoided seeing it, it just was never in syndication where I happened to live, or if it was, I just never noticed it. On vacation one time, I did happen to catch a few episodes, but nothing stuck with me, except, of course, the catchphrases like "Good morning, Mr. Phelps," "Your mission, should you choose to accept it..." and "This message will self-destruct in five seconds." So those who said the movie suffered when compared to the show may very well be right, I just don't know.As for those who complained it was too confusing; with all due respect, you need to get out more. I knew who the bad guy was within the first half hour, and so all you have to do is wait for the rest of the people to figure it out.Okay, now that I got all that out of the way; having seen this again on TV recently, first time since I saw it in the theater, I can confirm once again this is slick but still entertaining. The main problem, as one critic said up here, is that this is neither an actor's movie nor a director's movie, but a story movie, and the story doesn't allow a lot of room for either the actors or the director to move. You've got some good names here, but the only one with a character to play is Vanessa Redgrave, and she plays it beautifully(though Ving Rhames has some moments). Especially lost is Emmanuelle Beart, a great actress and the most beautiful actress in movies today, but she's all wrong for the part here. And though Brian DePalma stages some good scenes(especially, of course, the scene where Tom Cruise breaks into the computer room), he seems a little hamstrung by the plot. Maybe John Woo will do more with the sequel, I don't know. Still, it is entertaining enough. At least it wasn't like THE UNTOUCHABLES, which one critic aptly described as a beautifully wrapped package with nothing inside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this movie is incredible (and very underrated). Yes, it's true, the plot doesn't make much sense when you are watching it or even when you think back on it. BUT WHO THE HELL CARES!!! It's a brilliantly filmed, stylish, and original piece of work by a true master of cinema, Brian De Palma.There are several sequences in this film that blow my mind. 1) the first job near the beginning...2) the ultra-stylish, eye-popping, breathtaking, nail-biting, brilliant computer room break-in sequence, with Tom Cruise hanging from a cable on the ceiling---woah..3) the scene in the restaurant with the fish tank (notice how the angles on the characters when they're talking get increasingly more crooked...) 4) and the mind-boggling finale on the bullet train, you won't believe your eyes.Don't watch this movie and expect it to be realistic, because it isn't. It is totally over-the-top and implausible, but it's supposed to be. And that's what makes it fun. Just realize..IT IS A MOVIE...and enjoy it as a fun, amazing, stylish, brilliant thrill ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow what a waste of time. Lots of money spent on cast, location and special effects but it seems they forgot to hire a writer. This is a real good (or bad) example of Hollywood excess in the name of box office stars.The plot (if you can call it that) is a patchwork of various writers thoughts that don't hold together. There are too many plot flaws to innumerate. It appears as though the director just wanted special effects. Apparently any special effect will do as long as it will keep Tom's handsome face on screen.The height of this movie's stupidity is the helicopter chase through the Chunnel. Anyone who has seen a picture of the Chunnel would not recognize it in the movie. The concept that a helicopter could fly and maneuver through a 18 foot wide tunnel is stupid.</fullReview>

What about Mr. Rogers on the 10 most wanted? That's the kind of nonsense this movie peddles. It is total garbage. And is not a mission impossible story at all. Sure the movie is fine but give it a different name and don't steal any themes from the true mission impossible story. If you are not a mission impossible fan you will find this movie exciting.....but not if you are a true Mission Impossible fan. This is worst then terrible, and obviously not written by someone who understood the series. Rather promoted using the IMF name, music, themes, but not the heart and soul of this great series. I can't imagine the outrage if they did this to Star Trek or had a sequel to the Walton's and now John Boy turns into a death row criminal. The fact someone tried this with our beloved series just goes to show that double espionage can be tried, but we know better and know this is not really mission impossible but an impostor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More effect and affect than a great plot--you won't care about much but it's fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible (1996)The is a taste thing, but I found this movie playing so hard with movie tricks and spy clichés it became weirdly slow at times and weirdly irrelevant. You might say I wasn't supposed to much care about the characters in the twisting plot, but that's like saying they didn't really "intend" to make a great movie, so get over it.I didn't hate this by any means, I just expected more. I think I liked the third MI movie just because it took that ridiculous, high adventure stuff further. That said, there are totally fun and purposely outrageous scenes that almost make the rest of it worthwhile. Mainly, for me, the insane helicopter train chase. Ha. I laughed and had a good time with that.For those who know the MI movies this review is meant to raise the question--what is a movie like this supposed to achieve in the viewer? And how does it compare to the best of, to be obvious, the James Bond movies (I just saw "Skyfall," which for all its own flaws was better)? Or does it hold a candle to the really good Jason Bourne movies? (Not really, though the Bourne movies take themselves so so seriously, they occupy a different zone. James Bond always had a kind of detached humor which works well.)Brian DePalma is a director who knows most of all how to achieve effects. In this way the movie is wonderful--the angles for some simple confrontations, the changing camera angles throughout. His movies always replace substance with style, for sure, and yet the style is so overt and so attractive it almost becomes the substance. You can watch a DePalma movie just with your eyes.I'll admit once last problem I have here--I don't think much of Tom Cruise. He's a plastic caricature. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but he lacks some kind of intensity or style or something (I'm think Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, or even Matt Damon for some kind of "persona" at work). He's a big part of the movie.My favorite actor/actress in this whole thing is the remarkable Kristin Scott Thomas, and she's in it for just a few minutes. Jon Voigt is always welcome, and does his job. Vanessa Redgrave frankly over does her part, but that's part of the DePalma excess. Fun stuff.In the end, fine, another scene where the weary survivors of an adventure sit and soak up normal cafe life. Take it as it comes. Not half bad, not half good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Update of '60s TV Show Convoluted w/Great Action Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of the many people who were completely baffled upon first watching this movie, but I didn't let it deter me. Future viewings helped clear up what I hadn't grasped the first time and it's now safe to say that Brian De Palma's update of the 1960's television series makes for one of my favorite spy flicks. Based on the popular TV show, the film follows a team of IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agents as they pursue a renegade official attempting to sell vital information. Soon, the IMF is dead and the surviving member, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), is accused of being a traitor. Now Hunt must hunt down the true traitor while attempting to capture the black market information broker.Even trying to give a synopsis was enough to confuse myself. As I stated, there is enough double-crossing and false leads in this film to confuse the average viewer the first time through. Even if you find yourself having trouble following the convoluted plot, there are enough fantastic action sequences to keep the film entertaining. From the botched mission that results in the deaths of Hunt's IMF team to the theft of the information from a high-tech CIA vault, there are some seriously great suspense/action moments.This film helped me become a fan of Tom Cruise. I hadn't seen much of his 80's films before and I'd never paid him much attention, but I thought he did a great job as Hunt. Following the deaths of his teammates, he reforms with a group of disavowed agents consisting of two awesome actors that outshine Cruise (in my opinion), Ving Rhames and Jean Reno. Toss in Jon Voight as IMF team leader Jim Phelps (the only character of the TV show to transition to the film) and the gorgeous, soft-spoken Emmanuelle Beart as his wife Claire, and you have a great cast rounding out this busy popcorn flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second look: MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: An underrated big-screen version of the classic TV series. The plot no longer confuses after a second view. A thrill-a-minute machine.At first glance, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is quite like a self-constructing Rubix cube which finishes itself in the finale, but it rarely remains clear how it got there. But after seeing it again the other night, it became clear to me that MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE wasn't quite as complicated nor convoluted, considering how much complicated other espionage thrillers of this kind have turned out to be. Do yourself a favor: Turn your brains in the "on" position, keep your ears on the listen and wallow in the action-packed, special effects-laden summer entertainment.The plot itself is a thing of beauty. Where else can you see such a plot that moves from manhunts to double cross, and more secret agent/conspiracy jargon one summer viewer can possibly handle. So go get your glass of water or something, for you wouldn't wanna miss a single strand of detail in this complex summer popcorn action thriller of the adults. Tom Cruise is still terrific as the famed (and framed) IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt, point-man to IMF director Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, taking over the role from Peter Graves) during a mission to retrieve a NOC (Non-Official Coverts) list, before it goes out in the open, exposing IMF agents from their aliases. After an ambush which spelled certain failure of the mission, Hunt is framed as the suspected moll working for illegal arms dealer named Max (Vanessa Redgrave). To clear his name, Hunt goes over the edge. Whether it has him breaking into CIA secretly while dangling atop the ceiling, or take form of numerous disguises that would make any fan of the original series proud.The plot gets much more complicated than it sounds, since writers Robert Towne, David Koepp and Steve Zaillian throw in every situation and plot twists it could. The result, while admittedly thick, is clever and gripping. Director Brian DePalma owes more to Alfred Hitchcock than Bruce Gellar, as the film is more thriller than action, but the film works as an exciting piece of entertainment. Clever, fast and and is especially great at keeping the audience guessing. The cast is especially great, even if they aren't exactly Oscar-caliber. Cruise is an especially reliable hero, Voight makes an excellent replacement for Peter Graves (unsatisfied to reprise the role for this film) and Henry Czerny plays another mysterious government figure (after CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER) as Eugene Kittridge. French beauty Emmanuelle Beart sizzles as Phelps' wife Claire and Ving Rhames &amp; Jean Reno play disavowed agents recruited by Hunt to pull off the "Mt. Everest of hacks".Nothing is at it seems in this film, since DePalma pulls of everything with gusto, Hitchcock-style. Espionage, thrills, and that slam-bang finale (a fight on a speeding bullet train, having a helicopter fly through a tunnel). DePalma also doesn't drown the film with as much special effects as other summer movie rivals, resulting in one of the more promising piece of unadulterated adult summer attraction. Warning: This message will now self destruct in T-minus 3 seconds. 3... 2... 1...Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, classy and fun spy thriller with great direction by De Palma and a killer soundtrack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mission Impossible', based on the eighties TV format with the same name, is as classy and fun as spy-thrillers get. It's filled with enough twists and turns to make your head spin and the acting is more than solid overall, a common complaint when dealing with action-movies. Back in 1996 it was a huge hit and it's no surprise shortly after life was given to a sequel, the unfortunate MI2, perhaps the biggest mistake was leaving the project in the incompetent hands of John Woo. Slow motion and unrealistic fight sequences reign, and there's little left of the fun that made the first film so good. The third film wasn't a complete miss, the producers smart enough to hire a competent director and cast (the outstanding Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain and an underused Laurence Fishburn).The first one in the series however is a glorious success on every level; on top of the clever plot we have a great soundtrack to support it and director De Palma has some very nice cinematographic tricks up his sleeve. I distinctly remember the great camera-work in the first action sequence (the set-up). Pay attention during the scene in the phone booth, how he elegantly uses the camera to evoke a sense of panic and claustrophobia. That's just one of the great surpluses De Palma always provides in any of his film.MI certainly isn't a typical film for the director, he's never really done this kind of slick action-movie before. I, and most of you, will primarily know him for gangster movies such as Scarface, Carlito's Way and The Untouchables but he's also responsible for Carrie, his best movie so far IMO. For those who do not know it, Carrie is a horror-drama, and a very good one too, so De Palma can pretty much handle every genre and he proves it yet again. The plot moves along very fast, fast enough so the most obvious plot holes aren't noticed. Clever as it may be, it's far from flawless and some of the action sequences aren't exactly state of the art anymore, action-movies will always age faster than any other genre I'm afraid. I'm thinking in particular of the legendary tunnel scene in the end, it all looked a bit too artificial compared to similar sequences in today's films. The above really isn't a flaw, films date, it's unavoidable. In the end, even after 12 years, Mission Impossible has not lost any of it's charm and with, I still get excited seeing it again and again, and fans of the genre who haven't yet should check out this film from an era where Tom Cruise wasn't Scientology crazy and at the top of his 'cool'. Because if MI were to be summarized in one word, I'd definitely be 'COOL' !!8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insubstantial, but also stylish and fast moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until I caught this film on television recently, I had only seen the second episode in the "Mission: Impossible" franchise. I must say that I was not impressed by "Mission: Impossible II" which struck me as a leaden, humourless attempt to make a James Bond-style spy thriller and which had dissuaded me from seeing either of the other two instalments. The first film, however, is a very different beast from its successor. The differences are doubtless due to the fact that the two films were made by two very different directors. "Mission: Impossible II" was made by John Woo, best known as the director of violent action-adventures. Its predecessor was made by Brian de Palma, who has a reputation for Hitchcockian suspense thrillers such as "Dressed to Kill", and has many of the hallmarks of a de Palma film. "Mission: Impossible" is based on the old television series of that name, familiar from my childhood, and borrows a number of elements from it, such as the distinctive theme tune, the character of Jim Phelps and catchphrases such as "Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is??". (That one always used to baffle me as a child. Are spies really given the opportunity to say which assignments they will accept and which they will decline?) Although it does incorporate Bond-like elements, it is more like a cross between a Bond-style film and those paranoid Cold War thrillers such as "The Spy who Came in from the Cold", where the hero was never sure whom he could trust and where anyone, including the hero's closest associates- perhaps even the hero himself- could turn out to be a double, or even a triple, agent. (In this it differs from the original series, which generally reflected the moral certainties of the Cold War seen as Good v Evil). The film opens with Phelps and a team of agents on a mission to prevent a traitor from stealing a computer file containing identities of all America's double agents and then passing this information on to terrorists and criminal gangs. (This was made after the fall of the Berlin Wall, so the Russians are no longer the villains. The film, however, follows the tradition of using Eastern European cities as the setting for spy thrillers, so the mission takes place at an Embassy reception in a misty, mysterious-looking Prague). Unfortunately, the team have been betrayed and all of them except Phelps, his wife Claire and an agent named Ethan Hunt are killed. Because Hunt survives he immediately comes under suspicion of being the traitor who betrayed the team, so he is forced to go on the run. The rest of the story centres upon Hunt's attempts to elude his pursuers and to unmask the real mole. Another reviewer complains that most of De Palma's recent movies have been more about style than content. That assessment is, I think, true of this film. As one might expect with de Palma, there are a number of stylish directorial set-pieces. Probably the most memorable is the sequence in which a high-speed train, with Hunt clinging to the roof, is followed into the Channel Tunnel by the helicopter which is trying to kill him. (In reality, of course, the Tunnel is not wide enough for such a manoeuvre to be feasible, although this was presumably a deliberate error committed in order to increase the suspense. Most of the audience will probably assume, as I did as soon as I saw the entrance to the Tunnel looming, that the chase will end as soon as the train enters it). Another memorable scene comes where Hunt is trying to steal important information from the CIA headquarters, even though the computer containing the data is in a vault protected by all sorts of hi-tech devices, including temperature sensors and infra-red light beams. (This scene may have inspired a similar one in "Entrapment", made three years later, where Catherine Zeta Jones has to avoid a similar network of beams). As is normal in films of this type the plot is not only extremely complex- indeed, at times it is so complex as to be virtually impossible to follow- but also, at times, extremely implausible. Hunt is played by Tom Cruise who, despite his superstar status, does not seem really suited to a Bond-style action hero, lacking the suave, debonair charm of, say, a Pierce Brosnan whose first Bond film, "Goldeneye", had been made the previous year. (I must say, however, that Cruise is better here than he was to be in "Mission: Impossible II"). The result is a film which is, in many ways, insubstantial, but also fast moving and often stylish and enjoyable. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To this date, if I ask someone to explain me in short, what is the premise or to provide really a few short details about the story... nobody seems to remember or even explain. This movie is so easily absorbed from the memory of everyone. Once you remove all the stunts and explosions you really have no idea what was the story in the first place? The strength of the MI team is precisely in their team. The beautiful synergy of unique talents, always contribute in outsmarting their opponents. We have such a usable cast from beginning, what do we do with them? We kill them all from the beginning. Why? So that entire script, story ( for lack of the better word) could serve one purpose only : Tom Cruise's EGO. The second movie is what I consider pornography of such exploitation. But lets go back to the first one. This is one of those scripts that is precisely tailored to one man's vision. Everything in this movies serves his own action ambitions, that be all fine, but it makes me sad that the promise of real MI team was completely destroyed. As some have said at previous and I'm sure will repeat at later date as well : This Has Absolutely NOTHING to do with MI series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most Impossible of missions turned out to be the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the Mission:Impossible movies,this is my favorite as instead of lots of action like the next two sequels,this one instead is more of a mystery/thriller and has the best plot out of the trilogy as it twists and turns so fast that you wouldn't even know who the main villain is. Tom Cruise stars as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt who after an operation gone wrong,he suddenly finds out he was framed for the murder of his five teammates by a mysterious individual known as Job 3-14(later revealed to be Jim Phelps who is played marvelously by Jon Voight who was the mastermind behind the botched operation and received help from Franz Krieger) but Hunt is instead led to believe it was Eugene Kittridge(played by Henry Czerny) who presumes that Ethan Hunt is the mole as he is the only surviving member of his team. Ethan then learns that Clair Phelps(Emmanuelle Beart)who is/was Jim Phelps' wife also survived the mission and then Ethan begins with correspondence with an individual known as Max which is probably short for Maxine as it is a woman(played by veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave). Max then tells Ethan to get her the Non-Official Cover(NOC) list for her in exchange for the identity of the mole(Jim Phelps) as the list stolen from the US Embassy in Prague was a fake and the real one is in the CIA Headquarters in Langley,Virginia which is outside Washington,D.C and then Ethan would need two people from the Disavowed list. Ethan would recruit Luther Stickell(Ving Rhames) and Claire would recruit Franz Krieger(Jean Reno) who would later be revealed to be assisting Jim Phelps. But besides the great cast of this movie and the complex,brain-teasing script,another great thing about this movie was the plot,stunts,special effects and the director Brian De Palma who directed such movies as Scarface,Carlito's Way and The Untouchables. Great job by everyone involved with this film and it is now one of my immediate favorite spy/action/thriller films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the last super successful film by Brian De Palma and it is well worth it. The story is top notch and moves fast, so fast that if you don't pay attention you will miss out. It's a movie that if you miss something you blame the movie and not yourself if you miss something but you are wrong if you do this because it is all there you just have to pay attention. This story is one you earn by devoting yourself to it. Tom Cruise in this is at his best and I love it, his only other better performance is in this film second installment M:I:2. This is where for me Cruise left his chick image behind and became a real actor. Brian De Palma does none of his signature frames in this movie but I believe that is because he realizes that this is a story that he did not create and that he is just there to film the story not make it his own. Ving Rhames does a breakout performance in this and has never looked back awesome work. Watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A team of secret agents working for an equally secret bureau are ambushed as they carry out an operation which would have exposed a double agent. Agent Ethan Hunt, who is blamed for the failure of the mission, learns soon that there is more at play than he initially thought and sets out to clear his name and uncover the truth.Directed by Brian DePalma, who has many great thrillers on his resume, this is yet another good thriller. DePalma hasn't really ventured into espionage territory before, but here manages just that with dynamic efficiency. As most of his previous films it is all about atmosphere and suspense as a winding plot takes you down many surprising twists and turns. Tom Cruise, in the main role, is great and he manages to make the movie slick and cool with his ever likable on screen presence.There are terrific set pieces including a break-in to an "impenetrable" vault of CIA information and, of course, the spectacular climatic sequence on top of a high-speed train. The film cares much more about being cool (it stars Tom Cruise after all) rather than a truly convincing espionage story, like a John le Carre novel, but in this case that is just fine. 8/10Rated PG-13 for violence</fullReview>

People seem for some reason to have particular difficulty with a fantastic scene in which Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)verbally agrees with someone trying to deceive him as to earlier events in the film, whereas what DePalma presents us with visually are the images going through Hunt's mind as he pieces together how the events actually occurred. Very original, great directing and acting. People moaning about how difficult this film is probably led to the atrocity that is MI2 - all action, and a stupid, dumbed-down plot</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destroys everything that made the series fabulous RATING=A BIG ZERO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In buying the theme song and series name Tom Cruise bought the loyal viewership to the original TV series. The he blew what made the series fabulous right to hell. What a piece of garbage. What made the original series so great was that every character had a strength and a gift that, in lateral motion with the others, allowed the impossible mission to be achieved almost magically, though appearances to the contrary had one believe (until the end) the mission was falling apart.Tom Cruise's MI used the very premise of the TV series as the hook for his movie. Then he immediately destroys that premise: the team, each member a unique character who, though acting independently, was a essential cog in a well oiled machine. And the sequels were even worse. What utter garbage. And a blight on the name that was "Mission Impossible"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission: Incomprehensible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian DePalma, whose earlier foray into big-budget Hollywood star-laden product was "The Bonfire of the Vanities," redeems himself here. Adapting an epic satirical bestseller for the screen is evidently far more difficult than adapting a '60s-'70s TV spy thriller. Cast includes Tom Cruise, of course; Jon Voigt, whom I hadn't seen in ages; Ving Rhames; whatsisname, the guy who jerked Harrison Ford around in "Clear and Present Danger," playing essentially the same smarmy insider jerk here; and Charlie Sheen in a tiny and thankless role. The plot is a series of double and triple crosses in which Cruise is the patsy who has to figure out who's zooming who. Similar to "Eraser," the contemporary Arnie thriller, but miles more convoluted. Incomprehensible, in fact, but it works as a thrill ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Cruise is on cruise control...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Cruise is a good actor regardless of what anyone says. He has held his own while acting alongside such legends a Dustin Hoffman, Paul Newman and Robert Duvall. He has also taken direction extremely well from veterans such as Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese. If Cruise wasn't any good, do you really think these actors and directors of such a high stature would want to work with him? In 'Mission Impossible' Cruise creates an secret agent character that is sort of a miniature James Bond. Cool, unshaken and physical at every tense moment, Cruise's Ethan Hunt is a great character. Brian De Palma's direction is static as usual but the story (which takes multiple viewings in order to figure out the REAL plot) and Cruise's on screen charisma make 'Mission Impossible' one of the more respectable films to be based on a classic t.v. series when so many of them are nothing but junk. This film is a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That theme music don't you love it. Mission Impossible is a fun flick when you see it and that's where the buck stops. No deep analyzing needed. Like most extravagant action movies - it's an entertaining ride that one doesn't question along the way lest one wants that experience to be ruined.If you pull back the layers, you'll see a weak story salvaged by decent actors, star power and nice stunt pieces. There is no denying Tom Cruise works his magic here in a movie that seems tailor made for his screen presence. Having a few of the scenes stick in the mind can also be considered a good thing. For I will always remember him hanging from a wire in the middle of that completely pressure and sound sensitive white room. So that is that. A slick movie with a bevy of familiar faces and enough eye candy to shut the brain off for ninety minutes. You'll probably enjoy it for what is it. I know I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong start but loses steam fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great characters, intricate plots and an ensemble cast helped define the original "Mission: Impossible" during the 1960's but the elements that made the original series so strong are all but lost in this first big screen effort.It all starts out promising enough when we join the IMF in the middle of a mission. Unfortunatley, once the team members are systematically eliminated one by one we leave "Mission: Impossible" behind and instead stumble into a high tech version of "The Fugitive" with Tom Cruise again playing himself as he so often has in so many of his films. This is a shame considering the strong supporting cast and the potential it had to be an intelligent and intriguing update of the original series. The original concept and characters are betrayed by the writers and director Brian DePalma.Easy to follow and sit through but ultimately disappointing. Let's hope they get it right for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've finally come to see this terrible movie, and I'm still not done shaking my head in disappointment. Classic tale of pure good and pure evil, plus saving the world, plus wolf turned into sheep, I mean into a beautiful woman burglar with whom the main hero evidently falls in love, plus redemption through self-sacrifice, plus obliterating all bad guys with a casual ease, plus.... And all these pluses add up to a terribly big minus. This is a spy flick even worse and lamer than James Bond. It is as far from being realistic as it gets. Virtually nothing that TomCruise does smells like reality. Watch it, if you think that magnificent stunts and burning kerosene and pleasing your twisted need for grandeur are what a good movie is made of. The two good things about the movie are the stunts, bravely done (but absolutely unrealistic for the setting); and the soundtrack that is quite decent. For these two, I give this movie a weak 3. It wasn't worth the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ego centered and senseless movie. Brian Depalma pulls off one cool scene involving an exploding restaurant otherwise a box office success that will be baffling to people who watch it once the Tom Cruise star has faded. If you love Tom (and he can deserve your love, just doesn't this time) you'll like the fact that for a "team" movie there is no Team it's all just Tom. That's fine if you don't remember the original concept of the cool TV show, and let's face it the makers of the film were betting you don't. Best moment however is when they briefly play the original theme music in a couple of spots. Dangling wire scene is a steal fro Topkaki--which for Depalma is a signature moment. What can you say about a career that has lasted for decades where his signature is stealing other directors signature moments. Here though he really gets to do very little, he certainly was taking the job hoping (and getting) a hit film so he could go off to make his more personal Hitchcock rip off films ( don't get me stated) anyway he doesn't get to work much style into Mission. Final sequence on the train in the tunnel is the first of many abusive unconvincing CGI action scenes that have followed and dominated American movie making. I don't mean to get on a soapbox here this film is bad as a stand alone without trying to blame it for other bad films. Cruise is too into being serious to enjoy the film and the script (written and rewritten while they were shooting) doesn't not hold together, leaving Cruise looking rather silly for playing it so seriously rather than with a "isn't this fun? Don't take it too seriously" attitude that might have saved at least him. The film was a hit, feel free not to listen to me, or feel free to actually watch this film as a film and see how poor it is. For those who see Brian DePalma's cinematic stealings from other films as being his expression of style, this time around he most effectively steals the hanging on wires gag from Topkaki. Unfortunately he needed to steal some scenes from about 10 other good movies to help out the rest of this one. Most exciting moment in the film is when they briefly play the original theme music--that moment leads into the Topkaki riff. If you were on a desert island and only had this film and its sequel to watch, I'd say watch this one, otherwise use them both to burn to make black smoke to attract rescue.</fullReview>

I would like to congratulate you on single-handedly tarnishing the reputation of the best spy movie of all time because of your petty objections. I have been a huge IMDb fan/supporter for some time now. That being said, I cannot believe how insulting you guys have been to Brian DePalma in your ratings of this movie. When one goes to "Mission: Impossible" reviews page, we see "rating:6.6/10" and "user comments: In a word- Disgusting!" According to your ratings system, "The Punisher(re-make)" is apparently on par with "Mission: Impossible." Are you kidding me? For those people who could not understand the plot of the movie...watch it again for the love of God and try paying attention (that helps). You have simply conformed to what you heard everyone else was saying before you saw the movie by saying you didn't understand the plot. Its OK. I forgive you. See it again and try to have keep open mind. The editing and the incorporation of the musical score is breathtaking, as is the directing and writing. Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, and Jean Reno all deliver stunning performances. Between your "6.6/10" and "In a word- Disgusting!" the common movie fan who has not seen "Mission: Impossible" would get the impression that this is just a crappy re-make that is not worth watching, when in reality, it is a work of art. How dare you. Redeem yourselves and feature a user comment that applauds this movie for the masterpiece it really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Mission: Impossible, the sky is hardly the limit. An intricate plot with a great cast and excellent action and adventure.Tom Cruise plays as Ethan Hunt, who, like most of the IMF team, is new to the Mission: Impossible story. Jim Phelps is back as the leader of the IMF team.The plot revolves around the NOC (non-official cover) list, which contains the names of every single secret agent in Europe. A mole, inside the CIA, is trying to get this list and it's up to the IMF team to keep the list from getting into the open.From there on the plot twists more and more and Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances. He is so perfect for this character, and the other cast members do very well in portraying their characters. The storyline is great and hardly gets repetitive or boring, and the music, composed by Danny Elfman, is much better than Zimmer's M:I-2 composition. Elfman gets the whole espionage sound, with the light drum cadences and quick beats that will help keep the movie in a strong suspense.There is no reference to sex, the violence is not overwhelming, and the language remains fairly decent. It's a must see for all members of the family, since it's just a straightforward action movie that goes deeper than one would assume.This is one of my all-time favorites. I would definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brian De Palma has just ruined the originality of Mission: Impossible.Jim Phelps a traitor? Seriously, Tom Cruise is destroying one of the greatest IMF secret agents. Now, tell me: Jim has been a wonderful, successful spy (and a real handsome one at that!) and you're going to tell me a dumbass like Ethan Hunt/Tom Cruise is going to trick him?! Someone is trying to kill off the original Mission feeling and replacing it with thick Hollywood effects, lightweight, conceited actors like Tom Cruise, and girls with fake boobs. Too reminiscent of James Bond or any other typical Hollywood wanna-be spy film. I'm so glad Peter Graves and most of the original actors didn't get themselves involved with this depressing movie. The movie desperately tried to replace the characters with new ones, but I don't think you can ever replace Jim Phelps with Tom 'Loser' Cruise or Barney, or Paris, or anybody! I never liked Tom Cruise anyways. The original TV shows were much better than these new movies, vasically because they were intricately plotted, had lots of wit, and barely had these huge, unnecessary explosion scenes, which the new movies have so much of. I think the only reason why this new piece of crap remake of Mission Impossible was made by idiots, for idiots.If you have watched the old 1960's Mission: Impossible and liked it, you may not like these movie remakes! They are nothing compared to the intellect and intricate planning of the original. And if you're a Jim Phelps/Peter Graves addict like me, you'll hate the movie even more!</fullReview>

It's the only one of the Mission Impossible series that I've seen, the plot was sort of hard to understand at first but it had me entertained the whole way through. It has some great scenes, for example early on I really enjoyed that first mission in the fancy ballroom. Later on when they lower Tom Cruise in from the ceiling is definitely memorable, too. I'd compare the camera work to Alien, but filming spies instead of spaceships, of course. The music is great, the beloved theme song is widely known but really fits it's source well. I recommend this movie for watching at home, it's got plenty of action but it never made me uneasy, just in awe a bit. A great movie to watch casually.</fullReview>

However, the plot twists were clichés, the characters were shallow, and the storylines were often confusing. Moreover, the uniqueness of "Mission Impossible" is totally lost. The title of the movie may as well be "Bond Wannabe" or "A Generic, Big Budget Spy Action Movie with Tom Cruise."Overall, I can only give it a 3 out of 10.

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.A de Palma film is always a gas. He cares not at all about the actors. The story is just an excuse for his real work, which concerns the appearance of things. His films are, therefore, purely cinematic, something others have called `sterile.'And so it is here. The story is a trifle, a common bit about duplicity of the spymaster. The acting is deliberately flat, presumably to make producer Cruise not look bad. Each is allowed to find some old character: Reno finds Léon; Emmanuelle her Manon and so on. They rattle about in the past, each playing a role borrowed from another story.The conceit behind the film is a group (in the TeeVee show) who create elaborate scenes that dupe the audience, correcting some deep wrong. No one can be trusted to be what they appear. The goal of the plot is to discover identities of who is who.The film is three set pieces, a remarkably simple construction: Prague, London, Chunnel. The camera differs in each third, each exploring the space in a different way, each fooling us into believing the camera is ordinary. Usually he swoops and zooms are dramatically obvious, and are intended to reveal as in the remarkable `Snake Eyes.' Here, they are concealed, and used to conceal.As an elaboration of the idea, much of the plot revolves around hidden `spectacle' cameras and peeloff masks.</fullReview>

The team (the brain, the girl, the technician, the muscle and the actor) in effect were only there to move the plot forward. But, saying that, we really got to know and trust these anonymous agents; a tribute to such excellent actors as Peter Graves, Martin Landau and Leonard Nimoy. The first thing that this film does is kill off the team. Disgraceful! And then various members of the new team he puts together turn out to be traitors. Drivel! And then at the end of the film they completely trash the reputation of TV's greatest spy master Jim Phelps. Terrible! Sorry, but this is not the film that I wanted to see.It says a lot that according to rumour the producers did not see fit to offer any of the original cast members of "Mission: Impossible" so much as even a silent cameo in this movie. (Imagine the great Martin Landau as the aged Rollin' Hand. What a missed opportunity). I think another case of buying a title and doing what you like with it.

It's too bad that a whole generation of movie goers will think that THIS is Mission: Impossible without ever having seen the brilliant television series. It doesn't surprise me that Greg Morris walked out in the middle of this film and said "It's an abomination." Because Tom Cruise has tainted M:I's image so badly, no one will ever make a television show or motion picture that faithfully captures the essence of M:I... at least not during Mr. Cruise's lifetime or mine.

The thing that might make the film hard to understand may be the way how the simple story is told... In addition to that, some scenes are so illogical that they are already silly, for example the helicopter in the tunnel, not to mention the often criticized fact of making an arch villain out of Jim or the stereotypic dialogues.

It is particularly annoying given that the "plot" chosen to replace it is so bog-standard and predictable. An honest hero is framed for something he didn't do and spends the rest of the movie trying to clear his name and out the real spy... This seems to be the plot of every third blockbuster these days - two titles released just before "M:I" using exactly the same storyline spring to mind: "Judge Dredd" and Schwarzenegger's "Eraser". It was also totally un-necessary to take the hero of the original series and make him the villain of the movie - can you imagine a film version of "The Untouchables" with the cops hot on the trail of the evil gang boss Eliot Ness? There is also the fact that the movie is deeply insecure; one feels that it would like to be a cold-war style espionage picture but does not have the courage of its convictions so tacks a cheesy and implausible action sequence onto the end. I could go on, but at the end of the day, my list of criticisms are all are all pretty subjective, and don't really point to this being a bad film, simply one that I don't like. But then suddenly it struck me. The reason I find this movie so intensely pointless, and the reason I think it's no good, is that so many scenes are so stupid, or just completely extraneous. Take for example the films most memorable moment - the break in to the CIA building to steal half of the 'NOC' list. We are told that this is the most secure room in the entire world, that it has every security system known to man. Except, it seems, a plain and simple good old CCTV camera! Sure, the scene is well directed and a fair amount of tension is wrung from it, but if you take a step back to think, it's preposterous. Besides, by my reckoning there is no reason for Hunt even to have the real NOC list if he is planning on double bluffing simply to smoke out the spy, so the scene shouldn't even be there. Why would he endanger all those agents by handing over the real list? Nit picking? Certainly, but it sums up for me why the whole thing is a waste of time. There are plenty of movies one can enjoy by checking ones brain in at the theatre door; but when a movie cloaks itself in a supposedly complex plot and encourages the audience member to engage his or her brain, and then doesn't even stand up to scrutiny, I find the whole process deeply depressing - more so when the film takes itself as seriously as this one evidently does. I can't even be entertained anymore, because I am acutely aware of how shallow, empty, and ultimately pretentious it all is. So sorry folks, but if you ask me this is a red herring wrapped up in a Macguffin, wrapped up in a shaggy dog story with fleas, all designed for the sole purpose of making Tommy look good. It's a real shame that the supporting cast, production values, direction etc are all so high, since the film itself is so thoroughly worthless. At my most generous, I'd give it...(4/10)</fullReview>

The television show was fun, but this movie is slow and boring and has no likeable characters. I do not know why they even bothered to name it after the television show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission Impossible Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 90s, there was a pretty decent wave of spy movies; it started with a bang with 1994's explosive True Lies, which was shortly followed by the Brosnan era of James Bond, The Saint, Sneakers, and more. In the middle of this wave, Mission: Impossible burst into the blockbuster scene in '96, offering a flashier update on the classic TV series, complete with a prolific cast, some thrilling and memorable setpieces, and of course, action.There are some great moment in this film. One of the most famous scenes is watching Ethan infiltrating a high-tech vault on wires, dangling over a pressure-sensitive floor while hacking into a secure computer; it's still quite the tense scene. On top of that, the bullet train scene is pretty awesome. There is a good amount of fights, chases, and explosions. There is plenty of tech on display, which all seemed really cool in the 90s (to include self-destructing video tapes, glasses with cameras, explosive gum, computer stuff, and more). There's political intrigue abound, causing the plot to twist around with themes of deception and counter-deception. For a spy movie, Mission: Impossible offers plenty to enjoy.Unfortunately, the experience is hampered a bit by an overall feeling of dryness, causing some drag in between the more exciting scenes. This happens because the characters themselves are dry and fairly shallow caricatures; Ethan Hunt is a pretty standard action hero in this film, who watches his team fall apart and he's forced to go out on his own to find answers. This would be a great premise, but there's nothing much to Ethan's character to make us care for him. Without any personal stakes, the plot comes off as dry and shallow. There are neat ideas behind it, such as using a digital list of undercover agents as a MacGuffin, but on its own this is all rather dry and stuffy. On top of that, the film distances itself greatly from the source material; even though some names, some gadgets, and some aspects (like the use of masks) remain the same, the intrigue of the original show is ultimately replaced by pure spectacle. The original cast of the show hated this film, and if you're a fan of the original, chances are that you may not care for it (or its sequels) either.Fortunately, the film looks good and professional, with fantastic photography and solid editing. Tom Cruise does his usual schtick in his role, smiling a lot and acting all cocky; Jon Voight does his normal thing, and is pretty decent. The smaller roles by Jean Reno and Emilio Estevez are great. Other actors aren't bad. Writing could use more personality and color, but it's fine as it is. This production uses some really nice-looking locales, and some decent-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Danny Elfman's music score is a pretty standard variation on the classic TV show's theme.Mission: Impossible has a lot of cool parts, but the sum of those parts aren't quite as endearing. The various sequels, especially the third film, would properly align the series with a greater level of heart and ambition. As it is though, this first film is a pretty neat thriller, especially for its time.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Average | Film: Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not so good start to the super spy series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible, the start of the worldwide famous series of well, impossible seeming missions. This start is one I didn't feel so well about, maybe even sloppy. Brian De Palma directs and I didn't like it so much, I didn't even find Tom Cruise a quality I expect from him, for me this was disappointing. The movie isn't without it's thrilling moments and occasional parts where you think "Oh cool", but all in all a fairly average tale.The plot is a slight bit of a mess, not well thought out and even though as said moments are thrilling, the actual basis of it all is fairly strange and kind of hard to keep up with at times. I think Cruise as super spy Ethan Hunt is OK but he never gives it his all, he acts a bit too underwhelming and then overwhelming and can't seem to work out how to act certain situations. As for the rest of the cast we see Jon Voight playing the character of Phelps, now Phelps could have been a very intriguing person but Voight manages to bring him down a peg and he becomes almost lifeless in the role.De Palma is the wrong choice of director, I mean this is in hindsight for me and although he manages to get through the action scenes OK, he never kicks it up a notch and makes some scenes rather bland. As for that action it is OK throughout but some effects can ruin it, not to mention insane stunts which you will see toward the end of the movie. I liked the cinematography, it's nicely done and one thing that sticks out in this, well worked camera positions and also one thing to mention, good locations.I think to be fair if your looking for spy movies there are better one's out there than this one. Mission: Impossible only serves to show how 90's spy movies were done, crazy gadgets that seem insane and characters that are just impossibly two faced. That all said I would recommend this, in fact most others who I have seen talk about this movie usually talk of it's bad story but the action quota and stunts more than make up for it, I kind of agree but don't think it makes up for it's negative points.And what of Cruise?, what of all the sequels?(surely this can't be bad with so many after it), well the truth is I can see why the sequels were made. The whole set up isn't bad and even the plot although silly is still unique, this one for me is a blemish but that doesn't mean more like this just better, can't be good. Tom Cruise is a mega star of film and one actor instantly known across the globe, put his face on one of these and throw in him doing his own stunts, and you have yourself a franchise.Overall I felt slightly disappointed by this movie, although not fully disheartened by it's trying. I know many many people will enjoy this and I do feel this is one of the highest average kind of movies I have seen, so close to being OK. If you can look past the crazy plot and partly bad acting you may love this, oh and add in the insane stunts as well to try and bypass. One last thing to mention here is the writing, oh and it's also not that good, in fact this entire movie is kind of 50/50 all round, some good parts some bad but the script by David Koepp and Robert Towne is a particularly good example of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst in the series by really really really FAR!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission impossible 1 is a really bad movie in my opinion and is really really not as good as the 3 others. If you don't understand what I mean check this out : MI 1=4/10 MI 2=9.5/10 MI 3=10/10 MI 4=9/10. That is my opinion and you can read about it in my other reviews. There are 3 major scenes and only 1/3 are good in my opinion. the first one was his team recovering the NOC list and that was just some dudes getting killed and he was the only one who survived so that was rather boring. The middle scene was medium good and the only reason I gave this 4/10 instead of 1/10. there was only 1 issue with the scene and it was that in the trailer they show Ethan smashing Kriegler's hand onto the wall to make it look like a fight scene BUT THERE WASN'T EVEN ONE! That was very disappointing. And even without having watched the trailer it would have been disappointing since THERE WASN'T A SINGLE FIST FIGHT IN THE MOVIE! Then the last scene... The train scene was super cheesy and looked fake and it wasn't even that exciting. The trailer disappoints again in the restaurant scene by making you think that there is going to be an awesome scene where there is a flood following Ethan but it was just a brief lame breakout. It wasn't even well done. Then there's the boring story about retrieving the NOC list that is totally boring. Even if they would have succeeded in making 3 decent scenes WHICH THEY DIDN'T the movie's boring story and the handful of extra boring scenes with no suspense at all drags it down to BY FAR the worst mission impossible</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(This review is heavy on spoilers?but it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet?)Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission: Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on.And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused ? I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses.Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins.The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before.Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT ? or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously.And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it ? the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off ? just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc.Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette ? the old 3? inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie.I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan "Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD!" Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good ? for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place.Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat ? REALLY? ? that scares/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart.Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it.The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally.This actually very slow "action" movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience."I've been disavowed," says Ethan. Don't worry: it won't be your last time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super agents look tense and blow up stuff. It's a good thing Peter Graves was alive when this came out, or he would have been turning over in his grave at the treatment of his character from the beloved TV show. The script is by turns confusing and dull. An early action sequence where the team tries to do something to somebody at a party at a mansion is very clumsily executed by De Palma. A later sequence at the CIA headquarters comes off a little better but is quite far-fetched. The most ludicrous, however, is the final action sequence aboard a moving train. The cast is stellar, but only Redgrave turns in a noteworthy performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, there's no chance of letting any spoilers slip, because I only made it about 30 minutes in before giving up. I can start by saying that I was not a fan of the original series, so I'm not comparing it to anything... I just didn't like it. I found it very loud and confusing, way too intricate and convoluted plot-wise. I didn't care about any of the characters... that's usually the test I give a movie just before I turn it off in the middle: how would I feel if all these characters died in the very next scene? If the answer is that I wouldn't care one bit, I go ahead and turn it off, which is what I did here.The three stars are for the special effects, which looked pretty good but weren't enough to keep me interested for two hours. Not saying it was a bad movie, just saying I didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though it suppose to be based on the 1966 TV series, anyone who has followed or really liked the television show will be disappointed because it doesn't have 4 guys but 1, as though the creators of this movie version has decided to interwine James Bond solo idea into it. So all you see throughout the movie is Tom Cruise being in the highlighted so much, that you get the impression that maybe they should of made Top Gun 1996 movie instead. I don't like when movie creators don't honor and adhere to original TV or movie concepts, as it seems spitefully disrespectful, as if they are saying "I have a better idea." I won't see anymore Mission: Impossible movies as a result of this. It's like The Green Hornet (2011) movie that ruins a good concept, by hijacking it totally somewhere else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loose, Clunky Storytelling That's Rescued by Great Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it absolutely reeks of '90s blockbuster clichés, a confident performance from Tom Cruise and two or three truly great action sets ultimately save the first M:I from the dregs of mediocrity. The plot is a bit too twisty-turny for its own good, with perhaps ninety percent of the cast switching allegiances at least once before it's through, but that's kind of its thing and I can write off a few eccentricities in the name of identity. Jean Reno and Ving Rhames are wasted as generic lackeys, though, and the vital makeup effects aren't nearly as good as I had remembered. The magic of watching a guy rip off a faceful of fake skin is sort of lost when I can immediately identify who's wearing it as soon as they step on-screen. Though campy at times, it's still worth a watch for the perfect, trendsetting blend of action and suspense it brings to several key moments.</fullReview>

Most puzzling is that many of the actors in this movie have done GREAT movies. Thus, I have to wonder, were they improving in this piece of crap? Was De Palma just like "Meh, f*ck it, let the special effects guys write this garbage." Don't get me wrong, Tom Cruise is an awful actor anyway but Christ it was a so-called all star line-up! If it wasn't touted to this day as a good movie I wouldn't comment, but this sh*t will not end! Kill it already! In my opinion, if you haven't seen this movie, consider yourself lucky!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An American agent, under false suspicion of disloyalty, must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization.With the release of Ghost Protocol, I decided to run through the series once more to see what their built of. The trailer looked awesome, and I can't believe I never touched the series, so I started off with the first (of course!) and got ready to plunge my mind into the world of impossible. The first one... in my opinion, was good. Nothing more to it. What brought me by surprise is it's intelligence and some sort of visible style. The film is highly complex, and builds up on pure intensity and some weird filming technique. Another surprising quality was it's slow movement. The action is there, but is shots are varied and surely spread apart. In fact, there are about 4 action scenes throughout the film (which I didn't expect) but it isn't a problem. The movie begins seriously interesting, and the complexity and filming gives it some weird feeling throughout. I would never call the film bad (as much do) but those people only expected action and nothing more. I expected action, but nothing near to the amount of build-up it presented. So the tag line sells it, you expect the impossible. The film doesn't rely on action sets and whatever comes after, it brings intellectual sense onto and presents it nicely. If the series continues to give this impression, Ghost Protocol should seriously deliver. If people could understand this film is not purely based on ACTION, this would probably get a more deserving score. Mission: Impossible is the best way to make a spy film; intelligent plot, complexion, and intense sprawled action scenes throughout. See this film with caution, and expect the impossible. Impossibility that shows you can make a movie good without the such. Mission: Impossible receives 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The start of a cool spy thriller that isn't too convoluted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a cool and stylish spy thriller but also intelligent at the same time. This movie will inspire many films to come and there will be a lot of parodies for this movie. Yeah, the movie does have few bleak moments but it isn't way too far in between. This is going to be one of the biggest franchise for Tom Cruise and will lead to sequel. Some of the technology may not be plausible now and especially during 1996 but it isn't so far-fetched you can't really buy into it. Some scenarios may come off a gimmicky to some with the action sequences but it's still well crafted and blends right into the movie. The spy thrill elements are integrated very well and the theme song is just great. In fact the theme song is one of the most memorable them song in movie history. Although it was first used for the TV show before this movie. Few of the gadget seem a bit outdated, I mean it's still cool but nothing really amazing like how it was in 1996. The cool aspect of this movie might be a bit outdated but it was really cool for it's time and it's a stylish adaptation. Overall it's a spy thriller that should not be missed for anyone that is into this type of genre, especially if you like mystery thrillers. It isn't anything groundbreaking when it comes to the plot but it's still pretty good and there are some obvious plot holes but it's a movie that will inspire future movies of this genre and for the most part it is a entertaining spy thriller for adults. That flick isn't all about special effects, shoot outs and things blowing up. But a good mix between spy elements and a bit of action in it although the spy elements can be a bit over the top with the situation and all. But even the action for the most part is essential to the plot for the most part. It's a shame the next sequel isn't very good but still will be looking forward to this franchise to constantly get better as it progresses.7.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Tom Cruise Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the 1960's TV series of the same name on which this film was based, so I find myself comparing it to other action flicks, and especially to other films starring Tom Cruise. I've never found Tom Cruise to be among the finest actors I've seen, but what I generally like about his performances and his movies was present here in great abundance. The movie is fun, fast paced and full of action and energy. At times it can leave you breathless. Those qualities sometimes become its weakness, too, though. It's almost too fast in a few places, leaving your head spinning around a plot that I didn't think was either well developed or well explained and the end result of some of the extreme action is that some parts of the movie can seem quite slow in comparison. Some of the action scenes in the movie (especially the helicopter chasing the train through the Chunnel) was a bit too over the top.The movie centres around Ethan Hunt, a US secret agent who becomes suspected of treason after a mission he's on goes awry and his team is killed. The viewer knows he's innocent - the question is who's the real mole? I found reason to suspect a number of people - perhaps there were too many to suspect, actually. I don't want things spelled out too clearly, because that would take the fun away, but I like to be able to have a clear enough story to be able to make an intelligent guess rather than just a wildcard bet.The performances here I thought were nothing to write home about. Not bad, but nobody really stood out to me as superb, either. It's a fair to middling action movie that's fun to watch - but there are better action movies out there. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good idea that is its own worst enemy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of "Mission Impossible" is like a defective fireman's trampoline. It is painstakingly stitched together, reinforced and strengthened. Like a faulty apparatus, however it stretches and breaks under the sheer weight of what it is supposed to support.I can explain the entire plot of this movie. I viewed the movie recently after seeing it five or so times before, but the difference was that it had been four years since my last viewing. With the aid my previous experience, I was finally able to connect all of the dots and see the whole picture. Contrary to popular belief, every facet of the story is explained, but not clearly so. In the end, it is like somebody viewing a complex tapestry through a pair of fogged glasses.I noticed a curious coincidence when I watched the theatrical trailer. A point was made to show all of the violent moments of the film. The images include mid-air acrobatics, fights, chases in the street, gunshots, exploding cars, guns being loaded, a woman being slammed against furniture, people clinging to the outside of a bullet train and an exploding helicopter. The impression is that of an exciting action film; the movie itself is not. The trailer even makes Henry Czerny's character look like the villain when he is not.The Impossible Mission Force, or IMF, is the most elite branch of the CIA where failure results in the repudiation of all knowledge of the operation. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of an IMF team led by Jim Phelps (Jon Voight, in the role originally played by Peter Graves). Phelps is absent for the first operation, an elaborate deception used to coerce a confession. Jim's wife (foreign film actor Emmanuelle Béart) is under anesthesia for the act, and the team is worried that she will die from being under too long. It seems logical that the IMF would not risk the life of an agent without an anesthesiologist present, but never mind.The team's mission, which they choose to accept, is to catch a traitor attempting to steal the NOC List, which matches undercover code names with the agents' birth names. All but Ethan are killed, and the director of the CIA (the aforementioned Henry Czerny), believes that Hunt is an agency mole since he is the only one to survive, although Claire is soon discovered to also be alive. After his escape, Hunt contacts the list's potential buyer (Vanessa Redgrave, highly respected international actress) and agrees to steal the real McCoy so he can discover the identity of the man who betrayed him and his team.The problem is that the plot does explain itself thoroughly, but does so in such a convoluted and roundabout fashion that it leaves heads spinning like tops. There is one section where the mole is lying and trying to shift the blame to another. During this time Hunt is saying and thinking competing versions, and the result is confusing so nobody is sure what to believe. If you want see films that have complicated plots but explain them with marked clarity, watch "Star Trek VI" or "The Maltese Falcon." It is bad enough when the casual moviegoer is baffled, but when Roger Ebert says he cannot pass a test on the plot, the script has some serious problems.The other issue is the movie's inability to define itself. Despite the sales pitch of the preview, there is little action to speak of. It is really more of a suspense film, but by misrepresenting itself, it limits its potential. The two famous scenes involve the theft of a computer program from an impenetrable vault and the finale when a helicopter is attached to a bullet train and gets dragged into the Chunnel (an underwater train tunnel connecting England to France, for those who do not know). Only three bullets are fired, and none of them by Hunt.The acting is mostly pedestrian. Only Czerny and Voight, and to a lesser extent Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, stand out. Czerny is deliberate and Voight is especially effective with the delivery of two lines, "if discovered, they'll be executed," and "They stamped it didn't they? Those damn Gideons!" Yet, for some reason, I enjoy it. It is probably the ingenuity of the vault theft and helicopter finale. Despite its significant flaws, it has a real sense of fun and some wit in the dialogue. It will disappoint fans of the original series and people expecting lots of action, but it is just good enough to rank a six out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Confusing Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Phelps and his team charged with stopping a traitor from stealing and selling classified material. Everything was going well until the man they are following and all of the team are inexplicably killed except for Ethan Hunt. Ethan then calls the Director and goes to meet him when he discovers that the whole mission was to ferret a mole that they have been suspicious of for some time. Since Ethan is alive, the Director suspects him of being the mole. Now Ethan must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization.I had to see this movie twice because the first time was very confusing, with a complicated plot so I had to watch a second time to understand the whole movie. This film is very smart and has some twists that may leave you surprise.There are memorable sequences in the film, including Tom Cruise breaking into the CIA via the roof. It has great tension and suspense. This movie all leads to the great explosive ending with great special effects. Tom Cruise's and Emmanuelle Béart's acting are very good.Although not as exciting and good as the third film, this is a smart thriller in which average movie goers might get confused during the movie but this is a solid thriller and it is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining action film, more or less true to the spirit of the TV series. Best sequence was when Cruise was suspended over the computer vault (but why have an air conditioning duct large enough to crawl through leading into such an ultra secure area?). Lots of good gadgets, I liked the exploding chewing gum and the TV camera glasses. Good title graphics and music. Sequence on top of the train was excellent.Bit of a travelogue, could have done with being a little longer, say 10 ? 15 minutes. The ending in the Channel Tunnel could have been more spectacular although this sequence did get a little ludicrous (the helicopter blades and Tom Cruise's neck). The plot was extremely convoluted (but then so was the TV series) No internet connections were ever that fast! A little too violent in places in comparison with the lighter approach of the TV series.</fullReview>

When a routine mission to retrieve invaluable intelligence in Prague goes horribly awry, maverick team leader Cruise must take it on the lam to find out what went wrong and who the real mastermind is behind the operation, all the while eluding those in the agency who have deemed him the culprit. Elaborate and complex with memorable action set pieces, suspenseful situations, and plenty of twists, but they're all set in the midst of a confusing and incomprehensible story. Watchable thanks to a good cast and intriguing plot devices, just don't expect a great deal of clarity. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enter the mind of Ethan Hunt, a slick and clever spy working for the IMF. He's the James Bond of the new century, getting cool gadgets and working with a crack staff of team members. Mission Impossible, based upon the hit TV series, gives us a new look at spy's. Unlike Bong who gets all the girls and kills the bad guy in a matter of minutes, Hunt gets no women and can't even pin the villain in a matter of three days. Brian De Palma gives the spies in Mission Impossible a more human shell, which whom they really are and not some Super-Man hit-man. Mission Impossible, though unfaithful to the series it's derived from, sets itself up as a intelligent spy franchise. The only problem a person can have with this movie is it's confusing plot. But the only way we can get past the plot is just go with the films flow, and we do.Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, the point man spy in a group of agents under the control of their leader Jim Phelps, played by John Voight. They are assigned to crash a party and photograph a man who is said to have a computer disk containing every name of every IMF agent in the embassy and their aliases. Hunt and his team go to the party undercover and retrieve the photographs only to have each member of the team picked off one by one. Even Phelps gets knocked off and Ethan is the only one left alive. Ethan is then told the mission was a fake to flush out a mole who's been paying an arms dealer and they suspect Ethan of being that mole. It's now up to Ethan to find the real mole and save his name with the help of a few suspended operatives, including Ving Rhames. Now this plot may sound simple, but that's because your reading it. I had to watch the movie twice to fully understand the plot.Mission Impossible may have this overly thought out plot but you forget all about it. Tom looks cool, the gadgets are cool, and the action is neatly done to give us a nice ride through a spy mission without even remembering what the plot was about. Tom's acting is perfectly done to give Ethan the on the run spy. Ving is awesome as Ethan's partner and Mrs. Beart as Claire Phelps is a nice touch. The special effects are nice. A little hokey looking though, especially the final chase scene on a train being fallowed by a helicopter. And the bad guy, even though there feels like there's three of them, is a clever plot twist that leaves us satisfied. Plus the gadgets are awesome. Exploding chewing gum, fluid spewing pens, exploding video cassettes, it's all here and not over used like any Bond weapon.The only real beef with this movie is that there wasn't enough action. De Palma acts out by directing this movie with more brain then brawn. We have too much plot but little action. The real movie's blunder doesn't even pick up till half way in when we have the memorable shot of Ethan dangling about an inch over a pressure padded floor trying to retrieve the disk of aliases. With the name Mission Impossible, we expect plenty of action sequences but instead we have a warmed over plot going three different ways. Even the ending battle isn't that memorable and it leaves us with a feeling of, not awe, but shallowness. But that doesn't mean De Palma didn't do a good job. He does a great job giving his Hitchcock touch to the movie, giving us smart characters and a real atmosphere. Mission Impossible gets a 7 out 10 from me. It was cool, but does't get our attention right away. And if you had to choose one M:I movie to see, go see part 3. Part 3 was best, easily beating out this brain scratching film and John Woo's weepy sequel. Mission impossible= B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1996 blockbuster from director Brian De Palma has a close parallel with its 1960's and 70's TV counterpart. Released only a year after the Bond franchise was revived with Pierce Brosnan's new portrayal as the suave Brit spy in the mega hit 'GoldenEye', 'Mission: Impossible' seems with a basic understanding of the context to have been made as a rival franchise. This is similar to the way the 'Mission: Impossible' TV series was produced in order to compete with the first ever Bond movies of the 1960's.And it is fair to say that this movie is definitely a worthy competitor for the Bond movies; with it's tight and straight direction, it's narrative is played out smoothly, taking its time to explain the plot (which is arguably, upon first viewing quite complicated - but with foreknowledge of its complexity upon preceding viewings easily digested). It is only with the primary focus on Tom Cruise's character that reveals the producers' hidden agenda of rivalling the new Bond movies with an equally independent secret agent, Ethan Hunt. What is different from the conventions of the Bond movies, however, is the relaxed nature of the movie, there doesn't seem to be any need to try to hard with action sequences as a means to keep the audience hooked. It is De Palma's classic ability to build tension and angst during scenes in which the characters are simply laying out the plot or unravelling a mystery that makes it so entertaining. With Danny Elfman's soundtrack thrilling as ever and the (quite disappointing sparseness of the) always hummable 'Mission: Impossible' theme tune elevate this movie (notably with the theme tune) to the recognition that only the Bond franchise can trump.With seemingly endless twists and turns, this movie is far from predictable upon first viewing, especially with the foreknowledge that exists with fans of the original TV series. With only the enhancement of Tom Cruise's character above the rest of his IMF team as a signal that it is trying to rival Bond, the rest; the absence of overusing the theme tune, loose women with breasts on display (something the movie could have lived with) and the necessity of constant action are signs that this is a classic movie where the action scenes will be remembered no matter what. I mean who can forget the image of Cruise descending into that white high-tech vault and the dead silence accompanying him like a harsh barrier just waiting for him to slip. Just a classic film.Shame about the sequel though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, I heard terrible things about this film before I saw it on video. After watching this film several times, I got the plot but I also get a little more each time. I love watching Dame Vanessa Redgrave as a female criminal mastermind in this role. I also enjoyed a bit known actor, Rolf Saxon, an American expatriate living in London, as William Donloe. Remember he's the poor sucker that gets the blame for a breaking an entry that caught him off guard. I like Rolf Saxon as the gullible American in this film. He's the best part of the film in my opinion and the surprise to me since I became a fan of his in 1994 after watching old Capital City episodes. I believe did his job extremely well and deserved to be listed in both beginning and ending credits of the film. I love John Voight and can't imagine why Angelina Jolie doesn't want much to do with him. I felt Tom Cruise was adequate. I like Vingt Rhames and Henry Czerny in the their roles. I forget the French actress who was Voight's wife. That's too crazy to believe. I thought that Kristin Scott-Thomas and Emilio Estevez deserved more time on screen but that's the movie for you. I loved the Prague setting, Virginia countryside, and London as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been very keen on movies that are based on old(er) TV-series, because I've never seen the point of them, except for trying to make even more money out of a good concept of course. In a way Mission Impossible isn't any different from other movies that have been based on a series, but it still is good enough to keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Not that it is all that original. Of course it has been modernized and enhanced by using the latest special effects and computer animation their budget could buy and yes it all looks very spectacular, but in fact this isn't much else but a longer version of an average episode.Ethan Hunt, an American agent of a secret service called the IMF, is believed to be disloyal to his employer and is suspected of having killed almost his entire team of spies. He isn't the real traitor and knows that someone else in his team or in his secret service is the real bad guy. He has to find out what really happened and who is the guy they are looking for. In the meanwhile he has to stay out of the hands of some assassins who are send after him. Will he survive? Will he find out the shocking truth? It's up to you to discover...Don't expect an excellent and mind blowing story line. If it wasn't for the, especially at that time, stunning special effects and many plot twists, this movie would have gone by unnoticed. In fact this movie is nothing more but a 110 minutes taking roller-coaster ride. It's fun to do, but not for too many times in a row. I guess the true fans of the series will be the ones who love this movie the most. Even though I called it nothing more but a longer episode, I still give it a 7/10. It's OK, without being really special</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DePalma's all about lighting, camera angles, the perfect details for the perfect scene. All this makes for a much better finished product, and helps set the mood and pacing of the story. The story for this enterprise centers around Tom Cruise and his character, Ethan Hunt. When his mission goes awry, the frame begins to tighten. Everywhere he turns, everyone around Ethan seems to be on the "other" side, or operating in a duplicitous manner. It's up to our hero to fit together the pieces of this mental puzzle and figure out "who dunnit?"An interesting (if unoriginal) plot which plays out well beneath DePalma's direction and Cruise's performance abilities.I'm not a fan of Cruise. I personally don't like him very much. I've never cared for the way he comes off as feeling superior. But I do have to admit that he's done few movies that I haven't liked. He is a talent unto himself, and as over-rated as he may appear to be, I think he's earned those ratings by delivering quality entertainment through quality performances.Nice action, good level of suspense, interesting characters, and a flexible yet solid plot.A very entertaining (if unremarkable), slick endeavor.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best action films of the 1990's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rated PG-13 for Intense Action ViolenceGenre: Action/Adventure/Mystery/ThrillerStar Rating: **** out of 5This film is based on the classical CBS TV-series that ran from 1966-1973.This film is also a remake from another movie that came out in 1988 called Mission Impossible but this is a more updated version. The show's Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is the leader of the 'Impossible Missions Force.'In this 'episode,' Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is the point man for an IMF mission to catch a spy in the act of stealing information about the 'covers' of many other covert operatives. In the tradition of the TV show, the viewer is led down many plot twists, turns, and reversals, while the IMF members employ the latest in technology, disguises, and spy gadgetry to accomplish their mission. This movie has a much of memorable scenes and quotes like one memorable scene was the ending part with the fight on the train and going in and out the tunnel! Another part was when Ethan Hunt was inside that room stealing the data without being seen and being pulled down by rope. There is also a sequel to this film entitled Mission Impossible 2 and in the sequel to Mission Impossible 2, Tom Crusie is also the producer of the Mission Impossible sequel.BOTTOM LINE: A GREAT SPY FILM!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes that's the sort of technology showcased in this 8-year-old blockbuster, which is sadly already very out of date. Film starts out well, interesting, and clever, but somewhere after the first half hour unravels utterly. The plausibility goes directly from Hollywood cool downhill straight into Superman comic book land. It's way too much to itemize. I guess James Bond has been doing that sort of thing for years, but only recently have they too crossed the insult your intelligence line. MI has some very exciting and suspenseful moments, and a cast and a half to enact them for us. I just wish it had been toned down action technology wise, and beefed up with story believability or replaced a few of the tedious double crosses with um...a plot? Would have been quite good. Remember Dragnet '87? When it was over you thought to yourself, 'I do believe the TV theme music was the best part.' Deja Vu!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of the worst movies of the 90's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a fan of the 80's TV series known as 'Mission Impossible', so I was keenly awaiting the Hollywood movie with the same name, starring Tom Cruise. While I feel it was not a completely bad film, I am a person who was not impressed by most aspects of it, especially in its confusing story. There were also some scenes which I feel were totally 'wanky', bringing this film down for me big time.Ethan Hunt is a secret agent framed for the deaths of his espionage team. Fleeing from government assassins, breaking CIA's most impenetrable vault, clinging to the roof of a speeding bullet train, Hunt races like a burning fuse to stay one step ahead of his pursers.and draw one step closer to discovering the shocking truth.The main offenders in this movie have to be the script writers, who did what I would say was an appalling job with this movie's script. Firstly to kill off so many of the 'mission impossible' team does not work in my opinion, as it makes the team members that are left, seem all the more important. But if they cannot fill the void left by their former partners, then the whole franchise will have problems.Then to make characters come back to life, or change from one side to another just makes the story even more confusing. This leads me to the complex plot of the film. Now usually I love a film that takes the audience a while to work out, but in Mission Impossible, I found this story to be too confusing, which did not allow me to appreciate what it was trying to show. The writers include David Koepp, Steven Zaillian and Robert Towne, with this story loosely based on the television series created by Bruce Geller.The direction of 'Mission Impossible' was taken on by Brian De Palma, who gave us such films as the Untouchables and horror classic 'Carrie'. In general De Palma did an ok job with this film, but the story he was working with did not allow him to bring out the movie's great action, which I believe were missing. However I was not a big fan of the cinematography of this film, done by Stephen H. Burum. I mean the supposed 'great' scenes of the film are not shown in a way that I liked, which made me hate the movie even more.The main star of the MI was its producer. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is a man who is placed into a situation that finds is getting more and more precarious as he goes along. As cool as Cruise looks in the part of Hunt, it is my feeling that a different actor could do justice to the role, while at the same time filling the hole that is left by the lack of MI team members.The other cast members are very difficult to work out. The original team include leader Jim 'Mr.' Phelps (Jon Voight), who is a very strange man indeed. Other agents include Claire (Emmanuelle Béart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott-Thomas), Max (Vanessa Redgrave) and Jack Harmon (the unaccredited Emilio Estevez). Something bad has happened to this team, and Hunt has been framed for it.After Hunt lets team boss Kittridge (Henry Czerny), know that he understands what is going, Hunt looks for help from some new team members. The only other agent left is Claire, but now helping Hunt are Luther (Ving Rhames) an ok character, Krieger (Jean Reno) and Frank Barnes (Dale Dye). Yet everything is still not right. Hunt is helping out top government official, Hannah (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), which in turn will help clear his name from all the mess he finds himself in.There are two scenes in this film that I am sure people love, but I truly hate. The first is when Hunt is helped inside an impenetrable vault, when he is trying to get a hold of crucial government documents. Now most people would say that this sequence is 'thrilling', but not for me. I was not moved by it all, as I feel this scene tried to hard to be thrilling, making it quite dull. The other bad scene is the total end of the film, when Hunt is being chased by Mr. Phelps and Krieger on a speeding bullet train with a helicopter. This sequence for me was uneventful, unrealistically shot and clichéd, with the way we see Hunt end up being totally unoriginal in my view. In fact the last 40 minutes of MI are the most boring I have ever seen in a spy film.However there are some areas I do like in the film. Like James Bond, I enjoy many of the various 'spy toys' that make this job seem very fun. Such devices as explosive chewing gum, eyeglasses with built in TV cameras, many agents in different elaborate disguises and the way that laptop computers are used by quoting a certain verse in the bible. I must also admit that I am a big fan of the Mission Impossible theme, which has been great to listen for the best part of 20 years now. The music for this film was done by Danny Elfman, with the original Mission: Impossible theme by Lalo Schifrin.It is ironic that this film was called 'Mission Impossible', because it was rather an 'impossible mission' for me too actually like it, in fact I hated most of it. Mission Impossible is a film that had the potential to be great, but alas it was not. Perhaps if the script writers were more intent on making a film that made a bit of sense and tried not to change the MI idea I could have liked it. But unfortunately they changed it, and by doing so, they have a huge detractor in me.CMRS gives 'Mission Impossible': 1.5 (Bad - Ok Film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only exception I make to that rule is Rain Man because Tom is finally not the one pulling all the strings. With a superior actor like Dustin Hoffman alongside him, Cruise is obviously overshadowed. That's why he makes movies like this, so he stays in the limelight and everyone else gets a pension plan.Mission: Impossible is better than MI2, but that isn't saying much. That is like comparing a car crash to a nuclear meltdown. For starters, Brian dePalma is much more in tune with the genre than John Woo. Second, MI is trying to be an updated Hitchcock-style thriller. MI2 wants to be another John Woo action movie with MTV-style cinematography, loads of computer effects, and slow-motion galore. Boring...No wonder these movies stink! Their source material is one of the worst TV series of the 60s! Can't Hollywood get some decent writers for their blockbusters instead of relying on David Koepp? dePalma uses his camera in a fashion similar to the Untouchables, but here he is obviously going for the hi-tech Hitchcock spy movie (a cross James Bond and North by Northwest). It doesn't work, the formula is too contradicting.Overall, this movie stinks. For a better understanding of modern espionage thrillers, stick with Ronin. It's not great, but at least it has a more competent director behind the camera. 2 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Mission: Impossible' is sort of like an entertaining 'movie: impossible'. To understand the plot completely and to really believe the things we see on the screen are pretty impossible, but it does deliver what it promises. I was able to put the confusing parts aside and enjoy this well made action thriller.The movie starts in Prague with a team of agents on a secret mission that includes Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jack (Emilio Estevez), Sarah (Kristin Scott Thomas), Claire (Emmanuelle Béart) and her husband and also leader Jim (Jon Voight). Things go terribly wrong and Ethan is the only one who survives the mission. He meets with his main superior named Kittridge (Henry Czerny) only to find out they were looking for a mole. Since he is the only survivor they think Ethan is the man they want. Of course he escapes and to find the real mole, or at least discover the truth, he contacts the person the mole was working for, codename: Max (he turns out to be a she with the face of Vanessa Redgrave). Since a lot of people are looking for Ethan he decides to help Max and deliver what she wanted from the original mole. He does this with the help of Claire, who survived after all, and two other men (Jean Reno and Ving Rhames) who used to work for the same organization as Ethan did.I guess what I have written above is true, but completely sure I am not. It is hard to complain though. The action is terrific and there are at least five singles scenes that could have been entire movies. To give you an example, Ethan has to retrieve something for Max from the CIA head quarters. Since he is a wanted man he has to steal it in a difficult way, of course. This turns 'Mission: Impossible' temporarily into a heist movie with events that could fill complete movies like 'Heist' or the terrific 'Ocean's Eleven'. The movie moves so fast that you can't even realize you don't get the plot entirely.Maybe in the end the movie has trouble to make the right choices but on the other hand it gives us the kind of action we want. Much better than the sequel 'Mission: Impossible' is a movie that delivers. Brian De Palma's direction makes sure we get what we want in a nice way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Brian DE Palma brings us this thriller based on the 60's TV show that is from the beginning very confusing, often tedious and overall a big dissapointment. This over long film stars Tom Cruise as secret agent Ethan Hunt who's whole team is killed off after their mission goes horribly worng, but after investigating the situation he sees that nothing is reallt what it seems. If your brain isn't hurting by the end you are delighted to a great action scene on the top of a train whichk really is the only worth while part of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission Impossible is great,it starts off slow but comes to great suspense and action.You just have to try getting into it a little. It is about a crew (Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt) who are assigned to a mission regarding the CIA as they have access to their identities. It might sound cliche but it isn't.Mission impossible uses several different techniques with special effects (the hanging scene,the facemaker etc.) which are all brilliant and work in the most natrual way.Not just this,it concentrates on the plot as well as the action scenes which did impress me,it is a very Hi tech thriller and deserves everything it gets,and soon (when I have time)I will watch the sequel.If you can't get enough then play the playstation video game which is brilliant.I rate 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something is missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a huge hit and it made a lot of money and I'm still wondering why. I can't get it. This is Brian De Palma's work but if I'd have to compare it to something else he has done over the years I'd have to say this stinks. He's done so much better. Then what's wrong with "Mission: Impossible"? I really can't tell. It's a cute little thriller but something is definitely missing. Maybe it's lacking the action too much, even though the end scene is pretty awesome. Too much computers will most certainly kill the thrill too. From time to time "Mission: Impossible" is quite boring. Luckily John Woo's crazy sequel, "Mission: Impossible 2" was something completely different. It had everything movie needs to entertain. The original is far from perfect thriller but still, if you're about to watch "M:I-2" this might just be something to watch as a nice warm-up. Because that's all that it's good for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most common comments about Mission: Impossible is that it is 'unfathomable'. The story is certainly complex and you have to watch it at least two or three times to get the entire story straight but the story is half the enjoyment. How often does a movie come along that is so in depth and complex that you can't absorb it all the first time? The story is not difficult to understand if you pay attention and should certainly be praised for it's detail. The lack of detail was part of the criticism about M:I 2. M:I was definitely not your typical 'fast-food-for-the-brain'.The characters are believable - Ethan's charming vulnerability, warmth and refreshingly normal ego (instead of the 'arrogant' side we see in M:I 2) makes him a hero we cheer for. The warm relationships between the original team will always be an example of the heart of M:I. The stunts were impressive, as were the action scenes (so much so that some were copied for M:I 2) and the human story is equal to the action.This will always be a favourite of mine because this is not your typical A-to-B storyline which is predictable from the word "Go!". The characters are great, the action impressive but not as over the top as M:I 2 and is quite an example of how to make a action movie with a heart without making it nauseating. *This* is how to make a Mission: Impossible - maybe they should take note for the inevitable M:I 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For Tom Cruise fans and non-fans alike. This wonderful thriller, is so well crafted, that it took my breath away. Many people (even profession film critics!) didn't understand it. Perhaps it is too well written. Yes, it is complex. Yes, it is written for people with an attention span greater than a 3 year old's - you MUST pay attention; but it DOES make sense. Every single second of the film is important. Director Brian De Palma gives us the unexpected, at every turn. His visuals, as always, are exciting. The entire cast is fine; but it is De Palma's movie, all the way. One of the best film's of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mission: Impossible" is a fine action film that is just a little bit too smart for its own good. The film deals with the mission: impossible team trying to capture a double-agent in Prague, but being unsuccessful. After the entire team, except Tom Cruise, is eliminated, Cruise becomes the prime suspect in the shady dealings. Nothing is quite as it seems and the action is mixed with complicated, and somewhat confusing material. To put it bluntly, this is a thinking person's action film that is good but a bit difficult to grasp on the first viewing. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission Impossible(1996) shows why Brian De Palma is a talented but inconsisent director working in Hollywood today. The set-pieces in the film are good but not as impressive as in his best films. It relies too much on mystery and not enough on action which was what made the TV show popular. Mission Impossible is not as good as The Untouchables(1987) as it doesn't have the same type of power. Brian De Palma should stick to what he does best and that's doing Suspense Thrillers.</fullReview>

All the on-screen presence of Ethan Hawke, plus all the machismo of Helen Hunt. Now I don't know how many focus groups it took to come up with it, but every time Mr. Cruise's on-screen monniker was spoken throughout the film, I couldn't help but think I was either at a polo match or a drug-anon meeting.A superb cast. Emmanuelle Beart-wasted, Jean Reno-wasted, Kristin Scott Thomas, Henry Czerny, Ving Rhames, Jon Voight-wasted, wasted, wasted, and wasted. Dale Dye even gets a chance to make a less than meaningful impression.I can't agree that the story was confusing--it was just plain stupid. David Koepp should've done better-although sadly (without giant dinosaurs) this might just be his best , and Steven Zaillian, a true talent should be ashamed.An out and out embarrassment at every level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Took me a few watches, but I figured it out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three, actually. It's because, in regular movies, someone explains the plot outright, so the audience doesn't have to think about it. You really had to pay attention to the details to figure it out. Let's see how accurate I am.Voight was a mole working for the CIA and was trying to steal a special list of secret operatives to sell to the enemy. To cover his tracks, he killed everyone on his team and made it look like he died with them. Cruise was taking the fall, but was determined to prove his innocence. Keeping tabs on Cruise was Voight's wife, Claire, who he happened to fall for (even though he had figured Voight wasn't dead).So, Cruise wins the trust of a criminal ready to pay top dollar for the list and gets a new team to steal the other half of the list. He and the criminal meet on the train to exchange the list and the money, but Voight wants the money. And I'm sure you can lay everything over from there on.It was a good movie with good actors, and nice story, and excellent action sequences. It's worth a look, and even a second look, for anyone who hasn't seen it and those who have. Very well directed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one mission you MUST choose!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission Impossible will stand the test of time and will be a classic action film and series. I haven't seen an episode of the original TV series in many, many, many years so it in no way effected by opinions of the film blockbuster. Mission Impossible is everything an action film needs to be and easily embodies everything that great action classics have. A top drawing movie star in Tom Cruise, a really good villain, a big action film director, an enormous budget, and a complex and intriguing story line with plenty of action scenes.Tom Cruise headlines the cast as disavowed agent Ethan Hunt. Now say what you will (and people are saying plenty nowadays) about Cruise but I still think he's a powerful star and a great on screen presence and this was no exception. The character is not entirely difficult or complex but Hunt is suave, smart, well trained and a great hero and Tom Cruise pulls it off flawlessly and no one else could play Hunt. He's perfect in this role!! Jon Voight is his mentor and father figure as well as the perfect adversary as he takes a turn to the bad side as veteran IMF agent Jim Phelps (the only character to return from the original TV Series.) Voight adds class and experience to the cast and he's absolutely villainous as Phelps and although he's really no match for Hunt who he's trained perhaps too well his character is perfect as is he in the role. Emmanuelle Béart is as close to a leading lady as the film has. Mission Impossible kind of has a stigma almost like a "Bond Girl" with each film and Béart is the Mission Impossible girl for this installment, Claire Phelps (wife/"widow" of Jim Phelps.) She does a decent job but the chemistry is slightly lacking between her and Cruise and she never really gets a big character development, she's just kind of there but she does alright. Becoming one of my favorite supporting character actors is french actor Jean Reno who plays bad guy Franz Krieger. I prefer him in hero roles but his bad guy is equally good although he's kind of the henchman of the film and is doomed from the beginning. He still adds to the cast a great deal. Ving Rhames plays disavowed agent Luther Stickell in a role which turns into a long lasting partnership between Luther and Ethan. His role is slightly small but they probably keep it small so as to not overshadow Cruise's character because Rhames can be a big screen presence in his own right. Also noteworthy is MULTI talented and MULTI Oscar nominated (one win) actress Vanessa Redgrave who plays "Max." She deliciously mysterious and bad all at once and the sexual chemistry and banter between her and Cruise is overwhelming and very witty. She definitely adds some class to the film.Now I will admit to something because I've heard many other people mention this as well, since seeing Mission Impossible over ten years ago and several times since the plot has confused me since day one!! It was only this most recent viewing that I finally understood it. I suppose it's not overly complex but they really don't go into a lot of detail and explain it out. But the film has always been incredible because of it's action sequences and characters which really gives the film a lot of kudos. It's absolutely worth seeing and worth seeing again until you do understand it. I think it could have been simplified but for what it is, it's great and it will be if not already an absolute classic. Ethan Hunt's daring theft of a top secret agent list as he dangles above an incredibly high security room, the edge of your seat chase aboard a high speed train, and OF COURSE...the unmistakable thumping beat of the Mission Impossible song which is used three times in the film and every time absolutely gets your blood pumping!! If you want an unmistakable incredible action film this is it!!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mission: Impossible" is next to "Heat" known as the action movie with very few action in it.The main reason why the movie got criticized was because of the complex story which no normal human seemed to understand. Well, let me say this, after watching it about 5 times you will understand it completely and you don't even understand anymore why you didn't got it the first time. But even without fully understanding the movie you can very much appreciate this movie, like also I did the first time I saw it.The movie even is enjoyable for the Brian De Palma hater. His style is present (so there also is enough to enjoy for the De Palma fans, like myself) but not in such a way that it distracts in any way for the more casual viewer.Venessa Redgrave and Tom Cruise really seemed to be enjoying themselves playing together in this movie. You can tell they had lots of fun in their scene's which for me makes those scene's really enjoyable to watch. But again there is also plenty to enjoy for the more casual viewer. The exciting CIA break in is already a classic and the spectacular ending on the TGV also doesn't disappoint.The music from Danny Elfman is typically his style and suits the movie surprising well, he delivers one of this best works till date."Mission: Impossible" deserves more credit than it gets. Don't let the complex story scare you of.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than Woo's sterile sequel, but has the unmistakable stamp of De Palma's illogic. Except, this time it isn't so much illogic as total confusion for the viewer. The plot twists and the conspiracy haze go quite far, and it isn't long after one gives up in trying to understand who is doing what to whom for what reason. The movie isn't boring, I'll give it that; De Palma's films are rarely boring. However, there is also a casting problem: Rhames - of all people - plays a computer expert, a hacker, no less. This is absolutely ridiculous. Then we have the old and nearly fat Jon Voight karate-chopping the young James Bond-type Tom Cruise character. Even more absurd, Voight's wife is Emmanuelle Beart. These two are as convincing a pair as Bob Dole and Britney Spears would be. The action sequences with the helicopter are Woo-esquire: Cruise blows up the chopper and the explosion throws him - unharmed - onto the train, which is going at around 200 km/h. And then a part of the chopper fails to impale him by a mere millimeter. These scenes were truly prophetic because Woo - the king of absurdist action scenes - took over in the sequel. Beart comes complete with a set of fake breasts and an upper lip so pumped up with silicone (or whatever it is they inject there) that her mouth is perpetually pursed to kiss someone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MISSION : IMPOSSIBLE (1996) *** Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Henry Czerny, Jean Reno, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Redgrave, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Emilio Estevez (unbilled). High energy and quirky direction by Brian De Palma plus Cruise's usual cocky feistiness makes for a better than average big screen adaptation of a classic TV series. Cruise is Ethan Hunt, master of disguise on a mission to find out the reason his team was wiped out on a mole hunt in Europe, who is up to his neck in intrigue and one helluva complex plot line with some neat twists and great support from a well-cast international ensemble (although some aren't used to their best potential). Best bits: breaking into CIA headquarters and the best helicopter/train chase ever put on film. Danny Elfman's tweaking of the classic score keeps the pace as well as U2's Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr.'s ultracool remake of the Lalo Schifrin's main theme. Dumdumdumdum?</fullReview>

All the characters fit in their roles well. It all starts as a regular spy mission movie, but the unbelieveable turn of events leave the viewers as much amazed as the main characters. The slow recovery from this initial shock, the pursuit of truth, the missoin, the revelation, the hope/love/belief, and the grand finale; all of it has been well knitted in a single fully flowing hellufa movie.This movie is far better than its all-action'n'stunt-jon-woo MI2.

Any redeeming value the film might have had is lost under the impact of the extreme lack of sensitivity.Oh yes, there is one scene that I remember, not because of the action, but because of the total absurdity of it. Care to guess which one that was? Yep - the big tunnel scene. I've seen a lot of movie scenes that asked me to stretch my imagination pretty far, or even suspend my capacity for reason altogether, but never before have I been insulted like this. The setting of the film and the property itself demands that the events and the action be at least plausible. That, too, was tossed aside by Tom Cruise.What a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would seem the "Impossible" mission is to find as many ways as possible to degrade an original inspired series/idea. First let's get rid of the Jim Phelps character so that Tom Cruise's ego has no competitors and he can take over the lead spot in any unfortunate spin offs from this mess. Second let's forget clever story lines and substitute ridiculous unbelievable special effects. Cruise must have been made of asbestos to survive the train explosion scene. Brian de Palma "directed" this ? The (original)I.M.F force was a team effort lead by the uncorruptible Jim Phelps and they relied on brains plus meticulous planning to succeed in their missions. Each member had his part to play in order for the team to survive and they were the good guys saving us from the bad guys. This movie will do nothing for de Palma's reputation. The final result is a disappointment , more so because in places the movie does get it right and it becomes evident what could have been and should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for fans of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is little more than a formulaic Hollywood thriller, and if that's what you expect, then it delivers as a visually striking and well-paced movie.However, if you're a fan of the original, be prepared to be strongly disappointed. The idea behind M:I is that the IMF team and the audience know what's going on, but the villains don't. Here, the script turns this basic principle on its head.There is another major problem with the Jim Phelps character here. It might have been safer to have called him Dan Briggs and explained the change in team leader in 1967.These elements combine to make the M:I movie one of the most disappointing and frustrating movie experiences - but only if you have seen the 1960s originals. I can only recommend it to those who haven't seen them, or are unfamiliar with M:I on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusion: Quite Possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mission: Impossible" gained a reputation for being a sloppily unsolvable riddle of a film, full of so many holes and turnabouts and crossed loyalties that the viewer was left more irritated than perplexed. Watching it a second time with that in mind, what was surprising to me was that all the pieces of this puzzle fit together somehow...despite a few minor plot holes and improbabilities, the basic thrust of the film retains a certain logic and solvability. What's less surprising is how little this all matters. "Mission: Impossible" remains an average film dominated a few remarkable setpieces. The film moves rather impatiently and hurriedly through its scenes of intrigue and doublecrossing (the real source of so much audience confusion) in order to set up its action scenes. Cruise overplays with admirable confidence, but this remains a good action film, but a mediocre spy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is such an under-appreciated movie, its definitely the best of the 3. didn't HATE the 2nd one, but the movie got way too stylized and "rock &amp; roll" looking. and the 3rd one......forget it, that one just sucked. unlike the 2 sequels, this one actually FEELS like a mission impossible movie. the other 2 just felt like typical action crap. this one had the cool gadgets, the "agency" feel with all the different hackers and agents working undercover, the cool stealth-ness, it just had that "spy/mission impossible" feel that the other ones got more and more away from. it also has an incredible danny elfman score that really got that spy/sneaky/action sound with the right hint of quirkiness, and no tampering with the original MI theme (at least until the U2 version at the end credits, which i thought was a brilliant take on the MI theme). the stunts were very "MI" like, the whole fighting on the bullet train finale was amazing, and who could forget that scene of trying to quietly infiltrate CIA headquarters? that scene has been parodied time and time again, one of the best scenes in the movie. simply put, this is the best of the 3 films, and it has a good spy story to go with it. its not just tom cruise playing James bond, "stopping the evil villain" etc, it actually was about him being framed by the agency and you don't even know who the real bad guy is until the end. it was really well done, and not THAT confusing. after you watch it a few times, you actually get it. the movie makes you THINK, which is what i like about it. and all the performances were great. ving raymes, tom cruise, everyone. if your going to see a Mission Impossible movie, see this one, the first and the greatest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie that claims to be based on reality there are too much things that don't work in reality! I will only point out the two major flaws of the movie in this respect: 1) Tom Cruise falling with a fast pace towards a sensitive alarm wired floor! Yes he doesn't touch the floor, but the movie made us believe that this alarm that is installed in the floor is very sensitive ... well if it was, why didn't it go off? The pressure of the wind alone that Cruise's falling caused, should have triggered it (and I won't consider the fact, that a normal human being would be sweating like a pig, especially hanging like that ... any drop on the floor would have been the end of this heist/scam or whatever you want to call it) 2) The helicopter scene. Even people who like the movie more than me, do agree that this is totally bananas! Not only the fact that the helicopter goes into the tunnel or they used bad CGI (by today standards even more so), but for the fact that it literally stopped right in front of Mr. Cruise ... Again for a movie that tries to be real, a big suspension of disbelief isn't working here ...And then of course you have the BS plot, that anyone who has seen more than three thrillers can smell 10 miles against the wind ... Seriously it's so obvious and plain that there really is no suspense (oh and the fish tank explosion in the restaurant? What was that all about? Whatever!) Still the movie is shot and edited in a very professional way (you shouldn't expect otherwise from De Palma, the director here). And it has some action highlights (just not those I mentioned before!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twisted, confusing and action packed. This film makes you think that you're playing chess, with all the action of a James Bond film. Its Mission Impossible! While this film has an amazing array of gadgets, girls and gizmos it also adds to its reputation with its amazing death-defying stunts, and pyrotechnics that make you grab your seat. This is definitely the film of the year, without a doubt.The film starts off with a scene, seen through a camera in black and white, with a police officer interrogating a suspect. This scene is in another language, that instantly throws us off thinking that this is the enemy, but after the interrogation the man walks up to the door and peels off a rubber mask, and behold the glory that is, the action hero himself, Tom Cruise.Brian De Palma (director of The Untouchables, Scarface) directs Mission Impossible, giving us action, great explosions, close calls and intense scenes immediately after the starting credits.The director aims a small story at the start to lead up to the rest of the film, starting with a mission where all goes well until a few close calls with the target, and then it all goes wrong.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jim (Jon Voight), Clair (Emmanuelle B?art) and Jack infiltrate a party looking for their suspect who has the first half of the "NOC" list, a list of all the names of agents around the world. The "NOC" list is in two halves, the first half is held by the suspect and that contains all of the agents codenames, and the second disk contains the code names changed to real names, so both disks are needed.In the starting mission scene Tom Cruise is no-where in sight, until the early scene where he takes off his mask showing his disguise as an old man.There were many factors about this film which make it so amazing and so exciting. One of them is the rubber masks Tom Cruise keeps appearing from behind. These are definitely going to become a small famous thing to be related with Mission Impossible because it makes Mission Impossible "Mission Impossible".The life-threatening situations are dotted all over the place in Mission Impossible, making you really think about the situation.When I first watched Mission Impossible I thought I had everything sorted out and knew who was on who's side, but then when everything comes together it takes you a while to think it over an then you start appreciating the complexity of it all.Cruise is his usual self in this film as he is in all if his films, outstanding stunts and action, and soggy, floppy romance. Tom Cruise is meant only for action, when it comes down to romance, he just doesn't make it.So, all in all, wow. This is definitely one for the collections!</fullReview>

The mission to protect the list and identities of all the undercover operatives failed and Hunt is set up to take the blame. Hunt must get to the bottom of the conspiracy, find the list and save his name.The small screen classic finally gets a big screen treatment. Brian DePalma directs a reasonably taunt action thriller that diverges a bit for the original series but since this is a star vehicle for Cruise that is to be expected. The acting seems a bit stiff throughout 'Mission' but it moves at a solid pace and has a few cool action setpieces. A few cheesy digital effects aside 'Mission: Impossible' is a solid action franchise starter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After commenting on the piece of trash Mission Impossible 2, I decided to say something about the first MI. To begin, I want to say that Mission Impossible is one of my favorite thrillers so you already know that this is going to be a positive review. The first time I saw the rating of MI, I almost wanted to kill some IMDB users (I'm not joking). 6.5 is really insulting for such a great movie. Maybe it's not a flawless masterpiece but it deserves a 7.5 (Yeah, I know it's only one point, but for me it's a big difference). So anyway, I was like Hey, why do people think this movie ""sucks". I actually wanted to read some IMDB users opinions but I was too lazy so instead (I made something that coasted much more time) I went to see what Roger Ebert wrote and guess what, he's a pussy. His wannabe professional comment says only one thing `I didn't get it'. How stupid must you be for don't get this movie, Ok Ok, I have to admit the plot is a little more complicated than The Weeding planner's but Hey, it's nothing from another world. I could not believe that this was the major `flaw' for the majority of the people.So back to the film MI is a movie that (for a big part) lives from the style. De Palma's Direction is great, MI has a great atmosphere, especially the beginning with the scenes in Prague, and the scene in the security room has become a classic (even it's sequel tried to copy it). The acting is also good, I actually thought Tom Cruise was a pussy until I saw this movie; he gave a great performance as the paranoid guy who can't trust anybody. Another character that I liked was Ving Rhames's, it's difficult to describe how much Luther rules. Honorable Mention goes to Jean Reno and (a brilliant) John Voight. The score by Danny Elfman was very effective and is a pleasure to hear, I don't think it's necessary to say that the theme is legendary.To sum up MI is a great movie and everybody who likes thrillers should watch it.

Hollywood flirter and woman - screams Tom Cruise played the character Ethan Hunt perfectly and the movie was an immidietly hit. It is packed with the nice stuff; Cruise blowing up a aquarium resturant with an explosive gum, Cruise climbing on the top of a train, maskes!" - and the best of all; the scene that Mission Impossible has got film history to remember; when Cruise wires down into a complete white room where on the ground it stands a computer...you gotta see that one! We also get joined by actors Jon Voight, Jean Reno, Ving Rhames and Emmanuelle Beart, all fabulous in their parts. The film is so thrilling and is a long hunt all the time, very nice made! The story is awesome, simply breath taking within its fantastic style and mood. The movie challenges you if you really wonna know how things go with them and who si really the crock?

		<fullReview>Pros: Directing, score, action sequences, brilliant script.Cons: Lacks character development from other big name stars, his first team die rather quickly.This is one of the best spy movies ever. Although it was nominated for a Razzie as one of the worst written films, the script is its strenght. Basically Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt) has been framed for the murders of his colleagues and for being under the employment of max, an arms dealer. Cruise decides to work for max to find out who frames him and this results to one of the best scripts of the year. There are basically no plot holes and you need required viewing to see it. Danny Elfman's score is basically his best since Dick Tracy. It has memorable scenes, for example Tom Cruise hanging inside the Black Vault. The last 20 minutes has to be basically one of the most exciting in recent years. Most critics hated this movie but it gets better with age and repeated viewing. Kudos has to go to Brian De Palma for his fancy camera work and directing. The twist in the end is brilliant and Jon Voight is a fantastic villian. My favourite character in the movie has to be Gene Kittridge. Emmanuelle Beart fans hate this movie because she is basically there as eye candy for the guys. Premise: Ethan Hunt must find out who framed him.Mission: Impossible was not nominated for any Academy awards but it won a PGA golden laurel awards and was nominated for numerous MTV awards.Grade: 10/10 (Action packed spy classic)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*possible spoilers* Proving how stale the recent Bond movies have gotten, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is what the future Bonds should aspire to be like. An exceptionally well-written spy-thriller with mysterious characters and a plot for those who like to play the mystery. Tom Cruise is awesome as IMF team pointman Ethan Hunt, who's on the run to prove his innocence after nearly his entire team is killed during a mission in Prague. For the entire film, we're absorbed with the story and Hunt's quest to clear his name and find the person responsible. Co-stars Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Henry Czerny, and the beautiful Emmanuelle Beart lend some good support to the film as shady characters who you're never sure what side they're on. Jon Voight is a standout as Jim Phelps, in a role that now seems to have typecast him as the over-the-top villain. Much like RONIN, the film has a gritty realism and shows that flashy cars and neat Bondian toys can't always save you. From the now famous (and often copied/spoofed) CIA computer room break-in to the adrenaline-pumping helicopter/train finale, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is one of the best spy-thrillers ever made, and though I love many of the Bond movies up until TOMORROW NEVER DIES, this film most assuredly topples them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission:Impossible is a tightly scripted, taut, very suspenseful update of the old TV series that not only proves to be intelligent, but also has some adrenaline-pumping action sequences.Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt, a member of the IMF whose team is killed in a bungled attempt to recover a list of the true identities of many secret agents. When he meets with his agency, they suspect he is the culprit behind their killings and must flee to attempt to prove otherwise.Brian DePalma, a director known for providing involving, deeply rooted stories about conspiracies and ruthless factions, such as Scarface and Carlito's Way. In a film that just screams for non-stop, mindless action sequences, shootouts, and explosions, DePalma instead delivers an involving, complex film with action sequences both quietly effective and amazingly intense, as well as a great performance from John Voight and a charming, likeable, and witty performance from Tom Cruise. Danny Elfman's score is also effective in building tension throughout.While certainly not as breathtaking a thrill ride as other actioners, Mission:Impossible succeeds in delivering a satisfyingly complex, intriguing story and interesting, thoughtful, slick characters. It may falter sometimes in implausability, but the engaging story allows the suspense of disbelief. Thoroughly entertaining.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere as good as the TV show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot from Mission: Impossible, too bad I was dissappointed.I was one of those kids who loved the 1960's Mission:Impossible TV Show, it had suspense, incredible storylines/plots, and it also used ingenious use of camera work. So why was I so dissappointed by the movie?Well for one thing, the plot is far too damn complicated but its basically a molehunt/spy story. This film does not concetrate on the plot, it doesn't need to - this film is about one person and one person alone...Tom Cruise and his acting capability.The bad guy in this overly complex plot is Jim Phelps. This is an insult to every person who enjoyed the original TV show, and this is probably why Peter Graves (the guy who played phelps in the TV show) refused to do the movie. How can this film justify the fact that Phelps is a two-timing bad guy? By saying he'll get $10 million in bearer bonds.Anyway, the film whilst hurts on some levels, is enjoyable on others. The film has memorable scenes such as the 'inside job' on the headquarters of the CIA where Cruise must recover the NOC list from a high-security room (note without CCTV!) and the fight on board a speeding bullet train.The film gets rid of its stars far too quickly, and never uses them to the best of their acting abilities, instead the focus is all on Cruise's character.Sure the film is enjoyable, but lacks the 'sting' from TV show, nor the credible acting or storyline that this kind of film deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy cow, this has aged horribly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie in the theater. After that, I saw it at least once on VHS, maybe twice. I picked up the blu-ray of this, used from a Blockbuster that was closing. I've been more interested in seeing spy/action movies recently, and it seemed like something I should revisit.I wish I hadn't bought it.There are so many problems with this movie, nearly all of which have to do with the script.First, I don't care about anyone on the team. Cruise doesn't come across as having a personality, and he doesn't behave like a skilled agent. Everyone else in the cast seems to be disposable. Second, the plot had potential to be an interesting story, provided that the story was treated a little more like the A-Team, with them trying to prove their innocence. Instead, we wind up with a story where we aren't positive why Cruise is doing anything, except for some vague idea, and it comes across confusing, because it's hard to draw a line between his actions and his goal. Third, because of the first two, I find myself having no sense of tension or investment in the outcome of the movie. I couldn't care less if Cruise lives or dies.The movie hasn't aged well. The pacing is strange, and once again, computers are relegated to be magic boxes. And the action sequences seem to be... silly. When Cruise leaps from the exploding fish tank, I couldn't keep from laughing. The big finish fight with the train and the helicopter was not up to the same level of silliness, but it was very, very close.Now I have to figure out what to do with this blu-ray copy that I really will never look at again.</fullReview>

Given that Brian DePalma is the guiding force behind The Untouchables and the very structure of the TV show Mission: Impossible opens many avenues that one could explore with a large budget, a talented cast and the big screen, one certainly can be forgiven for keeping an open mind. Unfortunately, the end result is roughly 1-2 large scale action sequences surrounded by pure tedium. There is a lot of blame to go around for the end result, which burned up the box office and inspired two sequels (so far), but rarely if ever gets a mention on anyone's lists of favorite summer blockbusters. First, the storyline and characters are thoroughly uninteresting. For some reason known only to the screenwriters, the focal character is someone completely new, while the Jim Phelps character who led the TV series is shunted into support. The film allows absolutely no time to get a feel for the IMF team and how they work as our initial introduction to them is during a mission that turns into a disaster, leaving the majority of the team dead due to an obvious traitor. Naturally, the powers that be assume the traitor is the "lone survivor" (Tom Cruise), but we subsequently learn that another team member survived the melee (Emmanuelle Beart), so the two go on the run to steal a list of covert agents from the government to draw out a spy kingpin, who they hope will force the hand of the traitor and expose him/her (or some such thing). Like the TV show, there are a few twists and turns, double-crosses and reversals. Unlike the TV show, none of them are particularly surprising or involving. The cast looks better on paper than its plays out on screen. Kristin Scott-Thomas and Emilio Estevez are in the film for barely more than an eye blink before being dispatched. Lead Cruise is certainly up to the physical challenges of the role, but gives us no good reason to root for his character. He spends much of the film either blank-faced or glowering. Beart, as his co-hort and potential love interest, is lovely but listless. Jon Voight takes on the Jim Phelps role and pretty much contributes the same dull auto-pilot performance that he has reserved for his roles in popular entertainment for the last 20 years. Jean Reno is wasted as a later addition to Cruise's team, while Ving Rhames gets fed what few good lines there are and attempts to appear intimidating. Henry Czerny trots out a slightly starchier version of the uptight government official that he played in Clear and Present Danger. Meanwhile, more discerning viewers wait for the far-too-brief appearances of Vanessa Redgrave, who manages without breaking a sweat to make her fellow cast members appear laughable by comparison. DePalma, once known for some incredible set pieces, provides the film with stillborn pacing. He ratchets up the adrenaline in the final act in and on top of a speeding train, but prior to that we get one mildly amusing set piece with Cruise attempting a theft while suspended above the floor in a government building. Unfortunately, the scene goes on and on and on and on, ultimately losing whatever suspense and originality it may have initially possessed. These elements all culminate in a promising concept that misses its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High levels of action, not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although there was an impossible mission in this movie, the story has nothing whatsoever to do with the classic TV series. In the show, a team of under cover specialists created an artificial situation for the benefit of the victim(s) of a "Sting" type operation, usually resulting with their enemies turning on each other.The "IMF team" in this movie pretty much refers to Tom Cruise alone, with the rest of the team reduced in status to nameless flunkies who just stand around and watch as he single handedly saves the world. The TV show's covert stealth premise was tossed out, since Cruise doesn't emote well enough to convey the tension of committing espionage right under a dangerous enemy's nose. Instead, the original format was replaced by cranked up action at an "impossible" James Bond on steroids level, with scenes such as the exciting but ridiculously over the top helicopter/train sequence. Other actors have woefully limited screen time, but act their parts faithfully. The original score from the show is utilized well, spicing up the action effectively. The script is shallow, and the entire mole "twist" bit is concealed as well as is as an elephant hiding behind an ant. It's also an insanely stupid plot twist, which spits on the TV series. The Impossible Mission: to make Tom an action hero. See a James Bond flick or a rerun of the original TV series, instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the director Brian De Palma and I have to say that this is his worst movie yet (apart from Mission to Mars). Tom cruise is incapable of doing a good performance in all his movies, and this is no exception. I seriously don't see what everyone sees in him. Why other good actors like Jean Reno and Jon Voight would waste their time with this is absolutely beyond me. The only good thing that ever comes out of this movie is it's awesome theme. That has to be one of the most memorable pieces of music of all time. What amazes me most about this piece of schlock is that it managed to get TWO sequels to it. THAT's when you know that Hollywood is desperate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard quite a bit for Mission Impossible, especially now that the third one is about to come out in the theaters. I knew my parents owned the first Mission Impossible, but due to the crazy antics Tom Cruise has pulled on... well... basically everyone, he has pretty much turned me off of his movies. But, I figured to give the Mission Impossible movies a shot.While over all this is an exciting action/spy flicks, there were only a few scenes in the movie I felt were worth the watch. Obviously the exciting scene of Tom coming through the ceiling on wires and copying the information onto disk. The last action sequence of the helicopter and train with Ethan and our surprise villain, very well thought out, unrealistic, but exciting to watch. Over all, for movie's sake, give Mission Impossible a chance, but it's nothing I would scream or jump on couches about. :) 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inexcusable revision of a classic TV series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie for a while, but I do remember that when the movie ended I was livid. It wasn't that the production was poor (it was quite well done) or that the acting was poor (no Oscars, but good solid performances by all). The problem was with the screenplay.For those of you who did not grow up watching the Mission Impossible TV series, I can understand why you liked this movie and its sequel: you have nothing to base your opinion on except the movie. But for someone who has seen almost every episode of the Mission Impossible TV series, there were two fatal flaws in the screenplay that made me want to force-feed the screenplay back to the writers (David Koepp and Robert Towne) or at least force them to create an UNABRIDGED, G-rated screenplay for James Joyce's "Ulysses" before they are allowed to write anything else.The first sin has to do with teamwork. In the TV series, Jim Phelps would receive instructions on his next task, and after the message had self destructed, Jim would go about selecting those individuals who would be needed to complete this particular "impossible mission." After Jim Phelps met with the members of this team to discuss what needed to be done, the show would go about showing how each individual or groupings of individuals would go about with their assigned tasks (i.e. how DO you get tons of gold bullion out of a heavily guarded and surveilled vault without arousing suspicion?). This movie ended up ONLY being about Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise's character). As a matter of fact, MI2 was, once again, ONLY being about Ethan Hunt. This is so out of character with Bruce Geller's original TV series that I felt that the only thing the movie and the TV series had in common was the name "Mission Impossible." I think the reason for this is that in this day and age of movies like "The Bourne Identity" (which I liked, by the way), the Bond movies, and others, where there is only one person who seems to have his act together, and can fight off a small army of highly trained assassins without getting scratched, the idea of the individual hero is believed to be more palatable than one showing teamwork (other than movies depicting sports or war). In the TV series, I cared about the characters ? in this movie I was hoping Ethan Hunt would slip on a banana peel or something.*** SPOILERS FOLLOW! *** *** YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! *** The second sin was where the writers had Jim Phelps as a double agent. While it's true that a writer can do just about anything he/she pleases for the purposes of writing a good story, you are not supposed to make major changes to an established character for the sake of the story. For example, what if there was a remake of "Forrest Gump" where Gump becomes smart enough to receive the Nobel Prize for Physics? That would be a major turn-off for me. How about Harry Potter teaming up with Valdemort to become drug overlords? How about Wallace and Gromit being ax murderers and using the victims as a spread for Wallace's "cracking toast"? You get the idea. In the Mission Impossible TV series, there were plenty of opportunities for Jim Phelps to be indicated as suspicious. But guess what? He was someone that was so committed to his team members that when one of them got captured in one episode he came up with a hastily made plan, using the remaining members (including himself), to get that member back. In other words: he was never a turncoat! Making him one in this movie was lazy and sloppy writing, was just as ridiculous a premise as the above examples, and was inexcusable in my estimation.*** END OF SPOILERS *** For those who liked the movie, I really do understand why you did. But due to the writing I could not enjoy the movie at all. Because of this I rate "Mission Impossible" (the movie) a 5.------------------------------------------------------ For those of you who haven't seen the TV series, take a look at a couple of episodes. I'm sure the 60's technology will be a turn-off to some, and many of the plots DO strain the limits of believability. But many of the plots also embodied a spark of originality and creativity that I embraced and always had me wondering how in God's name they were going to pull off THIS one. Getting the gold bullion out of the vault was one such episode (mentioned above). Another episode that is seared in my mind was how they managed to get a criminal to reveal the location of a stolen stash of millions of dollars before the statue of limitations expired. Yet another episode (the one mentioned previously about the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) team member who was captured) was frightening in the way it portrayed the captured member being interrogated with special emphasis on trying to discover what this members' worst fears were and how to exploit them. When the captors found out this fear happened to be of enclosed spaces they used it to maximum effect. You were shown how the sanity of the member started to unravel and how that member started to crack, almost giving away the existence of the IMF. In other words, the TV series was about SO much more than just one character "whuppin' ass".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>comment on the robbery of NOC list sequence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi saw the movie a few times in bits and pieces.. will try and get hold of the transcript...on of these days.. last week again had the opportunity to catch the movie on HBO.. while watching it a doubt occurred to me.. though I am wondering why it didn't strike me earlier..Now, I am talking about the robbery of the NOC List. This sequence where TOM Cruise is suspended in the air by means of a rope. The area is a high security area to which access is available to the authorized official only after thorough checks of voice, eye retina etc. of course the access cards. The point is that its a high security zone.Now me doubt is if its such a high security zone owing to the presence extremely sensitive data, why aren't there any cameras in the room..Or is that the cameras have been de activated which I probably missed.indeed if there are no cameras, why is that so..I mean even in a Small grocery store, we find cameras which are being continuously monitored to avoid cases of shoplifting..can any one throw some light.thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It might be a failure, but they failed trying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the best way to understand what is right and wrong with this movie is to listen to the music. Based on the original TV series (and the bad 80s remake) Mission Impossible has the advantage of having one of the classics of lounge music associated with it. The problem is that the rest of the music is pretty bad, seeming to be there to fill in the gaps between when "Mission Impossible Theme" is to be played.So the plot is simple (there are some twists, but simple twists that will make you yawn). Ethan Hunt's team is wiped out on a mission to recover a list of spys and he is accused of being the turncoat. So what can he do, nothing except track down the real killer.This potentially intense drama is less than intense. Spy thrillers don't really work in the post cold war era, because the stories become about the break down of traditional loyalties.Yes this movie manages to transcend its plot, defining the idea of super secure computers (though the designers of the secure computer system should do a search on the internet for the "evil overlord list", especially the bit about making air vents too small for people to crawl through) and particularly how to break into secure environments. Of course, you only need to watch the trailer to see that bit.Not such a bad effort, takes the mission impossible idea to new places (whether you like it or not) and at the end of the day they failed trying. The roof top train chase, breaking into the supercomputer, the face masks, the betrayal, among other things, all are fascinating ideas, just poorly executed.Mission Impossible 2 is much better, though less idea driven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glamourously paranoic espionage thrillerwhich manages to be both cleverly complex and highly original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A highly likeable movie, Mission: Impossible is a cleverly conceived thriller which demands close attention and is worthy of repeated viewings. The film's exotic cinematography is a real treat for the eyes and the plot never wears thin. With so many twists and turns, you will be constantly on the edge of your seat. Tom Cruise takes on the lead role and Mission: Impossible is the film that catapulted him to superstardom. He makes the film more appealing and is totally appropriate for the role. The rest of the cast work well together (its good to see Kristin Scott Thomas in an action movie) but it really is Cruise's film and he steals the spotlight for most of the film.The fight scenes are well coreographed and you can see that a lot of work went into them. Of course, the film's most memorable scene is the "suspended in mid-air, trying to hack into the computer" one. This scene is amazing in itself, but my favourite scene is the "mission went wrong" at the beginning of the film. Perhaps the majority of the cast get killed off a bit too soon but I think it added to the overall effect. Clever, thought provoking and very entertaining, Mission Impossible is a very memorable film. 7.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Mission: Impossible back in 1996, I couldn't stop singing the film's praises. Here, finally was a film with some great set pieces and an incredibly complex plot to carry them. Sure the film was lacking in character. I didn't care, I was too busy trying to piece together the labrynthine series of double crosses and backstabs. Apparently, a great many people thought the movie made no sense. I find that to be a rather disturbing trend resonating from audiences who no longer wish to have their minds entertained as well as just their eyes. This movie's plot is so well constructed that it likely takes more than one viewing to piece together completely. The general impatience shown towards this film's narrative is a bad sign for the future of intelligent thrillers. It's too bad too. Here was a summer film that actually trusted its audience's intelligence, only to learn that its trust was misplaced. 9/10</fullReview>

Six years later I still have no clue. All I remember is the scene with Cruise suspended in a white room - and that's probably because it's been replayed and parodied countless times.

		<fullReview>There is no bigger enthusiast for the uniqueness of the original TV series than me.I have many dozens on tape,and while some are not so hot,many,even with faults,are so unusual and creative as to be TV classics - thinking man's TV.Nothing else EVER came close. My opinion of this film,although it is completely different to the TV series,is that it is an extremely brilliant classic for several reasons. True it doesn't 'feel' like the TV show,and it's technology gimmicks aren't as good,nor does it use some of the popular formulas of some of the best of the episodes,eg time shift or false locale ploys. But it has attained something that I can't recall any other espionage movie has,and never thought I'd see -it's a poetic spy story.It has heart,humanity,realistic double crossing with no limits,a plot of some complexity as opposed to the usual mindless stuff,and a real feel for the death of characters.Cruise's character was exceptional and brilliantly played - the reaction to the team deaths,his edgy nature,those were marvelous.The only thing lacking was some of the styles of the plot of the series and some more gadgets.The best scene to me was the chat between Cruise and 'Phelps' in London - the counterplay between what one character thinks is happening and the possibilities and actualities was first rate,and very subtle,a perfect scene,along with the music.So,although this is not a big screen version of the TV series feel,I'd say it can proudly call itself MI.The director and Cruise have created something extraordinary - an artistic,emotive espionage story.Classic.If only the sequel could be more of the same...and a TV spinoff...dream on!</fullReview>

Nooo, not Tom, I'm talking about Karel Dobrý, Max's computer-sidekick "Matthias" who might have easily outshone the rest of the crew (except for Vanessa of course) had he been given half a chance. The story is, to my humble opinion, quite terrible, the location lovely (Prag always is), the shooting very questionable and I'd rather not talk about most of the actors. It's more than just a pity that people fail to notice the intensity that dear Karel Dobrý radiates, that man deserves a major role on the screen. With all due respect for his home theatre Na Zabradli, they should give him a few months off to show the rest of the world what Czech theatre training is really like! Sigh...

I do agree the plot is confusing and convoluted at times though, but Mission:Impossible is very well made, with stylish cinematography, well chosen locations and inventive lighting. Plus the stunts and special effects are absolutely fantastic. Another strong asset is the music, the main theme is hypnotic and memorable especially, plus Brian DePalma's direction is brilliant. The film does move along very briskly, the script is efficient and the acting is also very well done. Tom Cruise is an actor I don't really care for but he is good here, but Jon Voight, Emanuelle Beart, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno are even better than he is. There are some very memorable scenes especially the burglary of a guarded vault and the Channel Tunnel helicopter pursuit. Overall, very well made and entertaining, if you forget the plot and just let the effects, stunts and visuals blow you away you will not be disappointed. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

To make matters worse, he followed it up with the even more ridiculous "Snake Eyes". I haven't seen any of his movies since then, but I read that they all sucked.All in all, this movie barely reflects the TV series.

Cheesy Tom Cruise hams his way through this movie, like he does in most of his other movies. There are a few good scenes were the special effects are extraordinary, but they cannnot make this movie worthwhile. Jean Reno irritates me, possibly because he has made so many other bad movies(Rollerball, The Professional, Ronin). Ving Rhames is kinda cool in a very small role as another agent.

Possibly the only really effective scene is simply lifted from Jules Dassin's `Topkapi', but the actor holding the rope in this version is nowhere near as interesting as Peter Ustinov in the original. Perhaps the silliest effect in motion picture history -- the entire train-in-the-Chunnel sequence is completely incredible -- occurs where the Cruse character throws himself back on the TGV using the explosion of the helicopter; see, fellows, the human cannonball at the circus is FAKED; human bodies are destroyed, not harmlessly transported, by explosions.

		<shortDescription>Why I absolutely despise this film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer is in the first twenty minutes of the film. Being familiar with the wonderful television show that this film was based upon, I was grossly horrified that so many people were senselessly murdered in the first twenty minutes of the film! The entire team sans Tom Cruise is killed, and there are some big names in that list (Emilio Esteves, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Joh Voight as Jim Phelps). I always thought that the appeal of the original television show was the ensemble cast working together on these very complex and often convoluted plots. This film flatly contrasts with the one thing that made the show so fabulous and action-packed. When I first saw this film in the theatre, I was horrified. I couldn't believe that anyone could have let this film be made. It's just so different from the television show. While I can see the point of making a film based upon a television show drastically different from the show itself, the very fact that Jim Phelps is the villain of this film is reason enough to ridicule the film. It just doesn't fit! It's almost as if Tom cruse didn't have enough of a role as the IMF's "team leader" he also had to become the head of the IMF at the very end of the film as Jim Phelps is killed at the end and everyone that was involved on the very convoluted plot against the IMF is killed. I like Brian De Palma. Unlike most people, I think his style of paying frequent homage to his predecessors should be quite flattering, not an insult or a sign of an inexperienced, unoriginal director. This time, though, what we have is a very good action movie that falls flat when the film becomes a single character vehicle rather than an ensemble piece similar to the original show. The ensemble would have made the film all the better, even if the writers did have to rewrite the entire film in order to get a new plot. (BTW, I think it is interesting to note here that "Mission: Impossible" managed to receive a Razzie nomination for "Worst Screenplay for a Film that Made Over $100 Million." Just a small tidbit to back up my point)</fullReview>

Good acting, not that it matters; a lot of fine talent goes to waste in this contrived mishmash. If you like action for action's sake, then go for it. But the viewer might be better off with a Wonder Woman comic book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man was this movie boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seriously fell asleep after watching 40 minutes of this turgid bore. I tried to enjoy it, but the plot was so wrapped up on trying to be intriguing. Brian DePalma is really becoming a terrible director now. An would someone please tell Tom Cruise he is not an action star.PLOT: 3 DIRECTION: 3 ACTING: 5 SCRIPT: 3 FAITH TO THE SUPERIOR TV SHOW IT WAS SADLY BASED ON: 1OVERALL: 3</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe there is people that liked this movie. Not only it lacks any kind of realism, any kind of acting and any kind of plot, but also it shows us such an old load of cliché that you will be asking for your money back. It seems to be impossible for this movie being directed by Brian De Palma!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible indeed. I'm still trying to understand this movie's plot. Every other minute some guy takes off a mask, so I had a very difficult time understanding who are the good guys, and who are the bad guys. And I'm not stupid. I think the creators of this film went a little bit too far in trying to surprise the viewer. All they achieved is a lot of confusion. If you're interested in watching a surprising and UNDERSTANDABLE movie, go watch "The Game".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I could not stop laughing at the opening guy hanging onto the mountain by his little finger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be HONEST. Was I the only one laughing??? After I started laughing and others could tell that I sincerely found it hilarious, the entire theater was filled with laughter. I think however if I had not started the ball rolling with the laughs and chuckles in that theater, (finding this beginning so preposterous that I honestly did not even try to conceal my inability to believe it), the folks might have just dumb-foundedly sat through the rest of the picture as usual. Had a real good time but I do believe that the director was just a little over the top with what he was trying to convey in that opening scene (probably that and this is what the guy does just for fun). The saving grace here is the title. On the whole, the movie was of course very good however and does deserve all of those stars. I'm a big Jon Voight fan since "The Champ" which has to be one of the best movies and performances of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escape from the Aquarium, Soviet Military Intelligence Bureau</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the Book by Suvorov explains the usual path to escape the Soviet Intelligence Bureau called the Aquarium is through the crematorium. However, Inside the Aquarium: The Making of a Top Soviet Spy Suvorov, Viktor himself being a defector to survive this path may know best how to escape on a Mission Impossible. Frist, organize your own team no matter how much hate them, the duty, or your country at this point. Have adequate funds to operate your mission under your command. Next pretend to kill yourself in one of the movies prescribed methods. Have a witness in an explosion, have a good technology catalog your death that is trusted, have a known bad guy testify under torture by deception on your part, or just take all money you stole from your government and hide. Don't worry about getting caught you didn't get in this command decision making position by being a dumb ass. Actor Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt plays a wonderful role as a young patriotic go-getter (Tolach) that the Central Intelligence Agency that you never see who even like to down-size and weed out their own compatriots use to get this in-genius thief, and traitor to his nation. A very interesting twist to the theme of betraying your nations human intelligence sector. Its a very good type-cast for actor Tom Cruise and other actors as wonderfully portrayed as action drama.Important agencies which contribute to the real life experience;Russian Academy of Sciences Department of Foreign Languages 17 Palchevskogo Street Vladivostok 690032 Russian FederationINTERPOL General Secretariat ( Corruption ) 200, quai Charles de Gaulle 69006 Lyon, France http://www.interpol.int/Public/Corruption/Academy/default.asp#faculty</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Problem With Star Vehicles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mission: Impossible is not as terrible a film as everyone would have you believe. Brian De Palma is a masterful director. Watch for extended scenes without cuts, watch for gorgeous shot compositions. M:I also teams a score of brilliant actors, albeit briefly.My problems with Mission: Impossible are purely based on an actor's egomania.Mission: Impossible was a pet project of Tom Cruise for a long time. The film was doctored by Robert Towne. The character pieces involved were brilliant. But they were too few and too brief. Tom Cruise has attempted to define himself akin to Sean Connery in his role as James Bond. Unfortunately, there is no Ian Fleming here. If Tom Cruise had let go a little bit... but he didn't. And so the film is what it is. Sadly, it is not Mission: Impossible. Brilliant performances by Vanessa Redgrave and other supporting characters. Tom Cruise would be an excellent Superman. But his Ethan Hunt is no replacement for the patronly Jim Phelps we have all spent so long growing with and growing to love.You do not take the fanbase from Star Trek, pack them into a theatre, and then show James Kirk killing his crew slowly and meticulously and then destroying the Federation from within. With Luke Skywalker you could pull it off, but not with James Kirk. Not with Jim Phelps. And the computer graphics show so many tells that it distracts from the film.This could have been a great film. Unfortunately Paramount wanted a summer blockbuster and Tom Cruise was more than willing to supply.YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT THIS YOUNG, RECKLESS PUNK THE SAME WAY YOU ALWAYS HAVE FOR THE GROUP OF SUAVE PROFESSIONALS YOU HAVE GROWN TO EXPECT FROM MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. Vanessa Redgrave has delivered an Oscar-worthy performance, once again. But one comes to expect that. But this film is not what it could have been. Still good.A success, undeniably, for Brian De Palma.A failure for Tom Cruise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* A typical nuts-and-bolts storyline that Hollywood is sooooo comfortable with. Ye Ole "agent that has outlived his usefulness, so it's time to retire them permanently..." practice. Anyone who has followed THE EQUALIZER, EYE SPY or the original series from which this film is based, is certainly not unfamiliar with the plot. Add to this some nifty special effects and gadgetry, and you've got a time worn plot with a new wrapping. Of course, throw in the usual percentage of spy idioms, too. The team does a "job", then proceeds to get knocked off, except for Tom Cruise. Tom's out there and alone. Tom desperately tries to contact the "company." Tom is scared. Tom forgot his dental floss. See Tom Run. Tom can't even manage a goofy smile. They try to kill Tom. Tom's having a bad hair day.What happens for the rest of this flick, is a whirlwind of incredible improbability and a seething lack of tension. In-between muffled protests of "No way" and the physical sense of my eyelids getting heavy, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is about as suspenseful as watching a plumber unclog a drain. Ms. Redgrave's performance is little more than a cameo, which is a true waste of a gifted actress.In summation, when the best thing you can say about a motion picture is that the peppy theme song (recycled from the tv series) still sounds good, it's time to fold the tent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad movie, but his film was lacking something. I find when Brian DePalma directs he creates, sometimes, very cold and sterile movies like this one, and Snake eyes. Better then the second one in story, but colder in character then the first. I hope they do not make a mission impossible three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that spits in the face of fans of the TV series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GRRRRR!!!! Hollywood sticks a "hunky" actor in the lead, spends zillions promoting it and slaps on the title to an old TV show that NO ONE ASSOCIATED WITH IT EVER WATCHED and Americans line up like sheep to see it. This film, along with other blockbusters like "The Grinch", make me ashamed of our film industry--maybe these films are why the French hate us so much?!?!? HMMMMM. Some bozo script writer has the wonderful idea to make the bad guy JIM PHELPS. He (or she) remembers hearing the name somewhere and it has a nice ring to it. It should, you IDIOT--he was the HERO from the original series that everyone loved!!! While you're at it, why not remake some other old TV shows that feature Barney the Dinosaur as a child molester or Santa Claus as an alcoholic?! AHHHHHHHH!!!!! Then, after irritating all the old fans, let's create the DUMBEST special effects ever and base the entire movie around explosions and stunts--even though the original series used these very sparingly. My "favorite" example was the banal chase sequence. There we see the "macho" Tom Cruise riding the skids of a helicopter. Suddenly, it blows up and he blasts FORWARD onto the train he is pursuing and lands expertly on the train. If this were really attempted, it would cost the lives of 67,000,000 stunt men to get this stunt right (providing that the laws of physics NO LONGER APPLIED during the duration of the stunt). Then, because this was such a "cool" stunt, other pictures included very similar stunts for the next year or so. I was half expecting to see it in the next Elmo movie! America WAKE UP--stop attending mind-numbing mega-budget movies just because they are marketed to us at every turn.PS--since I first posted this review, Tom Cruise's stupid public statements make me wish I could rank the movie lower than a 1--man I am getting sick of seeing this guy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mission: Impossible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the popular TV series, this action spy thriller may be sound like an odd choice for director Brian De Palma (Scarface, The Untouchables), but actually, it works. Basically Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) and IMF (Impossible Missions Force) team, including Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas) and top agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) carry out a mission in Prague, and it goes badly wrong. Hunt seems to be the only survivor, and he is now on the run after the head of the agency Kittridge (Henry Czerny) suspects him as a culprit. Hunt is now using most unorthodox methods to find out who set him up and clear his name. One key scene sees Hunt trying to steal computer data from a heavily guarded, complicated and seemingly impossible security room, with the help of Luther (Ving Rhames) and Krieger (Jean Reno). In the end, Hunt finds the person who set him up, and it is someone you would least suspect, and it all comes to a head with an explosive fight on the fast moving Channel Tunnel train. Also starring Emmanuelle Béart as Claire Phelps, Vanessa Redgrave as Max, Dale Dye as Frank Barnes and Marcel Iures as Alexander Golitsyn. Cruise does well as the American version of James Bond, the supporting cast is good too, but I can agree with the critics, it is not the story to be enjoyed, it is the fantastic array of stunts and special effects. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite its title this isn`t really a film version of the series . There`s no Rollin Hand , Paris , Cinnamon Carter , or Daniel Briggs . Worse there`s no absurd but clever plotlines that the original series was famous for , this MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is just a generic spy thriller with a confusing unexplained plot. If you`ve seen the trailers then you`ve seen all the best bits . If you want to see Jean Reno in an exciting clever thriller watch RONIN or if you want to see a good film directed by Brian De Palma watch CARRIE , SCARFACE or CARLITO`S WAY</fullReview>
