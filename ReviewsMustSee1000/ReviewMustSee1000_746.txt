		<shortDescription>Compelling Film About the Intersection Between Journalistic Ethics and Politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going back and watching Salvador makes me realize how long it's been since Oliver Stone has been on his game. How long has it been since he made a film that actually required the audience to think. It's not that he's suddenly become loud and bombastic, it's that he's suddenly stopped doing anything genuinely provocative. Natural Born Killers, for example, is *not* a provocative film. It's a loud and angry and aggressive film. However, the film produced only attacks on the filmmaker (or rather excessive adulation for Stone) and never really stimulated an intelligent national debate. But Salvador, based on the true experiences of photojournalist Rick Boyle, is Stone at his best. It's complicated and full of the mixture of regret, guilt, nostalgia, and outrage that fill the director's landmarks (JFK or Platoon, for example). After all of the violence and horror, it becomes a film about representations of reality and the different reasons for distorting truth.Rick Boyle (James Woods) is at the end of his rope. He's unemployed, his wife just left him. And he's just been thrown in jail for a litany of driving violations. After getting bailed out by his tubby friend Doctor Rock (James Belushi in the role he was probably born to play), he hops in his unregistered car that he isn't licensed to drive, and he heads south to El Salvador. His only companions are Doctor Jack, his alcohol, and his drugs on a journey that can't help but be likened to the drive to Vegas in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. When he arrives in El Salvador, he finds the country torn apart with leftist rebels fleeing to the hills and a country braced for a bloody "democratic" election in which a murderous American puppet general will likely be elected. Boyle tries to use his connections to get a press pass and get one last shot to become a success. This is made easier by the Salvadorian woman who loves him and the ace photographer who lends him a hand (John Savage).But not everybody in El Salvador is supportive of the loose cannon journalist. There's the colonel who thinks he's a communist, the military attache who's using him for information, and the local military forces who resent the way Boyle depicted them in a previous campaign. The audience is supposed to be disgusted by the way that Boyle treats himself and those he loves, but there's one important fact that's repeated over and over: Boyle was the last journalist out of Cambodia. We know that he stayed to help save people. And it's just a matter of time before he becomes even more personally invested in what's happening in Central America. And that's when things go really crazy.The world of photojournalism depicted in the film is one step from public relations and sometimes not even that. Boyle's major supported among the military leaders is a general about whom Boyle had written a glowing profile. Boyle is also able to curry favor by showing his pictures to American military leaders before trying to publish them. The question that comes up, of course, is why are the pictures being taken at all and how can anybody ever know the truth of any war. Journalists, like everybody else, get caught up in their surroundings. Boyle may be supporting the right side in El Salvador, but he admits to having favored Pol Pot for a brief period years earlier. The difference between canonizing a truly noble leader (like the assassinated Archbishop Romero) and elevating a genocidal lunatic is a small one. Salvador calls into question how American audiences can ever know who to trust in a media covered war. On one hand we have Pauline Axelrod (Valerie Wildman) appearing on air because she's pretty and blond even though she just accepts the official statements as truth. Then there's also Savage's journalist who's willing to do anything to get the perfect shot, to create an image that shows both the conflict and the reasons behind it in a single frame. Idealism and self preservation are competing instincts.The film is pure Stone. The battle sequences are tense and tightly edited and the dialogue (which Stone cowrote with Rick Boyle) is rippingly good, for the most part. Then again, its misogyny is almost worn as a gold star, female characters are, as always, Madonnas or whores, and a rape scene is fairly exploitative. Also in a conversation between Boyle and a conservative US Colonel, Stone unpacks entirely too much of his personal ideology in a series of monologues. The message of the film, about not wanted to create another Vietnam and liberalism not being the same as Communism is much too literally articulated.The film basically hinges on Woods's wonderful performance. His typical manic energy perfectly fits his character's earliest incarnation, but as Boyle becomes more troubled by what he sees around him, Woods's performance becomes deeper, richer, and more internalized. The rest of the cast has less to do and thus can't really be blamed for not standing out. Belushi's Doctor Jack has "Fictitious Composite Character" written all over him. Basically we watch as his story arc goes in opposite directions from Woods's at all times.Salvador is perhaps the only film to ever express nostalgia for Jimmy Carter. I like that. I like that it's challenging, dogmatic, but rarely insults my intelligence by saying things that I already know. This is a very fine 8/10 film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional entry into an American nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this movie more than ten times, over the last decade and one half, it as taken on many shades of meaning, but it continues to show how the more things change the more they stay the same. The reporter's sense of gathering news seems to be one of self-sacrifice and a search for truth however, the director shows how the American reporter possesses a quixotic sense of right and wrong that is overwhelmed by self-interest and self-indulgence not unlike the American public. He is unable to report with the clarity of a John Reed. Other points of interest are the visuals of the local life of peasants, who just want to live. They are shown to be no different than the peasants of Chile or Vietnam. Contrasting this life is the ruling elite that manipulates the meaning of the simple needs of the peasants into an ideology that threatens the middle class and the business interests that exploit the resources of this third world country. When the environment becomes so intolerable that the peasants begin to revolt, the forces of the ruling elite call on the American military might to help quell the rebellion. Here we discover the atrocities that become the daily part of life and bring the audience emotions out of its dispassionate viewpoint into one that feels the helplessness of a beaten people.It seems to me that the director was more into making a movie than selling tickets. For this we are grateful. This movie is as fresh with insight and meaning as it was when it was released. Dr. Zim Robert</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Stone's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Salvador is Oliver's Stone's best movie. This was a low budget movie and the last one Stone made before Platoon. This is a guerilla movie in the true sense of the work. A movie made about a guerilla revolt in El Salvador and one American journalist's story during that revolution; and made on in a guerilla style with a lot of hand-helded shots and local Mexican atmosphere and actors. James Wood and Jim Belushi are excellent. Except for the politics and an acid trip scene, this film is very gritty and real. Now it does have a frat boy road trip aspect, but that only adds a comic touch that is almost endearing at times. Set against the brutality of the civil war of El Salvador, the comedy helps keep the movie from being overly harsh and pedantic, which Mr. Stone tends to want to lean towards in portraying the politics of the time and place. Thankfully Mr. Stone is more interesting in entertaining then preaching in this movie, and with the excellent acting accomplishes this goal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the beginning the viewer thinks he has stumbled upon a road-trip gone wrong movie; this initial impression is strengthened by the presence of James Belushi, in a fantastic comedic/dramatic role. However, Stone ratchets up the tension in this political thriller as events escalate and force the protagonists to make difficult choices and take sides... an incredible film and memorable performances by Belushi and James Woods, who plays the ultimate cynic. a must see film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in El Salvador</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a touch of the Hunter Thompsons, Oliver Stone created a quality film about reporter Richard Boyle and his troubles in El Salvador during a civil war that breaks out around him.Compared to other Stone films, I think this is his best, he has managed to take the true story of Boyle and craft it into a film in which you actually care about the on-screen characters, something he lost later on.The performances are classic; James Woods, he was clearly on edge and it shows, he produces one of his finest to date. Doc would really have been only a fringe character if it wasn't for the fact he was played by James Belushie in fine form, he fits into the role of the degenerate with ease, he begins as somewhat uptight, but slowly dissolves into the seedy culture of Salvador in contrast to Boyle being ostracised by everyone he deals with.As with most Stone biopics, there is an element of "you weren't there man!" anger as he unleashed another tirade against the US government and military through this film. You can take that as you like, what I found most fascinating about this film is the similarity to Fear and Loathing, right down to the battered red car they make most of the journey in. I found it fascinating that Boyle could live the kind of story that Thompson made his name creating, the two would make a cracking team, should they not die getting the story, just make it up.If you're undecided on Olly Stone, but haven't seen this film, give it a try before you decide whether he is an overrated paranoid madman or an impassioned filmmaker with a message in there somewhere if you can get past all the shouting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible movie ... but a bit preachy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Salvador is a revelation. incredible movie about the horrors of US intervention in the third world. however, stone would have been better off simply showing the situation instead of subjecting the viewer to long drawn out monologues. i think most viewers groaned when michael douglas launched into his "So Bud, do you think we're living in a democracy" speech in WALLSTREET, and there are a few such sermons here. stone should watch THREE KINGS to see how it's done. let the viewer make his own conclusions instead of pounding him over the head with pre-fab ones.for those who think the interventions in salvador, Vietnam, cambodia, laos, philippines, etc were justified, they probably have not been to any of these places. granted it was the cold war... which is the excuse that is generally used... but the cold war is over and US policy has not changed in the slightest. the US is always at war, the cold war, the war on drugs, the war on terror, it goes on and on. anyone with a conscience should see SALVADOR, the world's first (and last?) political roadtrip movie. this is belushi's and woods' finest hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Oliver Stone's two masterpieces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematic equivalent of being busted in the chops over and over again until you can only fall, this, along with his TALK RADIO, is Oliver Stone's masterpiece.It is one of the most driven dramas I have ever witnessed, a work propelled by anger, a burning sense of justice and fiery humanism. It depicts a corrupt, murdering regime with savage focus and makes no dramatic concessions to the incendiary material.Financed slightly outside the Hollywood system, it boasts a dozen extraordinary performances and a brand of camera-work (by Stone regular Robert Richardson) that expertly marries documentary-style coverage to classic composition.SALVADOR has so much to say, but it concludes having not said it all because it hasn't the time.It's quite incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You'll love it here, Doc. You can drive drunk. You can get anybody killed for fifty bucks." - Rick Boyle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Salvador' is the extremely controversial filmmaker, Oliver Stone's, first film, and is it any surprise it has to do with politics? Yes, pretty much all of Mr. Stone's films have a strong political message in them (for example: JFK, Nixon, Born on the Fourth of July, Natural Born Killers, Heaven &amp; Earth, Wall Street, etc.) His first major film (not counting his dreadfully mediocre low-budget debut horror film 'The Hand), 'Salvador' explores and follows the conflict of military dictatorship and genocide taking place in El Salvador in the year 1980. Although it's a very in-your-face picture and has to do with debatable political hardships, 'Salvador' is a great, powerful and heart wrenching picture that will stay with you a long time after you view it. Even though 'Salvador' is one of Oliver Stone's least famous flicks, it ranks up there with one of his best films.The movie chronicles the life of real-life photojournalist Rick Boyle (played by James Woods). Boyle's life is falling apart all around him and he's almost completely broke, so he decides to go to El Salvador, to kick it with his best friend, Doctor Rock (played by SNL alumni James Belushi). Boyle and Doc Rock figure El Salvador will be the perfect vacation place, but what they don't realize is that the country going through one of the most violent acts of genocide in world history will effect them. In El Salvador, Boyle meets up with his girlfriend, a native, Maria (Elphidia Carillo), an old friend whose a reporter from Newsday, John Cassady (Carnivale's John Savage), and Cathy Moore, a Catholic nun who works as a lay worker (Cynthia Gibb). While relaxing in the so-called paradise, Boyle begins to realize the atrocities around him and makes a hard decision to try to make a difference, severely risking his life and the lives of the people around him.'Salvador' isn't a masterpiece, but it's a film of such ferocious power and intensity that it's impossible not to notice. The real life Rick Boyle and Oliver Stone round out a scorching screenplay, and Stone does an awesome job behind the camera. James Woods is magnificent as Boyle, and deserved his Oscar nomination. John Belushi not only provides us with a usual comedic performance, but puts in a lot of dramatic aspects to his character showing that Belushi has more depth than most people realize as an actor. John Savage, post-Deer Hunter, is a pleasure to watch as always, and Independent Spirit Award Nominee Elphidia Carillo, turns in a fine performance as Boyle's love interest. The film also features Michael Murphy as the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador. When it all is over, 'Salvador' proves to be a great film, but not an excellent one. The film has minor flaws like dragging a little, and sometimes not getting down to the point. It's Stone's first film (second if you count that crap, 'The Hand), and he does a damn fine job with it. If you haven't already, and don't mind a powerhouse of a film, go to your local videostore and rent 'Salvador'. Trust me, you'll like it. Grade: B+MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #238</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Great But Still An Effective Political Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is considered to be Oliver Stone's best film but I disagree , PLATOON is the best film helmed by Stone but SALVADOR is probably a fair way behind it . Unlike PLATOON which was a heartfelt movie mirroring the director's own experiences in Vietnam it's slightly difficult to connect with the characters . They're cynical and hedonistic to start with but improve as people as the film continues making the movie a slightly too obvious redemption plot , not helped with some Catholic imagery James Woods plays journalist Richard Boyle . Perfect casting by Stone which got Woods his first and last Oscar nomination for Best Actor . Woods has always been superb at playing intense , manic dangerous characters and excels at playing someone who suffers from a borderline narcissistic personality disorder who continually tells the world that whilst Sydney Schanberg was picking up his Purlitzer Prize ( See THE KILLING FIELDS ) he was the last journalist out of Cambodia . It's also interesting that Boyle's main motive for going to El Salvador is that it costs a mere $50 a month to live there whilst whores and drugs are easy to come by . Of course all this changes when Boyle gets caught up in events and becomes a crusader against human rights abuses by the right wing government The one main problem can be accused off from a moral viewpoint is one of moral equivalence . Alex Cox criticised the film where Boyle sees left wing guerrillas executing captured troops and cries that one side is as bad as the other according to Cox . I can't recall Boyle saying that but my own problem with moral equivalence is at the start of the film where Boyle self righteously proclaims he broke a story about " IRA suspects getting tortured by the Brits in Belfast " Is there any connection between the Irish troubles and what goes on in central America ? To be fair to Stone he does point out the American establishment's fear of El Salvador coming under the Soviet sphere of influence . And if Stone didn't have a deserved or otherwise reputation as a Hollywood liberal would people nitpick the film so much ?One thing about Stone's direction is how restrained it is in relation to his later work . There's a directorial technique called " Intensified continuity " which in laymans terms is MTV style film making . Stone took this to new heights ( Or possibly depths depending on your view ) with JFK and NATURAL BORN KILLERS . Here however the camera work is disciplined with no OTT flourish and Stone thankfully lets the performances , plotting and dialogue carry the film which whilst an effective political drama doesn't carry the emotional wallop of PLATOON</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was overshadowed by Platoon. The connection being that both are from the genius Oliver Stone! And both being released in 1986! Salvador at least as engaging as Platoon, but looking and feeling a lot more raw.You get the feeling it's a documentary. The camera is in your face! Which is exactly what Oliver Stone wanted you to feel! And who better to represent the audience than a journalist (James Woods)? Although if you watch the document about making this movie, which is as exciting as the future film itself, you'll appreciate the film a lot more! You will love it a lot more! Watch the movie for it's gritty content and for the fact it's a no holds barred look at a war zone and the depiction of that situation through media and politics!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Casablanca of the 1980s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this is one of Oliver Stone's lesser known films I believe this is one of his best. It is arguably the "Casablanca" of the 1980s, a love story wrapped inside a political film.As Richard Boyle (James Woods) ventures to report on the US-backed military junta in the client state of El Salvador he tries to recapture his love with Maria (Elpidia Carrillo) and help her family with the peril that is going on in the country. His crusade for human rights is the most heroic I've seen in any film particularly when he says he believes in human rights not just for some but for everybody.And the horror of the junta and death squads is evident and potent from the burnt human skeleton to the pile of human corpses in the valley to the slaughter of the innocent nuns. Tony Plana's beginning speech as Major Max sends chills down ones' spine.The film was entirely believable with powerful performances on both sides on the conflict. You really feel like you are on the streets of San Salvador, the training fields of the FMLN, and the immigration department of the United States.Oh, and Stone--you have COURAGE with a capital "C" filming this during the actual El Salvadoran Civil War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slippery When Wet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of director Oliver Stone's better films, "Salvador" revolves around a sleazy journalist who travels to El Salvador in order to document the Salvadoran Civil War.All of Stone's tics and traits are here: fast-talking macho men, vulgarity and humour as a tool used to lighten political preaching, sympathy toward left-wing rebels, motormouth dialogue, pacey editing, subplots about whores and drug addicts, simple moral messages, forceful camera work and an aesthetic style which blends Costa Gavras and Scorsese (Scorsese was Stone's teacher at NYU).In terms of politics, the film aligns itself firmly with the peasants who fought against a US supported right wing military dictatorship, Stone mourning the death of rebels as US hardware and government soldiers mow down poor revolutionaries.Stone makes the point that the US has a history of financing right wing dictators (Nicaragua, Cambodia, Congo etc), but the film never really broadens its politics beyond this. Like "Viva Zapata!" or even "Braveheart", this is formulaic stuff, the audience positioned to root for the rebel underdogs because the bad guys have bigger guns and look/talk like Bond villains. Of course Stone is not wrong in his stance - the Western Empires have boosted dictators and evil regimes across most of the Mid East, Asia, Caribbean and Latin America - but it takes a genius to convey this kind of material whilst not seeming reductive.More interesting is how the film plays as a character study. James Woods stars as our hero journalist, and his performance is so frantic, so sleazy and insane, that we can't help but be engrossed. At its best, "Salvador" conjures up memories of Peckinpah's "Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia" and Hunter Thompson's "Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas", the heroes of all three films driving through the wilderness with bottles of whisky and cars full of cocaine.8/10 - It's hard to fathom how the man behind "W" and "World Trade Centre", the former being (arguably) a Bush apologists wet dream, the later being a slice of jingoism dressed up as a disaster movie, could make a film like "Salvador". Still, though every bit as well intentioned as "Wall Street", "Talk Radio" and "Born on the Fourth of July", Stone's sensibilities are far too heavy-handed, his film bashing us over the head and pulverising us into submission. Compare with: "The Quiet American", Pontecorvo's "Burn!", Cox's "Walker", "In The Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds".Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A political war movie with heart, where for some, it requires a strong stomach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Salvador, here's one more place I don't want to visit. Screen writing great Stone, who makes reads so interesting, has made that abundantly. Although it has a crammed feel of story, one can't shy their away from the intensity this movies brings. The only reason I didn't see this at the cinema, was I had seen The Killing Fields a year before, where I thought like that excellent film, this was gonna be just like it,, but there's a lot of nice little things here, that make it different from that. I actually like this movie better than Platoon. James Woods is at his acting best, as a womanizing loser, once famous journalist Richard Boyle, who cons and weasels his way through life (the dangling coin on the string inserted in into the payphone slot I loved). He's a reckless sort with outstanding fines, and a much due rent. Now his Italian girlfriend's taken off back to her home town. His best friend has just bailed him out. He's in the doghouse too. Where do they head: El Salvador. Director Stone doesn't hold back on frank images, some moments will truly disturb viewers, two I won't mention, another one involves the rape and murder of some missionary girls, which I do say touched the gulliver. Boyle rekindling an old relationship, with a young Salvadorian girl marries her and tries to get her out of the country, where her fate lies in the end of the movie, I guess. All actors deliver top floor performances, Belushi as Dr Rock, the always wonderful John Savage as a budding award winning photographer John Cassidy, Tony Plana as the discreetly and corrupt Major Max, though I really didn't think Michael Murphy was that good as the ambassador, putting too little into his performance, where too Juan Fernandez was hauntingly scary as Smiling death. Salvador had some terrifying moments, a lot as Wood's fate was concerned. It's a scary place, and one place to stay well clear of. Opening soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent casting, performances and storytelling by Stone. The major difficulty in watching his re-telling of the true story is the looseness with which he interprets the events and uses the creative license to fill in with completely fictional elements. This isn't a bad thing but, as with all Stone movies, he gives them the illusion of 'reality' by interspersing these fictional elements with the same weight as the real elements. Adding the text post-scripts further enhances this dichotomy and blurs the lines between the actual true story and the "true" story he is telling. James Woods does a phenomenal job of portraying a peripheral real life journalist into a main story character as written by Stone and Boyle. This movie is very entertaining, makes you think and should encourage those who are unfamiliar with the events of this time period and area to actually read up on the scholarly accounts of these events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oliver Stone is a Legend. He has made remarkable films throughout his career and I have been his biggest fan since ages. 'Salvador' is a yet another winner from this legendary storyteller! 'Salvador' takes place in 1980, where a sleazy war photo-journalist Richard Boyle, played by James Woods, goes to cover the bloody civil-war happening in El Salvador. His journey is full of bloodshed. He goes to cover this war, which he begins to hate. He not only loses hope in himself, but also loses his soul. Oliver Stone handles this gritty &amp; gruesome journey with effortless ease. In each &amp; every shot, the director understands the subject &amp; executes each detail superbly. Screenplay by Richard Boyle himself &amp; Stone is in sink with the structure of the film throughout.Performance-Wise: James Woods is Terrific. He is the soul of the film. Jim Belushi is damn good. Michael Murphy is effective. John Savage leaves a mark. Others lend good support. On the whole, A Must Watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>typically overwrought, but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Oliver Stone's success with 'Platoon' came a belated re-evaluation of his previous film, which when first released was more or less dismissed as liberal Left Wing propaganda. But now that Stone has helped placate our collective guilt over the war in Vietnam it seems he can do no wrong, an unfortunate twist of logic since the earlier film may in fact be better than anything he's done since, and is certainly less reverent, less pretentious, and filled with livelier, more natural characters than most of his subsequent features. It doesn't even pretend to be good journalism. From the gaudy, strobe-light opening credits Stone is in (for him) classic form, presenting a wildly overstated pop-fiction account of Third-World turmoil, as seen through the slightly wired perspective of pill-popping ex-photo correspondent and gonzo sleaze-ball Richard Boyle, played by James Woods in a no-holds-barred performance. Subtlety never has been Oliver Stone's strongest asset, but his sensational approach to the subject (particularly in the hyper-dramatic music score, and during the more violent action sequences) can at least be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking thriller, powered along by Woods' wonderfully sleazy performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As jobbing photojournalist Richard Boyle (James Woods) and his friend Dr. Rock (James Belushi) guzzle booze and drugs in a red convertible on their journey south of the border, you'd be forgiven for thinking you were watching a sort of Fear and Loathing in El Salvador. But where Hunter S. Thompson journeys into the heart of the American Dream, Oliver Stone's semi-biographical thriller explores its outward reach as franchiser to the Third World. What emerges is an exposé of the superpower's influence in creating a late-twentieth-century Heart of Darkness.No sooner do Boyle and Dr. Rock settle into the roles of the partying gringos than they find rifles pointed at them at a military roadblock. 'Whatever you do Doc', warns Boyle, 'don't get on the ground.' The first in a series of tense, sweaty set-pieces, Boyle must defuse the situation, armed only with a couple of knock-off watches and his oily charm. It is in these scenes of forced laughter with grave locals that the self-confessed 'weasel' Boyle excels; his defining characteristic appears to be his knack for self-preservation. It is a role perfectly suited to its star: no one balances sleaze with intensity quite like James Woods.Leeching and lying his way through encounters with acquaintances and enemies, Boyle is a strange, flawed protagonist. He lacks the maverick talent traditionally bestowed on the anti-hero, which is here embodied in old friend John Cassady (John Savage), a photojournalist fiercely committed to the ideal of the world-changing shot. But as Boyle bears witness to the atrocities committed and hypocrisies inherent in the country's Civil War, he becomes more impassioned with every picture he takes. Where he is initially concerned with staying off of the dreaded ground, he grows to stand up for those who are stuck there.Stone shoots the movie much like a war-photographer, capturing the atrocities as an outsider, and wisely reigns in the visual excess that would come to define much of his nineties work. 'Gotta get close to get the truth', Cassady intones as he climbs over a mound of corpses, 'You get too close, you die'. Stone's camera stays eye-level with his protagonist, casting from above the American gaze over a people who live on their knees, or else are strewn lifelessly across the landscape.Behind the brutal military regime that tries to suppress the (equally brutal) peasant guerrillas sits the U.S. government. Their presence as 'advisors' lends a sense of futility to the battle-scenes: no matter how bravely or well each side fights, Stone suggests, the outcome will ultimately be decided amongst Americans in an office far removed from the battlefield. Boyle professes his patriotism in a climactic speech that fails to convince, in spite of Woods' best efforts; channelling the outspoken Stone himself, he reserves his most damning accusations for the government of his homeland.Despite slipping into the preachy and manipulative at times- a distressing scene involving a group of nuns is particularly heavy-handed, regardless of whether it is based in fact- this is an effective, tense thriller, with some interesting contemplations of journalistic and political responsibility. As much character piece as polemic, Salvador is highly recommended, for Woods' wired performance in particular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salvador is one of Oliver Stone's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Salvador is by far one of Oliver Stone's best films. Belushi and James Woods shine throughout the movie, there is good action, but behind the action there is an even deeper story that holds your attention to the end. This movie is a lost gem, its one of the best out there. When I first saw this movie I didn't know much about the historical background of the civil war in El Salvador or the American government's involvement in this war, but the movie captivated me, and I did some research into Archbishop Romero(a Catholic Priest who the CIA helped to murder because he supported the communists and peasants). Belushi's character has a bit of a Hunter S. Thompson type of persona(I'm wondering if thats who Stone modeled the character after), and he plays the part beautifully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated by critics as Oliver Stone's best film, Salvador shows the time of Richard Boyle in war-torn El Salvador, as he attempts to capture photographs for measly pay. James Woods is reliably good in the lead role, and Belushi is surprisingly adept at the small moments of drama as well as the comedy relief. The film is also well-directed, particularly the action sequences, with Stone creating a claustrophobic, dangerous atmosphere. Unfortunately, the story seems somewhat sensationalised, with the realism diminished due to this, while the film somewhat drags during the middle section. Despite this, an intriguing portrayal of politics is shown, with the director doing well not to take sides and presenting an unbiased view. 3 / 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie leaned left without flat out 'going' communist. And in 1986 that was a gamble.Except for the 1950's, no other era would have been as much of a risk. The Viet Nam comments made it seem even more chilling. But with Oliver Stone at the helm, it's no shock at ALL.It starts with real news footage of soldiers shooting into a crowd for no reason other than to disperse a protest. Who cared if civilians died? They never should have been disloyal. Sounds a bit like some other countries now doesn't it.The death squads doing their dirty work and American immigration not allowing refugees because of technicalities just pisses you off...or makes you cry. Stone finds the weak point in American foreign policy, then jams his finger into it. This is a bit of history the republicans don't want known.And James Woods was the ONLY one that could have pulled this off. No one else would have made it work. And he did NOT become a republican so much as just wanted more caution in certain areas, like airport security. He's been a near victim.Great film. One of Stone's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searing, upsetting and brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have Stone hitting the first home runs, finding his strength as a gonzo film maker. Using the extremely bloody civil war in El Salvador as a back drop, this semi-biographical film (so I've heard) can be a stand in for so many brutal wars: Vietnam, Cambodia, East Timor, Guautemala, Chile, more....take your pick. The wars in Central and South America are particularly brutal affairs and are fairly well documented. As an American I'm quite sure Stone was outraged to see the US complicity in the spiraling murderous storms that over-took so many countries that they had vested interests in. For those of us old enough to remember, the Iran-Contra scandal (although involving sordid US affairs in Nicaragua) also spills its poison into places like El Savador. In short: it is a clearly known fact (see: Peter Dale Scott, read and weep) that the US helped prop up, set up and maintain the darkest, most vile police state regimes in almost every single Central American country and was totally duplicitous in the downfall of democratically elected President Allende of Chile. The CIA and US Army personnel have blood on their hands and this movie only just touches on the depth of their guilt. Sure, it was local gangsters and mobs doing the killing, setting up death squads; it was with tacit US support if only because they chose to look the other way. That then President Regan stepped up this process which only resulted in tearing the fabric out of so many countries, sending already poor countries into a living hell, makes me very wary of those who pine for or think that things were so much better under Regan's domain. Ask the poor of Central America and Regan and his cronies are held in total contempt.This movie is hard to watch in several ways. The scenes of mass killings are gut wrenching. Scenes of torture and random rape of nurses, nuns, missionaries is horrifying. The cold blooded murder of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero is crushing (see: Romero, a phenomenal film with the late Raul Julia)....after Romero gives a fiercely impassioned speech to his flock, raging away at the mounting brutality...he is murdered....There is so much violence to talk about that I need to speak a bit about other matters. James Woods gives the performance of his career. He is simply outstanding. Belushi really surprised me and was an excellent foil to Wood's character. The wild and very raw camera movements and cinematography just added layers of roughness to scenes of violence and chaos. This is not a pretty film and it keeps us on edge, not allowing us to think for a moment that there are any redeeming moments. Without spoiling the end of the film, the bitterness of this films message goes right to the closing seconds without let up.Stone uses a sledge hammer to talk about journalists putting themselves in deaths door and there is ambivalence here. Wood's character is a sleaze-ball but at the end he begins a late in life process of soul rehabilitation. There are other journalists here who are junkies in the best tradition....to the super rush of fear as they photograph total chaos and murder, getting close to the ultimate bit of revelation that they too are often destroyed in the process. It is not a glamorous life but one filled with various and often conflicted personal agendas. Stone is again contemptuous of political apparatchiks and their often inept tour of duty. One comes away from watching this film thinking that Stone feels very little good about the way his country's foreign policy has been executed. With all those dead bodies in so many wars, is it any wonder? Very violent and as rough in the gut as they come. As close to the way it was; it should make you feel sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolution in Latin America: Salvador (1986) vs Under Fire (1983)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Salvador is Olvier Stone's best work and James Woods' finest performance. Perhaps my only regret about this movie has to do with it not going nearly far enough in depicting the brutality of the US client regime in El Salvador. But this observation does not count, as it doesn't have anything to do with the film as presented. A critique of Salvador would do much better to note that there are very few films about the political situation in Central America, period. Persons who are interested in the subject matter might do well to compare this Stone effort with the much earlier Under Fire (1983), a film which boasts superlative performances by Nick Nolte and Gene Hackman. Under Fire is perhaps one of the most under appreciated films, not just of the 1980s, but of all time. Both Under Fire and Salvador are head and shoulders above Ken Loach's limited tale of a Nicaraguan refugee's individual trauma - Carla's Song (made much later in 1996). Both earlier films were made at the time Central America was a major obsession of the Reagan Administration (which went so far as to suggest AK-47 toting Sandinistas were about to invade the Texas border). On account of this background alone, the respective cast and crews of both films deserve the sort of praise we should usually reserve for true artists rather than Hollywood's employees.Both Salvador and the much earlier Under Fire are very close in their subject matter: portraying disinterested journalists who only after becoming aware of the gravity of the situation in which they find themselves turn unsympathetic towards clients of the American Empire. The sort of journalists which have been entirely purged from the corporate-owned "mainstream" or "embedded" press in the United States (and the EU too).Both films do an outstanding job of noting the protagonists' rivals in the form of spin doctors for the regime whether from the US State Department or the corporate media. Characters like Salvador's ANS reporter Pauline Axelrod (played by Valerie Wildman) force us to recall the perverted scribblings of James Lemoyne (New York Times), the godfather of Embedded American Journalism; his students honored in that tribute to the corporate press, Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). Call that film for what it is: the anti-Salvador.Under Fire goes much deeper than Stone's film in questioning the ethics of journalism and the sort of circumstances which compel individuals to look at the bigger picture. The depiction of the conflict between Hackman and Nolte, on both personal and professional levels, makes it a very rewarding film. Salvador's portrait of a troubled has-been photojournalist who undergoes a sort of radical shock therapy in a war zone is different, but certainly no less interesting.I have to give the decisive edge to Under Fire for drawing much more attention to the nature and breadth of the foreign support upon which the corrupt Central American dictatorships relied. Salvador has a US helicopter turn up in the middle of a battle, an ambassador portrayed as indifferent, and that's about it. Under Fire, in contrast, has excellent performances by a young Ed Harris and Jean-Louis Tritignant as pro-regime killers, roles which draw attention to the nature and morality of those embattled dictatorships. Salvador counters with a much more interesting profile of some of the members of the so-called "government" and its military. In Under Fire, we just see Anastasio Somoza depicted as an insignificant car salesman type in the background who just happens to be the latest heir to the dynasty which ruled over Nicaragua for much of the 20th century. This was a wee bit dissatisfying.The major differences between the films are technical and stylistic. Some may prefer Stone's use of tight editing and camera angles and rather fanciful action sequences. I personally enjoyed Under Fire's determined efforts to bring out as much realism as possible on screen especially in the battle scenes. The author admits that many years ago he would have preferred eye candy in all of its Hollywood forms, but maturity and experience in watching film has changed all that.A 9/10 for Salvador and a 9/10 for Under Fire, and again hats off to all associated with films which one can hardly imagine being made in this Orwellian or "embedded" age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but definitely worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many filmmakers are afraid to speak out on difficult, controversial issues, for fear of driving away audiences and risking their profits. Not Oliver Stone. If he has a viewpoint on a much-debated issue, he says it as he sees it, no holds barred. The Kennedy assassination. Media violence. Watergate. Vietnam. As far as he's concerned, all these topics, and more, are fair game for his personal cinematic treatment. He may be accused of overdramatizing, of taking liberties with the facts, but no one can say he's uninteresting. "Salvador" is an important turning point in his career, the start of a line of films that established his place in motion picture history.Oliver Stone's chosen target: the role the United States plays in the affairs of third-world countries. Based upon the real-life experiences of journalist Richard Boyle, The film unapologetically criticizes our actions in El Salvador. It states that the U.S. aided and abetted a bloody revolution to support its own interests. Stone takes a very dim view of our military officials, portraying them as brutish and short-sighted at best. Although its politics caused some to dismiss it as left-wing propaganda, Stone paid no heed; just the opposite--he revels in the controversy his work generates in its wake. The film is to be commended for not compromising its views.What really drives the movie is the James Woods performance. At first glance, he seems to be little more than a sleazy, opportunistic reporter. In truth, that is just what he is...up to a point. However, his experiences prove a major wake-up call. Only then does he attempt to stand up for what he believes in. Compared to the devious U.S. officials, he's an innocent. Woods makes the transition believable, giving his character an unexpected humanity. Not only that, but he actually puts a dash of humor in an otherwise grim tale. His interplay with James Belushi is a joy to watch, and the infamous confessional scene is pretty damn funny."Salvador" is not a perfect film; Stone's usual tendency to spell everything out for the viewer manifests itself on several occasions. The midsection tends to lag, and the John Savage character is sorely underused. Finally, the director's difficulty in dealing with women is frequently evident. Nonetheless, it's worth at least one viewing. Even if you disagree with its politics, it cannot be denied that the human drama is, by turns, searing, hilarious, sobering...and unexpectedly moving.*** (out of ****)Released by Hemdale Film Corp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One 'El' of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you walked into a room halfway through Salvador there would certainly be no prizes for guessing that it is an Oliver Stone movie. Even though I'm a big fan of his, this film has the look and feel of many of the films that he made throughout the eighties and nineties.I do totally agree with those people who've criticised Salvador for trying to be both a movie about hedonistic debauchery (a la Fear and Lathing in Las Vegas) and a serious exposition of an actual series of (very serious) events. Jim Belushi's character never really looks at home in the movie (and, of course, that's one of the main jokes - Richard Boyle's selfishness more or less ruins Dr. Rock's life and turns him into a deranged 'tic tac' drinking wino) and the comic elements don't really work. This is possibly due to the fact that Belushi wasn't happy with the film or with his co-star (an admission he makes on the recently released DVD version), but it might also be the fact that he (and his brother) are/were extremely limited actors.However James Woods suits the role of the Richard Boyle, an intensely conceited asshole if ever there was one, absolutely perfectly, and he is equally convincing when bull****ing local officials in pigeon Spanish and when breaking down in frustration due to American inaction over the worsening political situation in El Salvador.I don't want to get into a debate about the truthfulness of the movie to the events it depicts, but the character of Major Max should definitely be addressed. As another person has already commented on this board - Major Max is little more than a caricature. This much is certainly true. But the guy he was based on, Jose Napoleon Duarte, WAS a thoroughly nasty piece of work. Yes, he may have been the first 'civilian' to be elected to the junta government, but to say that he was 'democratically elected' is being rather economical with the truth. The film does tend to lump the government in with the army and the death squads all too often, but this is not a complete fabrication by any means, considering the grip that the army had on government even after Duarte's subsequent re-election in 1984. Bear in mind that this film was also being shot while a number of those who masterminded the death squads were still in power. The DVD version contains the hilarious revelation that Stone and Boyle tricked the Salvadorian government into lending them their army and resources by making them think they were making a pro-junta propaganda piece.The best point I think Oliver Stone makes with Salvador is that it is dangerous and unfair to denounce anyone who takes up arms against their government with a legitimate grievance as a godless communist. The FMLN guerillas were not sponsored by the Russians and they got little assistance from Cuba. Besides, if they were intent on destroying the Salvadorian state then why have they taken an active part in the democratic process since the fall of the junta? The lazy and ugly paranoia of the Reagan administration was perfectly illustrated by Stone's inclusion of a rambling speech by ol' Ronnie where he lists a number of continents (continents, not countries!) that he saw as possibly conspiring to attack America.My only beef with the movie is Woods' ludricrously idealistic speech right at the end about what it means to be an American. The speech is proceeded by one of the most incisive criticisms of American foreign policy ever in a Hollywood movie, so to first say that America has opposed free speech across the world and then to sing the virtues of the 'land of the brave' just doesn't make sense.Anyone in possession of a conscience who would like to know more about the oppresiveness of the outside world but who doesn't know where to start, should definitely watch Salvador.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful dialogue, characterization, imagery, dumbly presented politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed the first several minutes of this movie on television, yet was captured by the realism of the dialogue between Belushi and Woods from the first 30 seconds I saw. The scenes between Belushi and Woods throughout the movie, between Woods and his Salvadoran girlfriend, Woods and John Savage (well playing a photographer), Belushi and Woods and the thugs who inhabit every street corner, are wonderfully written and acted. Woods is his usual wonderful self, Belushi has the best part he's ever had and plays it wonderfully.I have a lot of trouble swallowing this movie. First, it presents a completely hedonistic, and an utterly corrupt society, and a wholly violent society (violent in every relation within families, between strangers on streets, etc.), EXCEPT for dauntless American nuns, brave American aid workers, a valiant but troubled American ambassador, a courageous American photographer, etc. In that sense, and perhaps contrary to Stone's political instincts, one gets the sense that one should never ever visit El Salvador - if you have integrity, are industrious, sober, ascetic, abstemious, you will find it one great slum of people who need instant gratification - whether it is through their pleasure in violence, their pleasure in fornication, their pleasure in drugs, in drunkenness. There are no portrayals of people working steadily toward goals or objectives in any way. There ARE no hard working workers on assembly lines in factories, in management, in fields raising crops, in selling products, in hospitals (a doctor is yelled at for smearing blood all over his smock), in courts, in fire departments, in building construction, in police departments, in airports, in road construction, in advertising, in any area of human endeavor. No one in El Salvador is going home to a house containing one's wife and children at the end of a long honest day at work.Moreover, one takes one's life in one's hands from brigands, thugs, drunken violent people, accosting prostitutes, drug dealers, taunting begging children, on every street corner of the country at all times - not due to any political end - that's just the way THEY are, per this film. If a car exists, it's burning, if women are seen, they're nuns or prostitutes.The movie uttterly changes from its gutter realism to propaganda as soon as Savage and Woods go to the mountains to photograph the rebels. Suddenly, one hears sappy instead of ominous music, sees happy people kissing, sees vigorous hard exercise and training. It's actually rather funny in an Orwellian kind of way. The ensuing scene with Woods and the military attache and State Department analyst is as crude a political discussion as I've ever seen. The movie is at pains to state that there is no connection whatever between the governing communist Sandinistas of Nicaragua (heavily reliant on Cuban and Soviet assistance) and the rebels in neighboring El Salvador who purportedly rely exclusively on rudimentary military equipment captured from the government. The movie hits the point so hard that one wonders whether this is really true - it's certainly counter-intuitive that there would be no military assistance between a neighboring government and friendly rebels who profess identical aims. One problem with the movie is the conflation of the elected Salvadoran government and the civilian death squads, runaway private militias and outlaw government intelligence. The movie is deliberately vague on the distinction between ANYONE in official power (who are actually never shown) and the death squads. They are all shown as "one and the same".Well, this simply wasn't true in El Salvador. Obiously, President Napoleon Duarte and his party's members who controlled the government at that time did not head up death squads! In fact it was Duarte whom Colonel Roberto OPPOSED in the election. (Incidentally the colonel, is caricatured as "Major Max" is shown so evil, so stereotypically a banana republic colonel, his dialogue so badly full of childish bravado - as to be comic. No one would ever follow such a primitive buffoon).This failure to distinguish between the main body of government on the one hand and an alliance of: i) out of control elements of that government, and ii) outlaw factions of current and former military men, and iii) civilian death squads, is a serious problem in this movie. One gets the sense from the movie as if the war was the death squads against the rebels.In fact, the struggle there was three-way - a) rebels sought to overthrow a democratically elected government and to install a Sandinista like regime, b) death squads containing some present but mainly former members of the military and intelligence wreaked havoc on left-wing civilians (including the Church) and armed rebels, and c) the democratically elected government, relatively weak in arms, sought to stop the rebellion and to stop the death squads. Stone obviously has great talent in conveying a charged situtation on screen. The images are wonderful, the nervousness, the danger, the realism of the dialogue of people in danger. One just wishes he had more of an intellect - more of a desire to explore and differentiate - instead of hitting one over the head with simplistic (and therefore wrong) portrayals of political events. He can make one squirm, shriek, shake - but not think through anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and criminally unknown. I hadn't even heard of it before I was led onto it by my uncle. It IS a political film, but Stone lays off the politics a lot to concentrate on the human drama of his two individuals trapped in a war-torn country. Woods is fantastic in a performance that cemented my 'fan' status, and Belushi is hilarious as his whining compadre Dr Rock. As hilarious as these two sleazeballs are (and they ARE funny, the first portion of the movie is almost like a comedy) it should never be forgotten that the main point of the movie is to cast an eye over devastation and examine its causes. This Stone does, but not without bias (What's an Oliver Stone film without bias?) Even if you might not agree with the things he's saying every time, the factor that almost always wins you over is his unparalleled technique. Stone is a very gifted film-maker, and nowhere is this better evidenced than in "Salvador". You won't forget the message, due to the very unsubtle way he has of bludgeoning you into submission with his points, but you will enjoy the film if you appreciate talent. I urge you to give it a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frightening and explosive international thriller based on the experiences of photojournalist Richard Boyle who went to El Salvador in 1980 to cover the nightmare-like civil war so he could save his career.In the film, Boyle (James Woods in a memorable performance) and his friend, Dr. Rock (James Belushi) go to the war-ravaged country to see it for themselves. Once the pair enter the nation, they come upon key members of the rebel and national armies, the assassinated Archbishop Oscar Romero, and find old friends as well making some new ones.Michael Murphy, Cynthia Gibb, and John Savage round out the cast and each one plays a significant role in the madness. Savage rises to the occasion here as John Cassady, a Newsweek journalist/photograhper who "literally" goes to great lengths in trying to get the perfect photo. Murphy is fine as Thomas Kelly, the embattled American ambassador who is worried about the country and doesn't know CIA is doing behind his back. And Gibb appears as a Catholic worker and a friend of Boyle and she makes the most of her character.Director Oliver Stone, who directed the film and co-wrote the story with Boyle, shows everything in what happened in El Salvador, and like the Savage character, Stone does the same thing here. Veteran photographer Robert Richardson ("Platoon, "Bringing Out the Dead", "Snow Falling on Cedars") delivers some magnificent views of the city and landscape. Out of the Stone films that I've seen, "Salvador" has to be the best or a close second. Stone sticks to the truth here and doesn't tell lies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clumsy But Full of Honest Energy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You ought to see this movie if for no other reason than to watch James Woods' great performance. He plays a journalist who's days of glory and prestige have long begun to wane. His sidekick throughout the movie is Dr. Rock, a has-been DJ, drug-and-booze soaked, prone to whining and ill-health, but who provides much of the movie's comic relief. The spend most of the movie chasing stories that never get written, drinking, gobbling drugs, and dodging bullets....Yes, this movie has a decidedly left-wing political message. And yes,it is bumptiously, clumsily delivered--with the grace and insight of an 18-year-old college radical a little too full of himself. The action speaks for itself--dead bodies everywhere, the American military hovering nearby constantly. But just in case we don't get it, the characters lecture us with familiar left vs. right themes, crow with indignation, and denounce the military characters, who are one-dimensional and disgusting. U.S. involvement is simplified far too much. To his credit, though, Stone does not try to sanitize the leftist guerillas, who we see are as brutal as the regime they are fighting. (And just in case we don't get THAT--despite seeing them shoot captured soldiers in the head, calmly and methodically--Woods starts screaming, "You're just as bad as they are!" Well, duh!)Another problem is that we learn very little about El Salvador beyond the violence and pretty much constant whoring around of the American characters. Since setting is so important to this movie, a little more development in this area would have been useful...Since Woods' character had been there before, at least some of this could have been conveyed through flashback. But as things stand, we have very little idea of what sort of culture actually is at stake.Still, the drama is compelling, the characters engaging (sordid, but engaging!), the performances great. If Stone handles the politics ham-handedly, he manages to introduce moments of comedy--very human comedy--in a story that is wrought with despair. Belushi is a riot as the kvetching Dr. Rock, who unwittingly comes along for the ride from San Francisco to El Salvador (he thinks they're going to Guatamala), and finds himself being brutalized by Salvadoran military, police, infected by the water (and prostitutes)...generally having a rought time of it. Woods is a scream, too, when he tries to rehabilitate himself for his love, a young mother half his age. His scene in the confessional is very funny.Somehow, Wood's Boyle manages to find himself a part of the major Salvadoran revolutionary moments that are now familiar to us here in the U.S. Archbishop Romero, for instance, is assassinated right in front of him, just after Boyle has reveived Holy Communion from him. Also, Boyle is a close friend of the Catholic lay worker who was raped and killed with the nuns on the way back to San Salvador.Despite some of the clumsiness, this movie has a great deal of energy, and anyone who REALLY wants to see James Woods act cannot miss this. Political dramas fail when it compells characters to act woodenly, or unbelieveably (see "The Contender" for an example of this). "Salvador" remains a human drama first, and political expostulation second...See it.</fullReview>

It's easy to make simple assumptions - oh yes, America will deal with it and all will be well again. But that's just the abstract spin-doctor view any dodgy Government would want us, the public, to believe in.I saw this movie many years ago on the BBC during one of their political film seasons. I woudn't have really bothered but I'm a great fan of James Woods, and I'd also seen Under Fire the week before and that too had Central America in its sights.Expecting some kind of crusade against corruption and easy way out conclusions I stared in growing disbelief as the film unravelled the true horrors of what was actually happening in that poor strife-torn &amp; betrayed country.Woods gives the performance of a lifetime as Richard Boyle, the sleazy freelance reporter with no feelings for anyone other than himself and a bottle of juice.But even he becomes a changed man after seeing the carnage &amp; human rubbish dumps that strewned the country; even more so when he finds out how American politicians seem to move allegiance to whichever faction seems to be winning at the time while letting the people suffer an intolerable Hell.Woods is ably supported by James Belushi, a burnt out DJ with nothing better to do that tout along with Woods. And then there's the spirited offering from John Savage as the dedicated photographer looking for that "one defining photograph of truth".But this is a Woods film through &amp; through. You always get full entertainment from any of his films; he puts in so much emotion &amp; intensity that you end up biting your nails for him. It's a great disservice he didn't even get an Oscar for this, but who cares about plastic baubbles for the sake of great acting!This is a truly harrowing film and although this is a Stone movie, it does follow a lot of factual lines without being buried with Stone's politically sharpened axes.And I have to say I have seen many horrific moments on film both fact &amp; fiction, but I still have nightmares about the graphic abduction, rape &amp; murder of a group of nuns in this film, but which actually happened in real life!America, like a lot of great democratic countries, has an awful lot of dirty linen hidden away. Salvador is no Bleeding Heart act of Liberalism or political correctness; it offers a documentary style view of the harsh realities that happen to people when the Great and the Good betray them so badly!A masterpiece!*****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe not Oliver Stone's best production altogether.Films like "Born on the fourth of July" and "JFK" are more professionally perfected - and better budgeted. But the the gut reaction you get from this straight-forward war drama set in a small central american state many people couldn't find on the map, is still stronger than almost any work in the same genre. James Woods may never have been better than this, in the leading role as an arrogant self-centered reporter. He's bitter and weary of the world but still able to turn from complete cynicism to a personal involvement during the (so-called civil) war in El Salvador.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woods steals the movie, as usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge Oliver Stone fan, I rented this because James Woods is so entertaining, but the movie itself was pretty good, too. The movies I liked that Stone directed didn't have a big political message, like U-Turn, The Doors, and Natural Born Killers (ok, that last one was slightly political) There was one scene in this where Woods and Savage were taking photos of a huge amount of dead bodies in a dump, and there's a subtitle saying "Blah-blah, dumping ground for corpses killed by death squads" (or something similar) Oh really? Thanks for the explanation Mr. Stone, I would have thought they were at the zoo. I probably wasn't supposed to find this movie as funny as I did, but God James Woods was so funny. It's just his timing, or the way he says stuff, or something, but he just totally steals the movie. He can just roll his eyes and I start cracking up. If it had a different actor in the starring role who wasn't as entertaining, I doubt I would have watched it so many times. He was definitely robbed of a Best Actor Oscar for this movie--there's a scene near the start of the movie where he is barreling down the street in his crappy car and gets pulled over, that made me laugh so hard I played it back for my husband. Some of the scenes where they are driving down to Mexico are very Hunter S. Thompson-esque. The scene in the confessional where he asks the priest if it would still be okay to take a few hits of a joint once in a while is priceless. If you're a Woods fan, what are you waiting for? Get a copy fast! I can't imagine any other actor in the role, the other acting in the film is great, but he just acts circles around everyone else. Oh yeah, and the movie itself is great, very emotional. You do care about the characters, even the sleazy ones. Woods is strangely attractive in a seedy sort of way. The ending also was unpredictable, and there a several scary, very tense scenes. One more thing--watch for John Doe of the punk band X in a small cameo as a restaurant owner-va va va voom!!!</fullReview>

James Woods gives a dynamite performance in this tough, weirdly entertaining film, which was slavishly knocked-off by (among others) the makers of last year's "Welcome to Sarajevo" (which, admittedly, is also a fine film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the film which effectively broke Oliver Stone as a director, to the wider public. In this period - back before he started messing around with ridiculous over-editing and changing film stock for every shot, and having baffling scenes from Ben Hur playing while football managers argue with each other - Stone churned out quality movies. 'Salvador', 'Platoon' and 'Wall Street' literally in the space of about 18 months. 'Salvador' is my favourite of the three.The movie is sort of like 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' crashing into 'Apocalypse Now'. It frequently lurches from horror to hilarity and back again in the space of a few seconds. James Woods, in one of his many borderline psychotic early roles, is absolutely rabid as the jaded, down and out reporter who makes a road trip down to El Salvador with his best mate - James Belushi, in an unsettling but perfectly cast role which teeters between comedy, self-destructive debauchery and redemption.'Salvador' isn't huge on plot. It's a fairly chaotic mess, which really makes it a perfect newsreel of what was happening in El Salvador in 1980-81, as the US government threw military aid at a psychopathic right-wing government merely because they're 'not communists'.The film, perhaps unavoidably, gets a tiny bit preachy at times, and there is one scene where Woods comes across just a little too hand-on-his-heart, but overall this was before Stone got it into his head that everything he made was some sort of definitive statement about the American consciousness; that he was the biographer of America's psyche or something.Quite probably your political leanings will colour your reaction to this movie, and whatever the case, if you don't remember that period (which I barely do), a little homework might be in order before you watch it. What you'll see, in my view, is one of Stone's best films. A movie that is almost relentlessly gripping and constantly charged with a sense of impending horror. And through this maelstrom, James Woods' unforgettable, Oscar-nominated, performance, which at times is so frighteningly natural that it's easy to imagine them sedating him and locking him up in his trailer between takes.Not a masterpiece, but still a must-see film - which you could say about so many Oliver Stone movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Stone's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Salvador is Oliver's Stone's best movie. This was a low budget movie and the last one Stone made before Platoon. This is a guerilla movie in the true sense of the work. A movie made about a guerilla revolt in El Salvador and one American journalist's story during that revolution; and made on in a guerilla style with a lot of hand-helded shots and local Mexican atmosphere and actors. James Wood and Jim Belushi are excellent. Except for the politics and an acid trip scene, this film is very gritty and real. Now it does have a frat boy road trip aspect, but that only adds a comic touch that is almost endearing at times. Jutaposed against the brutality of the civil war of El Salvador, the comedy helps keep the movie from being overly harsh and pedantic, which Mr. Stone tends to want to lean towards in portraying the politics of the time and place. Thankfully Mr. Stone is more interesting in entertaining then preaching in this movie, and with the excellent acting accomplishes this goal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early powerful Oliver Stone film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Salvador is an early Oliver Stone film, which required overcoming many production hurdles, lying and cheating to complete filming, and committing fraud for additional money (all admitted by Stone in the commentary.)It was underrated during its brief theatrical release, although James Woods earned and deserved his Best Actor nomination as a press photographer who goes to El Salvador, accompanied by Jim Belushi, to make some money photographing the political mess and killings there, including the murder of nuns and a priest. ("Romero" is a movie about the priest).Based on "real events" and "real people" like all Stone movies, some license has been taken, also as in all Stone movies.Political viewpoints aside, the movie pulls no punches in showing the atrocities of war. If you are squeamish about seeing dead bodies, burning bodies and bloody bodies, then you will have to look away on occasion. As in real life, there is some sex and swearing.The DVD extras, including Stone's commentary, deleted scenes, and cast interviews and clips, are very interesting as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor country with high level of illiteracy, low level of public health and education, that was El Salvador 15 years ago, and it is probably the same now. Oliver Stone, who was the best director in 1986, once again directed an excellent film, which without any sophistication showed the cruelty of paramilitary groups in power in El Salvador, it was evident that poor people had nothing to win with this Government, and nothing to loose in such a battle, except the chains, that's why most of them went to fight against the government. The plot was well composed in a way that an American journalist (James Woods), his wife and baby are heavily affected by the prevailing injustice during this war. In the film one can see how the priest of San Salvador is wildly killed by a fascist from the military groups. It also indicates that guerrillas, although fighting for their people, were not hundred percent right when they killed the rival soldiers without any judicial process. So the film has the right balance and is a testimony of what happened during the civil war of 80s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Stone has it wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Salvadorian, it is an offense to watch this movie. I am a big fan of Oliver Stone, but sometimes it is evident that Stone gets carried away with emotion and his political views create too much bias; especially in this film. Stone fails to capture the essence of the conflict and most important to capture the reality of the situation. He portrays and depicts the right wing as terrorists while failing to show that the left guerrillas were even worse in their actions. The left guerrillas destroyed the country and everything that was good about it. The guerrillas enrolled child soldiers and spread hatred among Salvadorians. Stone failed to show how the right wing actually tried to help a country divided by a communist movement occurring across a Latin American level. Most important, what truly is offensive is the assassination of Monse?or Romero. This is so false, since Monse?or was shot by a sniper who nobody ever saw or knew who it was. Also, to this day nobody knows who is responsible for this assassination. This is a good film in the sense of fiction, because James Woods and Belushi give out an excellent performance. But this movie does not depict the reality of the situation at all. Please do not use it as a way of educating people about the war in El Salvador, because this is nothing like it. This is pure fiction and plus it is all shot in Mexico. To be fair I enjoy the acting but the movie should have never been called "Salvador", because it has nothing to do with the real conflict. Do not be misguided or fooled by Stone's leftist tendency. I have much respect for Mr. Stone but here he just shows how he really is an advocate for the modern socialist movement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Framed Shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's an early Stone, like 'Wall Street' he uses most of his crew from 'Platoon', though Richardson is the only one to consistently work with him.This is your only spoiler warning...Stone's problem is that he is too bound to his excesses, much like Spielberg is bound to sentimentality. If one removes the profanity, dull sex, and adolescent fascination with violence, his films are pretty simple. Perhaps, when seen through this filter, only 'JFK', 'Nixon', and this resonate the strongest.Why this? There is an interesting piece of self-reference here with Woods playing Stone. Stone was a drug-using, mildly successful writer in Hollywood and he parallels this with Woods' Boyle. Woods is one of the most daring actors around and it's no surprise the Academy gave him a nom.The bigger irony is that both men are in search of the "perfect shot" that will make them big. Both men fail. Woods winds up publishing someone else's work and Stone made 'Platoon'.Once you get past his shallow preaching, Stone has some really interesting points. I also have more respect for him than such directors as Spielberg and DePalma because Stone takes the time to put commentaries on his DVDs. With this much memory-inducing information at our disposal, he will be remembered for a while.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woods is a grungy, near penniless, third-rate photo journalist who thinks there could be some money made by heading to chaotic El Salvador and getting some pics. Belushi tags along and after barely crossing the border, have guns shoved in their face and nearly get killed. Woods has many connections everywhere it seems, and gets he and Belushi out of trouble...for a short while. The film mostly plays this way, as Woods becomes more daring in trying to get his job done, only to be nearly killed, but rescued by an acquaintance in the warring area. Despite the plot description on the video box, a lot of time is spent on things not related to it. A couple examples would be the carousing by the two leads, as they live for their beer and drone on about conquering a certain anatomical part of female virgins. Also, El Salvador is not even reached until 40 minutes into the film. But when they stick to the gritty stuff, the job gets done pretty well. The film's all over the place at times, but the performance of Woods, as with any of his films, makes up for it. He's not as dynamic as in other works ("Cop", "The Boost"), but still delivers as usual. Belushi, in a rare dramatic role, is the only other one of note, doing a fine job. Woods always outshines even great actors, making them look mediocre, but the others here are just horrid. The gay-ish blonde guy with the sweater tied around his neck, or the mustachioed man with the cigar, have crap line delivery. Fortunately they're not on screen too much. The oddest thing is that Tony Plana, who played Major Max, followed this up with such a tiny part as the demento prison guard in "Born in East L.A."(?). This is the only one Stone's movies that I remotely liked, and you can tell it served as a precursor to "Platoon", which he did after this. But if you're like me and love Woods, that is your sole reason for renting this. Based on actual experiences by Richard Boyle (Woods' character), who somehow survived and was able to share it all.</fullReview>

His buddy Doctor Rock (James Belushi) bails him out of jail and together they take a drug filled drive down to San Salvador. Major Mzx Casanova (Tony Plana) and his henchman (Juan Fernández) leads the military fanatics. Richard has connections from a previous right-wing article. He tries to reconnect with girlfriend Maria and helpful nun Cathy Moore (Cynthia Gibb). They join reporter John Cassady (John Savage). The new Ronald Reagan government is concerned about communist infiltration. The big networks aren't getting the real story. He gets involved with the guerrillas who want to tell their stories to the outside world and the government wants the pictures he takes. Filmmaker Oliver Stone lays out his political views. It's a cross between gonzo journalism and human rights abuses of central America. It's compelling by itself but it's James Woods' manic performance that puts it over the top. His energetic acting matches the chaotic political thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Platoon" and "Salvador" were both released in 1986 and both written and directed by the renegade Oliver Stone. The former won the Academy Award for Best Film, while the latter was a commercial failure. Stone found it extremely difficult to get finding for "Salvador" and it was made on a low budget. Clearly, this brave, but uncomfortable, film - an examination of the poverty and carnage of the developing civil war in 1980-81 El Salvador - was just too political and too critical of American foreign policy for Hollywood financiers US audiences.However, James Woods gives an excellent and Oscar-nominated performance as a self- centred and hard living American war photographer based on the real-life Richard Boyle who co-wrote the script. A number of the incidents portrayed - notably the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero - actually happened. The anarchic violence is reminiscent of "Missing", while the photographer-at-war theme reminds one of "Under Fire", two other political films about Latin America (it was actually shot in Mexico). The movie is fast-paced, powerful and committed with the Boyle character making something of a polemical speech - justifiably hard-hitting - in a scene set in the US Embassy in San Salvador.I first saw the film on its release in the UK in 1987. I revisited the work after I went to El Salvador in 2014, a trip which included seeing the tomb of Romero and the site of a Government-sponsored massacre. The civil war actually began in 1989, was still running at the time of the making of "Salvador", and did not end until 1992. By then, some 70,000-80,000 had been killed, including around 'disappeared'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm guessing the film is not high on the State Department's 'Must See' list. The movie makes several explosive political connections ? a newly elected President Reagan connects to unleashed military aid to Salvador that connects to fascistic military rule that connects to Salvador's wealthy class that connects to oppression of the country's huge, impoverished peasantry that finally connects to a bloody civil war. It's a deadly cycle based on fact, and on the US's ability to supply an unpopular regime with superior weaponry. Not exactly the image our corporate image-makers like to construct.Frankly, I can't imagine anyone in the role of the reporter Boyle other than the hyper James Woods. He's like a whirling top on speed. He doesn't walk, he lurches; he doesn't talk, he pleads, whines, and pontificates. But he's just the kind of off-center personality loopy enough to stick his neck out in a war zone. Plus, he knows the political score by being "the last reporter out of Cambodia", as he loves to say. I especially like his encounter with the well- coiffed blonde at the fancy outdoor reception. She's a big-time reporter there to echo the official line, while he looks like he snuck in the back door. But he'll have none of her State Department pabulum. He may be annoying, but his patriotism is based on speaking the truth to power, as the saying goes. No wonder he's unemployed. All in all, Boyle amounts to a James Woods triumph.The movie itself is chaotic, as it should be since we're in the middle of a civil war. It's also about as un-Hollywood looking as commercial movies get. You can spot the uppercrust running the war because they're always squeaky clean, especially the sleekly malevolent Major Casanova (Plana). The peasants, on the other hand, look like peasants since they probably are (filming was in Mexico). While Woods and Belushi look like they shop at the Salvation Army store. More tellingly, there's no attempt to render cosmetic either killing or death, especially that gripping last scene with John (Savage) and Boyle that's about as unsentimentally touching as movies get.But don't let any of this fool you. It's one heckuva movie with no compromises. Especially that last sequence that drives home the irony of the policy distance that supposedly separates the US from Latin America. All in all, Stone's film pulls off the difficult trick of refusing to pander to anyone or anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early intense political thriller from Oliver Stone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in the same year as Platoon, Salvador was somewhat overshadowed. Director Oliver Stone became a household name as a result of his Vietnam Oscar winner but it could be argued that his earlier, lower key film about the U.S. backed civil war in El Salvador is the better film. It's a semi-biographical tale about amoral photo-journalist Richard Boyle who travels to the war torn country with the plan to make money from reporting on the conflict but in the process he unexpectedly becomes politicised and emotionally wrapped up by the atrocities he witnesses. In many ways it's a typical Stone movie where he takes contentious political material and takes a direct uncompromising stance that asks uncomfortable questions about American political morality. It certainly is an early indicator of a film that marks out its director as a maverick of the mainstream. He is assisted very ably here by star James Woods whose charismatic turn as Boyle drives the film dramatically. Woods is always best at playing somewhat sleazy yet sympathetic characters. And here he puts in one of his best performances of that template. Stone's dynamic direction along with Woods edgy energy combines to make Salvador what it is.The subject of U.S. political intervention in Latin America was something of a hot potato back in the 80's; however, its subject remains highly relevant today when you consider the various complications caused by American foreign policy in the intervening 25 years. As a result Salvador has remained quite pertinent politically, while at the same time being an educational depiction of a little discussed civil war. It also works more conventionally as a great thriller too. Overall a pretty compelling and dynamic bit of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Salvador was made at the height of Reaganism in the 1980s, and depicts events in that country in the early 80s through the eyes of Richard Boyle, an American journalist.Boyle is a walking disaster at the start of the film. It opens in San Francisco (I think), where Boyle has been dumped by his girlfriend, given an ultimatum by his boss, and then pulled over by the police for driving an illegal car.The man is on borrowed time, and when he and friend Dr Rock hear of the tempting life on offer in Central America (cheap drugs, cheap booze, and easy women) they head for El Salvador.Taking the film by the scruff of its neck, Stone drags this movie, kicking and screaming towards its ferocious climax.We watch Boyle (a mesmerising James Woods) undergo something of a Damscus-like conversion as his hedonistic approach to life gives way to mounting fury as he sees first his new girlfriend's brother all but beaten to death, then one of his closest friends face an even greater threat as it becomes apparent the ruling force (a right-wing militia backed by US money) is rapidly destroying the country from within.I notice some of the comments on IMDb seem to take issue with Stone's style of film directing, in short accusing him of preaching. In defence of him, ask yourselves this: how many other US film directors would even consider making a film like this? Quentin Tarantino perhaps? Maybe John McTiernan? What about Ron Howard or Steven Spielberg? Let's be honest, most of them would be too afraid of harming their careers by launching such an all-out offensive on the very nation which gives them such a privileged lifestyle. I'd probably be the same if I had their talent: play safe and get rich.But that is exactly what makes an Oliver Stone film so special. Stone has probably never made a 'safe' film in his life, and I doubt he ever will.El Salvador is perhaps the greatest film of a career which may yet have some more to say. The picture crackles with the energy of a director who is afloat on sheer passion and righteous fury.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's 1980. Young men, women and children are being brutally killed in a bloody civil war in El Salvador. It's a horrific setting? but a perfect one for Richard Boyle, a sleazy war photojournalist whose career needs a jumpstart. Armed with his camera, Boyle joins the front lines in an attempt to capture atrocious-but-valuable images of the pain and horror. But with each picture he takes, he catches a tragic side of humanity that ignites his long-buried compassion. And, he unexpectedly discovers something that will change him forever: his soul," according to the synopsis.The promotional material also mentions well-deserved "Academy Award" nominations for James Woods (as Richard Boyle) and the writing team of director Oliver Stone and Mr. Boyle (this is his story). So, it should be noted that two Stone films - "Salvador" and "Platoon" (both released in 1986) - were competing for annual awards attention that year. Stone arguably deserved to be nominated for "Salvador"; but, since he wasn't, the "Best Director" Oscar for "Platoon" was assured.This film is marvelously done, with its main flaw being a tendency to lean too far into "Cheech &amp; Chong" territory. Perhaps, the "Dr. Rock" (James Belushi) and "John Cassady" (John Savage) characters could have been combined - this would have added incalculable dramatic impact to the final scene between Mr. Woods and Mr. Savage. Robert Richardson's superb cinematography is also on display; Stone, Richardson, and their crew create a tremendous visual picture.******** Salvador (2/28/86) Oliver Stone ~ James Woods, James Belushi, John Savage</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Woods is the Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Salvador is one of those forgotten gems in American cinema. It contains terse, uncompromising writing and direction from Oliver Stone and contains the greatest role of James Woods' career. He is so good in fact, that one wonders why he never quite reached super-star status.As real-life journalist Richard Boyle, Woods gets to bring to the screen what he does best: witty, intellectual cynicism. The scene where he attempts to repent for his sins at confession is hilarious and brilliant in equal measure. Just watch how well Woods uses his sarcastic facial expressions to drive home his lines.Of course, Salvador is much more than just a showcase for James Woods. It provides an excellent summary of the conflict in El Salvador and accurately demonstrates the attitudes of both sides.As Boyle's best friend, James Belushi proves that he's got serious acting chops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed but Emotional Experience of a Terrible Point in History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the headlines, you might think "Salvador" would be a controversial movie about the United States' role in Central America, but the heart of the movie is in their relationship. Oliver Stone may rightfully be dubbed the Emperor of Excess on account of his earlier work, he still finds most of his focus on the minutae, if in varying ways from movie to movie. For instance, his Salvador is a movie about real events as seen through the eyes of characters who have set themselves adrift from reality. That's what makes it so interesting.Stone's dramatized exposé is sensitive toward the left-wing peasant revolutionaries at the same time it condemns their slaughter of detainees in a key scene. He is sharply critical of the U.S.-backed right wing military and the allied death squads, converging on perhaps the most harrowing scene of the movie, their rape and murder of four American church workers.A sort of plot materializes, with the customary characters we assume to be in a movie like this, such as the American generals and embassy spokesmen and CIA personages. Woods and Belushi hustle frantically, constantly finding themselves out of their element completely amongst very much the wrong people and escape with their lives only because Woods is such a fast, ambitious hustler, the sort of role Woods was born to play, with his fluency, chain- smoking and nervous energy. He has an unreserved scorn in his portrayal of the film's co- writer and real-life main character Richard Boyle.Stone has a particular attraction to the romantic plot with Woods and a local woman he truly loves, but who lives within a convention of Catholicism and customary decency, a set of instructions that looks as if always threatened by being snowed under by the world outside of her customs. Stone may feel it important to include this strand in the story, but we don't. But the significance he attaches to it causes us to feel intensely about it in due time.A familiarizing and droll character touch is the scene where Woods goes to confession. He wants to marry the woman to get her out of the country, but she is adamant about a Catholic wedding. Therefore Woods talks with the priest and tries to make some sort of a deal humorously connecting Catholic conditions and his lack of knowledge of traditional principles.We meet some of the other people on the scene, mainly John Savage as a passionate war photographer not unlike the personality of his character in The Deer Hunter, and Michael Murphy as the U.S. ambassador, an angst-ridden liberal who proposes independence and the end of war as the CIA gets on with its normal practice behind his back. Now who's going to believe that he means what he says?The script tries to function Savage as a devoted photojournalist who will stake his life for the great war photograph, but when he come to his special defining moment, it's for a generic picture of a plane plunging out of the sky. It's a moment too hastily done because his picture, for which Woods subsequently fights hard, is meaningless lest a spectator trusts its context on someone's word.A scene where Woods nobly contests policy with the U.S. officials may be an imposition, an all too direct outpour of what the film is already showing us, but it is a riveting and righteous scene. At any rate, flaws and all, Stone's third feature is an emotional experience with vindicating humorous touches and a dawning of Stone's daring lack of inhibition with what he intended to show us in the ensuing decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Graphic Look At El Salvador's Civil War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an irony involved in any story that deals with El Salvador - the name is Spanish for "The Saviour" and if ever a nation needed a Saviour, it's this one. Although El Salvador has made impressive democratic gains in recent years, the bulk of its history has been one of revolutions and upheavals and military dictatorships. This movie - fictionalized and yet still powerful - recounts the story of a down on his luck American journalist named Richard Boyle (played very well by James Woods) who gets into El Salvador in the hopes of regaining some credibility in his profession and finds himself in the middle of a civil war between leftist guerrillas and the right-wing military dictatorship in 1980-1981. The movie is moving and it's at times very graphic in its depiction of the suffering of the people. The complicity of the United States in what's going on (especially the under the table, let's not talk about it stuff after the election of Ronald Reagan) is the underlying theme of the movie - not surprisingly, given that it's directed by Oliver Stone, who loves anything that even remotely looks like there could be a conspiracy behind it. The difference between this and some of his other "conspiracy" themed movies is that this one comes across as completely believable. My only minor quibble with this would be James Belushi's character of "Dr. Rock" - supposedly a former rock DJ and buddy of Boyle, who journeys to El Salvador with him. I found the character less than believable and of little real importance to the story, although he's in it throughout. Aside from that, though, this is truly magnificent. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stone's Gonzo Road Movie In a Warzone- Surprisingly Enlightening As Well As Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1986, Oliver Stone was nominated twice for an Oscar (in the category of best original screenplay) for Platoon, and his earlier film, Salvador.Platoon is a grand, epic, conventional war movie that sets out to perform the monumental feat of single-handedly engaging the American public with the United States' culpability in Vietnam. Salvador has the same aim, only this time having as its topic the small Central American state of El Salvador. However, in Salvador, Stone approaches the movie in a radically different way that bears the hallmarks of a cult movie.Salvador is a fictionalised account by photojournalist Robert Boyle (a suitably louche James Woods) about his own experiences in El Salvador at the beginning of the 1980's. Boyle is a down-and-out, a has-been who owes money to his friend, Dr. Rock, a drugged up bum (played almost too convincingly by the surviving Belushi). As a way of making some money, Boyle drives with Dr. Rock to El Salvador, which is in the grip of a repressive, bloody military Junta, to find a story and cash in on the snaps.What follows is an uproariously farcical tale full of bars, brothels, dirt, peasant rebellion, and horrific repression. This mix of farce and horror sits uncomfortably. Then again, at the same time, there is the interesting sense of one kind of madness juxtaposed with another. In this respect, the film continues in the spirit of Joseph Heller's famous novel, Catch 22.Unfortunately, Stone's characterisation is at times poor. He gives the 'good guys' depth and subtlety, but the 'bad guys' are unsophisticated, almost as if they are out of a comic book. This only serves to undermine the movie. On a related point, Stone's sense of history is imbalanced by his love of story, as he characteristically stretches his artistic license, though fortunately not past breaking point, as he does in his later movie, JFK.But sometimes it takes a hammer to crack a particularly hard nut. Stone, in this way, using in a sub-Hemingway approach, breaks open and sheds light on a dark episode in American foreign policy by creating a convincingly brutal world, in which his protagonist Boyle finds his humanity, and starts to act bravely, coming close to Hemingway's ideal of having grace under pressure.Stone succeeds in making a kind of gonzo road movie in a war zone, which is surprisingly enlightening as well as entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is as good as a Hollywood film gets. Considering the backing and the finances and the nature of this film, it's a wonder in many ways it was made. And it's probably Stone's best work ever.Notice that the co-writer's name is identical with that of the lead character.The scenography is unbelievable - time and again you'll ask yourself 'how did they do that?'The acting - where does one start? James Woods should open his own drama school. Michael Murphy is so good at playing what he's given. If you've seen him in The Year of Living Dangerously then you know. He's totally in character again here.And is it possible to think they could have cast someone other than Belushi for his role?This is a gritty movie. It's going to rip you apart. But coming from Hollywood, this is about as close to the truth as you will get.The closing credits do make up some facts - think 'American Graffiti' - but a few about aid certain nations give to others is not made up.It's happening right under the doors and noses of those who live so well just a few hours north.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Stone's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very gripping and is my favorite performance of James Woods.Woods was definitely robbed of the Best Actor Oscar for this film, I believe it was the year Paul Newman won for "Color of Money". (A fine performance but nowhere near as compelling as Woods'.)The opening scenes where Woods' character Boyle and James Belushi drive to El Salvador are VERY reminiscent of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.There are a few scenes where Stone's political views are brought squarely to the fore, most memorably in a confrontation between Boyle and a military type at a luxury resort in San Salvador. The dialogue between the two is a damning comdenation of Reagan's Central American policy in the 80s.I was originally moved to write this review when IMDB had a poll about what film featured the best scene of the Mexican-American border. I immediately thought of the end of this film. IMDB didn't include this in their choices, watch the end of this movie and tell me it isn't one of the most powerful and saddest border scenes in film history.This film is also an excellent companion piece to "El Norte." if you want to learn more about the effects of American foreign policy in Central America during the 1980s. Highly recommended and not as preachy/weird for the sake of being weird as some of Stone's later films.</fullReview>

For a nice moral middle class liberal to feel some of the things that Woods character ends up feeling would be too easily dismissed as bleeding heart stuff.When a slimeball is that overwhelmed by a situation, then something must definitely be wrong as the world is now discovering, albeit far too late for the number of people killed by this evil US backed regime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slapdash Polemic is Never Boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Journalist Rick Boyle's life in San Francisco is a mess. He's broke, married to an Italian woman with a child, and -- deserted by them -- talks a gullible disk jockey friend into driving with him in his clunker down to El Salvador. It's a jolly ride at first, a little like "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." Boyle is aptly played by the tic-ridden James Woods and his companion by James Belushi. They have a lot of fun driving through Mexico stoned and drunk in their convertible.In Salvador, things take a more serious turn and end tragically. Woods' character takes us on a political tour of the grungy capitol city with its cervezarias and its whores and its dope and its thugs and its jails. We meet the American-supported right-wing dictator who blames all the unrest on the commies. The guy is running death squads, and when one of them murders an outspoken populist priest, the Army immediately arrest an innocent bystander.There is one of those sexy, blond, camera-ready reporters who swallows every lie she's fed by the government and the CIA about the nasty rebels and the unblemished dictator. There is the American military adviser lashing out against the KGB infiltrators who will work their way up from Central America to the Rio Grande. And there is the American ambassador, Michael Murphy, a naive, well-intentioned man who turns first one way then another in his support for the brutal Hefe.The story was co-written by Rick Boyle. He seems to know what he's talking about -- the bribes, the mindless police harassment, and the mountain of dead bodies in the official dumping ground. But it's not really much of a documentary, not if you take "documentary" to mean something like an objective portrait of a given historical moment.Boyle's and Stone's opinions keep popping up. The dictatorship is absolutely wrong. The independent and ineffectively armed rebels are right to fight against it, but the suggestion is that, once in power, they'll become equally ruthless. In a too-long harangue, Woods tells the audience -- I mean his two companions -- that "left-wing" is not the same as "communist", but Americans keep getting them mixed up. He himself, he proclaims, is a patriot, a true American who has seen war before in Vietnam, Cambodia, and elsewhere, and believes it's wrong for the US to stick its armed support and covert assistance into complicated situations that aren't understood. We can't support just ANYBODY simply because he's not a communist.Those prejudices happen to be concordant with my own, but I rebuff sermons from any source. It would have been a better movie if Woods had kept his pie hole closed, if Stone had just SHOWN us Woods' feelings without his having to spell them out as if to a grade school class. However, maybe some viewers needed the message in bold print and, in any case, nobody ever stopped Stone from giving a lecture.Agreeable acting, for the most part. Woods, of course, could hardly fit the role of the reckless manic better. Belushi doesn't have much of a part. That's just as well because the character is a little mushy and appears only sporadically in the second half of the film. Elpidia Carrillo may or may not be a familiar name but people are likely to recognize her face from other appearances. It was generous of the director to give us a brief nude scene. I'd never realized how saucy her bottom was. Cynthia Gibb appears as a cheerful aid or nurse from some charitable organization. She's cute as all get out. No nude scene, though, and when she is raped and murdered along with some nuns, in a scene based on a real incident, it's shocking and painful. How, one asks, is it possible for any man to rape a nun? What kind of man could rape ANY woman? The film isn't without its humorous moments. Aside from Woods and Belushi tooling along in that beat-up Mustang, there is Woods in the confessional for the first time in 33 years. He wants to marry Carrillo and, in the course of doing so, commit bigamy, and Carrillo won't go along with it unless he receives absolution and takes communion first. (It only costs him one Our Father and twelve Hail Marys and an Act of Contrition. Sin seems to be the only thing the price of which has not skyrocketed over the years.) This is one of Stone's more amateurish but less indulgent movies. There's a plot, more or less, some character development, and mostly it rings true. It would be nice if were always able to keep at least one foot in reality and if he were to stop driving everyone crazy with his directorial furbelows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based around the real life experiences of journalist Richard Boyle, we are in 1980 and Boyle is not only in crisis torn El Salvador, he's also in it up to his neck.It sometimes gets forgotten just what a great director Oliver Stone can be, strip away his ability to ruffle feathers on a seemingly perennial basis, and you find some pieces of work that are stark and striking for all the right reasons. Salvador is one such film, sometimes criminally forgotten, it remains to this day a searing tale of tension amongst the troubles of a Latin American hell hole. Boyle is right in amongst the implosion of a civil war, death squads and guerrillas from each side pull him from pillar to post as he tries to protect his Salvadorian girlfriend, while his friends and connections all are in peril purely for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.Salvador triumphs mainly because Stone and his team have managed to capture all the building emotions of the main players, it's not just Boyle, it's the American government types, the press itself, and of course the crumbling Salvador people themselves, all things mold together in one big worrying pot boiler. James Woods plays Boyle and he is magnificent, managing to make an unlikeable character sympathetic, Woods (with Stone prompting for sure) clearly challenging himself to play out a career high. James Belushi also delivers his career best work, perfectly brusque and oblivious, his Dr Rock is the perfect foil for Woods' emotive Boyle. Then there is plaudits for Elpidia Carillo as Maria, charged with being the love interest amongst this carnage, she layers it perfectly for a very memorable performance.Salvador bizarrely is at times a humorous picture, but the laughs are all of the uneasy kind, because ultimately Stone's attempt at getting into the nitty-gritty of troubled El Salvador, is a harsh, and at times, a humbling experience. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most complex movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has it all.Drama,comedy,politics,history,love,sex,horror, you name it.It is a very difficult movie to watch, because all those elements are combined and are delivered fast-paced and uncompromising.As you would expect from Oliver Stone, the characters are extremely human, with their faults and qualities.Now of course, Stone is not the only director to master such realism, but with him, you get a sense of blunt artistic sincerity that kicks you right in the stomach. You may call it over the top, but usually, life is so. I mean, take the rape scene for instance.You have all the ingredients of an extreme situation here: the women are charity workers, some old, the rapists are dirty and murderous, ans so on.And details...One of the rapists lets literally DROOLS over his victim...Besides some neo-realistic Italian director, Stone may be the only film-maker that depicts such gore in such a manner.And as usual in his movies, characters are both despicable and likable.There are however some characters in the movie that are a bit one-sided (John Savage,the Salvadorian lieutenant, the immigration officer) but that may be due to the fact that there was no time to develop them or that it simply wasn't necessary to do so for the movie.The issues are also brutally human, you can almost "smell" them: venereal disease, poverty, murder, death, death, death, love, death, sex, death, despair, death, cruelty, loyalty, politics, politics,politics, goodness, social issues, and death again.It is highly questionable if Oliver Stone, not only in this movie but in most of them, makes movies for entertainment. It is intellectually entertaining, but it sometimes kills the child in you, or at least shocks him to pieces. Some directors simply say: "I'll tell you all a story,and I'll only suggest the shocking parts, especially the emotional ones, so you won't be shocked for weeks".But Stone simply shows you the splattered brain on your screen and shows and explains to you the pain behind it, in a very blunt way. Even when the despicable doesn't happen, even the suggestion is horrifying (take the border scene in the end, for instance with the attempted castration). Yeah, you heard me: CASTRATION. This kind of movie is not for the faint-hearted but it is not for some thrill-seekers either.It is a snuff movie experience about everything with issues. And somewhat militant. Confused already? In any case, I recommend this 100%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great liberal and historical movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel this movie sums up the liberal viewpoint. "You gotta think of the people first". Salvador presents El Salvador in a greater context of all of America's dealings with third world nations during post WWII. During this period, there was a school of thought that foresaw a world-wide revolution of workers that would consolidate the world under the ideology of Communism. This school of thought was originated in fact by the Communists, but right wing leadership also bought into the possibility of worker rebellions which would signal the end of capitalism. So the United States set to implement an international policy that would oppose the rise of communism the world over, to prevent perhaps another polarization of the world ala fascism vs democracy. Ironically this meant supporting the only communist opposition in many countries, insane fascists. The liberal viewpoint ridicules this position by showing the individual human cost. The conservative critique of this viewpoint would be that communism was a credible threat and communists would not have been any better and perhaps worse as a consolidated threat.</fullReview>

The acting is bad and I can't believe how anyone will nominate the screenplay as a good one. Why must the character know everyone of the famous martyrs here? (and worst of all, knowing them in a very casual way) Was that the only way for people in the U.S. to feel disgusted by all the things going on here with their support? I don't like the cartoonish characters and the use of only Mexican locations and Mexican actors (as they also did in "Innocent voices").The worst part is to discover Jim Belushi in a movie with the Salvadoran civil war as backgroundThis movie hasn't aged well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sure that this is a good film, but just how good it is, I am unsure of. 'Salvador' is not an easy film to like, and it is one that invokes anger. The question should then be whether it causes one to think or just to get angry. The politics of the film are not all that well explained, and it is only really in the final third of the film that any messages are pushed. Still, it is better of course that the film says at least something at some point rather than at no point. Messages aside, the film gives us two interesting characters, who are almost lost souls, wandering around in a land foreign to themselves. Their lives were heading nowhere in their comfort zones, so they headed out to somewhere else where things are going on. The film is meandering for the larger part and a bit messy with the violence and politics. Sure, this reflects how messy life was for the people of El Salvador, but it made it no less unsatisfying, at least for me, to view. Still, there are good things going for the film, such as some interesting performances, superb beginning credits and excellent music. I cannot say that I really thought too much of 'Salvador' as a film, although it is bit hard to specify why. There was enough in it for me to appreciate it though without having to like everything that I was seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear And Loathing In El Salvador</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that helped form opinion of the goings on in South America back in the seventies and eighties, with the illegal coups facilitated by the CIA and the despotic, military dictatorships that resulted from them. At the same time, it's also a vision of what went wrong in Vietnam and Indochina at a time when what was popularly known about those places was very superficial and basically gleaned from the nightly news. South America and Southeast Asia were strange never-never lands, where anything could happen at any given time, as in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now'. The fact is that this idea of the day lifted 'Salvador' out of the simple buddy/road movie formula. It was also directed by Vietnam War veteran and future director of Platoon, Oliver Stone.The story is of a hack journalist who is pretty strung out already, and his pill popping, alcoholic buddy Doctor Rock. They set out to cover the evolving conflict in El Salvador, but get caught up more than they had planned on (another Vietnam War metaphor). This movie is also very violent and gruesome (although more is suggested than shown).Nice supporting roles from Elpidia Carillo as Boyle's wife to be and Tony Plana as communist killing Major Max. This movie could almost be seen as a companion piece to Costa Gavras' more serious 'Missing' (1982) with Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemon.The sense of danger, of brutality and in fact, of claustrophobia is very intense. This is one of the most important, opinion shaping movies of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only the people who live in El Salvador really know and feel the country the way it is, El Salvador might be poor, with low educational level, and many other negative things, I personally didn't like the way it was presented by the movie, it wasn't bad at all, but I think it failed in historical aspects, the guerrilla's didn't were riding horses all the time, Archbishop Romero wasn't shot twice with a gun, and the capital, the cathedral were not close to similar. But we must have to appreciate Mr. Stone's effort because it was a good achievement after all. For the one who posted his opinion before I must tell him that he should go to learn some History first, and to read the newspaper before saying we're a country with no Literature, El Salvador has and had many literates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>most realistic film i've ever seen. very emotional. i don't know why there isnt more realism in films? probably because its not easy to achieve it. stone does it best of all directors. about political aspect: if something it tells is not the truth i dont care. this is movie and not documentary. its main purpose is entertainment. i'd rather see film full of lies than a boring film. i know one Stone statement: "nationalism is most destructive thing that ever existed in human history". i agree with this. so why does everyone so hate his political views? my view is that world should be one "country" and people should care about mankind and not about their countires. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1980's film that makes me glad for the 1990's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Salvador is one of those painful 1980's copy films that makes me glad for the great film decade of the 1990's. John Savage plays an excruciating clone of John Malkovich's sweaty bandana-wearing war photographer from The Killing Fields, injecting feeble echoes of his own shell-shocked character from The Deer Hunter. James Woods is even worse: unless he's playing a bungling evil corporate guy or a nerdy dad with glasses, this actor is almost always mis-cast. In Salvador we are given no reason to like him until his character undergoes a sudden 180-degree development for the mandatory love-interest angle. It appears that Oliver Stone simply decided The Killing Fields was commercially worth a copy and went ahead with it.Even though this film is full-on Hollywood, in the 1980's it seems that a big-budget film crafted poorly enough could still be sold under the stylish "independent" label. Here Stone's apparent rush to crank out another Killing Fields leads to an obviously expedient mix of English (spoken by Salvadoran campesinos when convenient), Spanglish and high-school Spanish (Woods and James Belushi), and Spanish in un-readable white subtitles (apparently for mood). The language problem is only one element among many (including poor cinematography and inconsistent music), that nudged this big-director, big-cast film into the "independent" bin.Salvador does have some documentary value, though. As a synopsis of Newsweek articles on El Salvador from the 1980's it passes. For this reason, I rate Salvador a "6" because in my system "6" is the minimum rating for a film worth spending two hours of my life watching. My recommendation is that, if you want a recap of the events of the war in El Salvador, watch Salvador (hopefully while doing laundry or shining your shoes). If you want a decently-crafted drama, stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>and to think that after September 11, James Woods changed his views completely...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of the many indictments of US-foreign policy, we get hit right where it hurts. Richard Boyle (James Woods) is a journalist with little direction in life in 1980. So, he and his friend Doctor Rock (Jim Belushi) drive down to El Salvador. But they never could have gotten prepared for what they were about to see there. As leftist rebels are battling the US-backed military junta, the death squads move across the country slaughtering civilians. To crown it all, Boyle even witnesses the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, a champion of the country's poor, at the hands of Roberto D'Aubuisson's thugs. It seems that the only person whom Richard can trust is peasant Maria (Elpidia Carrillo)."Salvador" obviously brings up the issue of journalism, especially in time of war. I read that there was some controversy about the portrayal of Boyle - some people claim that the movie lionizes him too much - but such arguments miss the movie's point. It was looking at the most vicious form of US-foreign policy, which continues in places like Colombia. Obviously, Oliver Stone likes to make politically charged movies, but this may be his best, alongside "JFK".A strange irony to the movie is James Woods himself. His role in this movie suggests that he long held left-wing political views. Then, he became a September 12th Republican: a leftist who shifted to the right after September 11, 2001. Does he even still acknowledge this movie, or what it portrays? For more information about the US-backed regimes in El Salvador and the rest of Latin America, you can read three books: "A People's History of the United States" by Howard Zinn, "What Uncle Sam Really Wants" by Noam Chomsky, and "The CIA's Greatest Hits" by Mark Zepezauer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salvador was a "typical" Stone film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Salvador" had the makings of a great film, but too many subplots dragged out the film. Stone's intentions were good to draw attention to the civil war in El Salvador; in fact, Richard Boyle's story is both amazing and interesting. But like many of Stone's films, they are to drawn out. If Stone would have focused on Boyle's character solely (maybe like Kevin Kline's role as a journalist in Cry Freedom), we would have had a true sense of what the journalist experienced. Instead, we saw subplot after subplot between John Savage's character (John Cassady) killed, the unfolding of Cynthia Gibb's character being raped and killed along with the other female missionaries, the brother of his mistress dying in the jail, the idiotic behavior of Dr. Rock (James Belushi), and the constant drinking and drug use. By the way, Belushi was horrible in the film and I see why he is on television now. I do not give this movie a rating higher than a 5. It is unfortunate, because James Woods is one of my favorite actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most Stone movies, it's made while stoned, so the exposition is rather convoluted and not all that interesting.Early on I was bored. I know there are many good reviews for this movie, but I found it silly and contrived.The Story.A journalist, down on his luck in the US, drives to El Salvador to chronicle the events of the 1980 military dictatorship, including the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero. He forms an uneasy alliance with both guerrillas in the countryside who want him to get pictures out to the US press, and the right-wing military, who want him to bring them photographs of the rebels. Meanwhile he has to find a way of protecting his Salvadorean girlfriend and getting her out of the country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only one liability keeps it from being great, but it's still a highly memorable Stone picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Platoon, Stone proved himself earlier in the year that Platoon was released with a down-n-dirty look at the killing squads and corruption in the military/government in El Salvador. His and out guide through the year 1980-1981, is one Richard Boyle (James Woods, one of his most compelling performances), a freelance photo-journalist who's covered Cambodia in the past and knows El Salvador's customs in regards to ordinary life and the killings very well. But as the film shows- which is based (I'm not sure how loosely, but it is a Stone film so who knows) on true events- Boyle gets his eyes opened after his girlfriend Maria (Elpidia Carrillo, a fair actress under the circumstances) and her brother are in danger of being killed. It sharpens up his senses; he gets off the booze and pot for at least a little while, and is thrust with another photo-journalist into the action. Meanwhile, the politicians (one of them not entirely one-faced turn by Michael Murphy) face a threat they couldn't realize- the possible fall of El Salvador to the rebels.The film suffers from one liability that is sometimes seen in Stone's films, though with a lesser degree- in the midst of such realistic filmmaking, with a documentary style that's intuitively used by Robert Richardson, some of the scenes are a little overly-sentimental, and (not excruciatingly but slightly) talky. Some of the points Stone wants to make are hammered in here and there as well. However the strengths of the work carry over- a haunting, taut score by the awesome Georges Delerue, the intense scenes of conflicts that are filmed like the most harrowing war documentaries, and the wholeness of Woods' portrayal of the brave, drunkard writer that was and is Richard Boyle. Overall, it's a worthy early effort by Stone to reveal a point of view many Americans might of not seen during the time this occurred, if not 100% factually than emotionally so. Even Jim Belushi isn't put to ill use here. A-</fullReview>

When they get behind government lines (unperforated!), an officer waves a pistol at them. Boyle identifies himself as an American journalist, Cassady pulls up a Leica and takes two rapid shots of the officer, and we hear the motor whine as it advances the film.Oops... that camera as it's shown all through the film is a standard thumb-advance model... no motor drive. (There were a couple of bottom mounted "rapid advance" accessories available for the camera, but they're very noticeable, and it's clear that neither is used here.) Personally I'd have used a different lens as well, but that's not really a "goof" per se....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oliver Stone was in on this one? I can't believe that this is an Oliver Stone movie. I wonder whether it was his idea to cast Belushi, who is completely out of his league here. This was and is an unbelievable miscast in my opinion. I was under the impression when I purchased this DVD that it was a serious movie involving serious historical events. Instead I get this comedy team ala Laurel and Hardy fumbling their way through. I can't believe how bad this movie is. My score of 3 is actually quite generous, as I was nearly unable to finish this 2 hour flick of excess. I don't have a problem with the flick if this was in fact how Boyle and his buddy existed, except that the movie is about a very real people dying en masse and a huge political upheaval within our neck of the woods, ie: North America. This was an event not to be taken lightly and unfortunately Woods, Stone et al, took it way too lightly. Like a good book, I want to learn something about the topic. As with other films regarding significant events in history I want to learn something about the events besides Belushi smoking pot and chasing whores. Teach me something, I want to know what happened. One of Stone' worst attempts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think James Woods is a good actor, I liked Oliver Stone's later movies like Platoon, JFK and Wall Street, and I'm sympathetic towards the Salvadoran workers, whom my government unfortunately assisted in doing terrible things to. But this is just not a well made movie. I suspect a lot of the ratings are due to people agreeing with the message of the movie. I agree with the message, but the artistry is off here.One thing really off is the mood. I think of Costas Gavras's Z or State of Siege or Missing - those movies had a consistent mood throughout that worked well with the material. Then compare them to this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politics aside, it a powerful but far too bloody !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Politically, I condemn entirely the underlying left-wing, commy and anti-american propaganda this film is trying to vehiculate. This is unhealthy and untrue, they are trying to incriminate the U.S. for the activities of communist rebels in Salvador and gullible spectators should not be taken in by this leftist propaganda.But nothing is either all good or all bad ! If the politics are completely wrong and perverted, the film itself, on a cinematographical level cannot be dismissed and has undeniable qualities concerning its production and script AND its beautiful theme music.It is a difficult film to to watch, as there is a lot of blood, death and violence which to the credit of the cineast is very realistic. We see some love between reporter Boyle and is Salvadoran girl friend (who is very pretty)and this is a welcome release but alas scenes of tenderness and love are short-lived. We see a lot of scenes of vicious, violent and drunk men We discover that tic-tac is not a mint drop but some kind of alcohol ! We see an unbearable scene of four nuns being raped !! There is too much blood in the filmThis is not a film to be recommended for all eyes as much of the shooting is extremely realistic. Many of the scenes are very sordid.Some of the shots taken are so heart-rending, you forget you are watching a film and think it is reality or a scene from a current war.Plot-wise, the film has not much to offer but the battle and bloody scentes are damned realistic.Also, there is far too much bad language and filthy words - it is overdone, adds absolutely nothing to the films qualities and is extremelytiring to listen to all the time.I prefer sweet romantic or sci-fi films but I make one exception for Salvador as its images are very very very powerful, much more than Platoon or other Vietnam Films. This film is not for everyone - certainly not for the politically gullible and even less recommended for those who cannot stand the sight of blood and death. Be Warned !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salvador</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Oliver Stone (Platoon, Wall Street, JFK, Natural Born Killers), I found this film, that I otherwise would not have heard of or watched, in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was certainly looking forward to trying it. Based on a true story, American veteran photojournalist Richard Boyle (Oscar nominated James Woods) is down on his luck, he does good work travelling the world to many trouble spots, and has done so for over twenty years, but his addiction to alcohol and drugs, and his colossal arrogance, have made him practically unemployable. Making hardly any money and with no immediate prospects, Boyle and his out-of-work disc jockey buddy Doctor Rock (James Belushi) travel to El Salvador, Central America, where the nation is suffering political turmoil, Boyle hopes there he can make money from freelance work photographing the devastation. It becomes clear to the situation is much more serious than Boyle and Rock were expecting, it is a war zone, they are shocked to witness, while entering the country, government troops executing a student, but they remain where they are so that they can capture and eventually sell off what they are seeing to newspapers. Of course the disaster in El Salvador is becoming an increasing concern to Boyle, he gets entangled with both leftist guerrillas and the right wing military, and eventually he decide he should get out, but he doesn't want to leave the woman he has fell in love with behind, Salvadorean girlfriend María (Predator's Elpidia Carrillo). Also starring Batman Return's Michael Murphy as Ambassador Thomas Kelly, The Deer Hunter's John Savage as John Cassady, Ugly Betty's Tony Plana as Major Maximiliano 'Max' Casanova, Colby Chester as Jack Morgan - State Department Analyst and Short Circuit 2's Cynthia Gibb as Cathy Moore. The performance of Woods is certainly a good draw for this film, but what is more interesting is the approach to portraying the Salvadoran Civil War, he has the lead character stuck in the middle of the brutality of the CIA supported guerrilla war, he does not have a moral compass, but it is believable with all the realistic violence and destruction happening around him, it is a relentless and most watchable biographical war drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Oliver Stone and Rick Boyle. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a Liberal or leftwing this film will be great. We all know Oliver Stone's view point, and he never would vote for Bush. The movie kind of leaves the cold war part out. The war of the West against Moscow. When the Sandinestans took over in neighboring Nic this place became a hot spot during the cold war. Communism was gobbling up one or two countries every 5 years. Carter was out after such a result and Regan came to power. The west suppoerted many dictators, they now never would, in this fight against communism. I believe this movie only show half the story, of how brutial and oppresives governments can be, and left the cold war aspects out. The rebels were ill equiped, badly trianed, and portrayed as old western style people. If my memory sever me right the Soviets must a gave over 300 million to the rebels, and I can not remember what the States gave to the other side. These rebels shot down choppers, and had idology, education and suported villiage to try a win the harts and mind in this war, and countroled parts of El Salvador. Rebels were brutial with kidnappings, and other attacks. Funny how when it is not shocking to bark at the west that no one cares about this place and its problems. This film is hard to like for there is no one to like in this film. No would behave like the people in this film in a dictatorship, everyone would be too scared. Yuppie style or art house film 3 out of 10</fullReview>
