		<fullReview>Few films manage to capture the era in which the original work was set and often rely on clichés of the particular genre at the expense of the core story. This film manages to avoid these pitfalls but more importantly serves as a worthwhile historical document. Anyone who is new to this period of history will not go far wrong keeping a copy of this movie as the attention to detail is excellent and adds to the experience as a whole (teachers take note). This movie manages to tread a fine line between gritty realism and Boy's Own, portraying the pursuit of an elite French warship by an older embattled British frigate. The production values are very high and the dialogue and length allow the director a better than average framework for character development. The predominantly unknown British supporting cast (some aged as young as 12) are expertly handled and provide a counter balance to the excellent performances of Crowe and Bettany. Crowe's delivery is very reminiscent of Richard Burton, exuding a measured screen presence without overpowering the dialogue.It would have been easy for the director to read through the salty notes of previous period pieces and deliver the usual tale of ocean going brutality and scurvy encrusted woe but Peter Weir's version of order through respect and camaraderie is far more believable especially when you realize that the sailor's greatest enemy was the ocean itself.I found little to dislike and much to admire. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is half swashbuckling action movie, half detailed examination of life in the 19th-century British navy, and all entertaining. Director Peter Weir has created an intriguing film that nicely balances fierce battle sequences with quiet, intimate scenes.Nearly all of the film takes place aboard the HMS Surprise, under the command of Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe). The captain's orders: to intercept and disable the French privateer Acheron, which is troubling British vessels off the coast of South America. The two ships clash early on, and the Surprise is thoroughly routed--the Acheron is larger, faster, and more modern. But Aubrey, with a determination that might not entirely be due to his sense of duty, is not one to give up, and the Surprise chases the Acheron--and/or vice versa--down the Brazilian coast, around Cape Horn, and to the Gallapagos Islands.That's the action part. The intimate part involves Aubrey's relationship with the ship's surgeon, Stephan Marutin (Paul Bettany). Stephan is a quiet intellectual and devout naturallist, whose train of thought is foraying into the territory that would make Darwin a household name later in the century. He's also the only one among the crew who's either willing or able to call Aubrey's decisions into question. He provides a grounding force for the captain, and the friendship between these two dissimilar men is the emotional heart of the story.I've yet to read any of the Patrick O'Brian series upon which "Master and Commander" is based, but the movie shows every evidence of being derived from a painstakingly and meticulously detailed work, one which has gone to great lengths to re-create the world and environment of these men. The details on screen are wonderful, depicting the sort of harsh conditions that make the contestants on those "reality" series look like the overglorified wimps they are. The crew of the Surprise (many of them not older than twenty) lives in claustrophobic and none-too-clean quarters--at times it seems as if every inch of the screen is crammed full--and sleep in hammocks that may very well end up serving as their shrouds. Battles are chaotic, with cannon fire ripping huge holes in the ship and sending shrapnel in every direction. The weather seems to exist only in extremes: still heat, raging tempests, even snow as they drift down near the Antarctic circle. Good service is rewarded with extra rations of grog and brandy, insubordination is punished by the whip. It's a place where both close friendships and deep resentments can grow, and the tension in the air at times feels like a living presence.Crowe dominates the production, once again proving himself one of the best leading men working in movies. In his hands, Jack Aubrey is a natural leader of men: clever, courageous, determined, and capable of what nowadays is called "thinking outside the box." He is frequently confronted with difficult choices, but takes his responsibilities and the consequences of his actions unflinchingly. Bettany turns in an equally good performance as Aubrey's emotional and ideological opposite; the two men play wonderfully off of each other. Most of the rest of the crew tends to blur together (the exceptions include a young officer who's right arm gets amputated early on, and later takes command of the ship), but "Lord of the Rings" fans will be amused to notice Billy Boyd among the ranks.The combination of action and introspection in "Master and Commander" at times seems like an odd mix, but the film succeeds on both levels. Definitely a voyage worth taking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And surprised I was. After hearing a friend rant endlessly about it, and having nothing to do one Friday night, I rented Master and Commander. The marketing staff should be cackling in glee, that a female in her 20's, would love this movie. It's an amazing movie. Russell Crowe is a force of nature, and all the other actors from Paul Bettany to Billy Boyd give wonderful performances. I especially enjoyed the details of life at sea, though most would call them boring. The day after my 5-day rental, I had to run to the nearest shop and buy the DVD, and have since re-watched it endlessly. I've never seen a more beautifully adapted, filmed and acted movie. Five stars out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Realistic and Exciting Sea Saga Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See this film NOW at the best, state of the art theater you can find. You'll know why five minutes in.I didn't want to leave the theater when this roller coaster rhapsody to sea soldiery circa 1805 was over. It's stirring entertainment. No love interests needed. This was what it was really like. One ship, 197 men, 4500 miles from home. Chasing a French ship twice her size. No retreat.Pirates of the Crappy Be-in was a cute romp, but Master and Commander has real ships, real crews, real cannon,convincing characters, historical accuracy and a REAL film director.Director/ Peter Weir (Witness) has returned big time and, with this one film, revived classic Australian realism, actually surpassing the production values of Peter Jackson's Ring Trilogy. This is not a fantasy film, but history - painstakingly recreated. And rousing history it is, with plenty of action AND robust character development. The adaptation by Weir and John Colley is right on target, brimming with great characters and scenes.And Russel Crowe? Other than "The Insider", this is his best role ever. Gladiator was just a warm-up. A Beautiful Mind? Well, nice acting from the neck up. Go see this if you want to see both his athleticism and his formidable acting chops! And he decent musical gifts as well (RC studied violin for the role).I've always thought Weir was one of our great directors. Now he's been given all the toys Peter Jackson enjoys. And Weir uses them to great effect - recreating a nautical reality that lacks nothing except the need to wipe your face every ten seconds. The cutting of Russel Boyd's fabulous photography is perfect. You get to know every inch of the ship, topside and down below. You also get a strong sense of the social dynamics on board - how men got along with each other for so many months. I felt swept along in a perfect mix of virile action and characters I could get to know and care for. One thing I loved was the constant caring between many of the men along the rank and file. There's a strong sense of honor and decency in the film. Yet enough grog flows to keep things loose.This is vigorous stuff and my most thrilling two hours in a theater for a while. Congratulations to everyone involved.For now, the best director Oscar goes to Peter Weir over Clint Eastwood (Mystic River)in 2004. Master and Commander is my pick for best picture, just because it is so masterfully realized. A stunning, exhilarating, and - at last - realistic action saga.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Commander succeeds not so much in the fact that it has an exceptional plot, but in the fact that it carries the viewer along on its voyage exceptionally. It follows the voyage of Captain "Lucky Jack" Aubrey sailing for the English empire while being chased by a French vessel during the Napoleonic Wars. It's not an entirely innovative or original plot, but it's the experience rather than the plot that drives this movie. The chemistry between the characters and strong performances by all is what make it an exceptional movie. Rather than casting good-looking Hollywood types as crew members, Peter Weir went after people who look like believable seamen who are also great actors in their own right. The cast even had a sort of boot camp training so that everyone knew how to make the ship function. It is this attention to detail that make the movie so believable and enjoyable. Rather than indulging itself in melodrama and Hollywood type moral-based clichés, this film pulls no punches about how it perceives the workings of a British Naval ship to function in the early 19th century. It simply bleeds authenticity at every corner. Excellent performances by Crowe and his doctor right-hand-man played by Paul Bettany only add to the thrill.The film also has a great original and non-original score which makes it flow perfectly. The interaction between the ship members is what makes it a success. Though 2+hours may seem like a long time to spend with an all-male cast inside a ship, I was never once bored. Instead, you truly feel like you are in the ship with them and at the end you feel like you would want to follow Russel Crowe's "Captain Jack" virtually anywhere he would lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very complete tale, interwoven with beautiful cinematography, powerful performances (Russel Crowe, especially), masterful score (Bach, Motzart...to name two),and a truly believable storyline with many twists. At the heart of which is the conflict inside Capt. "Lucky" Jack Aubry (Russel Crowe) who balances his duty to the British Empire and his personal relationships with friends and crew members on board the HMS Surprise. All this while playing cat and mouse with a french enemy vessel that is twice his ship's size and double her strength. The conclusion is a great blending of commonality of human cause and duty. All in all, this is one of the most well rounded stories I've ever seen on the motion picture screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish they'd make a dozen of sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Weir has directed a bunch of will-be-Oscar-nominated movies. For me, this is not a merit for a filmmaker, since Oscar-dramas are usually 95% of entertainment, which by itself isn't interesting. His style is very compromising and clean, you are not surprised by originality, but you can enjoy the professional touch he has in his work.Another Australian, Russell Crowe is also a professional, but has some weak points in his acting, mainly caused by certain machismo he desperately tries to maintain in all his characters.Rest of the cast was unfamiliar to me and I had not read any Patrick O'Brian books. But the sea itself, tall ships and the Napoleonic Wars are of course great elements to base the story on, especially for a amateur war historian and summertime sailor like me.I was surprised, how truly good Master and Commander was. A true adventure! I enjoyed the whole film and could not find anything I wouldn't like. Things were different in back then and Master and Commander presents its version of the Napoleonic Era. It looks very rich and detailed. Undoubtedly O'Brian novels form a fine background for the excellent screenplay. Soundtrack is very well done too, and musical scenes with Aubrey and Maturin playing duet with violin and cello ties their friendship. One of the best things in Master and Commander is the heartwarming friendship between these two characters.It's like Weir and Crowe were born and trained to do this movie. And obviously I have born to watch it, since I've seen it five times so far. A perfect jewel of its kind. Oh, how I wish they'd make a dozen of sequels, especially since the end was sort of open and had a sense of continuation. If I had watched this movie when I was 12 I probably would have had a career in the navy...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to start by saying that I have read one or two Patrick O'Brien novels. Mostly on planes, and they were great! This film blows away any expectation that I had for an interpretation of his novels. The amazing attention to detail and the tremendous acting were on par with, if not in great excess of Donaldson's "The Bounty", where Mel Gibson and Tony Hopkins gave mind altering performances. In this film, however, we are not lost in the great period work (which was off the charts amazing), we are also drawn into the characters. Developed with real life flaws and strengths, even our couragous leader, Jack Aubrey, drinks a bit too much, is tough on his crew and (maybe) makes a few desicions that may have not been the best possible at the time. What we have is a real life and incredibly insightful look into a very exciting and important time in the history of the world.Written as a battle between the British "Surprise" a relatively modest ship and the American "Aceron", changed for American audiences to a French ship. I am sure that after 911 most Americans would rather watch Aubrey crush the life out of a large and powerful French frigate than an American one. In any event, the battle scenes are amazing, the attention to detail, flawless, and the acting....superb. I have never liked Russell Crowe, but every movie I have ever seen him in I find myself saying, "that guy is an amazing actor". In my humble opinion, this is his greatest achievement. The supporting actors, right down to the inexperienced young actors, playing the teen midshipman that truly were part of both the American and British navies for several hundred years. Heroic...real...beautifully filmed....amazing in every respect.A MUST SEE, not matter whether you're a 18th century navy buff, or just someone who appreciates a well crafted period film chock full of action, emotion and intelligencePlease see this film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interestingly, Russell Crowe helps rather than hinders the picture. It's hard to believe that he's such a jerk when out of character, because his acting as the captain is totally believable. His character is great because he's smart, very stern, but very caring of his crew. While they fear him, they look up to and idolize him too.The presumably accurate historical details really piqued my interest, from the little 12 and 13-year-old kids on the crew (and taking part in battle--viciously!), to the intricate chain of command, to the sheer power of the battle scenes. Splintering wood shrapnel, how often have we seen that in movies? Some of my favorite scenes are when Crowe is playing his cello in his quarters. His room?I never would have guessed a ship like that would have such a nice and fancy décor hidden within it. I mean the captain's room resembled a room out of "Clue" (The Study? The Library? I cannot say?) Anyway, the visual details are great. Lots of money was spent on this movie and it was spent on things that really mattered, like recreating interiors and antiques. The guns and cannons look like artifacts to the modern viewer, but they're also well-kept and shiny.The dialog is fantastic, too?I can't remember exact quotes, but when Crowe gave some of his powerful, rallying speeches to the crew, I was ready to climb the mast myself.This movie is an incredible addition to the action/adventure/historical genre. It's also very much a man's movie. I'm not sure there's a chick in the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When at sea, one must choose the lesser of two weevils."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary quote is from a scene where the captain (Crowe) makes a joke at the expense of his good friend and physician (Bettany). It is indicative of the fine humor sprinkled into an otherwise serious movie.Many commentors said this movie is dull or boring. They must have wanted an event-driven, action-oriented movie, which this is not. There really are only two, rather brief, battle scenes. Instead, this is very much a character-driven movie. The approach the captain takes to his mission, extending it beyond his orders, to try and do his part to thwart the French power play in the waters near Brazil in 1805. His good friend, the doctor, wanting to study insects, birds, reptiles and other creatures on the shore of strange lands, including the Galapagos, but being disappointed by demands of the mission. Young boys literally growing up on the ship to become effective military leaders. The claustrophobic conditions on the ship, enduring rough seas that almost destroy their temporary home, or lack of rain that makes them wonder if they will die of thirst.Overall a fine movie. The critic Ebert has a good and complete review. The DVD is good, with a very nice picture and both DTS and Dolby sound, but no extras relating to the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From start to finish, this movie had me feeling every emotion, except hate. I found the brotherhood outstanding, the witty dialog at times near on side splitting, for e.g. When Aubrey suckered Maturin into the Weevil analysis. Maturin's response was equally as funny, but then Bettany has the ability to rise to the occasion in practically every role I have seen him in. Crowie, once again, Brings a fictional Character to life, and if you didn't know any better, you would think the story was based off a real life account. Killick, he kills me, " Killick" yells Aubrey for the Albermarle, " I'm already ere in-nit I " I have watched this flick now about 10 times, and I just don't tire of it, because each time something else catches my eye. I wish I could just climb aboard that vessel and experience the sea-dog life, as I am a sailor from way back. All the Actors in this movie, collaborate to make it a memorable epic. Weir When are you doing another? If you do, get Crowie and Bettany back, and Killick please. Loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a magnificent adventure story, pure and simple.It's unusual in that there are only two action scenes over the 2 hour, 19-minute film, one near the beginning and one near the end. They don't go on that long, either. For a modern-day film, that's very unusual. However, that doesn't translate to infer this is too talky or boring. The film will keep your interest all the way. However, for any ladies out there looking for a bit romance in this tale, it isn't there. In that respect, unless you want to ogle at Russell Crowe, this a man's film with an all-male cast.This movie is a great demo on how to make an adventure film fascinating without blood and guts and explosions every two minutes. It's an heroic tale, right down a little boy who shows us what guts are all about.This movie won the Academy Award for both cinematography and sound and both honors were well-deserved. If you really want to appreciate this movie, see it on a nice TV and play it with 5.1 surround sound. The creaking of the ship coming out of all the surround speakers is awesome, just in itself.One negative I had on the first viewing, which I corrected on the second, was the dialog. I had trouble with some of the accents and the naval terminology but that was corrected by putting on the English subtitles.If I could sum this movie up in one word it would be "classy."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to start by saying Bravo! I liked the story, the execution of the story by the actors and the director. Russel Crowe really depicted the Captain well and I thought that the supporting cast were superb. The photography really enhanced the scope of the story, and I must take my hat off to the photographic skills of the photographic director.One tends to forget that this story is not a high speed chase film with lots of blood and gore however it does have its share, although, the speed of the story is greatly paralleled by the speed at which a sea chase would have happened 200 years ago.It is great to watch a movie that really gets to the heart of the emotions of the crew of a Man-Of-War vessel, not just making the crew look like the hardest SOB's around.And to that I take my hat off to the Cast and Crew, as well as the writers and the director and producers of this production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A window in time, and the best film ever made about tall ships!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, I do not begrudge someone their opinion about a movie, but when they cast aspersions about other reviewers here, I feel compelled to respond. One disgruntled reviewer of this film stated that she cannot understand how anyone could like this movie, let alone love it. Further, she claimed that we, the other reviewers, only believe what we are told to believe. Nothing could be further from the truth.That someone would loathe what others have lauded is not surprising, really. I have to admit that I, too, have disliked films that were highly rated by a large majority of film critics. 'Fargo' comes to mind as does 'Moulin Rouge' and 'Mystic River.' However, unlike the reviewer, I watched these films several times over before reaching a final judgment in the event that I had been too hasty in my initial impressions. Neither of these films, though, were hailed as classics like 'MASTER AND COMMANDER'Many people go into a theatre with a preconceived notion of what they think they will see, only to be disappointed when what they see is not what they expected. Each person carries with them their own set of experiences and no amount of explanation or arguments will change their mind, either. Yet, once in awhile a movie transcends the boundaries that define it, and its true genius is not something that everyone is going to apprehend. This is the case with 'MASTER AND COMMANDER'.All I can say to that reviewer is simply, 'I am really sorry that you were not able to see what I saw.'Movies like 'MASTER AND COMMANDER' only come around once in a generation. It is, without question, the finest movie ever made about tall ships. However, its greatness lies not in the story line but in those elements that typically ruin what would otherwise be great historical films, namely: dialogue, special effects, and sound track. Take for example, 'Gangs of New York.' The cinematography and sets were outstanding but the dialogue of everyone but Daniel Day-Lewis was severely lacking in historical authenticity. Another example is the 'Passion of the Christ' which used a mix of Aramaic and Hebrew to add its authentic feel, but it came across as highly artificial.'MASTER AND COMMANDER' brought to life a language totally forgotten: the language of the sea, circa early 1800's. Every actor spoke the language as if they were born into it, and that element alone made the viewer feel as if they were viewing a window in time of a world rarely seen.The sound editing alone was worth the price of admission. I have never been to a film where I actually felt that I was part of the environment. 'MASTER AND COMMANDER' did that, and even if you play the DVD on a plain TV, you would still marvel at the realism of the sound.Finally, unlike every other sea movie that preceded it, the special effects were seamlessly integrated into the real footage of the ships at sea. At no time, did I get the sense that I was watching a scale model in a tank. In reality, the actual ship passed through rough seas on its journey around the Horn and these real scenes were added to the movie.All these factors I mentioned above set the movie apart but that does not mean it had a substandard plot and mediocre acting. On the contrary, Russell Crowe was at his best playing Lucky Jack Aubrey with a panache that could only be matched by the late Errol Flynn. If I were a seaman aboard the HMS Surprise, I would truly feel that I could follow him anywhere. Crowe commands both the stage and the ship wherever he goes.Paul Bettany as Jack's most trusted friend and the ship's doctor, turns in his best performance to date. Another unusual part of this movie is that while no seagoing fare would be complete without a love affair, the one in this movie is a platonic one between the captain and the doctor.The two have a special relationship that is constantly strained by Crowe's call to duty and his overarching ambition. Having served with the great Lord Nelson, Lucky Jack does his best to emulate him and carve out a piece of British naval history for himself. The film reminded me of works like 'Run Silent, Run Deep' which although dealt with more contemporary battles at sea (WWII), also featured a classic battle of wits between unseen adversaries. We never get to meet Jack's nemesis directly, but we learn by his battle tactics that he is a worthy opponent and a lot like Jack himself. 'MASTER AND COMMANDER' is a movie that I never tire of watching, and each time I see it I learn something new. It has its weaknesses like every movie does. It lacks continuity and subplots. It lacks character development of some of the more interesting supporting actors. Often I found it hard to keep track of who is who when everyone is referred to by their last names. Yet, all in all, 'MASTER AND COMMANDER' is a must-see movie and a must-own DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me being a seaman in the US Navy for four years and spent a few years in the merchants serving on board cruise and cargo ships in both oceans Atlantic and Pacific. I honestly think director Weir has put together his best Maritine sea saga yet. The crew looked like a crew on an 18th century sailing vessel. the costumes were authentic looking. There was a scene near the end where Crowe was up on the poop deck standing on the starboard side , the cameras was panning away from him, To me that was a classic pose.Everything about that picture was done well. Since the first time i saw this film i must of watched it about a dozen times more . My hat goes off to all who were involved in the making of this fine motion picture.I also understand that originally the french ship was to be an American one , but was changed for the American audience.One other post script There was a scene of a few crew members on there hands and knees scrubbing the wooden deck with a cobble stone what they were doing for the land lubbers out there is called holy stoning the deck. Its like sanding the old wood off the deck surface bringing up the new wood this is a practice that is still done today .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin novels, I have to say that this is an amazing adaptation. Crowe isn't big enough for Aubrey, Bettany is too good looking to play Maturin, and Billy Boyd is far too small for Barrett Bonden... but they all work very well in the roles.Much of the charm of the novels is that there is much that goes unsaid - actions must be inferred from future events. Translating this to the screen is not easy, but here it works out well. Because the film takes bits from all of the books (or many of them, at least), it's chock full of tasty bits of O'Brian. The preeminent pun of the series, regarding dog-watches, is oddly absent, but others are there.If you like the novels, you will like the film. It captures the feel of the books. The flavor of Nelson's navy is retained. Had I not seen the movie, I would complain about the casting. Having seen it, I have no complaints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The British Navy ruled the waves throughout the nineteenth century and this film captures some of that spirit rather well. The cast is excellent, Crowe in particular shining as the captain. The battle scenes between Anglo-French vessels are very entertaining, the cannons blasting great big holes into enemy ships! The story itself is not going to set the world on fire, but its all done very nicely. The film offers a glimpse of what life at sea was like during the Napoleonic Wars and anybody with an interest in history should catch the film. A few more battles would have been nice, but there you go! It's over 2 hours long, but doesn't drag. One to watch definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Incredible Adventure Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many of my friends labeled this movie as the "most boring thing they'd ever seen" I felt very uneasy. What's gone wrong? Could Peter Weir be capable of producing a "bad" film? After hiring and watching this film I was astounded. M&amp;C is one of the most compelling pieces of cinema I've ever seen. Absolutely absorbing in every respect it affirms Peter Wier as one of the best story-tellers working in Hollywood today.M&amp;C follows the story of an English Navy vessel as it pursues a far superior French vessel down the South American coast during the Napoleonic wars. But it is not the plot itself that makes this film superb, it's the way in which it is presented.The film's strength comes from it's blending of adventure, setting and character development. Weir doesn't focus on 'goody ship chases baddie ship' but gives great attention to how the characters react when put under such straining circumstances. Also evident is a genuine sense of atmosphere and setting. The production design, screenplay and acting lend themselves to the period in which the film is set. Consequently, the film strips away much of the more sensational aspects of an adventure flick, making the reality on screen appear entirely credible and engaging.Every acting performance is spot on. Each minor character is distinctive and stereotypes are completely absent from the film. Russel Crowe is fantastic as "Lucky Jack", superbly presenting the captain's charisma as well as the internal conflict between his ego and sense of duty. However, it is Paul Bettany who shines as Jack's confidant and intimate friend. The best performance of his career.Praise must also go the cinematography. Russel Boyd's visuals are superb. The film never resorts to extravagant special effects, instead focusing on a realistic and gritty portrayal of life on a navy vessel even during action sequences. The first time a cannonball flies over the bow I felt as though the projectile was about to crash through the screen and into my lounge room. Thank god, the annoying 'hand-held' camera technique is absent. Regardless of this, the sound and visuals are quite evocative.To appreciate any film, you must appreciate it for what it is, not against a set of preconceptions you have about what it 'should' be like. If like my friends you want mindless action steer well clear. If you are after a compelling, atmospheric and dramatic adventure film, Master and Commander shines above any other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic masterclass in realism and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful film that speaks of a time when ships were wood and men were iron. The Royal Navy truly shaped the modern world we know and understand today. It was a time when our ships, Royal Navy, Merchantmen and indeed, Privateers, ruled the waves with their bravery, discipline and determination. Master and Commander is a true classic that will stand the test of time, because the era it speaks of is timeless. The performances were all magnificent but the real stars were the ships Surprise and Acharon. The detail was amazing and I really felt the Visual Effects team really should have received an Oscar, it was just unfortunate they were up against The Lord of the Rings that year. I rate this film very highly and would recommend it to anyone wishing to see a historically accurate and highly memorable piece of cinema. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It opens with the most realistic sea engagement I've ever seen in a movie, helped immeasurably by the prudent use of CGIs. The performances are all pretty good -- and what a surprise to see such a straightforward adventure tale from Peter Weir, master and commander of the subliminally ominous.For my taste, which may, admittedly, be a little warped, the movie doesn't give us quite enough of the exhilaration of being at sea. I mean that zesty feeling of being windswept on a weather deck in the middle of an empty sea with bright sunshine all around. The one thing all these sailors would have in 1805 is sun tans but they look pale and sweaty. The visuals are a bit dark and gloomy, which is okay during storms when you're trying to get around the Horn but not when you're anchored in the Galapagos.Still, this is above average. Russel Crowe is neither Errol Flynn nor Captain Bligh. He's more like Horatio Hornblower but with more nearly human quirks than just clearing his throat. As the captain, Crowe plays a lively tune by Boccherini on the violin to the doctor's cello. Nice work too. And on happy occasions he gets drunk with his fellow officers and makes lousy jokes. There is one astonishing shot of Crowe and a companion perched on the tiptoptoloftical peak of the mainmast, atop the topgallants or something, a million miles in the air. How did he get there? Was Crowe digitalized in? If not, they're not paying him enough.We have the British fighting against what are traditionally called "overwhelming odds," a French super frigate, the Acheron, which they finally take after a bloody battle.What a more interesting and less popular flick it would have been, had the foe of the original novel been retained, the Americans during the War of 1812. No one would have gone to see it. The French in 1805 are an admirable substitute. The enemy is not "France", it's "Napoleon." The huge American audience feels less in common with France than with the Brits. Also during Napoleon's attempt to conquer the world, there was an opponent worth fighting, not to mention Jerry Lewis and bidets. But the War of 1812 -- well. Something about the Brits impressing American seamen, wasn't it? As a casus belli, the concept is a little difficult to grasp. And it proved to be a thoroughly bad idea by President Madison."Master and Commander" gives us heroes we can root for. We see everything from the point of view of the British sailors aboard the Surprise, just as we would in an Errol Flynn movie, although Crowe is a far more complex character. But suppose the Acheron HAD retained its American identity? What would our response, as Americans, have been? Would we still have been cheering for the Brits as eagerly as if it had been a soccer game? Would we have been tickled to see the Acheron blown apart? Such an added layer of complexity might have prompted us to think about the nature of war. (Gosh -- it's not REALLY a football game.) It would have challenged our loyalties. It might even have caused us to think a little about the nature of human nature. Why does battle seem so tragic only when OUR side suffers? Or -- worst of all -- what is it, buried deep in my limbic system, that makes me want to shout YEAH when Crowe outwits the Frogs? Whatever the answers, they're not likely to turn out to have the same effect as bright sunshine on a windswept deck. As I say, nobody would go to see it.There are three main conflicts, all handled deftly. The faceless enemy against the British, from "Horatio Hornblower" and "The Sea Hawk." The sullen crew versus an officer, familiar to us from, oh, "Moby Dick" and "Damn the Defiant" and "Mutiny on the Bounty"; and a more interesting conflict of interests between the intellectual doctor who wants to explore the Galapagos Islands thirty years before Darwin, and Russel Crowe's captain, who is determined to pursue and destroy the Acheron. We can see a similar disjunction between the egghead and the practical man of common sense in "The Thing From Another World" and "Ball of Fire." It's the difference between the theoretical physicist and the engineer. In the movies, the engineer often shows up in uniform and almost always wins the debate. The movie is worth catching. Lots of sea lore and tradition, almost an exercise in history. And with its innovative score and outstanding CGIs, it's a sensory feast too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have ever wondered what it would be like to be on board a British Frigate circa 1805, I doubt if you will ever come any closer to that experience than by seeing this movie. Getting all the details right was clearly a labor of love - a real ship was actually constructed for the movie. The realism effected is astounding, with minimal use of GGI.James Aubrey (Russell Crowe) captains the HMS Surprise as it plays a cat and mouse game with the larger French warship Acheron. The two ships first encounter each other in battle off the coast of Brazil and continue their chase around Cape Horn to the Galapagos Islands and beyond. The scenes filmed on the Galapagos were an unexpected treat for me - I had never seen footage filmed there.Aubrey is accompanied by Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), a medical doctor, surgeon, naturalist, philosopher, and friend. Aubrey and Maturin have contrasting temperaments and I found Crowe and Bettany to be perfectly cast - Crowe the decisive man of action, very much in command of his crew, and Maturin the reflective scholar and medic. The battle scenes are great, but what makes this more than simply an action entertainment are the discussions and interactions between Aubrey and Maturin that are at the heart of the film. As much as they are in conflict each has an abiding respect for the other and each has something to teach the other - Maturin is ultimately forced into action and Aubrey learns a lesson in warfare from one of Maturin's insects. Aubrey and Maturin are bound together by music and are never in more accord than when they are playing cello and violin together. Music plays an essential role here; I know some people who remember this movie mostly for its music.Breathes there a man with soul so dead, yea even a landlubber, who is not stirred when the drums start beating and the Surprise heads out in pursuit of the Acheron?This was a staggering undertaking and fortunately all the effort paid off in producing a wonderful film.</fullReview>

I own it, I love it, I watch it at least once a month, and I still want to crawl inside the world it creates and live there. The technical team that created the material environment of this film deserve all the awards that they can carry home. The glimpses of everyday life on board a tallship never cease to be fascinating, and each and every viewing reveals another missed detail. All the cast are exceptional, not least Crowe and Bettany, who create real characters of true warmth, integrity and charisma.If I ever won the lottery I would build myself an IMAX screen just so I could watch this movie on it all day.

		<shortDescription>In response to the misinformed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was first bothered to see, when i came to the IMDb.com site for Master and Commander that the sample review that was available was that of a person who hated the film. It upset me, but i have no real problem with it. In fact, it's good to see that there is a difference of opinion. It is hard for me to remember what i first thought when i first saw the movie, because since then i have completely delved myself into the world of Patrick O'Brian. First of all, let me say that i must have liked the movie well enough to buy it, because i now own it and watch it a lot. What i think made this movie great was the fact that it got me to read the books. i loved it so much, i went out and bought the books. The movie, unlike what was stated in a previous review, is not overly-nautical. In fact, it explains very little of the nautical process, unlike the books. It took me several weeks and about 2 or 3 books into the series to figure out the nautical terms, and i still have trouble with a few, but i'm much better now. Speaking of the books, this review said that 'Purportedly it's factual and based on real people'- wrong. It is based on the books. And in fact, it is not entirely based on the books in which it is named after (Master and Commander- the 1st book, and The Far Side of the World- the 10th book). The "lesser of two weevils' joke is taken from the 6th book, and the plot is not from the 1st book at all and only bits of it are from the 10th book, other elements of the movie are taken from various other books. WHat makes this movie so great is the fact that it melded these elements wonderfully, without being overly-nautical. Paul Bettany, being my favorite, did excellent, though he really didn't have much (in comparison to the character in the books). Russel Crowe i thought did great- he really captured the character wonderfully, minus the occasional stupidity exampled by the character in the book. There are several elements about this movie that make it a movie and not an adaptation of the book. For instance, in the book, Jack is fat and Staphen is ugly- this is obviously not the case in the movie. It wouldn't work well in the books, but it works magnificently in the movie, and i'm glad i saw the movie before i read the books, though i don't think i would have been disappointed had i read the books, then seen the movie. The whole point of this is to simply say that if (1) the movie was half as nautical as this viewer might think, then he would have been too lost to even finish the movie. He wouldn't even know how they got from one place to the other (as i often am in the books). (2) It's not based on true events, it's based on books. And in all of those points, are my opinions. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Old Fashioned Style Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is set in the early 1800's during the Napoleonic Wars when Britains Royal Navy really did rule the waves. In essence the story revolves around Russell Crowe as the Commander of a Royal Navy Frigate and his crew in pursuit of a French Frigate across the worlds oceans. Despite the lists of "goofs" mentioned in other reviews. The errors are extremely minor and unless you are the most perfectionist of a maritime historian they will not adveresely impact on your viewing experience. In fact, for a Hollywood movie, it is surprisingly true to life in its portrayal of the Royal Navy at that time. The film is a classic action movie in the truest tradition of Hollywood. The film is grounded in a good story. The action is intense and holds your attention. There is some violence but it is in keeping with the story and the action. The violence is neither gory or portrayed just to shock and awe. Not wishing to sound sexist this movie is fun for men of all ages. Age 5 to 105. Possibly the odd girl or two but I don't think this movie would be liked by women.</fullReview>

The end though, no spoilers really, was ... well I sprang up out of my seat and hollered at the screen, slapped my leg and wish the movie would never end. The more I thought about the film, the more I read into it, the better it became. It is more than a war film or a sea film, it portrays the old world, and the new together.

		<shortDescription>"Master and Commander"....a "chick flick" without the chicks?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the movie enough times, (mostly in pieces, but at least once the whole way through) so it's about time I commented. First just let me say?I'm a sucker for any well-made period piece, and this one seemed so detailed in every respect. This movie is often classified as an action movie, which aren't really my thing, and "Master and Commander" doesn't wholly qualify as one. I'd categorize it as part of the "drama set on the high seas" genre."Master &amp; Commander" isn't what I'd call a "chick flick" (whatever that is), but it's as close as you can get for a movie with about .08 minutes of total female screen-time. That's because it appeals to its audience in a somewhat heart-tugging fashion?you come to feel for the characters because they're so well-drawn. (Once while watching this movie, my husband even tried to console me by saying that perhaps the Will Wharley character was able to swim to the wreckage and then was washed safely ashore!?I know, that's really silly.) Every little, last minor character appeared so sensitive, gritty and real?and I could even imagine the stench emanating from the crew quarters. I love the entire supporting cast, from the complaining Captain's steward, to the grouchy old George Innis seaman character?I could go on and on, they're all brilliant.The overall particularly stand-out performances in my mind are: Russell Crowe, who provides such a performance of depth, as always, that it made me wonder what's really going on inside the mind of Jack Aubrey. Also, Bryan Dick as Joseph Nagle the rebel Carpenter's Mate?I'd never seen or heard this guy before, but the BBC ought to share him around more. Paul Bettany was excellent too as Dr. Stephen Maturin. Out of all of the characters in the film, his was the warmest and most appealing to me. His performance here made me want to go back and view some of his other films (but I'll gladly wait for "Wimbledon" to come on cable). And that Max Pirkis guy seems to have quite a career ahead of him. I adored the scenes in which he is tutored by Paul Bettany's character.?.Oh, and did I mention that the string duets in this movie were absolutely beautiful? Make sure you always listen to this movie in Dolby Surround Sound.I adored "Dead Poets Society" (another movie I must have watched a dozen times)?and Peter Weir has done it again. Actually, that movie is similar to "Master &amp; Commander" in a lot of ways?I mean, it even ended with all of the students saluting, "Oh captain, my captain!" Oh, what a tear jerking scene that is! (Maybe I'll have to comment on "Dead Poets Society" next!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who like action and adventure from a more romantic age you can't beat Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World for your needs. As a film it rates right up there with Captain Horatio Hornblower which starred Gregory Peck and Damn the Defiant with Alec Guinness, a couple of films I liked very much.Russell Crowe completely fits my conception of Patrick O'Brian's Napoleonic naval hero 'Lucky Jack Aubrey'. He's a worthy successor to C.S. Forrester's Horatio Hornblower. The books have been best sellers for years and this is Jack Aubrey's first screen appearance.The film opens with Crowe in command of a ship that's just seen a lot of action and it's not in the best of shape. Orders from the Admiralty come to him. There's a French frigate who's quite a bit bigger than Crowe's ship, nevertheless she's the only one near her in those southern latitudes so it's a search and destroy mission. One that can't be accomplished until necessary repairs are made.There's surprisingly little combat action in this film until the very end. It concentrates on character and goes into the most minute of detail the life on board a British ship of the line during the Napoleonic Wars. The action takes place in 1805 right after the Battle of Trafalgar and the United Kingdom is still keeping a lot of ships close to home.Crowe is nothing short of outstanding as Aubrey the charismatic captain of this vessel. He gets good support from the rest of the cast, my favorites being ship's surgeon Paul Bettany and Max Pirkis as the young midshipman who Crowe takes a fatherly interest in.In a sense the character's nickname of 'Lucky' is a misnomer. What you get Crowe's Jack Aubrey is a man of skill and daring and experience who knows how to take advantage of breaks and make his own luck. Never more so when he has that final encounter with the French ship.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World gives you a real feeling for the Napoleonic era. I do hope that Russell Crowe gets another chance to bring 'Lucky Jack Aubrey' back to the screen again.</fullReview>

Well it ain't so, and these are the ones for whom the sacrifice of a life lived for country, and the timeless truths of virtue under fire, friendship born of suffering, and something bigger than yourself - are not real. Goodness and doing the right thing have become old to us as a people, and it is costing every one of us. We want to be entertained, we crave stimulation, and are addicted to ourselves.

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, intelligent and touching film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teenage girl, I did not really expect to like this film, because I usually don't enjoy movies set in wartime. I wasn't prepared for this one, you see! I very rarely respond emotionally to the characters in a movie but this is one exception! I don't know what it was -- maybe the restraint present in each role, particularly that of the anguished midshipman Hollom. When painful things happened to the characters, I couldn't dismiss the characters as overacted or unrealistic -- they are real people and you care about them.I was surprised to read some comments on the film suggesting that the film lacks humour -- I really have to question these critics' definition of humour! Although the film does not contain many deliberately "comic" moments (save the lovely weevil joke!), a gentle sense of humour is present throughout -- you couldn't put this variety of different characters together on one ship and not get humorous situations! Another very strong point of M&amp;C is the music, which combines classical music with modern compositions and complements the settings perfectly.This is a truly beautiful, wonderfully acted film. It can't really be classed as an action movie, which will put some people off, but if you're in a thoughtful mood, I can't think of any more rewarding film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of Russell Crowe but when it came to 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World', I was able to put aside his thuggish behaviour in real-life as I was swept away by the excellence of the film and his brilliant depiction as valiant Captain Jack Aubrey.I haven't read any of the Patrick O'Brien novels, on which this film is based upon, but I imagine most fans of his work will be pleased by this adaptation as it's clear much effort has gone into preserving details, from the close fraternal bond between Aubrey and the ship's physician Marutin to the depiction of the tactics used to win in battle to the child crew who serve aboard the ship. You truly felt as if the grit, harshness and simplicity of the era were captured in this film and it is easy to be swept away in Aubrey's determination to destroy the French ship that dared to attack him and his crew.The cast were all wonderful in their roles. Crowe was able to shrug off his brutish behaviour to depict Aubrey as a stubborn, intelligent officer and gentleman who lived for Britain. Paul Bettany was perfect as the quiet, reserved Marutin who cared for his close friend Aubrey and all the men he tended to in his duties as doctor. The supporting cast, a number of whom were newcomer British child actors, also proved themselves and gave this film depth in the way they portray their characters as a tight-knit crew who rely very much on each other and would die for their captain and country.A must-see film, especially for the British as there is never been such a film that will leave you feeling proud to be a Briton. It reminds you that you don't have to be a football hooligan/BNP racist/chav to feel patriotic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film quite refreshing in this day of over the top action and in your face dazzle. This a timeless film that will appeal to broad audiences of all ages and it will not be subject to fads or popular notions. It could have been released 50 years ago and we would still accept it today as it will be tomorrow.There were no sex scenes, no memorable special effects, no surprise plot twists, and no unrealisticly choreographed fight scenes. This is a film that holds its own by pulling you into its atmosphere with masterfully developed characters, beautiful photography, fantastic ship battles, good score, and surprisingly fine acting. You'll really feel like your with the crew, and you'll really care about what happens to them. Crowe does an admirable job in portraying his qualities as a leader of men; true to his duty, courageous and tough, but not without weakness, humor or feelings. His on board friend the naturalist doctor is his excellent opposite, intellectual, bookish, and with an obvious impatience for unquestioned authority or the crown's less than humanitarian methods of punishment. His influence has a deep effect on our determined captain who comes to question his own ambitions verses his duty in protecting his men from undue danger.The danger is the sea, the weather, and the mysterious French frigate which is playing a cat and mouse game with our British mates. The enemy is never shown clearly, but we know they are clever, have more men, more guns, a thicker hull, and a captain who is possibly of the same determination as our hero captain. I found the relationship between the men, some of which are young lads barely in their teens quite convincing. Good camaraderie and a cemented loyalty under duress, but still fallible as all of us are. All in all a good solid seafaring story with authentic details and likable characters. The audio effects are sensational. By all means pump up the surround sound on this one lads!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a scene in MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD where the captain of a British Naval ship, circa 1805, debates the difference between duty and passion. Having passed on an opportunity to make wonderful new discoveries in favor of the pursuit of a massive French war ship, the scene manages to make a rather eloquent, yet subtle comment on the nature of man and his place within the world. The beauty of this film is that there are many such moments where the viewer is simultaneously bombarded with thematic musings, exciting action sequences, great acting and historical accuracy to the point where it becomes difficult to take it all in at once. Those of you looking for something more like Pirates of the Caribbean will be disappointed as this film is short on action and long on character development. There are only two major battle sequences, separated by more than an hour and a half of time. And while they are great; violently realistic and dramatically involving, the real guts of this film lies in the human stories told along the way. The director, Peter Weir, highlights his ability to tell an intimate story amidst a grand backdrop much like he did in The Truman Show. We get to know these men, their strengths and weaknesses and we see how the long and hard voyage plays on their minds over the film's progression. In one scene, a young officer feels the pressure of his men's dismissive stares and decides to end matters in his own way, afraid of what may be in store for him should he stick it out. Weir does a good job at highlighting the many facets of seafaring life. If you're looking for an intelligent and thought-provoking journey into the life of a 19th Century British Naval Vessell, look no further. Master and Commander has the depth of a good Discovery Channel show and the action worthy of almost any other high-seas adventure that comes to mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For England, for home, and for the prize!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is directed by Peter Weir, it stars Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany as Stephen Maturin. It is spliced from various novels in the Aubrey?Maturin series written by Patrick O'Brian. The film takes place during 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars and finds Captain Jack Aubrey and the crew of British frigate HMS Surprise ordered to intercept, destroy or take as a prize the French privateer Acheron. But the Acheron (The Phantom as the crew of the Surprise call her) is no ordinary ship, and her Captain is smart. So Lucky Jack has his work cut out; not only in the pursuit of the Acheron, but in harmonising the crew under his command. Especially his loyal and trusting friend Stephen.It's pretty evident within the first few minutes of Master &amp; Commander that this is no standard blockbuster naval based war movie. If you are after, or was expecting, a wave to wave Bruckheimer carnage a-like piece, well you best, or should have, stay(ed) away. For this is a Peter Weir movie, in fact this is a Peter Weir "period" movie, where attention to details and character dynamics are the order of the day. There's battle action here for sure, beginning and end, and terrific they are too. As first cannonballs crack and splinter its targets (note the sound work here), and later as blade meets blade; it's exhilarating stuff alright. But this is more interested in palpable tension, both on deck and on the waves. Threat is never far away, again, this is is covered by the impending duel with the Acheron and Aubrey's tactical pursuit/escape of her. While the crew give us a series of character dramas to involve us in the make up of a man-o-war's personnel. How different classes and males (there's not one female in the film) of all ages have to work together as one efficient unit in order to survive and triumph. Except for an interlude spent on the lusciously filmed Galapagos Island (Russell Boyd Best Cinematography Academy Award Winner), the film is set 99% of the time out at sea, on a cramped ship, this tells you that Weir is interested in telling a character driven story, cloaked in realism, above all else.The teaming of Weir with the highly rated O'Brian material looked a good one, and to someone like me who has never read an O'Brian novel? It is. But many of O'Brian's fans have been upset by either the stuff missing in the film, the stuff put in to fully form Weir's vision of the characters, or for Crowe not being Pugwashy enough. These complaints were inevitable since they come with practically every adaptation of novels these days. It should be noted, tho, that Weir was very much a fan of O'Brian, and in fact always felt inspired by the tight intricate detail of his writings. What of the author himself? Well he passed away three years before the film was released, but he had always envisaged Charlton Heston for the role of Aubrey. So, who in the modern era comes closest to Heston's physical presence on screen. Why Russell Crowe of course. Who not only brings that to the character, but also depth, because Aubrey comes with many traits. Strength, honour, stubbornness, leadership and loyalty are a given for a Captain on the high seas. But Aubrey is also vulnerable, self aware, playful, knows his limitations and able to laugh at himself. Crowe peels off each layer and delivers a high quality performance; from our first encounter with Crowe as Aubrey, the realism so loved by Weir is given a shot in the arm; and it stays throughout the movie.An excellent piece of casting then, as is that of Paul Bettany as ships surgeon, science and nature lover, and best pal of the Captain, Stephen Maturin. Bettany &amp; Crowe had formed a friendship on 2001s A Beautiful Mind. Where their on screen chemistry lifted an already fine film, to an even better one. So it be here too. Stephen &amp; Jack's relationship is the core of the piece. Two very different men yet as tight as two peas in a pod, with Stephen serving as the code breaker for the audience as sea talk and tactical intrigue weaves in and out of the story. It's there where Bettany excels, for he not only has us believing in this warm (platonic) friendship, he's also got us rooting for him since he is in essence the odd man out on this ship. Our sympathy is firmly with him, our friendly rebel if you please. Of the rest there's note worthy turns from Billy Boyd, James D'Arcy &amp; Edward Woodall, while Lee Ingleby gives a really heartfelt and emotionally engaging turn as Hollom.The film is not without flaws, tho. The pace of the piece does slip from time to time, while the talky middle section may stretch the patience of some. And the film isn't long enough to give the main characters some back story for the audience to work off. But it's still a great movie. Ripe with intelligence and interesting characterisations: and boasting enough adrenalin, humour and upset to fill out a big budgeted 1950s historical epic. Get on board folks, this is quality film making. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Errol Flynn graced the screen in Captain Blood, the genre of swashbuckling, seafaring films have enjoyed great notariety. Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a period piece with modern execution. From the standpoint of the story and cast, Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey is the ultimate star of Master and Commander. He conveys an authenticity and charisma that few actors currently possess, which allows him to pull off the Aubrey role so authoritatively. But there is an even more impressive star of the film--a star you will not see. Richard King was brought on board by director Peter Weir as "sound designer". His passion and technical expertise in audio engineering make the film a powerhouse cinematic experience, transporting viewers from their seats to a place onboard the British Navy ship, Surprise, off the coast of South America almost 200 years ago. More than any other aspect of the film, the realism and immersive quality of the audio puts the audience in the middle of the action. King won the Academy Award of Merit for Best Sound Editing for his work on Master and Commander. It was very well deserved.Based on Patrick O'Brian's novels about Aubrey's adventures, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World follows the Surprise, as it battles the Acheron, a superior U.S.-made ship in Napoleon's navy. After a surprise attack by the Acheron during the film's opening scene, in which the British ship takes nearly insurmountable damage and barely slips away in the cover of fog, Captain "Lucky" Jack decides to go after the faster, stronger ship instead of returning to England. At first, the decision seems foolhearty, as the Acheron again surprises Aubrey. This time, he escapes under cover of darkness. But the story is more than a series of chase and battle scenes, entertaining as those prove to be. Several aspects of naval and ship service are explored.Part of the story touches on concepts like religion and science in the prism of 19th century thought. The latter part of the film takes place in the Galápagos Islands where the ship's Irish doctor and naturalist, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) convinces Aubrey to let him explore and collect specimens in a pre-Darwinian subplot. Unfortunately for Maturin, he makes an unexpected discovery that leads him to cut short his tour of the Galápagos. One of his specimens, an insect that looks like a twig, gives Aubrey the idea to disguise the Surprise, leading to the film's climax, an intense battle, featuring an extended sequence of intense hand-to-hand combat. It is worth asking if Master and Commander would have received more attention if it arrived in theaters at a different time than the much more successful Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. Both feature "Captain Jack" characters, swashbuckling adventures on the open seas, and impressive battle scenes. Both films were very well executed, and it makes sense that a movie appealing to younger audiences would gross significantly more at the box office. The reality, though, is that audiences chose the equivalent of a theme park ride over an excellent series of books that easily could have spawned even better sequels to Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. The biggest disappointment of the film is that there would be no follow-up Master and Commander to follow Lucky Jack's exploits in the service of England's navy. Instead, we got two insipid sequels to the Pirates film, neither of which rose to the level of the first. Too bad. I would much prefer a trilogy of Master and Commander films, but it was not to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World is directed by Peter Weir, based on the popular book series by Patrick O'Brien and stars Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Robert Pugh, Lee Ingleby and Billy Boyd.Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World is the thrilling story of Captain Jack Aubrey(Russell Crowe)Captain of The H.M.S Surprise, he and his crew chase a French ship during the war against Napoleon.A tough and dedicated officer Aubrey is highly respected by his crew, however this latest mission is causing some division between the crew.Filled with spectacular special effects and a gripping story the real heart of the film and (indeed the books too),is Aubrey's friendship with the ships surgeon Dr.Stephen Maturin(Paul Bettany).Stephen keeps Jack human and reminds him he does not have to be so hard on himself all the time. Respected and well liked by the crew Stephen is a botanist and hates the military, despite their differences these two become the best of friends and respect each others different views and opinions.It's their ups and downs that make the film so worth watching.Thrilling and filled with excellent period detail this is another masterpiece from director David Weir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning and wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Weir is a director who has made some of the most interesting movies over the years, for example Witness, Dead Poet's Society, Fearless, Picnic At Hanging Rock. And for me, Master and Commander is not only one of his best, but also one of the best period epics from the last few years.Based on a novel written by Patrick O'Brian, it follows Captain Aburey and his ship HMS Surprise, as it does battle with a French ship in the South Pacific and the South Seas...There are many reasons why this movie works so well.The casting is spot-on. There are probably not many actors who can pull of a part like Aubrey, but Russell Crowe is one of them. Aubrey as Captain has to be a strong leader, but also an almost father figure to the young boy officers on board his ship. He certainly has to look the part when he has to fight. and in all these areas, Crowe easily convinces. I think his performance here is actually better than his Oscar-winning performance in Gladiator.But this is not totally Crowes' movie. There is a fantastic performance from Paul Bettany as the ship's doctor and Aubrey's close friend. The relationship is at the heart of the movie, despite the clashes with the French vessel, and both actors have to convince. It's to Bettany's credit that he more than holds his own against Crowe, making their relationship believable.The supporting cast, are all impressive, but special mention I think has to go to Max Pirkis as Blakely, one of the boy officers on the ship.The script by Weir and John Collee gives the actors plenty to work with. I've not read the Patrick O'Brian series of novels, but the dialogue here is fantastic and makes you really think you are on board a real ship. This of course is helped by the wonderful production design by William Sandell.The cinematography is superb, as is the music through-out the movie.The climax of the movie, a fantastic battle between and on the ships is gripping, well shot and very exciting. I've read that the way the battle is fought is also historically accurate. I can believe that.But this is Weir's movie. He directs the movie well, and despite being a long movie, it never drags or feels padded. He stages the action set-pieces brilliantly, yet also gives time for the actors to act well.Master And Commander won 2 Oscars at that years' event. It was beaten in its other categories by Return Of The King (which won everything else!). I think in any other year, it would have won best film and director.It deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Jane Austen's brothers were up to while she was safe in England</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Comment originally posted 6 July 2004)Excellent, excellent movie, with sound historical accuracy and detail and beautiful special effects. Peter Weir has such an incredible eye. Wonderful acting by all (especially David Threlfall as Killick, who stole the show for me every time he was on screen! The scene where he's cooking, annoyed at the Captain, with his head all bandaged up just cracks me up!) Of course, I don't need to tell anyone that Russell Crowe is great as a leading man. His captain has just the right mixture of sternness, culture, and humor. There are some amazing young first-time movie actors here too, who I imagine will have no problems landing roles from here on out. And of course I enjoyed watching my favorite LOTR guy, Billy Boyd, in this different role (although he was still a little Pippin-ish, as the little guy in the big gritty battle, but unfortunately he didn't get a solo song in this one!)At first, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about the pre-Darwin doctor, feeling that the character stole a little of the wind out of Darwin's sails, but I enjoyed how his character and the Captain's interacted, argued, and respected one another. Paul Bettany played the doctor very well, and his character showed what it must have been like for anyone in such a position, where his only ticket to travel is by serving as a doctor on a war vessel, and having to deal with the hardships of fighting, ship life, and superstitious, mostly uneducated men to travel with, not to mention having no real say in the destination or time abroad. And in this case, having to operate on HIMSELF. Agh.I can't say enough about the special effects or the acting. And even if you've seen many movies about life at sea (from any version of "The Bounty" to "Pirates of the Caribbean" to, umm, "Waterworld,") this movie is refreshing in its characters, plot, and action, and leaves you wondering what will happen next. I'm not usually a fan of sequels but sure would like to know what happens when the Surprise catches up to the Acheron again.Being the Jane Austen fan that I am, I also loved the fact that this movie portrays the other side of the world that she lived in (and I'm not trying for a pun on the subtitle of the movie). I love her "safe" world of dances, families, and English social life, with the officers always on the periphery, but I love the fact that this movie (and now I will have to read Mr. O'Brian's books) shows the masculine side, what those officers and their crews were really doing out at sea, and that it wasn't just floating around looking grand in their uniforms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterpiece from Australian Director Peter Weir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put this DVD into the player simply looking for some light afternoon entertainment, but instead found a really good movie...The scene for this movie is set rather quickly, as a British frigate (HMS Surprise) captained by "Lucky" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is stalked by a larger and faster French warship, in the treacherous seas off South America. The year is 1805.After setting the scene, director Peter Weir concentrates on character development and we get to know Captain Aubrey and some of his crew, and become aware of the friendship (and at times conflict) between the captain and the ship's doctor (Paul Bettany). The other central character is Blakeney (Max Pirkis), a young and likable Midshipman.The story traces the voyage of the HMS Surprise as it sails down the coast of South America, via the picturesque Galapagos Islands, and tension steadily mounts as the movie reaches a climax with the final sea battle.Other excellent movies directed by Australian Peter Weir include Dead Poets Society and The Truman Show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. That same evening I had seen a very tired "swashbuckler with Errol Flynn and Maureen O'Hsra and Tony Quinn. It was low budget and melodramatic and they all looked very tired. By contrast, this film had everything; drama, humour, pathos, action, scenery, and a passable story-line. Thoroughly watchable escapist entertainment--with no syrupy "lurv"interest. The Doctor/naturalist character was, I felt , a little out of time and seemed a touch too modern in outlook. I thought the portrayal of the life of the assorted midshipmen, learning their trade at sea, was very realistic. Would they really have been fooled, however by all those dead Frenchies on the enemy ship as they boarded it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must have watched this movie a dozen times, without tiring of it. The performances are excellent, and having read all of the Aubrey-Maturin canon as a result of seeing the film I can testify to the sheer faithfulness to character and period detail. Very unlucky not to win the Best Picture Oscar, this is such an immersive experience you can practically smell the sea air and feel the canvas.Plotwise, this is very much a composite of the books as no doubt many viewers have pointed out. For me the only drawback about this is that it rules out the possibility of a sequel. Probably Paul Bettany's finest performance to date, and he's a year younger than me, the talented so-and-so.Just watch it; this is the closest any of us will get to the Napoleonic War and 19th Century medicine. Unless we get treatment on the UK National Health Service of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meticulous and engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weir's meticulous recreation of life on a warship is an absolute pleasure to experience. The actors, who built up their characters as much as possible by establishing a hierarchy akin to that of the movie, do a marvellous job of recreating feel-good mateship amidst the rough work and seas they endured. Particularly noteworthy were the immaculate performances of Crowe and Bettany; their characters - a warm and friendly captain with a streak of arrogance, and his close, occasionally nervous but firm friend - and the friendship between the two are so flawlessly portrayed that each scene in which they feature is entertaining - the pinnacle of this is their duet musical scenes, with musical styles somewhat curiously but certainly effectively juxtaposed with the scenes that preceded them. The plot of Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World is actually fairly bland - upon reflection, there doesn't seem to be any way that such a plot could flesh out to a 138 minute picture; thus it is so that the interaction between the men on the ship, and the refreshing absence of female romantic interests, is what makes the movie truly engaging. All this aside, the realism and visual effects of the film, while comparatively infrequent and certainly less brutal or destruction-centred than those in standard action releases of the time, are very realistic, exciting, and have a touch of unpredictability about them. The end result is a movie which is not for everyone - younger age groups are certainly turned away, and I vividly remember being twenty years younger than anyone else in the cinema when I saw it - but those who will enjoy it will find it difficult to fault.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander was a hell of a movie. It's not just another remake. It seems like all movies made now are just remakes. This isn't a remake. Its the kind of movie that will be remade 40 years from now. It is an original movie. If you can't understand the plot of the movie, I pity you.Basically the H.M.S. Surprise gets orders to take a "prize" the French ship Acheron. The movie begins with a great little battle and from that point goes to chase mode. It doesn't seem like the movie would be that long just because the plot is so simple. However, along the way we get a lot of character description. This is common in the more classic movies, movies that are truly great. i.e. Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Raging Bull. The setting is described flawlessly. The ship looks exactly as a ship from the 1800's would look. It shows the cramped living conditions, the poor dental hygiene, and the more primal mind frame during this period of time. The acting performances were outstanding. Crowe does a good job and really seems to be a sea captain. The actor playing the Doctor did an excellent job as well. Its amazing to see him come from A Knight's Tale as a comedian to Master and Commander as a serious cello playing doctor that has a thirst for discovering new species on the Galapagos Islands.This movie has few flaws and for that should be considered one of the better movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few films manage to capture the era in which the original work was set and often rely on clichés of the particular genre at the expense of the core story. This film manages to avoid these pitfalls but more importantly serves as a worthwhile historical document. Anyone who is new to this period of history will not go far wrong keeping a copy of this movie as the attention to detail is excellent and adds to the experience as a whole (teachers take note). This movie manages to tread a fine line between gritty realism and Boy's Own, portraying the pursuit of an elite French warship by an older embattled British frigate. The production values are very high and the dialogue and length allows the director a better than average framework for character development. The predominantly unknown British supporting cast (some aged as young as 12) are expertly handled and provide a counter balance to the excellent performances of Crowe and Bettany. Crowe's delivery is very reminiscent of Richard Burton, exuding a measured screen presence without overpowering the dialogue.It would have been easy for the director to read through the salty notes of previous period pieces and deliver the usual tale of ocean going brutality and scurvy encrusted woe but Peter Weir's version of order through respect and camaraderie is far more believable especially when you realize that the sailor's greatest enemy was the ocean itself.I found little to dislike and much to admire. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing for me to think of warfare conducted at the whim of the wind, yet these sailors would almost drift alongside on another and fire at point blank range. I enjoyed the first battle were cannon balls from Acheron can seen flying through the air towards HMS Surprise - considering the low velocity of those guns - you possibly could have see a shot coming and ducked for cover! I found Russel Crowe thoroughly engaging - even more so in M&amp;C than in Beautiful Mind. The scene in which he helps the doctor in surgery on the island is fascinating. One gets a wonderful feeling of the cramped spaces with men moving about in crouching positions due to the low decks. Having visited some of these ancient fighting ships in maritime museums, I realized that they were quite small and flimsy by modern warship standards. Continuity: I agree with comments about the ship making 5 kts with her sails limp. Is it my error or does Lord Blackney's arm grow back? He seems to have two hands on his sextant when their second encounter with Acheron gets underway.</fullReview>

This is hands down the best movie every made without a single female actress (barring a 3 second scene off the coast of Brazil).Obviously the novels provide more backstory and much more nautical detail (so much to the point of being tedious) but the film approaches the tale from a completely different perspective. This is a work of art. This is what CGI should be used for in modern films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall A Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film at first seemed like it was going to be drawn out. It does start off with a pretty good action scene, then it slows down a bit. I also thought the film would primarily be only based on the ship (which it does for most of the time except towards the end when the crew decide to land on the Galapagos islands for a bit). However the down time in the movie became really fun to watch. The film displayed the crews individuality and tells the story about them and how they lived on the ship for weeks of not seeing family back home. Also it is interesting to watch how rank is treated on the ship. Russel Crowe does an amazing job in the film and so does Paul Bettany in his role as well. I enjoyed how the two actors characters developed over time in the film and how they both seemed to care for each other. Overall the film is fun to watch, it does have a rocky start and seems to start off slowly, but it makes up for it with a good story and some great action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely underrated masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this film probably close to ten times now since I first saw it in the cinema for a double header that included Tom Cruise's dreadful 'The Last Samourai'. I remember the impression it made on me. I also remember feeling embarrassed as a teenager buying a ticket for a movie with such a florid title as 'Master and Commander: Far Side of the World' and Russell Crowe on the poster looking like a butch sailor with an unbuttoned uniform staring wistfully off into the future. I cringed. How wrong I was. Here is a film told with great precision and mastery by one of the great chameleon filmmakers Peter Weir; I say chameleon because he is a director who always puts his story and characters ahead of himself - his craft is efficient, with the goal being to remove all traces of there being a hand behind the wheel. Everything you need is there, in service to the film. I've never had the adventure/buccaneer/sailor fantasy growing up, but this film certainly instilled it in me. It's a tremendous adventure, with sweeping battle sequences but is also unusually smart and literate for such a large scale picture. Despite its swashbuckling pretenses, the film allows all of the characters to breathe and come to life over the course of a strangely moving and evocative narrative. Each viewing of the film brings out more details under the surface. It's a shame it didn't have a chance at a sequel, it deserved one so badly. Meanwhile Pirates of the Caribbean 9: coming to a theater near you?. Seek this one out instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What going to movies is all about!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best movie of the 2000's. I challenge anyone to find another movie that so effortlessly combines genres of adventure, suspense, spectacle, drama, while gracefully interweaving subplots of war, science, philosophy, military culture, medicine, and class, and also staying true to history, geography, and weather. I'm sorry for that terrible previous sentence, but I don't have the time or literary skill to do better.This is not a Hollywood film. There are no maniacal villains, expository dialogue, musical crescendos, sweeping CGI views, fast cuts, or faster dialogue. Give the same script to any of the top 100 directors in Hollywood today, and you'd end up with the bastard offspring of Pearl Harbor, Cutthroat Island, and Wild, Wild West.But director Peter Weir had a different idea. His movie is as much about the experience as it is about the story. He makes you feel as if you were a passenger on this claustrophobic vessel, witness to both the mundane and monumental. You feel the dread of the crew's predicament - alone, at sea, and inferior -- knowing full well that they will be annihilated in any confrontation where they do not have the "weather gage." Despite a few beautiful panoramic shots, the film's POV never strays far from the ship and her crew. The enemy is distant, largely unseen for most of the film. One of the film's "chase" scenes is a dawn-to-nightfall pursuit, during which the film handles the tense waiting by showing academic studies and timekeeping. As far as I'm concerned, this film does not strike a single wrong note and is 2.5 hours of pure movie-going bliss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading a lot of comments here about pacing, strangeness of plot, strangeness of characters, strangeness of language?Well whatever you think of the movie I think this is one of the most faithful adaptations of a source novel I can think of. Any criticisms thrown at the movie can be applied as equally to the books in my view.The Doctor is a strange character, an Irish rebel who loathes authority but loathes Bonaparte all the more. Bettany is brilliant.Aubrey is also an odd hero ? probably toned down a bit for the film ? a magnificent leader of men and fantastic tactician who is actually a hopeless social inadequate complete with hopeless jokes (you're not supposed to be laughing WITH the weevils joke ? you're supposed to be laughing AT it) who is a complete liability on land. Russell Crowe tries his best but is too heroic ? he needs to more like Boris Johnson!The plot ? beginning and ending knowhere? With only brief battles at beginning and end? Again just like the books which often end in even stranger places and plot points. Most of all ? the impenetrable language (toned down for the movie) sets you amid the detail in a totally vivid completely &amp; alien world which you can nevertheless relate to as these men built the world we live in nowFor a movie fans point of view Peter Wier maybe went to far slavishly adapting the books, but give the guy a break, look at his track record (TRUMAN SHOW etc) If I were a producer I'd let him do whatever he wants with whatever budget.From an O'Brian fans point of view this is much better than anyone could reasonably expected and I can only say to those that enjoyed MASTER AND COMMANDER that if more come in the series in the same vein (wait until you see the various wives and families, the damn Yankees, the battles in the south atlantic, the adventures in the Indian Ocean, the spy plots in France and London, the feasts?) you're in for a real treat.Note ? this is an adaption of two novels ? Master and Commander, and The Far Side of the World (hence the title) &amp; enemy ship in The Far Side of the World is actually an american ship :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying Voyage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was well-reviewed, but hasn't jumped off the video rental shelves. No surprise there because it isn't the usual no-brainer-actioner with special effects overkill and lots of explosions for the mass movie-going public. Taken from a series of classic books, the movie feels a lot like good reading-literature, studied and paced and surprisingly intelligent. An adventurous start leads to a longish seafaring saga in the middle, and wraps up with a bang-up ending. The final battle brings you right back to the edge of your seat. How one reacts to the central movie - the voyage - may hinge on whether you enjoy thoughtful, well-done storyline and characters, or need hype and manic pacing to sustain you. My personal feeling is that the sea voyage that occupies the center of the film is thoroughly interesting and dramtically well-filmed. I came away from M&amp;C feeling that I hadn't been insulted or maniputated by a lot of what fills many movies these days, but rather told a good story. This film isn't an instant classic, I think, because for 3/4 of its length it moves at the thoughtful and studied pace that it does; but, it's still a quality film with excellent acting, interesting characters and overall superior story-telling values. Good film-making!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best film of adventure and naval warfare in the eighteenth and early nineteenth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1805. Napoleonic Wars. Bonaparte dominated Europe. England is able to resist because it is the first naval power in the world. Precisely by this, the seas become a crucial and strategic battlefield. It is a mission that could determine the fate of an entire nation.It tells an epic episode of Captain "Jack Aubrey" captain British warship "Surprise", whose role in the war against Napoleon is to intercept and destroy the French frigate "Acheron", a ship that can swing the war in favour of the Bonaparte's army.With this premise so simple, Peter Weir directs a story with undeniable mastery naval full of details that immerse us in the atmosphere of a tanned English crew commanded by Captain charismatic and hard "Autrey" played brilliantly by Russell Crowe, (in one of his best performances). Many adventures befall the British sailors to reach your goal, and all we are told with a very successful technique that combines naval action moments (as a dramatic exchange of salvos of cannon between the two ships, and approach to is to remember), with dramatic intervals.Possibly, this is the most complete film I've seen. The film is worth shipping for its photograph, by the magnificent portrait of the British crew on the duel between the two ships (and ingenuity of the two captains), performances by Crowe (that shines) and Paul Bettany also outstanding, and the soundtrack, which goes hand in glove with the film (violins and bass).It is a glorious film, in which both the atmosphere, such as clothing or weapons are impeccable. It is based on the books of Patrick O'BrianCrowe. The beautiful relationship of friendship between the captain Aoutrey and the doctor board framed in sea travel is evident in the film. All of it is intense instalment and vibrant, and we constantly see and hear and comradely relations nautical jargon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good adventure yarn. Plenty of action, but linked with some of the (movized) reality of what life on an extended sea voyage in a crowded man-o-war must have been like.Russell Crowe is pretty obnoxious and arrogant in real life and a lot of times that comes across in his movies in my opinion, but not this one. Besides, a number of scenes are stolen by his supporting cast especially the young boys and Paul Bettany who I thought was marvelous as Geoffrey Chaucer in 'A Knights Tale'I particularly enjoyed the string instruments and Russel Crowe's violin technique. In an interview he noted the hardest part of his role was to learn to look convincing playing the violin. He did a reasonable job of it (save his lack of vibrato action to match the music over - but it takes a while to get that far with a fiddle!).An entertaining flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb depiction of 18th/19th century warfare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay I wasn't around in 1805 and never served on a man'o'war so it would be fallacious of me to say that this is an accurate depiction of what it must have been like on an warship in that period. However, Patrick O'Brian's novels have been based on actual events and records from the period and Peter Weir has transferred this to the screen with an obvious love of the novels and with great attention to detail. I'm an avid reader of history from this era and it comes pretty damn close to how I imagined it must have been. Weir conjures up the claustrophobic feeling of life on board ship but also the great camaraderie that must have existed for crews to function effectively and after living together for month on end. Some people might complain about the lack of action - but life at sea would have consisted of long periods of routine with brief elements of extreme violence from either the elements or the enemy. It also creates the space to build up the characters so that we care for them. Rather than the gung-ho approach of many other films. When we do get the action it's sudden and jaw droppingly explosive. The cinematography is stunning with some of the battle scenes looking like period paintings. Again, it's good to see a film depicting naval warfare in the age of sail where the ships look "right". All of the actors play their roles really well with standout performances from Paul Bettany and a young Max Pirkis. If I have couple of minor gripes (which certainly didn't detract from an excellent film) firstly, the not so graphic depiction of how violent boarding another ship must have been - with people literally butchering each other with cutlasses, spikes and hooks etc (in the historic battle between the Shannon and the Chesapeake, the Shannon's boatswain had his arm hacked off with repeated strokes of a cutlass whilst attempting to grapple the enemy ship) but I suppose that would have affected the classification of the film. Less forgivable is the changing of the enemy in the source novel from American to French. It seems that it's not acceptable to depict Americans being defeated - even in fiction. Anyway, these are tiny gripes and if you like your historical films to be accurate with characters you can identify with and stunning action or you have the least interest in this period then I cannot recommend this film highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the rave reviews and good word of mouth I was looking forward to seeing Master and Commander. It had a big budget with a respected director and a reasonable leading man, a convincing recreation of an interesting historical era, and word of mouth that suggested it was more than just a knockabout action film.However, the story is really quite a simple one, and doesn't offer many surprises. A British warship, HMS Surprise, runs into a superior French ship, the Acheron, and narrowly escapes. The Captain (Russell Crowe) then spends the rest of the film pursuing and attempting to defeat the French ship. Meanwhile his confidante, the ship's surgeon (Paul Bettany), questions his stubborn decision to continue the pursuit.There's no doubt that Master and Commander is a handsome film (beautifully photographed by Russell Boyd) and a great deal of effort has gone into faithfully recreating 19th century shipboard life. It also recreates ship-to-ship battles, storms and various other hazards with some style, and it's technical Oscar wins were obviously well-deserved.Many people have suggested that this faithful recreation of the period is Master and Commander's real strength. However, if like me you've already seen the excellent British TV series Hornblower, none of this will seem all that new to you at all. In fact, a lot of it will be very familiar. With the exception of the occasional gory operation scene, Master and Commander doesn't really offer much that British television viewers won't have already seen relatively recently.This is why I felt some disappointment in seeing the film, because without the novelty of experiencing an unfamiliar historical environment, Master and Commander doesn't have that much more to offer. The characters aren't particularly well-drawn or developed, and the plot is pretty basic stuff. The two leads are both capable actors but Crowe in particular isn't really given much to work with, and has to be content to play the strong, silent, heroic type. Paul Bettany meanwhile, in this film looking and sounding eerily like Patrick Malahide, has the more interesting part, and makes a decent stab at it. There are a few other British character actors in the cast, including David Threlfall, James d'Arcy and Billy Boyd, and I was pleased to see Robert Pugh (excellent in the little-known film The Tichborne Claimant) among the ships crew as well. But Master and Commander doesn't really deliver enough that's new. The plot is a little too predictable, the characters a bit too underdeveloped, and the action scenes (although satisfyingly noisy), a bit too confusing and uninvolving. More than once I lost track of which Frenchie was being bayoneted or shot by which Englishman. I certainly wouldn't write-off Master &amp; Commander, as it's a pretty decent, if unsurprising film. It's well-made and is certainly better than a lot of the dross that's produced these days. However, if you do enjoy it, and find the subject matter interesting I would urge you to seek out the Hornblower TV series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There aren't too many films around even to this day that manage to capture the time period in which this original story is set somehow this film manages to avoid all the problems with others in its class came up against. If you are new to this period then this film is so good a teacher could us it in class. Yes its true the attention to detail is that good.The film is very realistic in its pursuit to portray an old British ship in pursuit of a modern French warship. What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said, the attention to detail excellent, the length of the film gives the director more than enough time to develop his characters. Its hard to believe some of the cast members were just 12 years old when they made this film. The performance by the lead actors Crowe and Bettany is equal to that of the production values. Just mind-blowing. Some say almost Richard Burton like.The director ignored previous films about disease and brutality but this depicts order through respect and comradeship.Just watch the damn thing already its that good your in for a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a beautiful shot in the closing moments of "Master and Commander" showing the infinite expanse of the seas as our gallant H.M.S. Surprise (once again) pursues her prey. It's just a very defining image to me, not only because it's the essence of the story (the gallant H.M.S. surprise chasing the enemy vessel through weather, battle and misfortune), but it brings home this crew's dogged determination in the face of danger. And Russell Crowe - so ideal is this casting - embodies Captain Jack Aubrey's boyish charms and steely grit as he leads his men to war. Mostly, this is just a thoroughly engaging sea movie. The battle scenes are exciting, the characters leave an impression, and the atmosphere is incredible. Between the sounds of the waters and the creaking wood of the ship, the fury of the ocean is nothing to laugh at. And Crowe gives one hell of a rousing speech: "... and though we be on the far side of the world, this ship is our home. This ship *is* England. "7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterful adventure of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Weir's Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is nothing short of a masterpiece and a wonderful adventure of a movie told with so much detail that people who are watching this movie wouldn't even need to read one of Patrick O'Brian's novel series all because of Weir's and John Collee's great screenplay. The film is one of the best films of it's genre since seeing Raoul Walsh's Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951), the movie is also a detailed character study of British Naval Capt. Jack Aubrey (played by Russell Crowe) and the ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (played by Paul Bettany)who also played Crowe's imaginary roommate in A Beautiful Mind (2001), as well as exploring their differences. Aubrey is a great strategist and tactician, and Maturin has a great interest in biology and collecting birds and beetles. Crowe gives one of the best performances of his career, and I was also impressed with Paul Bettany in this movie in a wonderful supporting role in fact to me is also his best performance. This movie has all of the things it needs that an 1800s Naval war movie is supposed to have for example excellent costume design, marvelous fight scenes, wonderful production design. This is one of 2003's best films.</fullReview>

During the Napolenonic wars, the film follows a small English ship defending itself against a larger better gunned French 'man of war' cruising in the South Pacific for Napoleon's France.*Special Stars- Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany.*Theme- England only asks the best from it's navy.*Trivia/location/goofs- 20th Century Fox bought The Rose, the ship which doubles up as HMS Surprise in the film, for $1.5 million. In the original story, the ship that was attacked was American. It was changed to a French ship by the filmmakers and the studio. The film ship is berthed at the San Deigo seacoast piers next to the 'Star Of India'.*Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable historic action packed and well produced olde school style feature film in the ranks of Clark Gable's 'Mutiny on the Bounty' or Greg Peck's 'Moby Dick". Refreshing and has something for everyone without too much violence, agenda, or preachings from the Hollywood brass. Film has everyman qualities and heroics that warmed your heart and satisfied your soul. Made patriotism in vogue again. I enjoyed Russell Crowe much more in this film than 'Gladiator'.*Based on- The book series from Patrick O'Brian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In April 1805, Napoleon rules Europe. British frigate H.M.S. Surprise under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is ordered to intercept French Privateer Acheron. In the first battle, Aubrey quickly discovers that Acheron is actually bigger, faster and more powerful skippered by a smart tactician. He escapes only through his skills and experience. After being soundly beaten, Aubrey decides to keep going instead of returning to base to refit. The ship's surgeon and Aubrey's friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) clash with him more and more as the far ranging battle continues.The action is exciting and more realistic than sail seafaring battle movies before it. The most compelling are the splinters that fly everywhere. It is the CGI that pushes the envelop on this action. Realism is everywhere. It is dirty, ugly, bloody, and horrifying. Russell Crowe delivers a solid performance to anchor this movie in reality. Then there are the everyday things that happen in between the battles. This has the epic scale conflicts but the human size struggle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a breathtaking and handsomely story adapted from two of Patrick O'Brian much successful seafaring novels . It starts in the year 1805 , when Europe has been vanquished by Napoleon, and only the British Navy stands in his way to total victory . Nearly the cost of South America, a new conflict is brewing. Captain Jack "Lucky Jack" Aubrey (Russell Crowe) of the Royal Navy commands the HMS Surprise , he fought with Admiral Nelson on Nile and is under orders of British staff to capture the three-masted French privateer Acheron, which has sunk several vessels . Crusing the coast of Brazil on the lookout for enemies and after various weeks of uneventful sailing , the fleeter French privateer lifts off in the fog and hits first under splintering fire , all but crippling the Surprise in an engagement in which Jack realizes his enemy's frigate is nautically superior to his own . Meantime the steadfast Jack Aubrey shares confidences and discussion with his cello-partner , close friend Stephan Maturin (Paul Bettany), a Darwinesque medic aboard . Aubrey is now faced with the choice of going back to Great Britain and admitting defeat or pursue the Acheron . Later on , they stop at Islands Galapagos where discover some extraordinary surprises .This rousing adventure/war movie is packed with action , psychological studio with interesting human relations, thrills , and impressive maritime battles. The naval battle sequences are quite good , the movie is well developed because it gets to know the seamen who are locked aboard the narrow quarters of a three-masted frigate HMS and how they relationship everyday. The captain , lieutenant ,Midshipmen and sailors are well-known by the time the final battle takes place . Director Weir chose to build the yarn from an intelligent point of view , describing an enjoyable friendship among protagonists and hard conditions about naval way of life with authentic psychology of men at war . The story exudes actual naval life with military discipline, gunpowder , real battles full of heroism and tang of salt . Magnificent duo protagonist and complemented by a string of sterling players as Robert Pugh as the sailing master , James Dárcy as Lieutenant Tom , with special mention to Max Pirkis as the Midshipboy and Lee Ingleby as unfortunate officer . Wonderful cinematography by Russell Boyd reflecting magnificently the marvelous maritime exteriors and wooden interiors . Groundbreaking special effects during maritime storm with giant waves by designer William Sandell who also made the ¨ Perfect Storm¨ . Sensible score with some emotive song and including classic music by Boccerini when the starring are playing violin. The motion picture is stunningly directed by Australian director Peter Weir who achieved several hits (Witness, Gallipoli, The last wave) and some flop (Mosquito coast, The plumber). Rating : Better than average and well worth watching . This excellently mounted flick will appeal to Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany fans .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director: Peter Weir; Screenplay: Peter Weir; Cast: Russel Crowe, Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy, Edward Woodall, Chris Larkin, Max PirkisPlot Synopsis: Audacious Captain Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe) and his crew of Brits aboard the HMS 'Surprise' obsessively pursues a French privateer across the high seas.In this noteworthy naval epic set during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, we see director Peter Weir deliver some of the most impressive special effects in recent memory. In fact, I would go as far as saying the proliferation of home-theatre is down to films like Master and Commander. The art direction and the cinematography are also spot on, capturing the feel of what it would be like sailing the high seas in 1805 (I have even heard reports of patrons coming out of theaters suffering from sea-sickness!)Russel Crowe once again delivers an impressive performance, rightly justifying his place as one of the premier actors of our time. As the brash Captain Jack Aubrey, Crowe exudes bravado and charisma and creates a well-rounded protagonist that is very convincing as the obsessed Brit hunting for French blood. Generally, the cast as a whole delivers a strong team performance, especially Max Pirkis as the young midshipman, however even mighty Captain Jack must play second fiddle (pardon the pun) to Weir's set designs and explosions.Perhaps the only gripe I have with the film is the inconsistency in the pacing, in that there are a few slow points that interrupt the overall flow of the picture. However, at 133 minutes, the running time is more than acceptable for a film of this type.Overall, Master and Commander is a very satisfying experience that successfully captures the look and feel of naval warfare and should appeal to anyone who enjoys a good cat and mouse chase across the high seas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must agree with Dr RJP in his/her assessment of this movie, especially with the comment that the characters speak the nautical language so easily. I was reminded of the language of the novel "Mutiny on the Bounty," which also evokes the same basic era. Our spoken language has changed greatly since then, but these actors deliver their dialogue with native grace and flair. This is a huge movie in scope and sweep, but has actors with sufficient screen presence to handle it. Russell Crowe can command a screen. I don't know if I would compare him to Erroll Flynn--perhaps more with Clark Gable, as in his role as Fletcher Christian in "Mutiny on the Bounty." Flynn's characters were more suave, more refined than the tough seaman Jack Aubrey. Actually, Crowe reminds me of Robert Mitchum in his acting style: both men's men, a little rough on the edges, not afraid of roles that challenged them.The whole "feel" of the movie is authentic, and hearing some of the old sea chanties was wonderful. I could smell the saltwater above, the tar and gunpowder and humanity below. I could feel the wind blowing across the deck.I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end, and I feel this movie and "Hidalgo" are Hollywood at its very best. The flaws were minor compared to my total enjoyment of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: There may be slight spoilers below. It's difficult for me to be objective about this movie since I love the series written by Patrick O'Brian. I believe that there were some mistakes made in casting the parts. Russell Crowe is an OK actor and while he may resemble Jack Aubrey physically, his personality is just not right. He's a bit too wooden to portray the bluff and amiable Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey.Another aspect of the movie that irked me was that they tried to cram every joke and all the plots of all the novels into this 138 min. movie (keep in mind that there are 20 books in the series). Also, the relationship between Aubrey and Maturin don't seem particularly close. They are cordial to one another, but then again, they are cordial to the other officers, hardly the great friends they are in the novels. On the other hand, it's true what other critics say about the details in this movie. I don't know too much about ships and naval warfare in the Napoleonic era, but I appreciate the historical accuracy concerning the youth of the midshipmen as well as the presence of the "powder monkeys", the ship's boys who carry the powder to the guns. For an objective viewer, this movie has enough action to make it enjoyable and worth watching. However, I would strongly recommend the novels, instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weir's excellent film is something to Crowe about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>447 comments in, a lot of this will have been said before, but I can't be bothered to cut it down..Master And Commander is that rarity - an action film made by an intellectual director. Peter Weir, whose previous credits include the cult title Picnic At Hanging Rock (1975), as well as the more recent successes Dead Poets Society (1989) and The Truman Show (1998), has often had a special relationship with water, witness its importance in The Last Wave (1977). In Master And Commander, for the most part, his sailor cast are surrounded by it - only setting ground once in the Galapagos Islands, and then at the requirement of the ship's resident surgeon-naturalist Maturin (Paul Bettany). For the rest of the time the focus of the film is entirely aboard the HMS Surprise, charged with the pursuit of the French privateer Acheron - a much larger and faster vessel, which, through a run of bad luck, continues to elude and outgun the British. In command is Captain 'Lucky Jack' Aubrey (Russell Crowe), his ship a microcosm of the society from which it springs for "this ship is England... on the far side of the world." It's also a vessel on which he has served for a number of years - having soaked enough of his blood into the timbers "for it almost to be a relative," and his youthful initials carved into the wood at the bow. Significant too is the year during which events are set, as 1805 was the great year of Trafalgar. The prestigious shadow of Lord Nelson looms large over the considerably more minor engagements of the Surprise, and Aubrey regales his officers with anecdotes of encountering the great man himself. Other, subtler historical echoes are found as the ship visits the Galapagos Islands, to re-provision and to help heal the sick. Maturin's excited discovery of new species, and his careful naturalism, is suggestive of Darwin's real life experiences there a few years later. Also on board is a young Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis), whose loss of arm during an early engagement provides a visual reminder of the famous Admiral back home. At the centre of the film is the relationship between Captain and the ship's Surgeon (reminiscent of a more famous one in the original Star Trek). The two are close friends, bonded by mutual respect and a love of music, although at odds over the exacting requirements of His Majesty's service.Aubrey is of the sea, a man of action, whose belief in discipline is paramount - including use of the lash if necessary. In contrast, Maturin is worldlier; a 'modern man' with wider interests than just naval conflict and, in private, forces his friend to confront issues of power and science. The duo balance each other out and it is tribute to Weir's melding of two books from the original Patrick O'Brian naval series that their relationship works so well. Praise is due as well to the performances of Crowe and Bettany, re-establishing their screen chemistry together after A Beautiful Mind (2001). It is their interaction, sometimes set to music in a touching way unexpected in this sort of film, which anchors the physical action seen elsewhere. For those who come to Master And Commander after seeing the recent Pirates Of The Caribbean the difference could not be greater. While Verbinski's somewhat surreal romp owed an unspoken debt of inspiration to the gleeful fantasy and athleticism of Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Weir's production harks back to the seriousness of a different tradition: that of Hornblower. For the director an accurate recreation of period detail was essential, right down to the ropes lay on the rigging (twisting a different way round to contemporary knotting). If there are weaknesses in the film, ironically they're in the some of the incidentals of plot rather than its staging. As Weir admits elsewhere on the DVD, he originally had doubts about adapting O'Brian to the screen, as the author's story lines did not easily make for a good film. By jettisoning a good deal and combining material across books he came up with a reasonable script although even so, some have felt that the film's middle could have done with some tightening. The episode in which an officer faces hostility from the crew then finally leaps overboard feels somewhat extraneous and, arguably, could have been left out without much loss, while the doom-prophesying older seaman ("..e's a Jonah awlright!") is a surprising and somewhat distracting stereotype amidst an otherwise entirely convincing setting. Those who might have doubted Weir's ability to conduct action set pieces excitingly need have no doubts as the two or three principal action sequences are carried off excellently with miniature and CGI work entirely invisible. Music is used carefully in the film, often brought in as part of the fabric of its world. To play his part, Crowe was obliged to learn the violin and is convincing at it while Bettany works with the cello. The director was careful to include two or three contemporary pieces the charm of which cements the main friendship on board, while Vaughan Williams' Fantasia On Greensleeves plays under a particularly poignant sequence, recalling the similar use of Barber's famous Adagio some years ago in Platoon (1986). The rest of the score is relatively unobtrusive - a wise decision, as leaves a lot of the film to speak for itself and is another indication of the director's concern for naturalism. Filmed as much as possible without the use of artificial seas and CGI, Weir's film is extremely convincing in portraying life and death on board, and some of the interactions between the ranks between cramped decks. Even Aubrey's poor jokes seem part and parcel of the blunt manner of the man. The producers secured a genuine period reconstruction vessel for a lot of the scenes and, together with Weir's characteristically careful direction, the result is a success all round, if ultimately no masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swashbuckling, action adventure, with great attention paid to the period's historical detail is a great deal of fun to watch.Unfortunately, the various sub-plots, treacheries, friendships, discontent are either clumsy, or never develop and actually detract from the entire reason I watched this : for the action and adventure!Russell Crowe's calm, focused soft spoken method does well for his part as Captain Jack. Paul Bettany does well as ship's surgeon and portrays a sensitive, intelligent but disillusion scientist who's interest is more for the adventure rather than the game. Dr. Stephen Maturin balances out, very well, the 'war is all glory' aspect of the story, with the 'war is all hell' actuality.All in all, it's a fun movie, but far short of the future classic that it was made out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is an ok film but that's all in My opinion. Russell Crowe was very good in his role but that's all that is good in this movie except the scenes with the animals. In fact, I think that was the most exciting part in the movie! I mean the very few battles in the movie were staged good but it seemed like the film was lacking something and I really don't know what it is. I guess this movie just didn't have any thing interesting to pay attention too but if it focused on the animals more and even Crowe's Opponents and not his entire crew then I believe that the movie would of been better. Was all of those operating scenes needed? I do think this film was better than Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl though. This may be the best film of its kind but I would still prefer Cutthroat Island much more if anyone is looking for an exciting war boat and pirate type film. What was the deal to have three composers for the film? In My opinion I think this movie is ok but its nothing special. If you want to see Crowe in another epic role then watch Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing nod to the classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first few minutes sported excellent photography of a ship on water. Naturally, you might experience a let down when they get to the up close and personal part, but then what would a movie be without dialogue? I admit I was disappointed at first by two things: The lack of dialogue (specifically the moving between two plots.) I would call this movie a "monologue" in that it had the old fashioned quality of being a simple story, straight up, no surprises (really); also, the lack of females present. The second quality is easily forgiven once you allow yourself to become woven into the tapestry of the tale.My absolute favorite features were the music and the dynamics expressed between the captain and the doctor. The fragility of human friendships, coupled with the detioration of the human condition while under duress were very well portrayed. All in all there is something in this one for just about everybody- historian, romantic, politician.I should mention this flick definitely has a classical leaning. I kept feeling that I was back reading Kidnapped and David Balfour again, two of my favorite classics. The score was absolutely beautiful and richly entangled with the plot of the movie. I doubt I have ever watched a movie with a score so perfectly matched. If you love asthetic photography, beautiful music and classical literature, this movie is definitely for you. Since there are no sexual innuendos, I would even let my eleven year old see this one for it's pure excitement and adventure, plus breathtaking sites, inspiring music and refreshingly old, but real human dynamics! I only wish we had seen it in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to disclose my name, but I was involved in the making of this film. And to further add to that, I won't say my position though I will say that I was down there for the full duration of filming (aprox. 6 months in Rosarito). All I want you people to know (whether you like the film or not) is that this was one of the best experiences I have ever had. Peter Weir has been my favorite director (not joking) since I was around 8 or 9 years old. His films always bring out emotions in me that I don't expect to feel in films. Considering that I was so closely involved with M&amp;C it's hard for me to just let go and watch the film for it's whole worth, but every single actor, extra, and stunt man you see was completely down for the "cause." We turned into a family down there. Peter was incredible; he went out of his way to not just remember peoples names, but to pronounce them correctly. His direction (in my opinion) was flawless. As far as Russell goes- I've heard a lot of people talk sh** about him. Saying thing like he's a drunk, and disrespectful of others. I'll tell you this. I was not close to him, but I've have talked to him and been around him a lot. He is an honorable man with a hard scenario to deal with. He is an actor who can forgive his character before becoming that character... then later be able to react to every manufactured scene honestly and from the heart. I hope that for all of you who did not like the film, you can at the very least recognize the heart that went into it. This wasn't meant to be a money maker- this was a story that needed to be told. It was entertainment with inherent lessons. It was a vehicle for great acting and great art. To those of you who loved it (the majority I hope), I'm glad that you appreciated it. Peter has been my king in this art [and business], and still is. He created a story that made a visceral six months for me. A part of my life that fed the fire of ambition.Finally- I hope that this isn't too cliche, but I hope that if this movie didn't push you to be a hero in your own life... that some film will one day. For me, the experience of making this one has. Find what you want to do, and do it- Surprise the world and make something great. Furthermore, if you have read this far and you aren't writing a script, acting, directing, or involved in the business, your interest is far too great to stay that way.ciao tutto</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain Jack Aubrey, Russell Crowe, and the crew of the British frigate HMS Surprise, chase a larger French warship from the Atlantic to the Pacific through Cape Horn in this handsomely-mounted nautical tale. People expecting adventure along the lines of Pirates of the Caribbean might be disappointed, but fans of intelligent, historically-accurate, character-driven adventure will find their patience rewarded. By the time you reach the climatic battle, you get a wonderful sense of what it must've been like to be a sailor in the age of wooden ships and iron men as they battle the elements and the enemy. Russell Crowe gives his best performance since "LA Confidential" as the Lucky Jack Aubrey, a man with the skill and confidence to earn the loyalty of the crew. Kudos to director Peter Weir. I would like to see more films like these.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best sea-conflict movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe is this movie, without his larger than life screen presence this movie could not maintain validity because I don't believe people would allow themselves to be pushed as far as the story demands without an extraordinary reason and the reason was embodied in Crowe's character.The director, Peter Weir, was able to sustain this saga through his superb ability to maintain audience interest even though sea stories about ships under sail meant that there would be huge amounts of time with little happening and then brief moments of total turmoil. This movie therefore is a different directorial animal to Gladiator, Crowe's masterpiece, because sea stories do not contain the intensity of action throughout as did Gladiator. I would think that Master and Commander would tax the directorial abilities of any person when faced with expanses of time as a metaphor for the sea itself especially in a movie involving one ship chasing another across vast distances of ocean. Weir does it, however, and he leaves the audience wishing that this movie could just keep rolling with more examination of Aubrey's, Crowe's character, life at sea.The action sequences are as good as has been shown in contemporary film without falling into that Hollywood trap of violence for the sake of violence.A fabulous film in all respects-see it if you can!</fullReview>

I have never seen a film billed so incorrectly. There were some action sequences, but such events were not the focus of the plot. Peter Weir chose, instead, to entertain the viewer with rich dialogue that advanced the storyline better than any explosion ever could. I can understand some viewers being disappointed in the epic with it's long sequences of calm, but, any perceptive, eager-minded movie goer will be satisfied with it's quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>20th Century Fox, Miramax Films, Universal Pictures:Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.**Russell Crowe** **Paul Bettany **Edward Woodall** **James D'Arcy**Directed by Peter Weir.Then Peter Weir appears out of nowhere! -In his best film since Dead Poets Society. But what worries me is that Master and Commander is yet another film based on earlier books, like Dead Poets Society. Could it be possible that Weir gets his hands on a real script that hasn't been a book, it is then we may discover the further talent he may have. Without books, The Truman show was an exceptional movie?Master and Commander, Pirates of the Car??( what ever) Is the `pirate' genre back?Probably, but what do I know I'm just typing to my self. I'm not going to outline the storyline for you, coz imdb has it all. Crowe plays the captain of the ship, who is often referred to by his first name Jack Aubrey by his crew. We can see by this that the crew are closely bonded lads, but tragedy will strike? For these men on the sea, only one thing is worth more to them than grog, women ? The film mixes a few jokes on the matter. All though Russell Crowe said in `A Beautiful Mind' he wasn't going to shoot anyone, he sure does in the final battle sequence of MaC. The movie has excellent battle scenes, short, but correctly done. This isn't a Non stop Naval battle movie with pointless action sequences, the film lets you bond with your crew before they die in battle, successfully making you be a part of the movie.8/10 </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed in MASTER AND COMMANDER that a lot of camera shots and angles resembled ones from MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY 1935 and 1962. Consequently, I worked myself right into enjoying the film completely.Russell Crowe keeps convincing me that he can play any role put in front of him. After LA CONFIDENTIAL, GLADIATOR, and A BEAUTIFUL MIND, I believe that he can even tackle the ultimate macho role: 007 (Move over, Pierce).The most pleasant surpise that I found throughout the film occurred within the reunion between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany (Dr. Stephen Maturin) as they played the two main characters. The chemistry that they displayed in A BEAUTIFUL MIND created a genuine friendship between them that spilled over seemlessly into this movie; they really care about each other in it.I can't wait for the next one...and I plan to read a few of Patrick O'Brien's books to see what everyone keeps praising so much within them.</fullReview>

He has to much pride in him that could kill his whole crew and his best friend Steve tells him that. But still he goes with what his head says not his heart until his friend gets shot.But you got to love a guy, who plays a violin so well and can make a crew smile even in a middle of a crisis. The crew themselves work together like glue to paper. The child actors act more older than the adult actors in some instances and they prove themselves.Master and Commander: The Far Side of The World, with a nine word title does drag and it cannot be helped when a peep of the watch is done.

Everything was just the way I imagined it, from the marines to the powder monkeys.I can't tell why seafaring stories are doing so well now, but we're certainly rediscovering classic cinema storytelling at its grandest. Russell Crowe even had a keen version of the classic matinée rugged hero about him, much like Clark Gable or Robert Mitchum or someone. He and Paul Bettany do play off each other very well, as demonstrated with the earlier A BEAUTIFUL MIND. And the up-and-coming young turks hold their own in this story as well. Particularly Max Pirkis, Billy Boyd (of LOTR fame), and the doomed midshipman played by Lee Ingleby.Great story, very well told. It made my top 100.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with my parents and don't expect anything more than a usual light sea adventure movie but I was mistaken. Master and Commander without a doubt is a best sea war/adventure movie in recent years and one of very best of all-time. It's a story of a British war frigate in thousands miles far away from home, a story of duty and courage of people united by one goal, a story of the strong characters who struggle with power of nature. The script is well-written, solid and consistent all the way. The screenwriters one more time proved that such a movie can exist without a usual weak Hollywood's love story in the background. Just unexplored boundless ocean, people on the certain ship and that's it.Peter Weir is a director who has made lots of very good but different from each other movies (worth to mention among them Dead Poets Society, The Witness, and The Truman Show). His directing in Master and Commander is outstanding. He has brought a balance into the movie; he united into one masterpiece excellent acting with magnificent special effects and that's the most important all these visuals are in the right place. Nothing here looks fake, all seems perfectly real, from a squall sea to beautiful Galapagos Islands. But the real glory of the movie is naval battles, the best such scenes I have ever seen. The excellent cinematography with well selected scenery makes this terrific piece of film-making an unforgettable experience for all people who prefer high-quality work to shallow summer blockbusters. Finally the acting. As all previously mentioned it's excellent. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany created here two Oscar-worthy performances of their well developed characters. Mr. Crowe was incredibly powerful as captain Jack Obrey, the strong leader but at the same time not a heartless person. He definitely deserved the fourth Oscar nomination in last six years for this terrific performance, but for some reason he was robbed of it. Paul Bettany perfectly plays here his best friend and at the same a subordinate under his command. All the supporting casts are good (including an excellent performance of young newcomer Max Pirkis as midshipman Blakeney) in their parts, they have created an amazingly real picture of a war ship and its crew. The movie's soundtrack is in opinion the best original score of this year and very suitable. All the way Master and Commander is an Oscar-worthy work of art that deserves the highest appreciation and praise. I know there is no a perfect movie in our world and with some patience you can find flaws in this Peter Weir's work but when you see such a movie you forget about all that and finally applause to all people involved in making of such a masterpiece.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute must for history and navy buffs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Weir is the most underrated director working today. He has shown consistent brilliance from such early masterpieces as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Gallipoli to later works like The Mosquito Coast and Fearless. Weir has managed to coax several career best turns from his lead actors, such as Harrison Ford, Robin Williams, and Jim Carrey. He should have won an Oscar by now (criminally overlooked for Witness, Dead Poets Society and The Truman Show). The recurrent theme in his work is isolation, whether on an Amish farm, in a repressive boys preparatory school, in a reality TV show, or, in the case of his latest film, in the early nineteenth century Royal Navy.Master and Commander: The Far side of the world is based on a series of Hornbloweresque novels. I've never read them, but the film is a remarkable work. Despite not being an expert on naval warfare, I understand this to be the most accurate depiction of life at sea circa 1805 ever put on screen. The crew, led by the wildly heroic Jack Aubery (Russell Crowe) act, dress and speak exactly as they would have done, to often incomprehensible effect on a modern audience. The most shocking aspect of this accuracy is how many of the crew are young boys, and some of them officers having to face harrowing and bloody naval battles. By contrast, the enemy isn't depicted at all, one of the great strengths of the film. The action stays entirely with the protagonists on their ship increasing the claustrophobia and tension of the plot.French vessel Acheron ambushes HMS Surprise in the opening scenes (showing, again with great accuracy, how difficult it is to actually sink a ship). Aubery and his crew narrowly escape. After fixing up the ship, instead of returning to port, Aubrey decides to pursue the Acheron around Cape Horn and go on the offensive. This puts strain on his friendship with ships surgeon Dr Steven Maturin (Paul Bettany) who believes he is pursuing the French vessel out of pride, putting the crew at unnecessary risk.But this is no Mutiny on the Bounty. Although the relationship between Aubrey and Maturin at first seems to have William Bligh/Fletcher Christian overtones, this later proves false. This is a far more intelligent and clever film than it first appears, with unusual complexity in its depiction of heroism, what makes a great leader and the human cost of war. Aubrey is not a tyrant, but neither is he entirely rational. He is heroic but flawed. By contrast, Maturin is warm and kind, simmering with righteous indignation, but not always the voice of reason he likes to think he is.Towards the middle, the film bogs down somewhat under the weight of its many subplots, particularly in the sequences around the Galapagos islands. However, the film returns to form for a splendid and exciting finish, which I won't spoil here. The cast are excellent, with Crowe never better. Paul Bettany is also very good. The cinematography is absolutely stunning (this film has to be seen on a big screen). The opening alone is worthy of admission price as Aubrey stares into the fog and sees the silent red glow from the cannons of the French ship in hiding. He yells for the crew to get down as cannon balls whizz overhead and strike the Surprise to terrifying effect. Special effects, music and sound are all very good too.All in all this is highly recommended to anyone with a serious interest in cinema, and an absolute must for history and navy buffs. Another to add to the list of the years ten best films and almost certain to be Oscar nominated.</fullReview>

I was expecting another silly high seas "action flick" ... it's not that at all. It's something much deeper than that and much more powerful. This movie actually has periods of SILENCE [!!] and lets you digest the action, all of which develops from the timeline of the story rather than being thrown in for sake of having an action sequence. I also got a great feeling of authenticity throughout, with class distinctions and real military decisions being made in as [I think] they might have been in the early 1800s. There are a few times when I felt the writer and director were hitting me over the head with things, but these were only minor things compared to the rest of this beautiful film.

		<fullReview>Let me first say that this movie was done very well. The acting was great, I really believed that the cast was out at sea a long time ago on these huge ships propelled by the wind. Russel Crowe was great and there was a real conflict that was depicted. I have talked to friends that really like this movie. For me it was very slow and boring. I was in the Navy for 10 years and let me tell you watching sailors at sea is not very enjoyable or interesting to watch. Like I said the movie was done well and the acting was great. If history is your thing and you are into boating or Naval history then check it out. For the rest of us, skip it. I was begging my wife to leave, she wanted to see the end. There is not much action, its in the end and beginning of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this film was enjoyable. The acting was top notch, with some "unknowns" in it was a joy to see. Max Pirkis as the young midshipman had a lot of focus paid him; what a fine young actor who portrayed the role perfectly. Many films with the "young" sailor portray them with almost sappy or cute style; M&amp;C did not. The writing of the script left no bad feelings on my part; a great story told effectively. The directing was perfect; it would easily had botched this movie if a different director had been chosen.The music was one of my favorite parts; some "period" music mixed with more contemporary British music helped me accept the characters into their roles with ease.I plan on getting a DVD as soon as it's out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Film For A New Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful film, quality from beginning to end. Russell Crowe just keeps getting better and better with each new performance. You need to see this film two times, because you will be highly enriched by the second viewing. Peter Weir a Master and Commander at directing, has created a classic masterpiece. Academy Awards potential looks emminent, the battles, the chase, the relationships of the crew and its Captain, the friendship between the Ships Surgeon and the Captain are at the heart of the story. I think what stands out is integrety and honor, to put duty to the forefront and to care about the people under your leadership. This is the best film of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read quite a few of Patrick O'Brian's novels and loved "Master &amp; Commander" the movie. You feel that you are on board The Surprise. You are a member of the crew. Paul Bettany as Stephen Maturin and Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey both play their parts to the hilt. You know that they are friends. There are moments of extraordinary tenderness, when after a young midshipman has lost his arm, Jack gives him a biography of Nelson, who had lost his arm also. You know that Jack feels sorry for the boy but is not maudlin. There are scenes of brutality, but this is war. I think Patrick O'Brian would have approved and I hope people will read his novels. The movie theatre that I was at was packed and at the end of the movie the audience applauded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERSMaster and Commander is by far the best film this year. Some people have been calling it an epic in the sense of Gladiator, but it is not so much an epic as we are allowed to view the activities of the HMS Surprise for a little while. There is a sense that the adventure continues at the end of the movie. Nevertheless, epic or no, it is one of the most detailed movies you'll ever see. The footage is simply beautiful, particularly the scenes on the Galapagos Islands, which are magnificient and a nice moment in the film. Russell Crowe gives a larger than life performance. Paul Bettany is perfect as the ship's surgeon and Crowe's best friend. My overall rating: 4 stars out of 4.. a must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Swashbuckling Submarine Epic on Top of the Rolling Main</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is shaped by three powerful forces: director Peter Weir, book series author Patrick O'Brian and Russell Crowe, to create an epic, costumed submarine movie on top of the water.Weir controls us from the opening sights and sounds, like the original "Star Wars," plunging us intimately into the middle of an ongoing tale and interlocking hierarchy of class and role relationships. Cinematographer Russell Boyd worked with Weir on "Gallipoli" and that's the only one of his films that presages the exciting in-your-face battle scenes (against both human and natural enemies). There are moments of confusion during the height of the battle as to which ship's deck we're thrust onto, but rather than damn the editor, I'll figure it's a way to bring the audience into the fog of war.These choices accent the crowdedness of "this wooden world," even as Crowe's captain roams and thus controls from the bottom of the bilge to the top of the mast (and it's a sign of Weir's supreme confidence that he doesn't even bother to repeat that latter, very expensive, pleased-as-punch non-CGI shot of Crowe). The loud sounds of the water and weather elements are constant, frequently drowning out the pre-Tom Clancy techno-nautical speak. We can be relieved that Weir didn't have smell-o-vision at his disposal as well.O'Brian re-created this upstairs/downstairs microcosm in his novels, written starting in the 1970's; I've only read the first two so far and am already enthralled at the Jane Austen-like attention to male manners, anchored by the unique musical and intellectual friendship between dashing man of war Captain "Lucky Jack" Aubrey, who is so unlucky physically, socially and financially on land, and his best friend the scientifically-minded Dr. Stephen Maturin, who is oblivious at sea and so crafty on shore.Weir quietly sticks in references for the novels' fans to enjoy, such as Maturin's warning that both sides in the war have spies as a veiled comment on his own role and a glimpse of Aubrey's letter-writing to his wife Sophie (in the second book they're just courting). For O'Brian nit-pickers, yes, Aubrey did not need to learn camouflage from Maturin's studies of natural science. Maturin' s ignorance of military customs --and freedom to challenge the captain in spirited philosophical debates on leadership and politics that are the highlights of the script and resonant of more than Bonaparte vs. England--might be bewildering to non-readers who have to infer that he is a civilian, not a naval officer.These intellectual discussions, amidst violin-cello duets, are pivotal breathers amidst Crowe's swashbuckling. While he and Weir chose not to make Aubrey as tubby as in the books, he does effectively take on a rolling main waddle and sports the trademark "Goldilocks" mane to completely take on the larger-than-life character.But Crowe doesn't just give us intense leadership (from an actor who spent half a day learning how to use the sextant so that his one line of dialogue on the subject would sound meaningful), but the radiant enthusiasm of command and action. The early 19th century milieu allows for more reaction to the ensemble than in "Crimson Tide" or "Das Boot" as we get a large age range, from child officers to wizened sailors, that bring out a wide variety of expressions in Crowe's captain. Most notable is the avuncular twinkling as the character clearly recalls his own long apprenticeship at sea, which appears to be necessary to master the endless details of ship management of materials, men, and meteorology (from blizzard to broiling drought) and earn his crew's approval of "true seamanship." He equally captures the humor of drunken dinners and the contradiction to his claim of stoicism born of "a lifetime spent around wounds" as no match for the doctor's.In re-creating close male camaraderie, the casting of the entire crew is terrific, as the camera keeps us familiar with each distinctive face, and only one almost distractingly cute surfer-looking dude, so we are really caught up in their unpredictable fates. I don't know if it was Weir's choices or MPAA pressure, but for a violent movie much is left to our imaginations based on the vivid set-up for each confrontation, the wincing on those faces, and the bloody aftermath (but less than in O'Brian's books where the decks are slippery with blood that needs constant buckets of water to wash off). Max Pirkis's miniature midshipman is simply a scene stealer, even as he jarringly seemed to be out of "Peter Pan" where little boys fight pirates.I'm a bit of a sea chantey aficionado, but I now think I must be more familiar with ones from later whalers and will assume the ones sung here by the crew are probably time and place authentic. I was impressed that the appropriate music continues over the credits, with no jarring inclusion of contemporary schmaltz, as we are simply left with ship, captain and crew continuing as the sea goes on forever and the story never ends --or at least to a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great sailing movie, not a great movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film. I've enjoyed the bit of sailing that I've done in years past, and I like old-fashioned adventure movies. I was hoping that this would be something rousing on the scale of "Last of the Mohicans," in taking old-fashioned literature and making it for a modern audience. However, this film is missing something of the innovation that made "Mohicans" such a stunner: more importantly, the villain is missing.  In Mohicans, the figure that chills the soul is Magwa (Jodhi May), who coordinates the attack on the English twice and becomes the central figure in the second half of the film. Hawkeye (Day-Lewis) is a noble hero along with Uncas and Chingachcook, but their heroism is made all the more thrilling in light of the threat of Magwa. In "Master," we only get a hint of the enemy, mostly his cunning, without a sense of a real conflict between them. Unfortunately, that leaves the drama to be between Mathurin (Bettany) and Aubrey (Crowe) which doesn't quite speak to the chase that they're on. The Acheron is essentially a Hitchockian McGuffin: it's what they've been sent to grab, and the mission lacks a sense of the motive for going after the Acheron. Actually, reading that initial mission of the Surprise evokes the taunting of Merovingian toward Neo and Morpheus in the Matrix Reloaded. The Merovingian reasserts his power by claiming they do not know the reason why they were sent. Like the Keymaster, the Acheron is a means to an end: it is not a "why." The crew of the Surprise does not really know the "why" of getting the "prize": they're in it for the "how." So, they are in a sense powerless without this "why." Theirs is a small game in a big war. Maybe if the film had ended when Crowe decides to land the ship on the Galapagos and go home, it would have been a more interesting tale about pride, determination, and wisdom. As it is, with their lucky break, both Mathurin and Aubrey get what they want which dissipates their dramatic tension rather flatly. So, although beautifully made with flashes of eye-popping brilliance (how the hell did they do the sequence around "the horn"?), it doesn't make for great drama, nor consistent enough action. We're left with a half-empty epic, its beauty filling the eye, but leaving the heart thirsty. ***.5-Dan Marrin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic sea voyage, with realism that shocked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Master and Commander today. I was quite literally shocked by the gut-wrenching reality of the battle scenes. Seems like I had barely snuggled into my cozy theater seat, expecting a "boring" sea story (as some critics have panned it), when suddenly the opening salvos of cannon fire from the French warship "Acheron" came coursing over the gunwales of the HMS "Surprise". The cannon shot came hurtling across and through the ship, with a distinct audible sonic roar - like screaming evil demons - and I was physically shaken by the sheer carnage that the cannon salvos caused for the ship and crew. I thought the movie was excellent, it was beautifully filmed and there was such an incredible feel of realism about the whole film. I found it not at all boring as some critics have said it was. But then again, I spent six years in the Navy, and another five years at sea in the fishing business, so I could relate to the whole on-board scene of life at sea. I thought the movie had just superb maritime atmosphere and great attention to detail. I also thought the movie had great suspense - especially after that opening skirmish. I enjoyed all the little touches that gave the movie depth and body, such as the detours to the Galapagos Islands, and I liked Captain Jack's dry humor and banter with his fellow officers and crew. The violin playing needed a little work, but it was a charming touch. So was the little cricket match.The only slight criticism I had was that often times, during dialogue, actors seemed to be speaking in very low voices, making it hard to hear. But other than that, it was quite a well put-together film. So, put me down as a big fan of the movie. I will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out, but to all who haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you don't pass up the opportunity to see this in a big-screen theater. It will definitely lose a lot of its "punch" if you view it on a small TV screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>having never read any of the novels in the series of the same name, i can make no comment as to the accuracy or quality of this film in respect to its adaptation from book. what drew me to view this film, something which i was very excited to do as soon as i learned of its debut, was not its cast nor its director, but the interest i have in anything related to the sea, sailing and the lost age of great sailing ships. i went with the hope that this film could get that right. while there are many minor details which i can easily take objection to, i walked away very satisfied with the recreation of life aboard sea which this film portrays.this film accurately portrays the life that would be confronted at sea in so many details. the great dichotomy between the lives of officers and the lives of deckhands, rightfully portrayed by differing foods served to the crew and officers, their respective living quarters, even the quality and quantity of conversation which these two, often adversarial sectors of the ship would enjoy is seemingly true to form. the long, post-dinner conversations amongst the officers over glasses of port punctuated with humor and marked by a literate and skillful ability to speak, share stories and entertain in a manner which predates television and our hurried society is starkly contrast by the "old salt", a cinematic cliche perhaps, below-decks as he warns of the bad luck experienced by all crew each time an unpopular and inept officer holds watch on deck. these crew would most certainly have been illiterate, uneducated and from the poor classes of england and would have been very susceptible to the superstitions and paranoia that long periods at sea could induce.moments of intense experience are strikingly contrast with long periods of little event: a man lost overboard and the effects of broken rigging trailing in the sea abaft are successfully portrayed (even though one must acknowledge that any verbal hailing to the overboard crew would have been inaudible and that his honest chances of getting back on board were nil in those sea conditions), as are the long, tiring and dismally hot days (sometimes experienced for weeks) that would most definitely have been encountered in the doldrums near the equator. the immediate elation experienced by crew during the strong rains which followed such a sweltering and monotonous episode is well done; one feels good for those on film as they dance happily on deck.while there are so many other great and subtle moments in this film, and admittedly some aspects to the plot and character development which fall short (one must "suspend their disbelief" during a few occasions), the film is excellent overall.ultimately, and i have read many other's reviews of this film, what any viewer needs is realistic expectations. this film is not set in our cell-phone frenzied, sound-byte age but unfolds in a time when time itself was experienced very differently. when new worlds (such as the galapagos) were first seen in the flesh and not on television or on-line while booking a flight. can we imagine what this experience would have been like? are you interested? if yes, then please see this film: you will greatly enjoy it while overlooking the minor shortcomings which it does possess. however, if you've never engaged your imagination upon what has come before and how it may have been, if you have no curiosity about life at sea during the great age of sail, no passion for exploring new worlds and can sense no mystery beyond the horizon as you lay upon a summer beach, headphones concealing the sound of the breaking waves, then i do have strong advice for you: stay at home and watch football, i guarantee you will enjoy those three hours so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be one of the only times in my life when I say this, but in the case of Master and Commander, the movie is far more engaging than the books. Because I am a nerdy sort, I felt a certain compulsion to at least take a stab at Patrick O'Brian before seeing the film, so I attempted to slog through The Far Side of the World. It was a harrowing experience! Anyway, I went ahead to the movie before I finished the book and was pleasantly surprised to find that such a tedious, though well-written, book translated into an entertaining, watchable film. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany worked well together again, and the characters of Aubrey and Maturin seemed to fit them like a well-tailored coat. Crowe brought Aubrey to vibrant, intense life, and his performance will not soon be forgotten. I have heard various complaints about Maturin's inaccuracy to the book. Granted, I am not a die-hard O'Brian fan, but from what I have read, I feel that Bettany was true to the spirit of the character, if not to the letter. There is an argument to be made for the fact that certain things on paper may not translate well to film, anyway. In addition, Billy Boyd gets lots of screen time, which only adds to the fun. One of my favorite things about the movie was the authentic portrayal of life on a ship, with its filth, lack of privacy, and genuine camaraderie. I also enjoyed the all-maleness of the story and the fact that the bonds between the characters were strong though not overly emotionalized. I found this movie to be highly suspenseful and very exciting. I have heard a lot of complaints about it being boring, though. I would simply say that it is not for everyone. The more literary a person is, the more likely he or she will be to enjoy it. I will definitely see Master and Commander again and savor its cinematic beauty, exciting story, and superb acting. See it. I dare you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers, dead ahead!* I'm stuck for lavish praises, so I'll try to make this five sentences long, at least. It's very faithful to mainstream Euro-history, especially 19th-century sailing jargon and techniques. Not to mention, the costuming. It's also very humorous, what with Aubrey's pun concerning weevils. Not to also mention, Fate's conspiracy against Dr. Maturin being the first naturalist to report on the fauna of the Galapagos! *Can you say, "Charles Darwin?"* But, of course, being a guy, the best part for me was the climactic showdown with the captain and crew of the French privateer "Acheron." Man! Did midshipmen (a.k.a. work-study naval cadets) have to grow up fast, back then! Otherwise, they literally wouldn't live to grow up, at all. I guess what I'm trying to say is: it's a good thing "the Black Pearl" never went up against "the HMS Surprise." Lucky Jack would've blown Mad Jack out of the water! Two thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best sailing ship war movie I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only a few things to say about this movie: 1) While I want to be generous to those with different opinions, in this case I have to say that those who carp about this movie being slow or boring are simply immature and are obviously creatures of the crappy car chase and explosion films that pass for movies these days. People, if you cannot find a film like this exciting, stay home and leave the theaters to the adults. 2) This must be the sailing ship equivalent to Das Boot; it does a perfect job of placing the viewer THERE, instead of simply sitting back and watching from a distance. The viewer gets the sense of confinement, discomfort and rough unpleasantness on board a ship like this for months at a time. You can almost feel your feet slip on bloody decks and the smell of vomit is virtually in the air. 3) My sail ship enthusiast friends tell me the movie is accurate about many lesser-known aspects of ship board life: The contingent of red-coated marines (who did the rifle work and were supposed to be first to board other ships), the young officers still in their teens (often including sons of nobility, put there to make men out of them), the majority of the non-officer crew who were taken (while drunk or in jail) onboard, only to come to their senses after the ship had sailed...and kept in line then by threat of severe punishment, the list goes on. It is the multitude of details like this that SHOULD make even the slower sections interesting for INTELLIGENT viewers. 4) The plot has clever bits of military strategy, where one party can overcome another by wits, not by explosions and incredible stunts that get script writers out of plot problems in lesser movies.</fullReview>

One cannot remain faithful to the period without showing that. The action sequences were outstanding. It makes you wonder how humanity has survived, seeing what these sailors went through. My wife hated it, but she gets frustrated at war movies as she sees the young fight and die for the older politicians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deliberately paced? Yes. Long? Yes. Very good? Absolutely!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From some of the comments posted here, it seems that we live in a time when moviegoers (many of them, anyway) demand that everything be fast-paced, and that the action be close to nonstop. If you fit that description, then you may well find this movie a disappointment. Otherwise, you are likely to find, as we did, that there is a lot about it that's admirable and worthwhile. The look of it, for one thing, is splendid, and the script is a throwback to the Horatio Hornblower/Captain Blood epics of old. There's no pretense of this being a film that tries to show the opposing sides fairly; this is about the days when Britain ruled the waves--period. Russell Crowe is superb and projects an easy authority and heroic strength, and the rest of the cast is fine as well. Peter Weir has done an admirable job, and the special effects are brilliant in that they don't really call attention to themselves as effects. This is one that demands a second viewing some day, and amply rewards a first viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exciting effects film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than most of Weir or Crowe's previous films, this one relies as much on effects and scenery as on the individual performances of the cast. Make no mistake, many of the performances are excellent, but this is an action/adventure film. Unlike many Hollywood action films, the action is pretty realistic, rather than simply graphic. Having seen several films and read several books set during this war, I found the story fairly formulaic, and therefore predictable. But that did not lessen my enjoyment of the film. It was a rollicking high-seas adventure that I found very exciting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read all twenty books in Patrick O'Brian's beloved series, I was both anxious to see this movie and dreading what it might do wreck the books' well-deserved reputation. I was greatly relieved by what I saw. It is a great effort to portray both the characters and the action. Good casting and acting are combined with superior effects to make the viewer believe every second of the story.It is my understanding that Russell Crowe was responsible for having "Far Side of the World" (the 10th book in the series) selected as the one to do. To avoid offending American audiences, they moved the story from 1812 to 1805 and made the French the only enemies that the British crew faced (we, of course, were fighting the British in 1812). "Master &amp; Commander" was actually the title of the first book in the series.The only character from the books that come across a little differently that what I would expect is Dr. Maturin. I envisioned more of a younger Anthony Hopkins in the part, but that's not to say that the chosen actor doesn't work just fine in the film. Dr. Maturin, besides being a surgeon and a naturalist, is also a British spy in the books. If more episodes in the "Master &amp; Commander" series are ever made, I would like to see that aspect of the Doctor portrayed.As for the lack of women in this film, I certainly don't accept that as a valid criticism. There are plenty of women in the books, but they were seldom on board ship during long voyages.My expectation is that more films about Lucky Jack Aubrey and his crew are unlikely because of high cost and lack of a massive American audience for British historical dramas of high quality. I'm just glad that we got a great effort on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kudos to Peter Weir for making a thoughtful, intelligent picture (not aimed at 13 year old boys). How easy it would have been to turn this into Braveheart/The Patriot/Gladiator - male revenge fantasies (and all the same picture with different costumes, though the first and third are worthy in their own ways). I also have read all 20 books and was relieved and pleased to see how they were honored in many small and subtle ways. The French weren't depicted as cardboard villains - the easily hissable, obvious type of bad guys. They were doing a job, just as Aubrey was; it was business, not personal, and I admire the filmmakers for sticking with that. I see some here have complained about the lack of drama. The drama is that of men living at close quarters for long periods of time. The film is an adventure, but at its heart it is a character study and a fine one. I fear it won't find the audience it deserves because it never panders to "Bruckheimer" action movie sensibilities. I hope people can get on board with that. See it and judge for yourself (by the way, read Anthony Lane's review in The New Yorker).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize that movies ultimately are for entertainment, and yet as a professor of history, and a writer as well, I do cringe through most movies set in the past, especially when they deal with military themes. In the case of "Master and Commander," however, my hat is off in a salute! Never have I seen a movie that so graphically captures the "feel" of life aboard a ship of the Napoleonic period. As for the battle sequences, I was stunned. They finally got it right! Naval artillery rounds did not explode in the 18th and early 19th centuries, they are solid shot that shattered whatever they hit. Not to offer a SPOILER here, but the first volley left me gape mouthed and darn near ducking for cover myself it was so well and accurately done. I know because I have fired live artillery rounds, solid shot and canister, from Civil War period cannons and have seen the carnage such weapons, though primitive to our eyes, can create. The entire cast and crew of "Master and Command" deserve three huzzahs for their devotion to accuracy, and also for the presentation of a rousing good tale. They show, as well, that "good history," can indeed sell and I hope it is the beginning of a trend.Dr. William R.

		<fullReview>Master and Commander is a great film. What makes it especially remarkable is that this is a big-budget Hollywood film that offers fine acting, an engrossing story, action and subtle, brilliant moments?the kind of film that Hollywood has seemed to have forgotten how to make.Russell Crowe is perfectly cast as Captain Jack Aubrey and he deserves to be considered for his fourth Academy Award nomination for his performance as the fictional 19th-century naval warrior. He is supported by a fine cast with outstanding performances by Paul Bettany and fourteen year old, Max Pirkis.I'm somewhat amazed that some people here have commented that `Master and Commander' is `boring'. Nothing could be further from the truth. I suspect these people have become so jaded by the usual trash that comes from Hollywood that they do not recognize a good film when they see it. It is rare these days that a film comes out which doesn't feature blaring music and explosions every other minute. Some people think that such things are story-telling and that is sad.Unlike many of today's films, `Master and Commander does not insult the intelligence of its viewers. Its actually has meaningful dialogue and its characters tell a story which provides a rare glimpse of a time past. But these characters are worthy of our present as they exemplify honor, duty and courage. Virtues that many in Hollywood today know nothing about.  See this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly one of the best movies of the year. Rare is it that you find a Hollywood release so true to the novels from which it was developed.Although it is a fictional account, it is very accurate in its portrayal of the time, as well as life on board a British ship of war.From what I've read of other comments, those who had cause for disent based it on relatively minor points, whether inconsequential or in keeping with a particular historical detail.If the battle scenes seemed loud and confusing, that's an accurate portrayal of how they were (and are).If there were times when the movie moved along sluggishly, that's because life onboard a ship in those days was even slower and largely more mundane, punctuated by brief moments of brutal fighting.Most of the negative comments I've read seem to reflect a lack of understanding of both the novels and historiocity behind them. On the other hand, those familiar with both, even if they haven't read the books, will immediately appreciate the attention to detail down to the smallest levels.As another commentor said, and I agree, I think those who walk away disappointed do so because they were expecting a modern car chase at sea with lots of bright flashing explosions, all moving at a rapid pace they're more accustomed towards.Without a doubt, this movie is destined to become a classic not only in its particular genre, but on its own merits, as well.Once in a while, Hollywood surprises me and gets it right. This is one of those times.</fullReview>

It was well balanced with character development, battle strategy, as well as small side stories(for instance the bad luck with the boy they likened to Jonah). One thing that impressed me a lot in this film was MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE, one thing that has been missing from most modern movies. It really played a part in learning the characters past, interests, and insight on upcoming events.

		<fullReview>Being a fan of Naval history, I rarely miss a sea epic. Most of them suck. They're usually very romanticized, full of inaccuracies with a thin story line that a serious sea fan and former Naval officer leaves with a feeling of disgust and disappointment. Not here, gang. This one is a keeper. I recall seeing the teasers and thinking how very accurate were the little bits and pieces I was seeing. Then, we get Crowe on the bargain. Crowe's hamming fits well with the role of a British Naval captain who manages to hold his crew together with his charisma and Bettany is superb as the cerebral ship's surgeon. There are some very wonderful points of this film, the point of view never strays from the ship, the distinctions of rank and differences among officers and crew are clear, and the representations of the ship and battle scenes are remarkably researched and reproduced. The only other sea epic I can recall that even comes close is Damn the Defiant. If you haven't seen this film yet, do so immediately. It's a keeper!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sails away from the majority of mediocre films in 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World has a very rich look on the screen. The reported $135 million budget shows as you watch the 138 minute Peter Weir feature, which makes the price of admission worth it alone. However, not only does this film have a very artistic aura surrounding it from beginning to end, it also incorporates other fine aspects of technical film-making. The editing, the original musical score, the cinematography, the visual effects, and the sound effects all coupled professionally together by director Peter Weir and the strong, memorable acting performances by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. I have never read the novels written by author Patrick O' Brain, so I cannot make an assessment on the screenplay adaptation from novel to film, but I can make the judgment that the novel must of have been a very engaging one, as this film itself was exciting and gripping at the same time. Therefore, I can only make the positive assumption that both screen writers Peter Weir and John Collee followed the original source faithfully, because both writers believed that what they had read was destined to be brought to the silver screen in its original form. The opening action sequence and the final battle sequence reminded me of the classic opening and ending of Saving Private Ryan. Master and Commander resonated a very gritty and realistic feel of the life on a ship and the battles that these sailors had to endure upon in the heat of an attack. There are some slow points in the film, however they are essential nonetheless (The Galapagos Island scenes felt out of place but when they ended, they made sense and it just took some time to get there). This film is not simply about one small ship chasing another bigger ship across the globe, but rather about discovering the mysteries of the new world that was awaiting to be discovered and about friendship that was to be trusted and leadership that was to be earned during a desperate era of war between two powerful nations. So it was necessary to spend time within the film to explore these themes. By learning the trial and tribulations that these men had to bare through, we start to care more about their hunt for the French ship. I enjoyed this picture a lot as it sails away from the majority of the mediocre movies that plagued the sea of theaters in 2003. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film I realized 2 things:1) With the exception of a couple of Brazilian natives, there are NO women in this film.2) Russell Crowe is so riveting on screen that I would probably buy a ticket to watch him do laundry.Though the overwhelming action sequences are sometimes so loud that I couldn't understand a word being said on screen, I still found it to be an enjoyable and watchable flick. That I couldn't hear what was being said was sometimes of no moment. This is not a film that spends a lot of time explaining itself. There was enough inexplicable nautical terminology tossed about that eventually gave up trying to understand what the hell they were talking about and went on faith that I would be able to figure out the pertinent details of the story.The story was not a particularly strong one, but the movie was well executed. Both Crowe and Paul Bettany did excellent jobs, although there were a few moments when I wanted to smack Bettany's rather effete doctor around and tell him to catch a clue...We're at war and you want to stop to check out the scenery? Still, he makes a good on screen "conscience" for Crowe and his behavior sets the stage for the moments when we get to see a more human side of Crowe's character.When I left the theatre I didn't feel as though I'd wasted my $8.00...and that's something in this day and age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not read an O'Brian in a couple of years, I hadn't anticipated the lovely buzz of recognition watching MASTER AND COMMANDER afforded. The theater was mostly empty, so I presume this will be the only Aubrey/Maturin episode we will see onscreen. But this one is a fitting bookend to the majestic series-- a stand-in for the final-episode I have presumed O'Brian left his executors to publish posthumously (presumably, one in which Aubrey and probably Maturin go down with one ship or another). Weir and company didn't get in the humor of the books (film-goers won't know how fitting was one O'Brian fan's online confession that his dream-Aubrey was Bill Clinton). They couldn't shoehorn-in Maturin's espionage or the other sides of his fascinating, impossible book-being. And those watching the film won't know the aesthetic of O'Brian's relegating battle-scenes to secondary importance (he even vaults-over a few, stunningly). They will see his archival relish, his fascination with hierarchy and order maintained under claustrophobic conditions, and his curator's interest in absolutely every aspect of naval subsistence. In a couple of respects, the film even improves on the books: the line of streamlined eloquence Weir affords Jack may conventionalize his appeal to his men, but it stood-in for the charisma of Aubrey's reputation, amassed over so many volumes (Crowe understates artfully); the film manifests tangy mortal presences for the ensemble of sailors who, in the books, flicker by as names-only. In fact, Weir's only error seemed to me the inflation of Hallam's collapse into a set-piece of cued poignancy, a narrative stutter. Spectacular film-making-- I am sure Spielberg, Scorsese and P. Jackson appreciate the ingenuity and clarity of what Weir managed. Jack Aubrey would know what to do with the churls who have recorded indifferent comments in this register.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I implore you to give this film a fair chance if you are smart. I went into the theater with high hopes, being a Russell Crowe faithful follower. This is a big different from what I have seen of director- Peter Weir. Of his filmography, I have seen early Mel Gibson in Gallipoli, early Harrison Ford in Witness, the always go-to Dead Poets' Society, the though provoking and Oscar begging Truman Show, and now Master and Commander. From what I have seen, this is a very different feel from Mr. Weir. The film was not as epic as I expected, but the storyline was well written and easily held my interest. I've heard talk of Russell Crowe and best actor, which would be an amazing three nominations under his belt. It was nice to see another performance from Russell Crowe's buddy, Paul Bettany, non-existent roommate to a beautiful mind. His performance grips you at quite painful times, in which you really feel his character's pain.Filmed on the same waters as Titanic, I must say that this film is much more deserving of academy recognition. I don't know if I can quite say best picture, but I hope to see a not to Mr. Crowe, soon-to-be-new-father. I would love to see a best picture nomination, but it seems my vote will probably be going to Return of the King. By the way, to any LOTR fans, Billy Boyd's performance was quite enjoyable.</fullReview>

As a naval commander myself, even now in the days of steel ships one recognizes the traditions that the (Canadian) navy keeps alive in the wardroom (officer's mess), the gunroom (the home of the midshipmen) and in the hand's mess.The battle scenes are as authentic as Patrick OBrien made them, without the lamentable urge to explode things in blazes of flame.And as a professional string player, I recognize the intimate scenes with instruments do reflect OBrien's vision of dimensions of Aubrey and Maturin's characters well.

		<shortDescription>Not just a movie, but much more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an actor and screenwriter who loves all kinds of films, but has an admitted bias toward seafaring themes. For more than four decades I've studied ships, shipbuilding, and war at sea, especially during the Napoleonic era when wooden sailing warships achieved perfection (after beating the Little General, the British Empire was secure for a hundred years). This film is not just a masterpiece of its genre, but a time machine that takes you there in fact.Every moment of Master and Commander is informed with feeling and thought that is so true to real life that it sets a new standard for the art of movie making. The technical facets, such as the ship and its crew during a storm at sea, have never been seen with such realism before.I've read 13 of the 18 O'Brien books, and was prepared to be a bit disappointed, but I find myself unable to find any flaw, or think of anything that could have been added within the boundaries of the film's two hours.Ratings: casting and acting = 10 of 10. story, script = 10. sets, costumes, tech., set design = 10. music, overall look and feeling = 10. direction = 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** Mild Spoilers Maybe *****Usually, I don't like Peter Weir movies that much. But this time I was pleasantly surprised. I hope many people either don't watch the trailer for this movie or don't let themselves be influenced by it. The trailer doesn't give any spoilers but it gives a different impression of the movie. This movie is a great epic with heroic, yet very human (and humane) and attractive men of all ages. There is no cheesy, distracting love story, but there's a lot of display of emotion. I'd recommend this movie to men who silently dream of sailing away and exploring things, and to women who want more substance in dialog and more interesting male characters than the usual "chick" movies have. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Weir almost perfectly captures life on a frigate in the early 19th century; he has an astonishing eye for accurate details. The story has echoes of Moby Dick; and the game of cat and mouse with the French ship draws you in. Leavened with just the right amount of humor and with far less pandering to mushy sentiments that one would expect from a major Hollywood product - this one kept me engrossed from the start.</fullReview>

It had an attempt at a climax, but it just totally failed to work. Somehow I just never got to care about any of the characters so I couldn't get involved, and the story just ... dragged.

A truly great film with balanced and true to life characters, plenty of action and a cultural truism not found in other films. This movie should have received better promotion. I wish Hollywood would make more films from the Patrick O'Brien novels about these characters, with the same actors and director.

		<fullReview>Nearly all of the film takes place aboard the HMS Surprise, under the command of Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe). The captain's orders: to intercept and disable the French privateer Acheron, which is troubling British vessels off the coast of South America. The two ships clash early on, and the Surprise is thoroughly routed--the Acheron is larger, faster, and more modern. But Aubrey, with a determination that might not entirely be due to his sense of duty, is not one to give up, and the Surprise chases the Acheron--and/or vice versa--down the Brazilian coast, around Cape Horn, and to the Gallapagos Islands.That's the action part. The intimate part involves Aubrey's relationship with the ship's surgeon, Stephan Marutin (Paul Bettany). Stephan is a quiet intellectual and devout naturallist, whose train of thought is foraying into the territory that would make Darwin a household name later in the century. He's also the only one among the crew who's either willing or able to call Aubrey's decisions into question. He provides a grounding force for the captain, and the friendship between these two dissimilar men is the emotional heart of the story.I've yet to read any of the Patrick O'Brian series upon which "Master and Commander" is based, but the movie shows every evidence of being derived from a painstakingly and meticulously detailed work, one which has gone to great lengths to re-create the world and environment of these men. The details on screen are wonderful, depicting the sort of harsh conditions that make the contestants on those "reality" series look like the overglorified wimps they are. The crew of the Surprise (many of them not older than twenty) lives in claustrophobic and none-too-clean quarters--at times it seems as if every inch of the screen is crammed full--and sleep in hammocks that may very well end up serving as their shrouds. Battles are chaotic, with cannon fire ripping huge holes in the ship and sending shrapnel in every direction. The weather seems to exist only in extremes: still heat, raging tempests, even snow as they drift down near the Antarctic circle. Good service is rewarded with extra rations of grog and brandy, insubordination is punished by the whip. It's a place where both close friendships and deep resentments can grow, and the tension in the air at times feels like a living presence.Crowe dominates the production, once again proving himself one of the best leading men working in movies. In his hands, Jack Aubrey is a natural leader of men: clever, courageous, determined, and capable of what nowadays is called "thinking outside the box." He is frequently confronted with difficult choices, but takes his responsibilities and the consequences of his actions unflinchingly. Bettany turns in an equally good performance as Aubrey's emotional and ideological opposite; the two men play wonderfully off of each other. Most of the rest of the crew tends to blur together (the exceptions include a young officer who's right arm gets amputated early on, and later takes command of the ship), but "Lord of the Rings" fans will be amused to notice Billy Boyd among the ranks.The combination of action and introspection in "Master and Commander" at times seems like an odd mix, but the film succeeds on both levels. Definitely a voyage worth taking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I make no comment about the book/s from which this film was adapted, I only comment on the movie.And it is excellent. It is an exciting adventure in the traditional style, but it is also thoughtful, intelligent, full of well-drawn characters and historical detail, and nerve-janglingly authentic in the battle sequences.It is difficult to tell where physical reality leaves off and CGI driven spectacle starts - and that is how it should be with CGI.There is not a great deal of exotic scenery (although some Galapagos sequences have made my mind up not to move there), but there are some spectacular seascapes.And there are some excellent performances in a story which is, surprisingly, as emotional as it is exciting. Crowe is surprisingly low key, although he anchors the film well (excuse the nautical metaphor!), but Paul Bettany's ship's surgeon is its emotional heart.Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good lord..... can Peter Weir ever direct!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredible. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen and it was a great experience that I'll always treasure. Unfortunately, it was released at the same time as Return of the King and inevitably that film stole the limelight and steered the critics attention away somewhat. As an adaptation - this film is brilliant. You might be forgiven for thinking that, this being a period epic, there will be lots of talking and little action. On the contrary. Weir throws the viewer straight into the deep end with an early confrontation between the Surprise and the Acheron. The wide shots are simply incredible to behold - an early one of both ships firing broadsides just looks amazing. Crowe is in top form here as the proud Captain Jack Aubrey - a man who is in danger of letting his pursuit of the French Man O War Acheron become an intensely personal vendetta and steering his crew through ever perilous waters. Paul Bettany is his intellectual foil as the Irish doctor Stephen Maturin - a great role for Bettany and the chemistry between the two is palpable. The music and script are great and the casting is just top notch; the scenes of the Officer's eating in the great cabin are some of the most memorable ones in the film. As others have mentioned, the attention that Weir has given to period correct detail is amazing. The film is a piece of art as much as it is a boys own naval adventure.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only good action, but good history; plus outstanding novel adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander is one of my favorite action movies set in real history. The characters and plot of the movie borrow from Patrick O'Brian's famous series with a real attention to the spirit of his writing. O'Brian is well known for his attention to detail and his ease in creating a fictional world so believable and real, it is almost like stepping into a time machine. I believe Master and Commander is one of the few movies in which I can honestly say IS as good as the book, and I am an avid fan of Patrick O'Brian.Aubrey and Maturin are presented in all there literary appeal (although a small chunk of Maturin's character is missing in the person of his espionage capabilities). Aubrey is the practical, patriotic British leader, who relies on discipline, smarts, and tenacity to win his battles. And Maturin is his counterpart, the intellectual idealist who understands the costs of war from the vantage point of a surgeon below the decks. The two's differences often lead to clashes, but are easily reconciled by the two's friendship and love of music.It is also refreshing to see a movie which doesn't rely on the spectacular for its dramatic moments, but instead the subtle yet important shifts in the plot - which is closer to real life. The movie doesn't have any dominant female roles, nor does it need it. The British Man of war is a male paradigm, a ship run by men with really no place for women until it nears shore. Indeed, it seems HMS Surprise seems to be the only real female role in the movie; a character as enduring to Aubrey as his own wife. But a character with her own personality quirks, faults, and strengths.The only complaint I have of the movie is purely as an O'Brian fan: the Barrett Bonden character isn't quite right. I probably wouldn't mention it except that all the other minor characters flawlessly match their character descriptions in the books - Pullings, Mowett, Killick (Man I love that guy), Allen,Howard, Calamy are all instantly recognizable to the point that those who've read the books need not even be told their names to recognize them. But Bonden's wrong, I'm sorry but he just is...its just a little distracting to me, so I thought I'd mention it. It really doesn't affect the quality of the movie in the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't miss the "Making Of" for this film if you have or rent the two-disk DVD set. They bought one ship and made a second one from scratch to make this movie! Weir the director stated his intent to make the movie achieve the above Summarized goal. For my money he succeeded. Ten out of Ten for this one. The use of early music played by the Captain and the Doctor to bring in the civilized nature of both men was brilliant, and Mr Crowe studied the violin enough to be able to accurately act the playing, and the above clips include some of his actual playing. He had never touched the instrument before, likewise his co-star on the cello. There are only a few movies in this category, perhaps A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS is comparable, and I viewed it twice on successive nights. It has so much truly authentic detail and depth of action that it could be profitably viewed monthly for a year. UNMISSABLE. And I had never heard of it before late 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Master and Commander Is both Masterful and Commanding: A Near-Perfect Combination of Action and Drama in a Period Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about a well-done film that is often taken for granted. You sit in your seat and allow the film to take you away and for approximately 2 hours, you are taken to another world, to a group of people you don't know, to places you have never been, and into situations you could scarcely imagine. And for these two hours, you are enveloped in this world, forgetting for a moment that you are not really there, only experiencing illusory images on a screen. Good movies do this to you. But it all depends upon an outstanding script, convincing actors, realistic sets, and superb direction. If any of these pieces are weak, the cinematic experience is compromised. Luckily, Master and Commander has all of the elements in spades. Instead of watching a movie, you feel you have boarded a military naval vessel at the very beginning of the 19th century. Your ship is loyal to England. And your commander is Jack Aubrey, played with stunning realism by Russell Crowe.Based on the novel by Patrick O'Brian, Master and Commander begins right in the middle of the action. It is as if the viewer suddenly woke up on a late 18th-century naval vessel amidst the conflict between Britain and Napoleon Bonaparte. You see the workings of the crew, their tasks, and their relationships. You see the hierarchical structure, from lowly ship hand to the officers and the captain. And, most stunningly of all, you experience being out on the wide open seas just south of the Caribbean islands along the eastern coast of South America.You mostly get to know the HMS Surprise's captain, Jack Aubrey (Crowe), and his struggles between his duty to and orders from the Crown of England and his love and responsibility for his crew. He must manage these interests while trying to capture the fastest ship known to the world in service to Napoleon Bonaparte. And of course, he can't allow the French to defeat him in combat, and he can't lose his ship at the hands of the French, other foes, or the destructive power of the sea. Aubrey is like the juggler at the circus, his hands juggling his men and orders, while his ship is balanced on his nose.The film begins in 1805 with the HMS Surprise and its crew sprinting down the coast of South America. They are in hot pursuit of the French's prize possession, the Acheron, which can out-gun and outrun the English ship. Fighting erupts, momentarily crippling the Surprise. The officers suggest finding a port, but Aubrey does not want to lose sight of his prey. The story becomes episodic as it chronicles the conflict between these two titan vessels. Softening the stern objective sensibility of Aubrey is a naturalist-doctor, Stephen Maturin, who serves as both the ship's surgeon and an enlightenment-style scientist who wants to study biology off the coast of the Galapagos Islands. But not even science can stand in the way of war and military conflict. Or might it be his ally?As usual, Crowe's performance is outstanding as he finds that subtle area where he is a compassionate and yet hard-nosed commander with a touch of wit and humor. Maybe slightly ideal, but we tend to run with it. Peter Weir's direction is masterful in the sense that he purposefully avoids drawing attention to itself. His goal is to give you this story without breaking new ground in cinematic technique which could distract from the unfolding of the epic drama. He wants to tell you a story on the high seas, not comment on the skill of "directing". And that is the mark of a truly great director.The relationship between the script, the actors, the setting and the director appears seamless. The action and the drama both coincide in such a way as to be believable without it getting too sentimental. Everything is seen from point of view of the ship mates, which keeps the viewer honed in on a particular point of view which appears to be by design. The story wants the viewer to take on the hopes and dreams, the prejudices, the hates and the fears of the crew. Whether or not it is moral or immoral to play war with the French is not the point. Rather, the filmmakers want you to understand the conflict from the English perspective. This is the kind of film-making that succeeds upon just about every conceivable level. I think Crowe makes an excellent Captain Aubrey, and would like him to recapitulate the role and make further O'Brian stories. A high-mark of pure cinematic entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, lovingly crafted film is a visual and audio treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Master and Commander" was well worthy of its 10 Academy Award nominations. It is rare these days to come across a film that is this intelligently scripted and directed. It is wonderfully subtle, sensitive and powerfully moving at times, occasionally humorous, and yet tense and gripping at other times. The attention to visual and audio detail is incredibly rich and makes owning on DVD well worthwhile. Every time I have watched this I have discovered new details previously unnoticed.I saw this film before I had read any of the Patrick O'Brian books upon which it is based, and I have to give Peter Weir and his crew even more credit after having become familiar with the novels. While the film borrows snippets from several of the books, and is only loosely based on "The Far Side of the World", I am extremely impressed with and appreciative of the attention that was paid to the characters' personas and relationships to each other. This film was obviously put together by people who greatly admired and respected O'Brian's creations.Some naysayers here have accused this film of lacking plot, and I have to wonder if they understand what the word means. In addition to the main plot involving the tense and fascinating cat-and-mouse chase between the Surprise and the French privateer, there are various sub-plots involving the relationships between Captain Aubrey and Doctor Maturin as well as the other officers, midshipmen, and rest of the crew. There is something gripping going on in almost every scene, providing plenty of pace to the film.The acting is excellent and the always charismatic Russell Crowe makes a perfect Aubrey in my opinion. The Maturin of the novels is a bit darker character than what is presented in the film, but Paul Bettany does such a wonderful job with the role that that is not even worth a criticism.An excellent soundtrack employing lush, classical music adds to the enjoyment of the film.My only regret is that they don't make nearly enough films of this kind any more...one of my top favorites in our DVD library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolute best of it's genre, bar none.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy some reality in your swashbucklers you will be somewhat astounded. They have never made one any better. If what you want is a cartoon and a good laugh try Pirates of the Caribbean. While it has nothing at all to do with reality 'Pirates' is still plenty of fun.This one is a movie best suited to those who understand something of sailing and/or naval tradition but it is also of interest to those who want more from a character than just blood and more from a movie than just an endless and mindless series of fight scenes. While there is brutality in the movie, much of it is implied, with very little of the explicit gore that is used to draw in the mindless masses. Most of the sickening reality is kept just off screen. You get the idea, and that's what's really important, with just enough 'blood and guts' so you are aware of it.There are no real weak spots in this film. There are plenty of strengths. Sound is amazing. Acting is superb, although it's not a movie that lends itself to an acting Oscar. Like a ship that requires all the crew to 'pull together as one' the movie takes an almost ensemble approach with a host of character actors each contributing to the complete picture.It's very realistic in it's portrayal of life at sea and the interaction between crew members, including the need for discipline and mutual respect, the necessary pecking orders that must be maintained, and the brutal realities. Each of these people, regardless of rank, cannot survive without the knowledge and teamwork of their fellow crew members, from the lowliest on up. If you've ever been aboard 'HMS Rose' or USS Constitution, as I have, you have basically been aboard HMS Surprise and the French privateer Acheron. Acheron is based on the USS Constitution class of 'super frigates' and HMS Surprise, while somewhat based on the historical HMS Surprise, is actually "HMS" Rose; a replica British Frigate you will find at most tall ship events throughout the world.My only complaint with this picture is the ending. A sequel is implied, which would justify the ending as it is. Without a sequel it just doesn't have the necessary finish.One more thing...and this is very important at this time. You can view this movie many, many times with nearly the same level of enjoyment. In a time when people are trying to build libraries of movies and getting stuck with too many movies that just don't have any legs beyond the first viewing this is one for the library. If you like it once you will like it again and again. That can't be said of most movies.See this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Aubrey is skillfully brought to the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (TFSOFW), is based on the novel The Far Side of the World by Patrck O'Brian and here I must stress the word 'based'. Essentially this film takes the fully developed characters from O'Brian's later Aubrey-Maturin novels and parachutes them into a story that loosely resemebles the plot of the book TFSOTW - this suggests that it is characters that the director, Peter Weir, is interested in and as such we can hope to see a faithful representation of Jack Aubrey's, Steven Maturin's and the rest of the book's major characters up on the screen - Weir does not disappoint either and nor do the actors especially those in the lead roles.The film takes place in 1805 and opens with Jack Aubrey's ship HMS Surprise being surprised (get it?) by the French ship Acheron - whom Jack was ordered to sink, burn or take a-prize - crippled the Surprise takes refuge in a fog bank. The crew expect this to be it for their mission. Jack though knows he cannot allow the Acheron attack British whalers and bring the war to South American waters, he orders the crew to refit the Surprise at sea after which he continues to pursue the Acheron south towards Cape Horn. However the Acheron once again gets the better of the Surprise and obtains the 'Weather Gage' (a term used to describe who has control of the engagement), at night and through the use of a decoy Jack is able to turn the tables and gain the Weather Gage himself. After the mizzen mast is damaged rounding the Horn crew members begin to believe that the 'devil' is at work and that Jack Aubrey is no longer 'Lucky Jack' because of this their aminosity is turned toward Midshipman Hollom who, unable to cope, commits suicide. After rounding the Horn the Captain of the Marines accidentally shoots Dr Maturin, forcing Jack to put ashore at the Gallapagos Islands so that the bullet can be removed from Steven. Whilst touring island on his recovery Steven sights the Acheron he informs Jack who sets off disguised as a whaler to confront the Acheron and end the French threat in the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans.In my opinion Russel Crowe puts in his career best performance as Captain Jack Aubrey and it is a credit to Crowe that after seeing this film I could not imagine anyone else in the role, a similar complement can be bestowed on Paul Bettany although to a slightly lesser degree. I think that Crowe and Bettany along with Peter Weir have brought Jack Aubrey and Steven Maturin to the screen with a level of perfection that has been seen only a few times before. Both have the right look, the right accent and most importantly the right attitude.Character wise TFSOFW is perfect. However it does wall down a little as the story is not as strong as it could have been. In my opinion it should have been based perhaps on The Mauritous Command where Aubrey is in command of a squadron of frigates and has to deal with not only the French but also the other captains in his squadron something which I feel would have given the story a lot more depth whilst the capture of the Mauritous, La Reunion and Ile de Bourbon would have given something more tangible for the audience at the end.That though is only a minor complaint. It should be noted that Peter Weir brought the fragility of a ship at sea and the intensity of an action between two ships to the screen with the same brilliance of Patrick O'Brian in the novels. I think that this is why Peter Weir chose to adapt TFSOTW as adapting a more expansive book like The Mauritous Command might have led to a need to use CGI extensively which may have taken away from the incredibly authentic feel of the film which is perhaps what, along with the characterisation, Peter Weir wanted to portray the most.With a more involving story I might have given TFSOTW 10/10 and who knows, it might even have one best picture. (I hope Peter Weir wins best director soon too as he's made better and more innovative films than Scorsese yet he still hasn't been honoured at the Oscars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely adore this movie. Like the first reviewer, I am a woman in her late 20s. I read all the Horatio Hornblower books, and I love stories of the King's Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. There may be a few inconsistencies here and there, but hey, we're all human. Needless to say, I was quite impressed. The movie is touching, tough, and lyrical. The music is exquisite -- I have purchased the soundtrack, and the casting brilliant. I have now been through two of the Aubrey-Maturin novels, after seeing the movie, and I don't see what people found so disturbing about Russell Crowe's casting as Jack Aubrey. Though Aubrey is younger in the books, Crowe played him magnificently. And I love Paul Bettany; always have, since his Chaucer days. He does the character of Maturin a great service. As I have read these books, I've found that the screenwriters took good care to include some dialog from the books word-for-word. I like that in a movie made from a book -- or more than one, in this case. I can't wait to read the rest of the books and compare them to one of my favorite movies, one I've watched so many times, I can "watch" it with my eyes closed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to rank as one of my all time favourite films,it is flawless, from the period detail to the uniformly good acting,an intelligent and well paced story is played out by characters who are all totally believable,Russell Crowe is excellent as Capt Jack Aubrey,resolute and stern but with flashes of humour and self doubt that make him all the more interesting and he is superbly supported by Paul Bettany"s Dr Maturin,something of a libertarian and more tolerant of the men"s grumbles than the Capt, he is the Capt"s conscience,the friendship between the two is nicely played,the scene where Capt Aubrey looks mutely at the Doctors cello after the Doctor has been shot speaks volumes about the depth of friendship between the two men,as does the scenes of the Capt and his officers getting drunk at dinner,you can totally believe that this is a crew that has been bonded together by many hardships.The everyday aspects of life on board a man of war are also well shown,the crowded conditions and hard work of keeping a ship running,not to mention the risk of death,the scene where they are forced to cut the ropes of a storm broken mast that is about to capsize the ship but in doing so must abandon one of the crew who went overboard when the mast broke is very affecting,you can feel Capt Aubreys sadness and sense of responsibility as the doomed man is left to his fate.The battle scenes are very good and well convey the frantic and fierce action that must have been characteristic of this type of warfare,the noise and smoke of the cannon fire,the lethal shrapnel of flying wooden splinters and musket balls,followed by the bloody mayhem of hand to hand fighting. Master and Commander is a truly excellent film for anybody interested in that period in history but even if you are not you wont be sorry you watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best high sea adventure movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not decide if this is the most exciting history documentary of life at sea in the mid 18th cent. ever made or a swashbuckling yarn. The props are that authentic,and to a pretty good degree the treatment and duties of the crew portrayed in this movie.Russell Crowe is perfect in this movie in the roll of Captain "lucky" Jack and the stand out in the movie, but every single actor is this movie does a amazing job.Max Pirkis, and Paul Bettany deserves mention as outstanding too.The basic story starts when Captain Jacks boat is surprised and damaged by a French warship. The chase begins for proud Captain Jack , and at any cost it would seem..Jack is torn between friendship, duty and pride when his best Friend is injured and the captain must make some morally tough decisions. Tonnes of high sea adventures ensue.Every detail of this movie is great, you must occasionally remind your self to breath at times while watching it...very very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've ever seen. If you love period drama you'll love this one. It gave a lot of insight into the often cruel world at sea that shaped our history. Breathtaking scenery. Beautiful score and a few well placed surprises I didn't see coming. There was a depth to the characters that shone through. Russell Crow, Paul Bettany and all the crew were so into their parts. The weevil joke was so unexpected and funny! One profoundly moving film. The 2 disc DVD has so much intriguing and exciting features it made the whole experience even better. If you missed this at the cinema shame on you, you missed a real treat. Well worth buying on DVD for the extras alone. I sure hope they make another one as its based on a long series of books and begs for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic piece of film-making. Authentic, exciting, well-acted, with incredible production values. Definitely one of the internationally top 300 films of all time.I have seen the last 9 Peter Weir films and all of them have not been less than impressive achievements in cinema. He proves himself with every film and this once certainly ranks amongst his best. He has shown to be one of the best "well-rounded" directors ever - no particular style or genre recognition, but a mastery of the essentials: character, story, scene, sound, and picture. In essence, flawless film-making.Master and Commander is an astoundingly well cast film. Russell Crowe as the stoic, heroic, staid, foxy Capt Lucky Jack. He fits the role like a glove and chews through the role like Brando in The Bounty or George C Scott in Patton. Chris Rock at the 2005 Oscar made a profound statement (in the form of chicanery of course) when he said that historic epics should not be cast without Crowe in the lead role. How absolutely true that is. Even though his tour-de-force performance was in Michael Mann's stylized chamber drama The Insider, Russell Crowe is on the straight path to be being forever typecast as the "gladiator-like hero". He fits that role perfectly - the role of a character that has been the favourite of movie viewers for generations - the historic hero. From Chuck Heston in Ben-Hur and El Cid to Brando in Julius Caesar to Richard Burton in Becket to Kirk Douglas in Spartacus to John Wayne in The Alamo to Ben Kingsley in Gandhi to Denzel Washington in Glory to Mel Gibson in Braveheart to Crowe in Gladiator; and so it will continue for as long as cinema exists. And at this phase, Russell Crowe seems destined to take that role to the peak, he was born to be this type of movie star. The rest of the cast is equally well-cast, with the exception of Paul Bettany as the ship's doctor, who sometimes cannot hold his own in scenes with Crowe and allows himself to be overshadowed. The smaller supporting roles of the ship's crew is also cast with actors who seemed to truly have come from a ship - weathered and grimy and full o' pee and vinegar. Of particular note is the characters of the midshipmen, the youngest of the crew. These children belong to aristocracy and are sent on the ship as part of an education experience. The young actors chosen are simply amazing. Child actors are very risky, with great potential of being the all too evil "precocious" or "cute". These kids managed to play kids, yet show amazing maturity, ability for insight, leadership and at the climax - heroism. I was quite impressed. Nothing cheezy or corny here..As far as the production goes, rarely is this much attention to detail displayed in cinema. You can almost smell the hemp of the ropes as they squeak, or feel the ship sway in the ocean. Peter Weir has given us a wonderful action filled historic aqua-epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in the theaters, I was only moderately impressed. I'm not a big fan of Russel Crowe, but he is certainly one of the best actors of our time. After seeing this movie a few more times on TV since, I've now come to really enjoy it. It's just so well done. It's a credit to the masterful Peter Weir who kicked butt on the Truman Show as well. He is an intelligent director who doesn't have to have a neatly wrapped Hollywood happy ending with his films. Master and Commander is strangely satisfying, exciting, touching, and suspenseful all at the same time. Russell Crowe really wears this role well. Paul Bettany is a fantastic actor as well, and takes on the doctor role here with skill I thought. It's definitely worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One thing bugged me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except for the trip around South America, the Surprise always kept her guns run out. This was not the normal way of sailing these ships. If ventilation was needed, only the gun ports were opened. The guns were kept inside ready to be loaded, and THEN run out. You wouldn't keep them loaded and run out all of the time.Remember that these guns used black powder and if you kept them loaded and ready to fire all of the time, the gunpowder would be so damp that they wouldn't fire when you needed them.Speaking of the guns, the ones the Surprise carried were capable of shooting through 2 feet of oak at 400 yards. If they had moved close enough, the cannon balls would not have bounced off. They finally got the chance when they were disguised as a whaler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is much to admire about Peter Weir's adaptation of the British sea voyage novels, "Master And Commander: The Far Side of the World". It's absorbing, it's breathtaking, it's intelligent, it's glorious, and it's ingeniously crafted. This is such a sensational marvel of a film production that, if it hadn't been for "The Return of the King" stealing its thunder, "Master and Commander" would have certainly won many more Oscars, and perhaps even the grand prize. My only major complaint with the film is the story: at times tedious, and includes some ingratiating details (e.g. Paul Bettany befriending a junior sailor---entirely irrelevant to the plot). This is an astonishing effort that sails both on style as well as substance. The acting is, as expected, pure dynamite, with Russell Crowe delivering yet another impeccable performance as the virtuous, vivacious "Lucky Jack" Aubrey- and plays this role with such spirit and conviction that he virtually steals the show as far as the cast is concerned. Paul Bettany plays a diffident, subdued role as Stephen Maturin, proving that he can be deftly serious and reflective to Russell Crowe's bombast and vivacity. The visuals, to say the least, are absolutely splendid- from the engaging battles of the ships, to the raging storms, to the flickering lights throughout these turmoils, one is really given a "taste of the perilous and spectacular sea" through some strikingly realistic effects. And speaking of being situated into the action, the sound effects are superb- the gunshots are vociferous and glaring, and it is often scary how terrifying these battles really are. The ship design is exquisite, and perhaps very exorbitant, displaying practically every detail one might expect to find in a British liner circa 1805. The costumes are fancy, genteel, and luxurious, and what else might one expect sailors from the Royal British Navy to be suited with? A far cry from the scrappy suits of "Pirates of the Caribbean" in that respect! I will say that my favorite scene of the film was the showdown between the Brits and the French- you are literally situated right in the center of the bloody action, and you realize that this is the ultimate pinnacle and quest of the story: what an engaging thrill! Featuring some brilliant and laudable technical design, fantastic acting, yet a somewhat slow and stagnant plot, "Master and Commander" is, above anything else, a masterpiece in modern film-making, and truly a wonder to behold. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes you have to choose between the lesser of two weevils</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World tells the story captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey. Aubrey, commander of the 28-gunfrigate HMS Surprise, has dinner with Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon and resident spook. Did I mention that in the book, which I haven't read, Maturin's a British spy? Well, he is. He's alsoAubrey's friend. They also play the cello and the violin. Thesurprise is in pursuit of a French frigate, the Acheron, which isattacking the British whaling fleet in the Pacific. The ship, in the book, The Far Side of the World, was actually an American frigate named the USS Norfolk. However, they changed the nationalitybecause they didn't want to make Americans the enemy. Thechase lasts the entire movie. In the beginning, you see theSurprise kedging, (using anchors,) to get away from the Acheron, and hide in the fog bank because her rudder was shot away. The Surprise is actually the reproduction of the BritishRevolutionary War era British frigate HMS Rose. She was up forsale in Halifax, Nova Scotia, when the studio bought her. TheAcheron herself, however, was based on the USS Constitution. Isit good? To quote Lucky Jack Aubrey, "Sometimes you have tochoose between the lesser of two weevils." I'd read the entireseries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the "battle-strewn" epic expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd seen this in the DVD store a couple of times and I'd have rented it if other titles hadn't caught my eye. Instead, I watched this via Sky's Box Office service. They'd advertised it as a "colossal, battle-strewn epic".Half way through the movie, it was apparent that the initial battle between the Surprise and the Acheron was not a taster of things to come. In fact, after the eye candy had finished, the majority of the middle of the film dwelled upon the crew of the Surprise, their characters and their relationships with the remainder of the crew.Although Sky's synopsis wasn't completely accurate, as a viewer you are injected into the situation the crew of the Surprise find themselves. However, I found myself hopelessly waiting for some action during the middle of the movie whilst all the characters are established. When a movie promises lots of ship-on-ship action, cannon shots flying left, right and centre and a good yarn, that's what I expect. What I got was a nice character- based plot between two battles that lasted over two hours.I'm not blaming Sky for some false advertising of course. The battle scenes were incredible, with some excellent sound and realistic destruction. The shame is, there should have been more than two battles.The acting was good. Russell Crowe was his usual, convincing self and carried his authority well. The film also introduced some new, fresh talent who I'm sure we'll see a lot of in the future.Pushed, I'd give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am baffled that some people found this film boring. I suppose they expected an Erroll Flynn swashbuckler with a Maureen O'Hara love interest or something because otherwise I can't fathom it (pun intended). This is a great film, in my opinion, and I was captivated from start to finish. I won't rehash the plot or the situations because those have been covered already by others.Suffice it to say I was very moved several times during this wonderful Peter Weir masterpiece. The storm at sea while rounding Cape Horn is stupendous, and the loss of the young sailor is heart-wrenching and the cinematography is awesome in the storm scenes particularly. The secondary string about Jonah is haunting, if a bit predictable. But everything in film (and life) is inevitably derivative of things that have gone before and Weir captures the pathos and tragedy of Midshipman Hollom's (the Jonah's) tragedy and ultimate heroism. Russell Crowe's acumen as an actor is well-known, he goes from strength to strength in a variety of parts. I wish he'd tackle Shakespeare now, perhaps Macbeth or even Hamlet. One bugaboo of many movies is when there is some actor trying to fake playing a musical instrument. Here Crowe attempts to convince us he is an accomplished violinist. He does very well but it is the only part of his performance that is not fully convincing, but neither does it detract. Paul Bettany's cello playing is even finer, I thought he really was playing the cello. It turns out he is a guitarist which accounts for his superior fingerwork over Crowe's more ham-fisted simulation; though Crowe worked hard to learn the violin for this part and made impressive progress in a limited period of time on what is one of the most difficult musical instruments to even get a decent sound out of.Films like this, that are historically factual and so brilliantly produced in such detail, are very rare and it's churlish to sneer at it simply because it doesn't fall into the category of the obvious run of the mill Hollywood blockbuster or fringe "art" movie. And more importantly, it isn't just some mediocre adrenalin booster, though the adrenalin is boosted from time to time. Don't miss this film! The dvd set is lavishly produced and worthy of anyone's collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls far short of its goals...authentic period detail and atmosphere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always think of films like TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST and MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY as among the most satisfying of sea epics. MASTER AND COMMANDER, on the other hand, is an impressive looking film that seems to be short on story material and therein lies the difference between an engaging sea epic and a mildly interesting one.None of the faults lie in the acting. I found the cast uniformly excellent but have to admit I preferred RUSSELL CROWE much better in other recent roles than here, as the obsessed Commander. It's not a fully rounded characterization and there's nothing he can do to hide the fact that his character is never fully explained.This is the sort of film that has to be seen on the big screen to be truly engaging. It's full of atmospheric period detail as to costumes and settings and all of the naval battles are authentically gripping. But somewhere along the way, one becomes aware of too much running time and that's always a signal that the plotting just isn't strong enough to sustain two hours and twenty minutes of a viewer's time.On the other hand, it could be that with all the hype, I expected too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine this is as how an English crew in the early 1800's might really have been. I really have to congratulate the director and screenplay people for doing a superb job in recreating this fictional account of an English-French sea chase. The use of really young boys as midshipmen was realistic, since these boys were usually 13 year old and over sons of well-to-do British. The attention to detail was noticeable. Not only that, but having a clear knowledge of where the movie was leading to was refreshing. In the back of your mind you search the horizon, along with the crew of the ship, looking for that elusive ghost French frigate. It really keeps you interested. It seems that a lot of movies make the plots too interwoven and abstract. This one keeps you in suspense right up to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Commander is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It portrays life at sea during the era of the wooden warship wonderfully. There are those that have commented that the characters are not explored emotionally. Of course they weren't! Those where the days of wooden ships and iron men. On top of that they were serving in the Royal Navy, the English Royal Navy that is. Emotion was not a thing one indulged in during that time period on His Majesty's ships! I thought the movie portrayed very well the "life", it did not show the downtime, fair enough, but who wants to watch a movie about a bunch of sailors doing nothing for weeks on end? The downtime was implied, you had to look for it...Now for the things Master and Commander brought to the screen (and the public awareness about that era).The ship: beautiful! A wonderful recreation of the beautiful sailing and fighting vessels of the time. What a time that must have been when men sailed the world and every new port was a discovery mission of a kind, when they had to rely on their wits and skills to get through every day.Lucky Jack: I have only one question about Lucky Jack. Who did he p*** off to end up with a 28 gunner? In 1805 the British ships of the line (the wooden walls of England) where a little more capable than the 28 gun probably a "6 rater" that Jack commanded. At the time Vice Admiral Lord Nelson was sailing the Victory, she was a 104 gun "1st rater" and there weren't too many ships in service that were too much smaller than her.Other than that I loved Russell's character, who couldn't? Tough but fair, a man of Honor, a born leader of men, and a good Friend to his best Friend (the doctor). Someone mentioned earlier that he was the Captain Kirk of the high seas. Well did anyone else notice that Jack's best Friend was the doctor? Kinda like Kirk and McCoy... Is it any wonder that Star Trek turned out that way given the source? Gene Roddenberry was a WWII B-17 pilot. He knew a little about the relationships that men build during "trying" times. I think that the writers of Master and Commander understood this too. That is why Jack is who he is and he chooses his close Friends wisely and he holds that friendship above all else. Captain Jack is a wise, interesting, multifaceted character. Maybe a little too perfect, but there must have been men like him somewhere in the service in those days, so why weave a yarn about a lesser man? I still wonder who he p***ed off to only command a 28 gunner! ;-)The Life: Well done! The hardships of a life at sea are well documented in this movie. The grisly account of medicine 100 (or so) years before another Englishman discovered Penicillin. The bug infested food (the lesser of two weevils). The food in the sailors quarters. The mess becoming the sick bay in times of battle. The Captains cabin being assembled and disassembled depending on the situation and time of day. The age of the young Officers and the powder monkeys. All brutally but honestly truisms of the time not portrayed well in most other period pieces that have been committed to film.The Directing/Writing: Better than par... I loved the fact that you did not get to "see" the battles from the perspective of the French. That was masterfully done. You only got the perspective of the English crew and because of that you lived their lives. You had the feeling of being one of them, you felt the way that men in that situation would have felt. If they filmed both sides of the battles it would have been as if you were an observer from the "10,000 foot view" and not a member of the crew. Besides, you didn't know what was going to happen in the end. If Quentin Tarantino had written and directed this movie both ships would have gone down with all hands... ;-)As a "fan" of the era of the Royal Navy's fighting wooden ships (which covers about 400 years) I was greatly impressed with Master and Commander. It was a triumph of modern cinema to bring to life a time we can only dream and wonder about. Sure Jack was a little too perfect and some of the crew were a little too brave but that is the stuff of tall tales. Tall tales of the sea, after that film I wish I had the oppotunity to join Jack and his crew on every voyage. That is what movies are all about.Well done!Martin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a simple plot, an epic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire plot of "Master and Commander" can be summed up in a single sentence: In 1805, HMS Surprise sails from the coast of Brazil to the Galapagos Islands to do battle with the French ship Acheron. From this thin reed of a plot, Peter Weir constructs a true epic that should thrill fans of old fashioned sea-going adventures.From almost the beginning, we discover that the Acheron is a formidable foe, since it is both larger and faster than the Surprise. The Acheron is also nearly impervious to the Surprise's ordnance thanks to the modern invention of double-hulling.Also from the beginning, we are shown that the Surprise's captain "Lucky Jack" Aubrey (Russell Crowe filling the shoes of fellow Aussie Errol Flynn) is a wise and courageous commander who loves his men. He does have doubts at times, however. This is largely due to his frequent conversations with his best friend and ship's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany). Dr. Maturin believes in the primacy of scientific research over battle and feels that Jack can be something of a tyrant towards his conscripts. During their free time, the doctor and captain play music together with the captain on violin and the doctor on cello.What impressed me the most about this film is the painstaking attention to detail as far as what the ship is like, how the men are trained and even who served in the Royal Navy two hundred years ago. The men are mostly conscripted (i.e. kidnapped) by the Navy from off the streets of England. And not all of the men are men at all. Boys who have not yet reached puberty are conscripted, and are even made officers (there is a subplot involving a young boy played by Max Perkis who loses his arm in an early battle, and who commands a battalion at the end of the movie). Captain Aubrey treats the boys with fatherly affection, although he still expects no less of them than his adult crew.Another thing I liked was that, rather than relying solely on a through-composed score, bits of classical music from Bach, Handel, Mozart, and Vaughn-Williams are thrown in. In deference to the Captain's duets with the doctor, the music is nothing but violins and cellos, with no brass or percussion. And the score is such that it fits seamlessly with the classical music.I also really enjoyed the scenes of natural wonder on the Galapagos. They are so enchanting, one forgets that they have little to do with the plot.The film truly belongs to Russell Crowe. In a movie with no women, Crowe is the manliest of all men, and is the only contemporary actor who could have played the part. Every other male in Hollywood is either too old (i.e. Harrison Ford), too wimpy/sensitive (i.e. Ben Affleck) or not a good enough actor (i.e. Vin Diesel).There are a few flaws. Much of the dialog is either mumbled or drowned out by the sound effects, so it is sometimes difficult to tell what's being said. Plus, there are a few scenes too many that have nothing to do with the main plot. And aside from the captain, the doctor, and the kid who loses his arm, you don't really get to know anyone in the film as a distinct character.Altogether, however, this film is a rousing nautical adventure in the spirit of "Captain Blood", "Treasure Island", or "Mutiny on the Bounty". I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever daydreamed about going to sea or going to war. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film all about atmosphere, authenticity and emotion.In a film climate where audiences are encouraged to view film that have big twists, turns, action sequences or emotional revelation, it is testament to the quality of Master and Commander that it was a box office sucess, despite being all about the essence of being at sea.I admit that I was a sucker for this movie from the very start: my favourite filmic location is probably a boat at night (and there is quite a bit of that in 'Commander) but that was not to say I expected to love the film - I was sceptical about it, in truth.After viewing I was thoroughly convinced of the atmosphere on board a Napoleonic wars battle ship. I could believe in the actions of the well rounded characters and the brilliant performances from the charistmatic Crowe, and gifted sidekick Paul Bettany.Equally impressive was the way in which Peter Weir crafted the supporting roles of the stereotypical crew members (old sea dog, grumpy cook, true master at arms etc.) without ever being cheesy or false.The cinematography was stunning, with the action scenes cut to perfection. The fact that these scenes are at the unconventional places of beggining and end means the film may be boring to thrill seekers, but lovers of literary film will be well pleased by this; the heightened tension, and the feeling of adventure gained is perfect.The inclusion of the anthropological aspects provides the motivation for the discovery of the French and final battle; a great touch showing that coincidence in life, and the unexpected, is often mutually beneficial once selfishness is discarded - you'll understand when you watch.8/10 A class act.</fullReview>

Because of all this dialogue, one would expect some sort of great finale to complement or even make up for the rather dull talk. Most of all it is not engaging.

Russel Crowe turns out much better than feared, actually he fit quite well. The other was all quite characterless, except for the doctor who was OK, but maybe too "reasonable" for this voyage. I can easily understand his motivation for the "Darwin voyage" to the Galapagos, but he didn't go quite well as the warrior. As a pacifist, why would he enroll on a war ship? The ship was cramped and dirty, and it had a realistic atmosphere. So was the chaos during the sieges realistically shown. We get to see things exclusively from the ships viewpoint often impressively photographed. But as this is a Peter Weir I would want more in terms of inventiveness and character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For those in peril on the sea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am working my way through the Jack Aubrey/Patrick O'Brian series of historical novels and thought it would b a good idea to see the film of Master and Commander. I was a bit apprehensive about the castings and in some cases they definitely did not work. However, thinking that Russell Crowe was not right for Jack Aubrey, having seen the movie, all I can say is I can't see anyone else doing a better job. In the books, this is a man with a zest for life, courageous and maybe a bit reckless - Russell Crowe captures this very well. Still not sure about the Maturin casting because he is definitely a man who is not what he seems and that does not come across. Boden - also not quite right. However, this is a proper rendition of the period and the spirit of the books. I can only say I wish they had made more - the books do have quite a few love interests in them so this would have been good to see. Of course, it must have been expensive to film but this is what film is made for - beautiful cinematography, great set pieces, a good story and really sound acting - much better than all the action hero stuff that is out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the unwieldy title, this film is an unexpected pleasure ? an actor's film, which is a rare thing nowadays in Hollywood. It's certainly not an action film ? there are only two major sequences and they bookend the movie ? but instead it focuses on characters as they develop through action and reaction. As such it's a surprisingly mature piece of work, featuring some excellent performances from the likes in particular of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany, playing the ship's captain and doctor respectively. There's no showiness here, just strong, subtle work, and it's hard to choose who gives the best performance between the two of them because they're both great.This is an adaptation of a novel by Patrick O'Brian, which I haven't read as yet, although I believe it's a loose version of the story. Whatever the origins, it looks great, with often breathtaking shots of scenery ? the Galapagos Islands, for instance. The ships are models for the most part, yet it's impossible to tell this, as the effects are very good indeed. I really liked the strong undercurrent of humour running through the film ? such as the "lesser of two weevils" joke ? and the surprisingly touching moments of humanity, like the boy who loses an arm and yet goes on to become a hero.What happens on screen might be familiar ? there's the usual catalogue of ship-bound perils like droughts, deserted islands, wrecks, storms, cannon battles and a particularly well-handled "Jonah" ? but this is about a hundred times better than PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN which came out around the same time. It's no surprise that the latter production, a bloated Disney cartoon, was the more successful of the two and the one that went on to spawn sequels...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Performances are Great, but it lacks Excitement and Memorability,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a stellar cast. The high octane action sequences and set pieces are enjoyable, but the movies highlight is without a doubt the performances, Russell Crowe shines in the lead role as a charismatic pirate, Paul Bettany is also stellar as the crew's doctor, the scene in which he performs an operation on himself is the best part for me. As far as the story goes, it's lackluster, their really is not anything about this screenplay that showed that this was made for any reason other than making money, there's no big surprises or genuinely thrilling moments, it all, quite literally, just floats along for two hours. The film clearly relied too much on the fact that it was the beginning of a series, because it is holding back, clearly wanting to save some great moments for sequels, which never ended up happening, and not giving enough here, they really should have just focused on this movie, taking more advantage of the potential it had. While it may not have been as good as it could have, Master and Commander boasts great action and stellar acting, worth the watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix. A British captain must chase down a rival French ship. Best Performance: Russell Crowe</fullReview>

Shoddy directing combined with top notch acting gets a 7 out of 10 from this reviewer. The characters grow on you. The ones you hate you learn to love. And the ones you like you come to despise. It's not a pretty story. Kudos for philosophy. And for going against political correctness and killing off those whom the world will never miss. Kudos also for the funeral director who is droll to the max and provides some welcome and much needed comic relief, but he's not sufficient to save this badly executed drama arc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come aboard on the HMS Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Surprise has just been ordered to pursue the French privateer Acheron at any cost during the sea battles of the Napoleonic Wars. The Acheron has been preying on Britain's whaling fleet and only Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his crew can stop them. The movie is based on three novels in author Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey and Maturin series. The series based on Jack Aubrey's real life career has a total of twenty novels. Most of this story plot comes from the book, Far Side of the World. However, in the film version, the action takes during the Napoleonic wars, instead of during the War of 1812. The producers wished to avoid offending American audiences. In consequence, the fictional opponent was changed from the USS Norfolk to the French privateer frigate Acheron. I find this to be very disappointing as the film is not loyal to the source material and that the fact that having a movie about the Angelo and American conflict would be so much interesting since there isn't so many of them out there rather than another Napoleonic piece. Other than that, most of the film tries to stay true to the books. Other scenes are taken out from Patrick O'Brian novel's Desolation Island and the book, Master and Commander. Great efforts were made to reproduce the authentic look and feel of life aboard an early nineteenth century man of war by director Peter Weir. Rather than sporting computer graphic illusions, the film filmed on the reproduction of the eighteen century post ship Rose. All of the actors were given a thorough grounding in the naval life of the period in order to make their performances as authentic as possible. The characters are so well developed to the point, it makes you feel you are there with them. So realistic. The script was great in its character development and direction. The acting by Russell Crowe is outstanding. The cinematography is great as I love the shots at Galapagos with Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) studying the animals and plants on the island. The music is pretty amazing. Great work by Christopher Gordon, Richard Tognetti and Iva Davies, lead singer of the Australian band Icehouse. Safe and sound at home again. Let the waters roar, Jack! Lyrics to the sea shanty, 'Don't Forget Your Old Shipmate' is one of the best things about the film. It's just nice to hear these long forgotten sea hymns. Spanish Ladies and The British Tars which was set to tune of Bonnie Ship the Diamond is also interesting to listen. The truest depiction of life aboard an eighteen century Man O' War on film since Mutiny on the Bounty. I have to admit I was slightly disappointed about the ending. It's such an annoying cliff hanger. It's made worst to the fact that there will probably not going to be a sequel to the film, any time soon. The movie can be a bit boring to some, as it had a very slow pace to it. The movie felt like a documentary movie, rather than a good historical action movie. It didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. Having a ship chasing after a superior ship could have been an Ahab hunt of the white whale type of a story that would make the story so much interesting, but the movie is lost without a sense of depth with pointless scenes at Galapagos Island. I think most people came to this film to see two battleships duke it out. If I wanted a natural geographic special. I'd have watched Jaques Cousteau or Charles Darwin instead. It was devoid of charm, humor and anything resembling amusement. Hollywood's attempt at being cerebral was just not working for me. I give it props, it was so so, but anyone with a short attention span, this movie isn't for them. Check out, HMS Defiant, a British adventure film released in 1962 if you like these types of movies. In my opinion, that movie is better than this. Still, if you watching this, just make sure you don't fall asleep on the helm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We should know by now not to learn history from film and the truth is far more interesting. Number one, the battle took place during the War of 1812 and Aubrey is fighting the Americans. I mean can you imagine the French having such a superb ship, a technological wonder? No the super ship was actually the U.S.S. Constitution-Old Ironside. So why was the date and the enemy changed? Director Weir said that the producers worried that the American audience would feel funny about rooting for the British. Since the Americans were funding the movie, the French became the bad guy. It's interesting that Old Ironsides is still in great shape and is in Boston. By the way the reason the ship was so hard to sink is that it was made by live oak only found in the Americas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just what I expected only better - and yet somehow still the same.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd think the Master &amp; Commander part would be enough title but nope they thought more, more, more.Whether that pushed audiences away or not isn't important, I personally never bothered with this because I assumed it was merely another "we're all in the navy let's have some ship to ship battles" thing. And it is, it's a good one, but that's nonetheless what it is.We join the action in the second quarter of the battle between Napoleon and the Rest of the World, represented in this case by England ship the HMS Surprise. The Surprise is captained by one Jack Aubrey played by Rusty Crowe and has a crew of 200 give or take, some of them only kids. (And I mean kids, as in 12/13ish!) The year is 1805 and things haven't been going that well for the ROW team, Napoleon has basically been giving them a little bit of a flogging, and it is Rusty and co's job to track a French warship that is in the area and engage if possible.Course it's possible, this is a naval battle film! Can I just cut some corners here and say that tactically the French captain and Rusty seem to be on a par, each coming up with whiz bang ways of getting into or out of range, and each pulling some nifty tricks that are totally unexpected? (That saves me from having the explain each one, there are a lot.) The French ship is bigger, better defended and faster however, otherwise it wouldn't be that much of a movie, what with the big boy bullying the little boys around.After an early battle that doesn't go their way the men want to call it quits and head home to their toothless loved ones that eat terrible food, Rusty sez "No", perhaps remembering he has a bunch of kids and that scurvy is probably more tolerable, and besides sailors get regular sex... with each other. So FORWARD we go.The constant voice of reason and doubt is Paul Bettany's as the ship's doctor, he wants to rest up and take a trip to the local Galapagos Islands where he can indulge his love of animals, in the scientific sense that is, (I've already cracked the standard navy = gay jokes, seems a bit think to add beastiality). Eventually it seems that the odds are against them and some key personell are injured so Rusty calls the whole thing off.But it's never that easy.This might come off (and is) an extremely simplistic and glib review of a vast and ambitious film. In reality there is much to like about M&amp;C etc, the ships look splendid and amazing when in full sail fanging along the open ocean, the storm scenes and sea battles are incredible, I'm not sure if they used CGI or not but in any case... incredible and there is more than enough tough decision for Rusty to make to either escape or succeed, and of course they usually have negative implications too such as the death of crew.Rusty's captain is a fierce tactician and soldier, but obviously a loyal shipmate and great leader, and Paul Bettany's ship's Doc is at once a confidante and counterpoint to the captain when he fears he is a little ahead of himself.This is very much an exercise in substance over flash and meaningless FX and as such is a triumph. I myself have seen enough examples of substance though, and maybe I might change as I get older but in my eyes even a film of terrific realism and vision is still only just worth watching as far as I am concerned right now.Final Rating - 7 / 10. Just what I thought it would be, only better. And yet still the same, (somehow). Worth a look but not a crowd pleaser.</fullReview>

Only then can the unique relationship between the two men take full shape and lend insight to the generally faithful screen version.O'Brian (1914-2000) was an accomplished writer who wrote a good many other kinds of stories and books, but this series remains his chef-d'oeuvre. For those who prefer a quicker approach, there are also several audio book versions both abridged and unabridged.Do yourself a favor.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on video the other night and managed to get through it on its action merits. I can see why the film's faults occurred, but I think it could have been handled better.My main issue with the film is its choppy nature, poor characterization, and reliance on action to produce plot and pathos.We begin with no backstory, which is not a sin in itself, but then too little follows for my taste. Clearly the director is trying to bring us into the immediacy of the story and represent to us how very far from home the Surprise really is. But instead of telling a story of the few principal characters, or indulging us with loads of context, we are brought briefly (episodically, as one comment put it) into the minds of several characters. Other films have accomplished this well, particularly certain war movies or flicks that depend on characters for plot like "Magnolia" and "Happiness." However to my viewing, these episodes seemed like plot twists; I was therefore surprised when they were merely dropped, albeit dramatically. They flat-out failed to add to the plot and so do not justify however many minutes of film they took up.***SPOILER FOLLOWs***[A mild one; relationship between two characters]The most promising plot development (or so I thought) had to do with the increasing conflict between the captain and his closest confidant--there is a moral and ethical battle, of the Moby Dick variety, that begins between the captain and the doctor but then goes...nowhere. In the midst of all this the action seemed rather gratuitous and nearly an afterthought.If you examine the plot, it is fairly obvious and thin, and where the movie showed promise--in its characters--it either dropped the ball or did not have the time to go where it needed to go. In short, this movie didn't quite deliver as adventure or drama, and at times wanted to be a character film rather than action/adventure. The end result feels to me chopped and poorly edited/conceived.Somewhat worth renting, 5/10. Parts are too graphic for the kids, but too stultifying for adults. If it's period adventure you want with tall ships and muskets and marines and battles, you had better go see Pirates of the Caribbean (superior story and characterization, equal production value, more action). Or on land, the very-low-budget BBC productions of the "Sharpe's" series. Or just read the books, and get all the characters and all the action, I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers)Okay, the story is fictional. Was a bit easier to figure that out than The Last Samurai. I was stuck with a choice. Watch this movie at the theater or Samurai. I watched Samurai. I'm glad I did too. That one is emotionally charged. And perhaps not entirely cool to watch.Master &amp; Commander was simply a delight though. One of the best sea faring films I've since since The Bounty. (mind you I only saw The Bounty -the gibson version- a few months ago) Hopefully we'll see more of these. And I'm not talking Pirates of the Caribbean. That one is pure entertainment, without much in way of seriousness.The action begins right off the bat , and with the occational breaks. doesn't stop. If LOTR wasn't on the clock, either this movie or last samurai woulda made a decent showing. (though I think I still would have been pulling for Whale Rider)I do have 3 known complaints.Camera work. Some of the camera work is lousy. Probably from the cramped quarters in which some of the scenes were shot. My favourite error is as they are going around the table during a dinner meeting, the camera obviously bumps someone and you can actually hear the mistake. o_OThe ending. It gives the possibility of a sequel. Or does it. I know that this is part of a book series. (note the word series.... more than one)Finally. Marketing. Someone in the marketing department should be tortured, hung from the side arm and whipped. They released this bare bones edition, without a shred of special features in it. I'd seen ads of a 2 disc set with that picture on the front. So I bought it from Blockbuster. Where I found the bad news back home. 1 disc. Having seen the other cover at dvdempire I informed Blockbuster they sold me the wrong one and I wanted the 2 disc. They told me it doesn't exist. After much persistence. They said Best Buy has a 2 disc set and to buy it there. I'd say the manager was probably so confused he didn't know his limb from limb. Since the 2 disc is on the blockbuster webpage. I ended up with a 3 disc set.So imagine this.Now we have the bare bones edition in widescreen and pan/scan.And now we also have the Collectors Edition in 2 disc sets and 3 disc sets.We've got 4 different versions to watch out for.

		<shortDescription>A good tale, if not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always feel embarrassed when I review a film that was based on a popular novel or series of books. I hate to read. Even when I am at my loneliest like sitting on a stalled subway or up at a cabin that doesn't have electricity, I would rather sit back and rehash a movie I have seen in my head than pick up anything off the coffee room table.So when theatres were hit with the new Russell Crowe film, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, I knew that better more refined critics would be able to compare the film adaptation to the on-screen version. I cannot.Not that that's a bad thing mind you. One of the bigger advantages of not caring to pick up the written word is that you accept the movie as a whole and are not constantly sitting in a theatre saying to yourself, 'It wasn't like that!' or 'He would never do such a thing!' It's a small advantage, but it's all I got.Master and Commander is based on a series of novels by Partick O'Brian all surrounding (I suppose) Capt. Jack Aubrey (Crowe), head of the British ship the HMS Surprise during the Napoleonic Wars. Aubrey has a daunting task in front of him and his mates as they follow and try to engage the behemoth French vessel the Acheron. Their foe has twice the men and firepower than the Surprise, but hell, this is a story of heroes and bravery, so bring it on. In this case, size does not matter.The movie shifts seamlessly from scene to scene with crewmembers yelling out orders while playing a cat and mouse game with the Acheron that has them twice the cat and twice the mouse. This all leads to a final showdown where a brilliant idea inspired by an insect found on the Galapagos Islands, has the HMS Surprise trying to live up to its name and attack the unprepared Acheron.Released in the summer of 2003, Master and Commander went on to grab 10 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director. Whether or not these awards were founded is an argument not to be had here. However, there is no mistaking that with 10 nods (and none in the acting categories), the production values must have been top rate, and on that level it did not disappoint.There are so many elements and avenues one can take a review of M&amp;C that it is hard to know where to start. First and foremost, there is the direction of Peter Weir. A four time Best Director Oscar wannabe, he has been behind the camera and calling the shots for nine critical hits in a row. Even Speilberg can't lay claim to that feat (Hook, anyone?). From 1981's Galipolli through Witness and The Truman Show, Weir has become one of those directors where actors cancel weddings to appear in.And, with M&amp;C, Weir does not disappoint. The characters are brisk and rugged and the it doesn't take him long before he has you feeling as if you are an actual crew member on the HMS Surprise awaiting your next command. Films set on the high seas have been hit and miss over the years. For every Pirates of the Caribbean, there has been a White Squall, so the fact that Weir pulled it off so effortlessly is a testament to his abilities.Russell Crowe too, puts in another well received performance. But what is different from his roles in Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind is that the supporting cast in M&amp;C seem to steal scenes from him with regularity. Specifically, Paul Bettany, as the ships doctor and Max Pirkis as a young Midshipman who loses an arm in their first encounter with the Acheron, are both stellar in their portrayals as the ying to Crowes' yang and the young to Aubrey's old.But for all the hootin' and hollerin' fun this ship to ship battle ready movie embodies, it really took the DVD before I was able to understand everything that was going on. During the opening sequence and later during a severe storm, the ships mates are yelling to each other things that I could not conclude. Only by flipping the subtitle button did I finally understand what they were communicating.Also, in the final battle aboard the French vessel, it was cut so fast and furious, that it was hard for me to tell the two sides apart. I couldn't tell who was winning 'cept for the rousing musical score which lead me to believe the good guys were kicking ass. I am not suggesting that we should forgo history and have one side orange and one side blue, but maybe a steady cut of the sequence would have helped me with my bearings.Despite these few observations, the movie as a whole was a satisfying experience. The scenes on the Galapagos Islands (the first ever film to shoot ashore), were of great interest even though it kept us from the battle scenes we so craved. And the two ideas of Aubrey to dupe the French were inspired. In all, I have to give a thumbs up to Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. It may have had the longest title of any movie this year (move over Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines), but it didn't feel like a long sit once it got started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine piece of Ocean movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe had done LA CONFIDENTIAL before he did GLADIATOR that really kicked his career onto the top notch of Hollywood. GLADIATOR was a huge movie that captured Oscars and was simply a way too convisning, big, dramatic and epic movie to not draw itself attention, so when Russell Crowe headed for his next big movie it was a adaptation, this time; set at sea. MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is a highly exciting drama about a Captain and a crew that's having a hard time handling a aggressive ship that keeps attacking them. Director has done a fine job but I must say that the movie's finest details is; mood, music and general scenes going threw it. The movie is very fine watching, photo is beautiful and everything is very in place, although the movie did draw it's running time a bit too long at the middle of the movie, the end is so good that it is very worthy waiting on. Russell Crowe does a fine performance after he had to live up to his Maximus character. MASTER AND COMMANDER rules a lot of the time, with big ships firing canons, swords being drawn, genially made viola / bass music, fine photo, good dialog...very much of it goes very well on, another problem is; there's not much of originality or pure entertainment, so it gets a bit "dry" as the movie goes threw minute after minute. The end is fine and maybe the movie's best scene. As Crowe and his crew is done nailing the French boat Crowe starts looking for the Captain, but sadly enough he finds the Captain dead with a depressed doctor claiming the fact. Crowe tells his assistant to take the French boat and that they shall meet later. It all seems finished and Crowe and the doctor is playing music together when they get on the topic of the Captain and the doctor tells Crowe that the French doctor was already dead, so Crowe understands that he has been tricked...and that the "doctor" was the real captain. So, they turn around and heads for another fight...although this one we don't get to see... STARS: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar seems to love epics as epics have been big winners in the past and this year three of the five Best Picture nominees are epics.This is a more unique epic. Not just set in the past, not just a war story. This was a case where the seas were the battlefield. And not just ship vs. ship but also ship vs. weather and waves. This was no easy battle for England in its quest to be the leading world empire and France to try to defeat them. And part of it had to do with claiming the Galapagos Islands. And Jack Aubrey securing his place in history.Although the ship vs. ship and ship vs. weather battle scenes were the most trilling parts of the movie it wasn't always about battle. It was also about discovering an island they just recently claimed. The movie also had its more solitudinal moments as we see the new untouched land and its animals.Overall the visual effects were the movie's highlights without a doubt. In terms of the acting, Russell was good but I've seen him do better and more complex roles. The standouts in this movie I felt were Paul Bettany as the surgeon and young Max Pirkis as Blakeney. The script gave way to the action scenes more. But the direction was excellent as doing a movie of this caliber would be no easy task. In terms of music, there was very little score. More original score could've been added to it.So overall I was very impressed with the movie and would highly recommend it.</fullReview>

I loved the attention to detail ...it is obvious that the art/set designers, whomever they might be (sorry that I am too lazy to look it up) did a great amount of research. The music was superb...I always love to hear that Bach cello suite! Of the 3 oscar nominees I have seen (still need to see LOTR and Mystic River), this was my favorite. I liked Lost in Translation, but it was a bit depressing...this one was not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vivid Picture of Men at War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible SpoilersThe late Stanley Kubrick, capable of producing brilliantly original films quite different to anything else (`A Clockwork Orange' is a good example), was also capable of producing brilliant work within the confines of an established genre. Although `Spartacus' is in some ways a typical sword-and-sandal epic made at a time when such films were highly popular, it is so well done that it is possibly the best example of that particular genre, and quite equal in quality to anything in Kubrick's later work.It seems to me that Peter Weir is perhaps the nearest thing we have to a Kubrick working at present. Like Kubrick, he is selective about his projects, sometimes waiting several years between one film and the next. (`Master and Commander' is his first film since `The Truman Show' in 1998). Like Kubrick, he is determined not to become stereotyped or to repeat himself, and tries to make each film different to its predecessors. And like Kubrick he can both work within established conventions and produce work which is unconventional. `Picnic at Hanging Rock' and `The Truman Show' are both, in their different ways, strange and haunting films, different to anything before or since (and two of my favourite films of all time, as is another Weir film, `Dead Poets' Society'). `Witness', on the other hand, falls firmly within the conventions of the standard crime thriller, but is also one of the best crime thrillers ever made.`Master and Commander' is another example of Weir excelling while working within an established genre, the war film. Weir has, of course, made an earlier film about war, the anti-war `Gallipoli' set in World War One. `Master and Commander' is a different type of war film- the type that follows the fortunes of a tightly knit unit of fighting men. The unit in question can be an Army platoon or an Air Force squadron, but in this case, it is a warship in the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The British commander, Jack Aubrey, is under orders to intercept and stop a French warship, the Acheron, which is preying on British shipping, and pursues his orders with dogged determination, despite coming off second-best in an early clash with the French ship.Although this is a different type of film to `Gallipoli', the two films have one thing in common in that both have at their centre a friendship between two young men of contrasting characters. In `Master and Commander', the friendship is between Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor. Aubrey (an excellent performance from Russell Crowe) is a man of action, patriotic and with a strong sense of duty. Maturin is the contemplative, intellectual type, fascinated by science, but with little interest in the war. (He- something of a proto-Darwin- would rather spend time on his researches into the natural history of the Galapagos Islands). Despite their contrasting natures, and occasional disagreements, the two are firm friends. Some films would have exaggerated the contrasts between them, but that temptation is here resisted. It would have been easy to portray Aubrey as an uncultured philistine, but in fact he shares Maturin's love of music and joins him in playing duets. Again, there might have been a temptation to play Maturin as a cowardly weakling, but we see that he too is capable of courage and resourcefulness when he is accidentally wounded in a shooting incident and has to give instructions for an operation on himself. I have not read Patrick O'Brian's novels on which the film is based, but I have heard them referred to as the `Aubrey-Maturin' novels, which would suggest that the two characters are given equal prominence. In the film (perhaps because Russell Crowe is a stronger actor than Paul Bettany) Aubrey seems to be the figure at the centre of the action, with Maturin playing Watson to his Holmes or Robin to his Batman.The film tries to give as vivid a view of life at sea as possible, with great attention to detail. It is visually both realistic and exciting, particularly during the battle scenes. At first, I wondered if it was giving a somewhat sanitised picture of naval life, but the darker elements became visible later. We see the rigid discipline- a sailor is flogged for insubordination- and the suffering caused by war. (A young midshipman, no more than a boy, loses an arm in battle, but bears his loss with an extraordinary stoicism, which I would have thought unrealistic, were I not aware of real-life examples of young sailors behaving with comparable heroism). We also see the peculiarly superstitious nature of naval life- one officer is ostracised and driven to suicide because he has a reputation for being a `Jonah' (one who brings bad luck). Aubrey, on the other hand, although he is a firm disciplinarian, is highly popular with the crew because they regard him as lucky.In Britain, the film has mostly been seen as a patriotic adventure story. I think, however, there is more to it than that. Although I doubt if it will do well in France, I do not think that you have to be British to appreciate the film. Like many films of this type, the audience's identification is with the men themselves rather than with their country or their cause. The exclamation `This ship is England!' can be taken as a patriotic rallying-call, but can also be seen as reflecting the fact that many sailors (and many fighting men in general) fight as much for their comrades as for their country. This is perhaps particularly true of sailors of this period, who spent many months (or even years) away from home in the hermetic environment of the ship. The natural dangers of the sea meant that they had to rely upon each other for survival even when they were not facing the enemy. It is not therefore surprising that close bonds formed between them and that comradeship and teamwork are themes running through this film. (The element of male bonding is emphasised by the almost complete lack of female characters). This may not be a classic like some of Weir's earlier films, but it is both an exciting tale of adventure and an intelligent study of men at war. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome aboard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler For two-and-a-half hours you live on aboard HMS Surprise, eat, sleep and breathe with the crew, and finally feel like becoming one of them. And this is a surprisingly easy ride, particularly when compared with earlier films of sea battles such as Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 and 1962 versions) and Billy Budd (1962), to which I'll come back. The lightness (in no way to be taken as a negative comment) of this film comes mainly from the almost lyrical style of the direction.The movie opens with exciting action of an ambush by the French phantom war ship Acheron. Sitting in the new IFC Palace cinema, I feel vibrations at the back of my chair as cannons roar on screen. Yet, for some reason, the actions never feel brutal. Maybe the winning smile of Captain `Lucky' Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) helps, as he confidently orders the rowboats to tow HMS Surprise into the fog, thereby escaping annihilation. The mood then turns light, as Aubrey and ship's doctor and good friend Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) relax in a beautiful duet of violin and cello. The divine music takes us through to the completion of the repair of the ship, as well as serves as interludes bridging many subsequent scenes.While there are casualties, we are generally spared the trip through the gruesome carnage. One particular event, however, needs to be covered. This is the amputation of a broken arm of 13-year-old midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis) who, in the end of the movie, waving a pistol with his remaining hand and shouting in his still boy-soprano voices, leads a group of rough sailors in a daring charge to the enemy ship. Even the most serious of the injuries turned into an almost comical relief with the doctor opening up the skull of the wounded, to a full house (or ship) of audience who try to inch forward to get a better glimpse of the guy's brain.One big factor that makes this voyage so enjoyable is the character of the Captain who, combining authority with humanity, feels almost like a successful CEO of today. This starts with his affable sense of humour, as he cracks this terribly punny (not a typo) joke of `the lesser of two weevils', in which he himself is totally immersed. We are then treated to the breathtaking beauty of a tropical paradise. With buzzeling native trading boats surrounding our ship, the feeling is almost akin to that of a Caribbean cruise in a modern liner.Let me not get too carried away with this rosy aspect. The enemy phantom ship is always lurking in the background, and there are undercurrents of conflicts on board. Good friends as they are, when the passion of the Doctor as a naturalist gets the better of him, the Captain has to put his foot down as the mission of the voyage is to track down and destroy the enemy ship rather than collect specimen of tropical insects and plants. Then, a case of insubordination leads to a public flogging that is reminiscent of a similar, but much more serious situation in Billy Bud. Forgive me for digressing but I must recommend Billy Budd, without any reservation, as one of the best under any reckoning. Neither are the elements favourable. HMS Surprise first goes through a devastating storm, then sleek and ice and finally plunges into a stillness that is almost identical to that in The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner. However, the script does not take it as far as the ghost ship with sails like gossamer when it sails betwixt the Mariner and the sun. Instead, the crew of HMS Surprise gets away much more easily. The albatross is also featured, but under a different set of circumstances. Here, someone also tries to shoot the albatross, not with an arrow but with a bullet, and hitting instead the good doctor by mistake. This gives rise to a most fascinating scene ever presented on a movie screen: the doctor operating on himself through looking at a mirror someone is holding over his opened abdomen. Moving to the finale, the accidental spotting of the enemy ship is one hundred percent predictable. By disguising as a whaler, again predictably inspired by natural phenomenon revealed through the doctor's studies, HMS Surprise lives up to its name by getting within striking distance of the stronger enemy ship to engineer a surprise attack, and the rest is history.Master and commander has all the necessary ingredients and director Peter Weir (of Dead Poet Society), like a seasoned chef, blends them in just the right proportion and touch to deliver two-and-a-hour hours of delightful entertainment.Finally, it's a bonus to see Billy Boyd (not to be confused with Billy Budd, the movie, whom I recognised even at the very first scene, when he is half-covered with fog. Inasmuch as I absolutely detest any conversation in the cinema, I couldn't resist and, covering my mouth with my hand and leaning over to my wife, whispered in the lowest possible tone `Pippin', to which she nodded an acknowledgement. Having watched Return of the King four times and spent over 10 hours at home on the Appendix DVD on Fellowship and Two Towers, I just couldn't resist the urge. I hereby confess and beg forgiveness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best sea yarn since "Das Boot"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weir's finest work since `Gallipoli' twenty-odd years ago. The great virtue of the screenplay (for which Weir is co-credited) is to eschew open perspectives and broad canvasses (? la Mutinies on the Bounty or even the Hollyowoodian `Moby Dick') and to focus on the hermetic world of the ship and its crew. In this, the cinematic model is self-evidently Wolfgang Peterson's `Das Boot' (which appeared, like `Gallipoli' in 1981, making it a good year for lucid war movies): throw a group of boys and men more or less willingly into a closed world, put a charismatic (but not insensitive) alpha male in charge, and turn them loose to kill or be killed within the most technically demanding, unforgiving framework, where your captain's brilliance and good luck may allow you to live another day and have the thrill of sinking (or seizing) another enemy, but where the ultimate outcome must always be the same. Davie Jones rules.The film lacks the unflinching rigor of "Das Boot" - there are some ponderous (and not always intelligible) prophetical mutterings about Jonah among the crew, we make a stop in the Galapagos, there to be treated to some insipid proto-Darwinian reflections (with Bach on the soundtrack, to add gravitas), and all the rule-Britannia jingoism (and gratuitous anti-French digs: the enemy, an American privateer in O'Brian's original, becomes effete and Bonapartist just in time for the 2004 Oscars) gets to be a bit much (though it's probably authentic enough: `This ship is England!'). Weir and his fellow Aussie Russell Crowe can hardly have gone through all that without shoving their tongues well into their cheeks (or at least biting them badly): `Gallipoli' was, of course, precisely about just how mindlessly deadly such jingoism can be. Also, the substance and subtlety of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship, so central to O'Brian's fiction, somehow eludes Weir's and his actors' efforts, however sincere. But the evocation of shipboard life in the grand epoch of the Royal Navy is as convincing as you can get, and the power of that evocation carries all quibbles before it, like a warship surging ahead under full sail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe wages war on water in this rousing, old-fashioned adventure, which stays afloat despite being almost as long and self-important as its title.April, 1805. Pint-sized French fascist Napoleon is "master of Europe", but Britain is still scrapping on the high seas. The ship HMS Surprise is defending the Empire on "the far side of the world", chasing a French frigate along the coast of Brazil."CROWE DELIVERS ANOTHER FINE PERFORMANCE"But then, the tables are turned. Outmanoeuvred and outgunned, Captain Jack Aubrey (Crowe) is up against it. While his best friend, surgeon Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), wants to scarper, 'Lucky' Jack is determined to fight on - and damn the consequences.Crowe delivers another fine performance here, mastering an English accent (and the violin) as a gruff action-man with pretensions. The movie matches his character, as it's not quite happy to be a brain-in-the-bin swashbuckler. Oh no: Master And Commander craves importance."LESS GLADIATOR, MORE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC"So, instead of zipping through the slight story (chase ship: capture it), director/co-writer Peter Weir (The Truman Show) is bogged down by a 'character-building' stopover in the Galapagos Islands. It's less Gladiator, more National Geographic, as Maturin mooches around oohing over nature like a good-looking Charles Darwin.Sandwiching this snooze, though, is some great aquatic action. Filmed in the same giant tank as Titanic, the sea-set sequences are utterly convincing; both exciting and spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nail-biting, intelligent and suspenseful sea adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD (2003)THE GOOD:--Taking place almost entirely on a ship and with an all-male cast (save for a small appearance by a few ladies offering food to the ship members) this movie didn't seem to have much promise for me. It surpassed my expectations by far, I was fully invested in the picture and never found it boring or unappealing. I felt like I knew the ship really well (director Peter Weir spends a good amount of time familiarising it with the audience) and the characters relationships were --Russell Crowe gives a fierce, believable performance and was perfectly cast. Though I have to admit that the film really belongs to Paul Bettany. His beautiful and sympathetic performance was something to treasure and very much worthy of an Oscar nomination. The child actors in the film also show a lot of promise, especially the blonde boy who was impressive in his part (sorry, can't remember the character's name and the actor is an unknown).--The action sequences in this film are extremely impressive, though they aren't there just to be great big awesome action sequences. All of them serve the story; all of them are intense, bloody, realistic and extremely involving. This isn't like the action blockbuster "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" where the action is there to be enjoyable and fun, in "Master and Commander" it's about delivering to the audience something realistic and showing us the true horror of sea battles.--The friendship between Crowe and Bettany is extremely well developed. Their chemistry is right on, and I loved the parallel of the sea captain obsessed with winning battles and the quiet-spoken, intelligent best friend concerned about the action's his captain and friend are taking.--The score is divine, I loved the beautiful violin/cello pieces. Did Crowe and Bettany really performance those?--This film has terrific cinematography. The swooping shots of the sea and of the two ships were breathtaking, and the chaotic filming of the action sequences made the atmosphere so much more present during those crucial parts of the film.THE BAD:--Some of the secondary characters were quite underdeveloped and there to just hang around. I was also very frustrated at times when I knew the performances from some of them were terrific, but the film never bloody explained their names. Perhaps the cast was just too large and I wasn't familiar enough with some of the characters, which in itself was quite annoying.RATING:9/10 - A nail-biting, intelligent and suspenseful action/adventure with developed characters and an involving plot. What more do you want?IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Gladiator (9/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (9/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (10/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (10/10) Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Solid Adventure Movie (Possible Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany play the Ship's Captain and the Ship's Doctor, who happen to be best friends. Moreover, both characters share a responsibility for the survival of the crew, albeit on different planes of authority. I found that the pairing worked quite well, and wonder if we'll see it again. Both did solid acting jobs, but neither role was a far stretch from previous roles - Crowe in Gladiator and Bettany in a Knight's Tale.The feel of the movie was phenomenal. I cannot recall any movie with at sea scenes remotely close to this movie, except The Perfect Storm. Combine that with the brutal combat details of the Patriot and you'll have a good feel for what war on the high seas was like. One of the major differences though is the presence of young children and teenagers, usually orphans, on ships that as often as the adults find themselves the casualties of sea warfare - this is a fact most people tend to forget.This visually masterful depiction of life at sea, showed all facets of sea-faring life. The ship itself is amazing - how it was transformed from a place to live to a place for war in a matter of minutes. How while some live stock was kept on board, much foraging still needed to occur the longer the journey, or when the ship was stuck dead in the water because their was no wind, or how they ran low on fresh water because it hadn't rained in days. Based upon what I have read, in and out of school, these were many of the realities of sailing at sea.You will find yourself drawn to all the supporting characters who's names and faces become familiar to you over the course of this movie, and be amazed at the vivid scenery that plays a backdrop to the brutality of life and war at sea. This is an awesome movie that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film though characterization might disappoint followers of the series in print.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a wonderful film with many strong aspects to it. I found the opening especially powerful. Sailing and combat scenes were all presented well. I liked the fact that many of the crew were so young. It gave the film an authentic ring, since they probably would be. Some felt the film was slow, but I felt the pacing and action were very good. My main criticism of the film, if that is what this is, is that it must be enjoyed for its own sake. It is not a faithful representation of the characters in the series. In the books Maturin, for example, is a spy, small, sly, clumsy and never fights. The crew cares for him assiduously. (This makes sense when one considers that he is your only chance for survival when the probable happens and you are wounded.). Bondin doesn't appear to be present or he is incredibly miscast. Aubrey himself is a ruddy faced blond with the soul of a pirate and a love for sailing and fighting. I like Russell Crowe's presentation, but he isn't Aubrey. I didn't have any trouble getting by these facts because I didn't have much emotion invested in the characters from the books. Someone who identifies with the characters in the books might feel betrayed and be disappointed by the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed by this film. The reviews were good and the tomatoe meter was a solid 84.I guess I just don't get it.Things start off, quite literally, with a bang that promises us a captivating seafaring adventure.Then there is a pause while the ship is repaired and we are introduced, courted by, and finally married to, a depth of authenticity that infuses this film with all the excitement of a Ken Burns documentary.And the pause continues. After a while, I realized the pause was the movie. The real problem here is that Peter Weir couldn't seem to decide what story he wanted to tell. Is it about the captain of a frigate, a simmering pacifistic naturalist and his protoge or the grain count of planks used in a frigate? The answer is: all three. What it isn't about is a sea battle. There are times when the film seems to say to us, "Oh yeah, that sea battle thing, guess we better baste that a little."Certainly lacking a sextant, compass and map, this movie just wanders around through a boring series of listless scenes occasionally punctuated by something exciting.Oh, yeah, and there is a solid 15-20 minutes of screentime devoted to the ship in the duldrums. No kidding.Wait for this one to come out on HBO. Or PBS, maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a great admirer of the Patrick O'Brian books I was in two minds about seeing this film, but I need not have worried. It doesn't attempt to follow the book, which is just as well, but the spirit is there. The visuals are stunning - I sat enthralled through the battle and storm sequences, all very well realised. The ship herself is the star, of course, and gives a better idea of what a ship of the period and its crew were really like than other similar period films I have seen such as the various attempts to film the Hornblower novels or Mutiny on the Bounty.There has been some discussion about whether women would enjoy this all-male film - well, I certainly did! Such a relief not to have the pointless and emotion-free sex scenes that most films seem to find essential. Also very nice to have a cast of fairly unfamiliar faces (apart from Russell Crowe himself of course), and to have English characters with English accents, and not the Americans saving the world again. A sequel seems to be built in to all films these days, and with Aubrey and Maturin you have 20 books to go at, so no shortage of material.</fullReview>

I reach the point where I almost tried to forgot what they were trying to say and came to realize that this could have been made as a silent movie.Still,all of the visual richness filled the screen.

		<shortDescription>One of the most realistic period movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its outlook you could expect something good, even if a bit strange: Peter Weir running a seafaring movie, which from its trailer promised to be a gripping and exciting adventure through the seas of the early 19th century? But the trailer was lying. The movie is much more than just the adventures of Cpt. Jack Aubrey on board the HMS Suprise. This movie is made from the very same fabric it displays on screen, a fabric of sweat, salt water, heat, cold and storms. A fabric of moral and human fiber, a fabric of people's senses and feelings. The biggest suprise of this crafted and superb movie is that it sticks to the human values, and brings back that feeling of old movies, before the explosion of CGI created new worlds and destroyed many others. In fact, the computer-generated elements in this movie are so rare and detailed that you'll not notice them and even if you do, you'll forget that they are not real. This movie is realistic to every woodchip that flies under the cannon charges and every bit of cloth these characters wear. Add to it a commanding presence by Russel Crowe, decent supporting characters and a superb sound construction and you'll have one of the finest movies of the year, and a sure bet to the oscars (it's produced by Miramax, you know).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enrapturing and captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last few months I have been in a phase where good and great movies just came pouring in from countless places and it's been a wonderful experience. But "Master And Commander" tops the chart! Why? Because it was the most enjoyable and powerful of them all. Because it had an impeccable cast that drove the movie all the way through.(Mr. Crowe being his usual self in the best possible way and the incredible Paul Bettany who gives the movie a Darwinistic and humane tone). Because it had an incredible enseble working on its score, cinematography, costumes, editing and especially detailed presentation of that time. Because it had dialogues that had something, no, a lot to say. And because it was just so bloody brilliant. My favorite moment: when Dr. Stephen Maturin stumbles upon his so-seeked out bird and catches the French ship closing in. With the surrounding music, camera and atmosphere it created one of the most perfect movie moments I have ever seen. The only flaw I can remember was the casting of Billy Boyd who should either had more screen time or either been replaced with an unknown actor. I more than understand people who will and have found "Master And Commander" tedious or perhaps arguably uneventful, because the people who will enjoy it the most are people who know a little bit about naval customs and happenings in those days and who will appreciate it especially for that. This movie is more than just a regular revival of a seaman movie, it is an excellent documentary of days when British fleets fought with the French and it ends in such a manner. Perhaps unfinished to some, to me it was perfect. Peter Weir, kudos to your directing skills, they have proven you to be Hollywood's very own and true Master and Commander. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some have commented that this movie is dull. Well, I supposed pace, composition, and a setting appropriate to the high seas aren't everything. Some have commented that Russell Crowe is dull. Well, perfect control, pitch, and nuance as the Captain of the Surprise doesn't require the overacting prolific in Gladiator. What's so, er, surprising about Master and Commander is its languid pace, which echoes the kind of life faced by the shipmates. You got a direct feel for sailing, and kudos to Peter Weir for that cinematographic vision. One user commented that certainly lots of sodomy would have gone on behind the bulkheads...and frankly, the whole crew seemed rather non-sexual, as though a saltpeter bomb had gone off at the film's start. Given Russell Crowe's fine performance in The Sum of Us, I'm sure he could have improvised...but perhaps he had more important ship duties to attend to (a la Captain Kirk, who always referred to the Enterprise as "She").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen Master And Commander twice and will make an effort to see it again before it leaves the big screen. Overall the the thing that impressed me most about this movie is how I found myself completely engrossed from beginning to end. Magnificent acting, directing,sound, and the musical score. There appeared to be a great deal of attention to detail regarding authenticity of costumes, nautical language,props,etc.. Russell Crow was outstanding. Encouraging to see Hollywood bring to bear its resources of writing, creativity, talent, and technology in producing a great film like this.</fullReview>

I loved every minute of it, despite the slight seasickness i felt occasionally. Hey, did anyone notice that the unfortunate Mowett (Jonah guy) looked a bit like prince Charles?

		<fullReview>Rarely does a film rate a 10 by any reviewer, but "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is one of them. The audience lives life on the HMS Surprise with Jack Aubrey and his crew for a short two hours of this historical epic. It is a believable adventure at sea in 1805. Peter Weir is a master of detail.The characters are real, from Lucky Jack to Cousin Joe. Their dialects are authentic early 1800's, lower class Britain. The cinematography is spectacular, the ship is beautiful in its woodwork and rigging detail and the sounds of creaking masts against the wind are ubiquitous. The roar of the cannons and the chain and bar shot as it rips through the audience is electrifying.The only sense that could not be stimulated by this movie was that of smell. One can only imagine how repulsive that must have been with two hundred men living in close quarters amongst the cattle, goats, chickens and rotting food for months on end. The daily grog would have been the least of two weevils.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Commander is a magnificent piece of creativity. from the visuals to the feel of it i think Peter Weir did an amazing job. I don't know much of historical war stories neither have i read the novel by Patrick O'Brian but i got the real feel.From a technical perspective, this whole film,shot on the sea succeeded in pulling the viewer by depicting how real and rough it gets- happy, dirty, battle, fear,friendship, courage, decisions .To support the technical, Russel Crowe did not only act, he reproduced history. He was strong yet tender in friendships, which portrays reality rather than larger than life, all- perfect commander. He was able to talk through issues with his friend, a good balance between strength and weakness.I could not resist getting Gladiator goose bumps when he got engaged in the sword battle in the enemy's ship. However, the movie dragged at certain places, it was too long for the intended message, you only get the hard core after long minutes of just watching one ship and a bunch of almost-not entertaining dialogue.But on an overall scale, it was well shot, well cast and good make-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near perfect cinematic experience, for those ready to embrace it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Weir is one of those directors whose films are well-known, yet the man behind them doesn't seem to garner the recognition he deserves. Over the last thirty years, he has made some of the very best films of their respective years, traversing different categoric genres, but always focussing on the human story behind each story - no matter how big or small. Picnic at Hanging Rock. Witness. Fearless. The Truman Show. And now, his largest film by far, yet also a deeply personal one, arguably his greatest achievement in a career filled with triumphs of popular cinema.As the scope of his films gets bigger, the characters become more defined and human, a rare accomplishment indeed. For me, although I love The Truman Show deeply, and feel it is at least in part responsible for a growth in more intelligent, popular movies in recent years, Master and Commander is his best film, a close-to-perfect film for its kind. The story is very simple. "Lucky" Jack Aubrey's ship and crew are hit by a surprise attack from Napoleon's battle ship, the Acheron - the nemesis of the tale. Having weighed up the damage and taken care of the casualties, they retaliate with a seemingly impossible counter-attack by pursuing the stronger, faster ship that outmans and outguns them. They tail them across the vast ocean, through freezing cold, sweltering heat and life-threatening storm.It is the technique that is astonishing. The detail of the life, the crew and the protocol of war at sea two hundred years ago is all accounted for, without ever becoming tedious. This is a long film that feels long, but never less than gripping, crammed with events, but not necessarily overly complex story. The characters drive it. It is they who are the most interesting aspect of the film and by resting the dramatic weight of the film on the actors shoulders rather than the effects - which are seamless, by the way - the payoff to each individual dynamic is all the more satisfying when it comes. Tempers fray, loyalties are questioned, motives and pride and duty are put under the microscope, making for a tense atmosphere, far more dramatic in classical terms than anything the Wachowskis' fx wizkids can cook up. It is the attention to detail that makes this film.Every screw and splint of wood of the HMS Surprise is on display, making the ship as much of a character - the omnipresent sidekick to each individual - as any of the crew. With judicious, unshowy yet acute use of both cinematography and sound design, the viewer is put aboard the Surprise. When it leaks, you feel it. When it is damaged, you are scared. And when the crew hurt, you are saddened. This is the best sounding film you will see (or hear) in a cinema all year. Other films bombard you more, sure, but this one immerses you into its world. There is a real feel for what life on board must have been like, but Weir never takes the easy way out by shoving something front and centre, as if to say, "Look how hard life was back then". Rather, it becomes an integral part of the story and the lives of the characters. Crew members get sick and their treatment must be swift and sometimes crude if they are to survive for months away from dry land. The opponents' ship and crew, the French Achelon, is rarely seen any closer than through a telescope, never offering the God's eye view of an alternative experience to that of the Surprise. We know as much or as little about the enemy as Lucky Jack does.To top all of Weir's technical acheivements, there are two or three outstanding and spectacular battle scenes. The opening twenty minutes are as good as anything in Laurence of Arabia or Pirates of the Caribbean, combining classic set-piece orientation with state of the art model and effects work. You are never taken out of the scene by a "money shot", rather the drama and danger are heightened by a genuinely invisible use of action technique. And when the final skirmish takes place, all of the character building both of the filmmaker and of the crew's Captain, comes into play, making for a terrifying, tense and exciting climax. Along the way, there are exceptional performances from the sometimes overly showy Crowe, here as good as he has ever been, displaying a real control of his craft (no pun intended), a leader trying to balance what is best for his men with his sense of duty, whilst living up to his impeccable military record. Paul Bettany is the yang to Crowe's yin. You feel the history and the brewing difference in priority between a Captain and his Physician, two old friends trying to keep their career and their relationship in check, brought together by their love of and skill in music. The scenes these two share are the most touching, as their loyalty to each other, the ship and the crew are well intentioned, but coming from different standpoints, simultaneously trying to remain honest to one another and do what is right. Billy Boyd makes an impression (even if his accent wavers slightly from time to time) as the helmsman who has the respect of the officers and the friendship of the crew. And the two young officers (I do not know their names, but they are both very young) are superb in roles that are usually carried off appallingly in films like these. As little more than boys, their sense of awe and respect for the older officers and their need to prove their bravery and worth to them comes across beautifully, and their scenes with Bettany and Crowe and incredibly touching, without being sentimental.That is the skill of the film. It fulfills all the requirements of entertainment - drama, performance, action, spectacle, beauty and humour - without ever overdoing it and spoiling any given moment by going too far. It is also wittily and intelligently written, one of the strongest scripts of its size to be seen this year. The "Weevil" scene is a truly wonderful scene, because it enhances the relationships of all the characters involved, makes a point about life and duty, is very natural and human and is surprisingly funny. The film is filled with such moments and while the ending may not be as long an action scene as some may have come to expect, it carries true weight by rounding off nicely. A completely satisfying film, almost impossible to fault as long as you dont expect a huge action extravaganza. If you have ever watched Mutiny on the Bounty or The Sea Hawk or any such sea-faring, swashbuckling adventure and wanted a glimpse of life in those circumstances, given an historical background and exciting story, then this is mana from Heaven. And when it is over, you wouldn't mind a sequel continuing the story where it left off, not an implausibility given the wealth of source material in Patrick O' Brien's many Jack Aubrey novels. That is a rare feeling, but make sure Peter Weir is at the helm..."Pull for Lucky Jack"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I vote 10. At first, movie is technical brilliant. I had an impression of personal presence in almost all the scenes, which means that the cameras positions, light, sound, the other effects and the rest of the technical tools are well composed, coherent to each other, "catching" the right moments to be as close to the reality, as possible (or necessary). Furthermore, Peter Weir`s choice of actors is excellent. O`Brien`s novel needs such an actors, who can realized their roles with the faces, movements and characteristics, they already have by their own. Relationships, between captain (Russell Crowe), his doctor friend (Paul Bettany), than the young boys and their elder colleagues, finally the sailors back to their captain - all the circle is description of possible human community, which can be comparable with any other human union, even the state. Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey represents classic leader, an archetype of "strict, but righteous king" (captain), so his role justify the title of the movie. On the other side, Paul Bettany`s character is a typical one who represents other human spheres, such as mind, sense, hunger for knowledge and scientific researches. This polarity, between human lack (Dr. Stephen Maturin) and captain`s (Jack Aubrey) personal wishes, covered with "hold on tight" of state (British Empire) priorities, P. Weir alleviates in the scenes where the fear of loss of a close person waking up a hidden love and care (R. Crowe character). That point makes this movie more lyrical, than the epic male war drama. No matter the scenes of battles are enough rude, as they have to be, the lyrical sense is the clew trough the entire movie. Except the parts at the Galapagos islands, everything is on the ship, but the feeling of claustrophobic, introvert atmosphere is absolutely absent. Also, the end without end (final issue) makes the movie and protagonists a bit like a shadow, which can emerge any time, somewhere at the oceans. Very good end. I saw many of characters Russell Crowe acting, but as Jack Aubrey, I found him the best (for now). Knowing well Australian and New Zealand film production, directors and actors, Crowe is so Australian in this role (no matter Aubrey is British) - a specific and recognizable acting (like people can always recognize the Hollywood or European actors and acting styles, which are specific in their own way). Conclusion: Congratulations to Peter Weir, Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, all the other actors and the rest of the Master and Commander movie crew.</fullReview>

I was reminded of that novel when I was watching "Master and Commander". I appreciated the film maker's decision to set it during a period that's rarely done in film history. Europe has just begun to extend it's grip around the whole globe with England about to reach pre-eminence. The scientific method was taking hold among European academia.The main plot has a British warship pursuing and being pursued by a French warship. Among the men, and boys, on the ship is its doctor, who is a naturalist as well. He clashes with the ship's captain when his pursuit doesn't conform to the captain's.The film is well written, well acted an adventurous. A good all-around effort.</fullReview>

I am an admirer of good books (especially historical for the historical reenactment is my hobby) but also big fan of action in the movies. So in cinema I rather choose to watch big productions with a lot of action and good F/X'es. Unfortunatelly I do not like the situations when producers of the movie just think of me as about an amoeba when my inteligence is to be consider :-). After this season in cinema I nearly forgot that one actually can make a movie containing lots of good action and also containing a scenario! I mean scenario with a good plot, good, "non paper" characters etc. As I mentioned before when you watch this movie it is like you were reading a very good book.

		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a tale of adventure and tragedy about the Navy battle between the British H.M.S. Surprise and the French Acheron. When the Surprise is attacked by the Acheron, a far superior and modern ship, and is almost sunk, Captain Jack Aubrey refuses to give up until he takes that ship down. Tragic casualties occur, the ship's doctor is almost lost, bonds are made, men are made, and the Surprise attempts its revenge.The movie is an outstanding piece of media simply because of the way it was filmed. The positioning of cameras allows the audience to almost feel the motion of the boat, (I would not recommend this to anyone who gets motion sickness). Because the scenes are shot from so many points of view, viewers could almost put themselves in the position of the characters, feeling the sea spray on their faces and smelling the ocean air.There were many lessons learned throughout the movie. Captain Aubrey learned not to make promises that he couldn't keep. Dr. Stephen Maturin learned that sometimes duty must come before desire. Everyone learned courage, to support their fellow soldiers, and to deal with the sacrifices and losses that come with war. Even though the movie lacked any main female characters, there were well developed relationships (friendships). (Being a woman, I was surprised that I enjoyed a movie that lacked any romance whatsoever.) The men had well developed relationships, which is rarely seen between men in movies. The characters were very solid, and the actors did an amazing job of portraying them.</fullReview>

I am not a big Russell Crowe fan but sometimes he surprises me. He did an excellent job. He played the role of Lucky Jack with the reserved emotion as needed. I knew nothing about what the film covered. My husband briefed me quickly about the war and I was set. The film was beautifully done.

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice since it hit the big screen and enjoyed it thoroughly each time. Like most good movies it is better the second time around. I should preface this by saying that I had never even heard of the series of books until the movie came out, so I had no expectations of the characters. In any case, this film really captures the era it depicts. The viewer gets a close-up look at the grimy, often violent, world of the golden age of sail. The main characters, and several minor ones, are well-drawn and are not just cartoon characters. The acting is fine throughout. The action is gripping, the more serene moments involving. Overall, it is just a flat-out entertaining piece of cinema. You don't have to be an expert on the Napoleon-era British navy to enjoy it, but I trust that those well-versed in this area will find the level of detail satisfactory at the very least. Some devotees of the books are disappointed, of course. This is understandable. Rare is the movie that can hold a candle to the book it is based upon, for the simple reason that books can convey so much more through narrative, stream-of-consciousness and other devices. Anyone reading the book before seeing the movie should expect this. Good example: bucketloads of material has been missing from the first two LOTR movies, yet the trilogy is one of the greatest film achievements in history. Another: The original "Jurassic Park" took a book with a lot of serious statements on issues such as genetic engineering and turned it into, essentially, a CGI adventure. As long as this is expected, the movie can be taken at face value and enjoyed for what it is. I didn't expect "Jurassic Park" to do more than make a passing reference to the weighty issues involved, and thus I was not disappointed. The one criticism I will comment on, though, is the relative importance of the two main characters. My understanding is that some devotees of the novels think that Aubrey is too much "the star" compared to the books. Not having read them myself, I'll give them that. But as a newcomer to the subject, my impression is that the doctor is almost on an even keel with Aubrey as a character. Crowe will obviously be THE star in most if not all of his endeavors, given his current status. But the doctor's character was quite well-developed, from his intense interest in natural history to his ignorance of maritime jargon. The changing of the enemy in this one from American to French was probably primarily due to the fact that Hollywood doesn't expect American audiences to root against Americans. But the point one viewer made somewhere on the boards, that had it been an American vessel the movie would have taken place at least 8 years later and thus the sequels would have been limited, was likely taken into consideration as well.  Bottom line: A first-class adventure that stands up well to repeated viewings. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

It is a brilliant movie and from the beginning to the end the action takes place so there is no time to get bored. It is not also the story itself which makes the film interesting, but also the excellent perfomances of Russell Crowe (an actor who also deserved an Oscar for his magnificent perfomance in L.A CONFIDENTIAL) and the British born actor Paul Bettany. It is sure this film will be nominated to the next Oscar awards in 2004 and I hope Russell Crowe to be nominated as best actor in a leading role.

		<fullReview>Great film - the visual effects of frightening velocity and damage potential of cannonballs fired at close quarters was incredible, never imagined this kind of chaos - sound effects too were remarkable throughout. Creditable acting and not a trace of any unrealistic or obviously phoney accents, which must be a first in a film of this nature.Particularly enjoyed the portrayal of grubby, greasy crew complete with acne, misaligned teeth caked in plaque, dirty fingernails and greasy clothes with genuine looking worn-in stains. These kind of details made the film for me (I know nothing of sailing but have been aboard several ships of this time and others similar).Really enjoyed it. No silly Hollywood-style "token romance" or unrealistic love interest. No silly ending, good pace throughout and some great moments.I would give this nine out of ten (9 / 10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb, amazingly real and emotional.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has prompted me to put some comments here at IMDB, which is a rarity. A movie that takes you by the neck and never looses its grip for the entire journey. For me the thing that made it was its believability. I was there on the ship in the first few moments in the calmness of the fog, then, a distant flash, and all hell breaks loose as the HMS Surprise is pulverised by enemy cannons. Never has an action scene appeared as forcefully and emotional as the first ten minutes of this film.Over the past few years I have failed to `get into' hardly any new action-adventure movies. The Star Wars prequels, Matrix sequels, have all disappointed because of the low believability factor for me. But here is a movie that makes you believe again in the `movies' and there ability to take you to another time and place and feel for the people involved.Not once did I think I was looking at any computer generated scenes or looking at a ship in a `big tank', so the effects were perfect, that is, they didn't look like effects, they were seamless.So here we have action, drama, adventure on a grand scale. And no BS love connection to annoy the hell out us and the progress of the HMS Surprise.This is a 10 out 10 movie for me.Here is some of my other favourites in no order or significanceTerminator 1, Terminator 3, Titanic, Minority ReportSome movies I didn't likePearl Harbour, Attack of the Clones, Fast and Furious</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Sea Dramas Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film all around: great acting, great visuals, great action and meaningful dialogue. Crowe and Bettany and the supporting cast are in top form, and it would be a travesty if this film doesn't take home more than a few Oscars. A true tribute to O'Brian's novels and probably one of Weir's best films. One note: yes I know the US frigate Norfolk(based on the USS Essex, 32 guns) from the novel Far Side of the World , was changed in the movie to a French 44 gun frigate(which did not exist in 1805)called the Acheron. While you might argue that this change was made to appease American audiences(since we Americans are all blindly chauvinistic), I would offer another, more artistically based explanation. First of all, the novel Far Side of the World, despite its American adversary, was a best seller here in the States when it came out and no one complained about its plot. Secondly, when trying to establish an increased sense of drama around the chase of an enemy frigate, making the enemy vessel a privateer of an enemy who is threatening your homeland and has a more oppressive government than your own(Napoleonic France in 1805) is far more effective than having an enemy who is still fairly weak militarily, has neither the intention or ability to invade your country, and has a more democratic form of government than your own(the USA in 1813). Imagine Aubrey's far less dramatic final speech `Do you want to make James Madison your President? Do you want the Liberty Bell in Picadilly?'. While the O'Brian novels certainly can, and do, pull off the tension and drama of the chase and destruction of the Norfolk effectively, it must be remembered that we the reader get to know and root for Jack Aubrey, Stephen Maturin and their crews over a series of novels, a series that, not surprisingly, started with Aubrey and Maturin's experiences in the Napoleonic Wars. A two hour stand alone movie probably could not pull this off as well since most moviegoers probably had not read the novels and hence do not have the background with the main characters. All in all this film is one of the best sea dramas, and war dramas for that matter, ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huzzah! This isn't the movie I feared it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the O'Brian books, I was worried by the trailer I saw: almost no Maturin, an apparently pivotal moment when a young boy takes command of the ship... oh dear, I thought; maybe it will be a great film but it won't be anything like those wonderful books. Fortunately (for book fans, at least), the marketers were lying! Pretty much everything you could want from an adaptation is here, which of course explains why a lot of people don't seem to like it: it has an episodic nature, the humour is embedded in character, the attention to detail is almost obsessive, and (I think this is the crucial one), it makes little concession to readers/viewers who don't know the environment. Few "mainstream" films of recent years have chosen to assume that the audience is this knowledgable and intelligent, for which Peter Weir must be roundly applauded. You have to bring your brain in with you for this one. For any book fans with lingering doubts: The weevil joke is perfectly done; and rest assured, Killick is perfect too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old dame likes this tale----</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---From the opening shot of the beautiful sailing vessel on the lonely sea from high above; through the first sequence of the crewman going though the hammocks of the sleeping crew to wake the next watch and them climbing, in the dark, up the masts among the sails, I was captivated.I have never read the books, nor even heard of them, until reading about this film. The movie has a great world of the Napoleonic era to detail, and does so in great fashion. I loved the look of the garb of the era, and the detail of all the many chores and insights into daily living on a great vessel.The cast is uniformly fine. Russell Crowe is the commander of this vessel and he is most believable. The young Lord Blakeley played by new-comer, Max Pirkis is a standout. And for us gals, James D'Arcy, in a small but star-making role, is just gorgeous.This is a world of men, and the time is the early 1800's. I, for one, am glad the filmmakers did not mess it up with romances and kept it true to the story of men at war at sea. And that they did not put in action just for the sake of the fanboy crowd that has no attention span for the nuanced tale being told. Wonderful film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blatant foreshadowing but no theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts well, but then...Without providing spoilers this film had not one surprise (except for the name of the ship) and every plot point was obvious from the laying of the first seed. In fact by the end of the film I was laughing at how obvious things would turn out.As one other reviewer said this film drags in the middle, then has a way too short (and badly edited) climax followed by a dull/ downer of an ending. This film needed major editing in the middle and a longer, more interesting finale with clear expression as to what was happening to whom rather than Rusty pulling out a sword to relive his Gladdy days. By the end I didn't care (or even know) who was getting killed (contrast this to other war films, even flawed ones like Saving Private Ryan, which know how to draw out empathy through things such as character development!)But my biggest complaint is this film has no theme. Historical films should provide a salient comparison or a lesson for the current times. This film provided neither a contrast nor a comparison. By way of contrast it could have explored the values of those times, the political and military rivalry of the English and the French and the desire for exploration. More pertinently in terms of comparison this film could have tackled a key issue in our lives, namely one such as the war on terror. The fact that the doctor wanted to study new life forms and explore new lands despite the fact the ship was involved in a war could have been a great metaphor, namely that we should continue to support the space program, commit ourselves to fighting AIDS etc. rather than be caught up only with the wars/battles going on at this time. I just thought this was one of many types of themes that could have been explored to greater depth and insight rather than basing the movie around two blokes, one a snag the other old school.In short a missed opportunity (and one that will also play really badly on VHS/dvd).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pacing all at sea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following his magnificent performance as Maximus, Russell Crowe is well-cast as the tough, yet tender, commander of a British warship during the Napoleonic wars - Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, a man who can have an insubordinate crew member whipped, yet make haunting music with a violin. I don't know if such multi-faceted heroes existed in real life, but this is a creation of the best-selling author Patrick O'Brian from whose first and tenth novels the story and two titles are taken. Crowe is ably supported by his co-star from "A Beautiful Mind", Paul Bettany, as the captain's friend, ship's surgeon and amateur naturalist, Dr Stephen Maturin. Strangely this is a battle movie in which only at the very end does one see the faces of the French enemy, the rest of the time a glimpse of sails and the crash of cannon balls being the only sign of their presence. This focuses the attention on the British ship and its crew of 197. Indeed it is totally a man's world with a lingering glance being the only feminine element in two and a quarter hours. The attention to detail and the fine sets give a real sense of authenticity that makes one really feel acutely the immense privations of being at sea for so long in 1805. The sound is superb too, making me almost duck as rifle shots and cannon balls seemed to whizz over my shoulder.Director and co-writer Peter Weir has crafted a gripping movie, but it is marred by poor pacing which contrasts adversely with a classic adventure movie like "Gladiator". After a tense opening 20 minutes, we don't see any further action against the enemy until the end, when the attack on the more formidable French ship is too quick, too confused and made to look too easy - following which there is a limp final ten minutes that ends the work on too low a note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A likeable war epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great pleasant surprise, as I found the trailer rather mediocre and thus I went to the cinema with low expectations, figuring that this would possibly be another heroic Hollywood drama full of clichés. However, I was overwhelmed with joy. In addition to be an adventurous and thrilling movie, it is full of humour and personality, and it also seems quite authentic historically. The tension and special relationship among the crew mid-sea in wartime in the early 1800s is very charmingly described. I think Crowe and Bettany play excellently together. Crowe has the authority, the sympathy as well as the doubt that one would expect of a convincing captain Aubrey - my only complaint is that he does not seem convincingly British. I am really happy that the project was laid in Peter Weir's hands, he never disappoints. Quite a relief also that this was not made into a simple, superficial Hollywood drama by adding unnecessary love stories or such, which is always my worst fear about "masculine" movies. Oh no, this movie is full of manhood and in my opinion it does not at all suffer from not including any female characters. I can't say much about the degree of being true to the original story as I haven't read Peter O'Brian books yet, but at least this movie has surely made me want to read them - and I expect them to be even better (the books usually are)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MINIMAL SPOILERSEvery so often, a few friends of mine will read the 40 or so reviews I've done over the months on this website, and will make some comical opinion regarding them. Truth be told, I don't care anymore. What I hate is when I go to see a film with someone and come out in admiration of the creators and awe at the film itself, yet someone else comes out and instantly condemns part of it. This happened with "Master and Commander".In this film, we're introduced to Captain Jack "Lucky" Aubrey (played with an almost Maximus type persona by Russell Crowe who could possibly win the oscar for this). Aubrey is the captain of the HMS Surprise (yes, I know it's not the best of ship names, but I don't need someone in the cinema mentioning this the second the name is mentioned!), a British ship during the Napoleonic Wars which has been stationed to the seas around Brazil with the mission to stop a French ship from stealing british Whaler's goods. Aubrey is joined by a crew of varied types, including Billy Boyd in his first performance since playing Pippin in "Lord Of The Rings", and most importantly his best friend and ship's Medic Dr Stephen Maturin, played majestically by Paul Bettany (who ironically is playing Crowe's best friend for not the first time, having appeared as his imaginery friend in "A Beautiful Mind"). The film continues along the similar sort of path as for two hours, Crowe almost constantly chases the French ship, stopping only partially at the Galapagos Islands, and involves a fair few battles against the French and against nature.What can be said about this film? Well, theres limited cgi in this film, meaning that everything which takes place revolves around a real life boat created from scratch and actually taken out onto the sea's for shooting. The acting is spot on, and the realism is accurate, showing us just how gritty it was aboard boats in the old days. This film reminds us just how lucky we should feel about being alive in this era rather than centuries before. Whilst I do confess at times, the characterisation drags a bit and some of the characters don't really connect to us on a higher level, attempts are made for some of them. Bettany in particular is easy to associate with, and if the guy doesn't get Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars then there really is something wrong with the world, and also an unfortunate officer is developed for us to pity and bond with.I guess really, there isn't too much to be said about this film. This could possibly be one of it's flaws. When it is released on DVD &amp; VHS, I look forward to reading the blurb on the back of the box, simply because I'm sceptical it could be anything more than three lines. Crowe &amp; Company chase a French ship around the Far Side of the World for two and a half hours. That's all that can really be said to be honest. As far as twists and turns go, there aren't any. The plot is straightforward, VERY simple, and ultimately this doesn't matter one bit. This film is something you can't really do justice to when describing it. Some of the best films of the last few years (this, "A Beautiful Mind", "Adaptation", etc) were beautiful, not because they were crammed with events, but because with the few minor events they did contain, they developed grit filled beauty on a high scale.Will this film win any Oscars? Currently it's a lot of people's favourite to scoop at least one of the big ones, I'm unsure though. I think it was amazing, but it doesn't seem like something Oscar would really plump for. Then again though, I never thought Gladiator would scoop many awards and that proved me wrong. Watch this film, but if you get sea sick, take a bag in with you.</fullReview>

Ships, weather, etc., very realistic.Borrowed parts from several books, but with 20 books and only one [or two or...] movie, how could you not? The way it ends, a sequel has to be in the works.Only one goof I noticed: Stephen boarded the French ship during the battle - he would never have done that.

		<fullReview>On leaving the cinema last night, two women in front of me complained that the film was boring, and that they should have stayed in and watched Eastenders. How foolish. This is a fantastic film on a number of levels. Firstly for those of you who are proud of your heritage and have had enough of Hollywood constantly denigrating the British, then fear not, because this portrays us in a positive light. Secondly what a wonderful picture is painted of life in the early 19th century Royal Navy- the songs, the food, even sleeping, or how the decks were converted before action occurring. It shows the grim realities of war at sea, and just how difficult it was to sail these magnificant looking ships.The game of cat and mouse between the French privateer and HMS Surprise is broken up by these interesting sequences. The doctor is well placed, because he can play devils advocate without incurring the penalties of mutiny etc. The climatic fight scene is as good as anything I've seen in a cinema. Russell Crowe is as ever on imperious form, as is Paul Bettany. However the young midshipmen- unlike their ship- are not wooden, with some fine performances, certainly talent is there for the future. James D'Arcy comes of age with a well crafted performance showing an array of emotions.Splendid effort all round. Bravo. What a way to return to the naval genre!</fullReview>

As a matter of intriguing plot this movie does not have much to offer. Crowe commands an english warship, and are under order to seek out and destroy his enemies, which in turn are trying to destroy him. End of story. There are little help from subplots in interaction between the crew. But then again, this movie's strength is not the plot. It's strength is the scenery, acting and details. This movie should not be watched as a ordinary movie, this movie should be felt. Because the makers of this movie have put in an effort for details. If you let it the movie may transport you onto the ship were you can feel the waves, smell the salty ocean and hear the roar of the storms. Thats the strength of this movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*~* May contain spoilers *~*Seeing this movie in England definitely added a little bit of an edge to the film since I'm an American and knew very little of the history behind it. Apparently, Patrick O'Brian spent a lot of time meticulously researching his novels so that they, in addition to being wonderful fiction, are also technically accurate. I feel that the movie did a wonderful job of portraying the wooden world of the 19th century British naval vessel. The sense of realism I was able to maintain throughout the movie was a huge factor in my enjoyment of the film. Russell Crowe acted wonderfully as I have always thought of his acting. This film is most like some of his most recent ones where he actually exhibits some real human emotions unlike the stiff stoicism in "Gladiator" or repressed rage in "L.A. Confidential." Bravo.My only qualm with this movie was the unnecessary history lessons. This seems to be a new trend in movie-making that I don't particularly like. Now, I haven't yet read the books and I don't know if the Jack Aubrey character does stop at the Galapagos Islands or not, but whether or not it happened in the book it didn't need to be so very harped on in the movie. As much as I wasn't a fan, I don't think that it detracted from the movie one bit, especially since it seemed crucial for the chance sighting of the 'Acheron' during one scene. Still, there was a bit too much of an obnoxious pedagogical emphasis on the naturalist portion of the film in my book. It seemed like whenever I saw the ship's doctor, it was like the director was nudging me in the arm and saying, "See! See! Just like Darwin would discover in a few years! Right! Right?!?"However, my complaints are so very minor that I still felt compelled to rate this movie at a ten, which I reserve only for excellent movies. It seems like one of those films I can watch again and again for the appreciation of human ingenuity in the actions of the characters as well as just good, well scripted, well-shot with great special effects, action scenes. Like I say, knowing some of the history made it easier to understand as well. For instance, when Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis) loses his arm and is given by Aubrey a book on Lord Nelson, that has significance in that Nelson (one of Britain's greatest admirals) also was missing an arm for most of his naval career. It was just nice to have issues clarified that I may not have understood otherwise.The effects were very cool and I liked the various scenes during storms, ship-to-ship fighting, and the realism portrayed of what it might have been like to be a career navy man in the early 19th century. The acting was magnificent and Crowe portrays the smart, but prideful, captain quite well. Paul Bettany does well as the voice of reason slash doctor who controls how much master and how much commander Crowe is supposed to exhibit. All the other characters were of a caliber as to be interesting and contribute well to the movie without robbing anything from that captain-versus-captain battle I was looking forward to. In this way the movie set itself up well for a sequel and also could easily call it quits here and now. What happens next remains to be seen for what it's worth.So, in summary, I felt that this movie was wonderfully entertaining and a fantastic way to spend an afternoon or evening. If you haven't seen it, get out and see it. If you have seen it, I recommend buying it for those rainy afternoons with nothing to do and nothing to read. A definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first few opening minutes of Master and Commander are stunning. Director Peter Weir treats us to one amazing shot - where the cope of the surrounding ocean first comes into view and, for the first few minutes at least, the camerawork remains inspiring. There's more than a hint of verisimilitude in this naval epic, and it's clear Weir is trying to depict the stoicism required to withstand life on board a frigate in the Napoleonic wars. He treats us to grizzly operations (with primitive medical equipment, of course) and the tight, cramped conditions are made apparent from the start. The narrative is structured superbly, and the cat and mouse chase between the two ships acts as a driving force throughout. The pace is far from perfect however, as the film drags in the middle (a stop at the Galapagos Islands seems to last forever - not aided by the realisation that the Islands themselves may be the most boring in the world). Unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe's performance is drenched with charisma. Captain Jack Aubrey is a quasi-resurrection of his role in Gladiator and, once again, I could honestly see him as a respected, inspirational leader in a time of crisis. However lame his puns may be ('the lesser of two weevils'?). His character is a joy to watch, thanks to no small part by how excellently it is written. We can understand his troubles to identify with the crew (through several dinner scenes) and simultaneously retain their respect and confidence. Unfortunately, I can count only four other distinguished characters in the rest of the ships identical, plentiful crew, which leads to problems; An integral part of Crowe's role comes in his decision to release a broken sail and send a shipmate to his death. Who? I've no idea - so I don't care. The presence of only three recognisable actors (Crowe, Paul Bettany as a doctor with a passion for nature and a rather bland Billy Boyd) means it becomes difficult to decipher who's who. Who just lost a friend? Who's loyal to 'lucky' Jack? Who just died? etc. This is one of those films that's alloyed by the lack of an large, ensemble cast to highlight the key members of a 100+ crew. Which would seem perfectly reasonable considering it's 135 million budget. There are other flaws. Noticeably the convoluted close-combat scenes caused by dizzy camera work, and the actual siege at the end is an anti-climax, considering it drives the narrative right from the first 3 minutes. The ship battle scenes are some of the best action set pieces of the year, and the weather and damage special effects remain unnoticeable throughout (putting the Matrix Reloaded's blatantly obvious switching to shame) but an involving twist at the end is never resolved and sums up my entire opinion of the film - impressive, but unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uncommon, exciting, thoughtful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If every movie was this exciting I think we would all be happier. I just read some criticism about Master and Commander that was valid, I guess, if you are an obnoxious weenie who defines very existence as ones ability to constantly demonstrate uniquely superior knowledge, wit and taste to the detriment of people who would rather call creation the true validity of existence.Indeed this story is in the tradition of setting modern stories in foreign times. But so what? It's a complicated relationship we have with narrative, escapism, and our desire to understand the past. Master and Commander succeeds in illuminating parts of the past while simultaneously exciting us and compelling us, and yes, relating our modern sensibilities to the past. The dramatic camera positioning throughout should hint to even the most ridiculously pathetic film nut that we are watching a spectacle. Despite what we witness at downtown film-festivals, it's not worth dismissing exciting narrative as a valid art-form merely because haunting and disturbing indie film is most accessible to the common NYU film graduate. Success on such a grand stage, and Master and Commander is that, should be lauded as a triumph, and rapidly enfranchised. I can't wait for the next O'Brien movie. God, if every creative work was made with such enthusiasm, without a touch of petty ironic malevolence. Every scene is ecstatic. Every scene is interesting. More Patrick O'Brien, more Jack Aubry, less Star Wars, Matrix, Spiderman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seing this film, and I really liked it. Visually it is a beautiful film, the locations are breathtaking and the camerawork excellent. The characters are good and develop, which is difficult to do when you have so many of them. The action is great and the story was very good. The only problem was the length, I don't mind long films, but when they don't have to be long is when I get mad. There were so many scenes in this film that really didn't do anything for the story, they were just there. A scene that should only take 30 seconds drags on for 2 minutes. This movie could have been just as good and over in 90-100 instead of the rear-end numbing 138 minutes. Don't let the length keep you from seeing this film, and do see it in the theatres so you get the full effect of the special effects. What has surprised me the most about this film are the great reviews it has recieved, from the type of critics who usually only rave about sensative dramas like The Hours or any other Julianne Moore film, and usually bash anything with good action in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations were, I confess, rather low. A plot drawn from several of the novels, centred around an extended chase, missing out much of the splendid social and personal elements of the books and, worse yet, the horrible miscasting of Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey. It sounded ominously like another great literary work being churned and processed into a disappointing film.Under the care of Peter Weir, however, the film has become something far beyond adequate or respectable. It may be more Hornblower than Aubrey, but this is a very fine naval film indeed. True, it's hard to accept Crowe as Lucky Jack, but he has a good stab at it and does portray elements of the character (notably when he's drunk, when he's in combat and when he's voicing his authority) excellently. Only when faced with extended, emotional dialogue does he falter. Likewise Maturin on screen is not Maturin in the book, but to be fair the whole cast do such a good job that it is almost possible to forget the novels for a time and revel in a fine tale wonderfully told. David Threlfall deserves special mention, though, for stepping directly from the pages of O'Brian onto the screen as Preserved Killick.Rousing battles, lavish production, delightful details, and just enough of the wit and humanity of the books to raise the whole above the typical naval yarn. It might not be the adaptation we dreamed of seeing, but it's far beyond that which we had any right to expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly recommended viewing, both gripping and educating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a line in Master and Commander, uttered by Russell Crowe's Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey, to his friend and Ship's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) who is setting off an an expedition of the Galapagos Islands (the movie's one sojourn on land), where he asks for a plant to be named after himself, "one that is prickly and difficult to eradicate". It's a nice exchange between the two men, and seems apt, in that it sums up Aubrey . This is a ship's captain after all who has taken his men on a voyage across to the far side of the world, chasing what seems to be his own Moby Dick, a French frigate the Acheron, which he has been assigned to stop from taking the war across the world. The film opens with Aubrey's ship HMS Surprise taking a pummelling from the French, but having managed to evade this attack he sets of in pursuit for the rest of the film.This is absolutely cracking stuff. The aforementioned opening salvo is so realistic I thought I was there, each cannon blast ear shatteringly authentic. Proceedings settle down thereafter, with time given for characters to come to life. As well as Aubrey and Maturin, there is the second in command Tom Pullings and the midshipmen Callamy, Hollum and the excellent Max Pirkis as Blakeney, as well as numerous sea dogs (including Hobbit Billy Boyd as the coxswain), too numerous though I'm afraid for me to remember them all. We are treated to a feel of what life on board must've been like, with all concerned interacting wonderfully with each other. Aubrey is always in command though, and Crowe portrays him as strong and at times authoritarian, a man who doesn't lie down and say no. His relationship with Maturin is crucial, and Bettany provides a perfect foil. A smart man of science, who is our view into this hard world. The first scene of the two of them playing their violin and cello together, is almost ironic. One of the movie's best scenes has the two of them discussing whether or not they should be continuing the chase, and it's well played by both men.This is genuinely classy stuff. It's inevitable that comparisons will be made to the other sea-faring movie of the year, Pirates of the Caribbean, but it's not vaguely in the same class, and face it, if the pirates had been up against Aubrey he'd have sunk them in the first five minutes of the movie. I don't like to compare when they are so different though, but if it's authenticity you seek, and the feel of what it was like to be in the British Navy circa 1805, Master and Commander is the film for you.Hmmm, lemme see, I'd give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very much worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off - thanks, Peter Weir ! Thanks - first and foremost for not turning this masterpiece into yet another inane action slugfest for the 'attention deficit disordered' crowds. Thanks for sticking to detail, flavour and authenticity, a considered pace, smart dialogue and a glance at a world when the "far side" of the globe really was half a world (and months of travel) away !'nuff said As for the movie, this is _not_ another action slugfest with wild explosions, high-paced chases (the "chase" here takes place at a leisurely 12 knots, app 20km/h or 14mph ), wire Kung-fu melees (cutlass, axes and pikes anyone ? ) and skipping over the (sometimes high) price of victories won. If you want slick battles and heroic antics, look elsewhere. With a grand 150 minutes running time both the actors and the setting have enough time to establish themselves in telling the deceptively simple story (guess what - it is not, but many of the turns and twists are happening within the narrow confines and among the crew of a man-o-war) of the frigate "HMS Surprise"s stubborn chase of a much larger French privateer around Cape Horn and far out into the great pacific ocean - transmitting a very accurate feel of the "why"s "how"s and "where"s of the story, with a plethora of subplots, plenty of nods to the "Aubrey/Maturin" series by Patick O'Brian ( who, I guess will not rotate utterly disgusted in his grave, even though they really hashed up his series' original plot - which was to be expected), scenes to make you flinch (19th century onboard surgery makes one truly thankful for modern painkillers) and a lot of very british humour - at times bawdy and old fashioned, but great fun nevertheless.Of course - the more history you know, the funnier and engrossing this movie gets, and I suspect readers of O'Brians novels of having a clear advantage - yet my "not-so-book-wormish female companion" had an excellent time and enjoyed herself immensely - at least she suggested seeing the movie again a few days hence ( This might have been due to Mr Crowe, though ). So I guess the story-telling is engrossing and concise enough - at least if you can stand five minutes screentime without yet another blazing gun-fight or massive explosions. And when the battles occur, they hit you full force - no punches pulled, just utter mayhem, violence and destruction. As for the precise, detailed and authentic outfitting, the ships themselves, the depiction of storms, damages and high seas and the long slow passages of sailing - breathtaking.The acting is solid to exceptional - Russel Crowe is the perfect choice for beefy, large bodied and physical Jack Aubrey, and Paul Bettany does wonders as his academic (read - frustrated naturalist and philosopher ) friend, conversational foil and resident genius ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin.The same holds true for the supporting cast who bring the sailors and officers of the "Surprise" to vivid life, especially James D'Arcy ( Tom Pullings), George Innes ( Plaice), David Threllfall (Killick ) and Max Pirkis (Lord Blakenley ), often by subtle acting in the background or with short comments. Kudos must go to Director Peter Weir for pulling this of - especially as the crew is clad in drab, tattered naval uniformity - and gets few distinctive lines besides "yessir". To judge just how hard this can be, go watch "Blackhawk Down"..... you live with them, you suffer with them, you know their habits and faults. No higher praise could be expected. The camerawork is good, with some great, moody shots and the soundtrack is acceptable, softly underscoring the events, but nothing very distinct, the movies only serious shortcoming, IMHO. The short interludes of classical music being played by the actors do not distract or grate either - lucky us.Certainly one of the top three movies this year - miss at your own displeasure !nine out of ten salvoes from me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the detail that counts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, forget what the film leaves out from the book. O'Brian wrote a 20 novel long saga and the movie takes bits from a few to make this. O'Brian was never that interested in the plot, but more the human side and the emotional drama and that is what Weir has given us. I was worried this movie would dumb down the book and leave us with a meat-headed action-fest, but it captures the flavour of O'Brian's canon so well. The music of Jack and Stephen, the conflict between the warrior and the scientist, but still with the friendship that underpins it. What also makes this film excellent is the human side to the HMS Surprise: it's not the ship or the mission that is important, it's the crew...we see the men bond, whether below decks or in the wardroom with the good natured officers. So many Hollywood movies portray the British as pompous, tea drinking stuffed shirts obsessed with class. In M&amp;C, they are not mere national stereotypes but men with feelings who show joy, playfulness, devotion to duty, superstition, bravery and deep sadness and remorse. When characters are killed, we feel their loss and share it with the survivors. And that's the wonderful subtext to Weir's movie; the human element of a bygone age. I feel he truly understands O'Brian's work not as nautical potboilers, but as a character study of the men who fought in the age of fighting sail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is just about one of the finest and most see-worthy films of the year. Russell Crowe is at it again in the clothes of a natural hero, this time a certain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey, and with director Peter Weir we are taken on a journey of revenge that goes to the very far sides of the world. What is perhaps most to admire of the film is its excellent realism. The very first 15 minutes are perhaps the finest, most exciting and dazzling 15 minutes of the year. Jack Aubrey and his crew of seamen are attacked by French fregate Acheron, and the battle is downright intense. Saving Private Ryan redone in the early 19th century, well, I'm very amazed. Also, Paul Bettanys character, Stephen Maturin, adds an excellent supporting character which helps us take interest on the happenings on the ship, the HMS Surprise. What came most unexpected (to me, anyway) was the fact that in this movie, we get to delve into our characters in a way not yet seen in huge blockbusters. This risk was worth taking, as this drama keeps the crew alive and believable. Even if we might drive into some slow parts at times, I can't help to be fascinated by the authentic portrayal of the wars at sea, and even if it is a little slow at times, the beautiful shots, interesting characters, and spectacular battle scenes create one of the best films of the year, which is highly recommended. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Sea Tale, totally NOT either book! A misrepresentation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful and salty sea tale. It is superbly made. But it is not, simply not either Master and Commander or The Far Side of The World. These are two great books and the director and writer borrowed liberally from both, but not even enough to make it even close to the excellence of O'Brien's original works. If you have not read the books, then it is a fine film, but if you are looking for traces of these brilliant novels, you will only find tiny tidbits, lifted from the books. This film was made from whole cloth, and the book titles were used simply for commercial purposes as not that many viewers have read the books. A lot of the scenes in the film never happened in either book and so very much was either distorted or left out. (I have read them all, some twice, "Far Side" is one of my favorites) If The Lord of The Rings series had done the same thing, there would have been riots at the theaters... the Ring makers stuck to the stories as much as time would allow, Weir and company simply made a fine sea epic and stole the book titles, although I did enjoy the film totally, it was not even close to what the books were. Go see it for its classic elegance as a "real old time movie" but not to see the stories as written. The CGI battle and ocean storm scenes were superb, the texture and the mood were quite realistic (an old Coast Guard officer speaking here) but it simply was not either book, a pale imitation... Also the casting of Capt. Jack Aubrey was way off base, not even close to the real thing - Russell Crowe is a superb actor, but he is not Jack Aubrey... and Stephen Maturin was totally wrong... in the book he is a small, short, dark, unattractive man, and totally unlike the actor Paul Bettany that was selected for the role. All the other roles were superbly cast, however, but I do have worries about Killick. Read the books. Or even better, get the Books on Tape read by British Actor Patrick Tull. They are far better than the movie. Ah, Hollywood!</fullReview>

The (very few) action scenes are worth the price of the ticket and the special effects take you to that high-sea adventure effortlessly.The problem I found with this movie is the low entertainment value. Crowes other and better known historical epic, "Gladiator," has a gripping, involving story. "Master" on the other hand looks like something more suitable for the History Channel or Bravo than the multiplex.This story is the second in a series of books made on the same character, and in a way, the movie feels like a sequel without being one. The characters are introduced as if we already know them and some of their intentions or problems are not really explained.Still it is a very good movie, not great, but good. It possibly needed a better balance between the action scenes and the scenes that pushed the plot development, again, like in "Gladiator." The action scenes in this movie are too few and far between. A shame because the climatic battle scene at the end is one, if not the best naval battle scene ever made for a movie.</fullReview>

The battle scenes are reminiscent of swashbucklers "The Sea Hawk", "Captain Blood" and the like. Difference is, the latter have better "setups" than Master and Commander.

		<fullReview>The trailers for this movie were deceiving, but so are most. Its sad trailers have to put in almost every action scene they have just to get people's attention, but in this case action played very little in Master and Commander.There are some very well done action scenes, but this was really a movie about life on a navy battleship in the early 1800's. It was interesting seeing, for what maybe was the first time, all the children who lived on the boat with the men (scary thought), and brought home the origin of the term, son-of-a-gun. (Look up the origin, it's interesting.) Even some of the officers were just teenagers.But even as a human drama and a "this is how they used to live back then", the movie still came up short at time. This movie had greatly done cinematography, but the story itself was poorly told and dragged many times. (The excuse that that was how life was on ships sometimes is no excuse; you don't have to show 15 minutes of nothing happening to give people an idea that nothing is happening.) Another shortcoming was that the director wasn't able to convey a sense of time lapse. One scene would cut to the next, and then they casually mention 3 weeks have gone by, but you never get a sense of that. But the arguments between the captain and the ship's doctor were good, most of the actors did a great job, and again there was very good camera work and the action sequences were done well.I'd rate it a 7/10, but again, don't think this is an action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit that I've never read the Patrick O'Brian books. I went and saw this purely for the enjoyment factor. This also means that nothing other than my enjoyment was at stake.The movie itself moves quickly and truly gives you a feeling for the life that these people led at sea. Russel Crowe and the rest of the supporting cast are wonderfully convincing, making one forget at times that you are watching a movie. Invested in all the characters I really felt for them as they lived their daily lives in a small wooden ship, at the whim of whatever Nature and Napolean could throw at them.*Caution* This May Spoil It for some people.The plot for the movie is deceptively simple compared to what you see on film. Jack Aubrey has orders to defend the Brazilian cost. When the H.M.S Surprise is attacked he takes these orders into his own hands and chases the attacking ship for all it's worth. But that isn't what the Director seems to be interested in. Peter Wier gives us the chase, but he shows so much more as well.If you're not into realistic battle scenes and the hard, rather dirty, and very cramped life of the professional sailor this movie is not for you. If you are, and you want to see as close as a filmmaker can get to the real thing, the film is definitely a must see.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been able to lose myself in the film I am watching. I drove up the long Texas driveway with Elizabeth Taylor in Giant, flew over the desert with the English Patient, stood with Lawrence on the sand dune as he twirled in his new costume....but never have I felt such a part of a place as I did last night sitting in a theater while the ship and crew of the Surprise welcomed me into their world, thanks to the genius of Peter Weir and his crew.It was like a magic door opening, and then, on the other side, standing in the small, fragile, impossibly crowded little ship along with Killick and Captain Howard and Nagle - with William Warley and Faster Doudle, with the midshipmen, the officers - sharing their discomfort and pride, their suffering and exhilaration - as they follow their Captain to the far ends of the earth.The first thing you hear when the theater lights lower is the wind and the creaking of the wood, and the ropes chaffing one another.. It is silent as the camera carries you onto the deck of the ship just before the change of watch. Two officers watch the fog through spy glasses - and see something there. There is a call to arms, and you go below again where all you can see though the muted lamp light are silent rows and rows of gray drooping cocoon-like figures swaying back and forth. Then one after another the men crawl from those cocoons - their hammocks - and go up to the deck to begin their "Day." The camera pans past them, through midshipmen and marines getting ready for duty, till it stops at gnarled hands tightening a belt, pulling on a shirt -and there at last stands the captain - Jack Aubrey of the the HMS Surprise.This is not a blockbuster film, despite the rousing bookend battles that enclose the plot. It is a thoughtful study of a ship of the British line, and of the men who live in it. Everyday ship happenings - the times of sadness and horror, the humor, the character of the men - captain and crew - are the true soul of Master and Commander. We grow to know all of them, even the lowliest powder monkey, and we become part of their lives.Most memorable to me were Max Pirkis as Midshipman Blakeney - eight years old, an innocent, but full of courage and grit and intelligence. Someday you just know he will be a fine ship captain too; Lee Inglebey as Midshipman Hollum, a man who was not made for the sea; Robert Pugh as sailing master, Master Allen, gruff, with a laugh to fill a room, and more knowledge of sails and ships than anyone else on board - except for Jack Aubrey; Paul Bettany as Steven Maturin, friend, fellow musician, brilliant scientist and doctor. His face in the scene where he operates on himself, mirroring what his body was feeling, was acting of the finest.Finally, the soul of the ship and the movie, Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey. A bluff man, a canny leader, caring yet tough, courageous, reckless at times, always loving the Surprise (there is one scene where he defends it from the charge of being old, talking as he rubs his hands over the wood of a shattered doorway, that tells it all). Once again Crowe turns what could have been a stock, seafaring character into a man of great depth and feeling. The anguish in his face during a violent storm, when he must choose between man and ship, brought tears to my eyes. At the end, his quiet Our Father takes those who have died in battle to their home in the sea. He makes you see how he - and you - will miss and remember all those who fell to defend their little part of England - off on the far side of the world.*************************In retrospect, I wish I had not seen all the trailers and shows about the movie. There are scenes that were very familiar already. One should come to this film, as my daughter did, unsuspecting of what will be seen. She loved it. And I did too, even if my enjoyment was partly that of seeing an old friend (the film) made whole at last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a historical war movie with no Americans in it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I laughed my socks off at some of the negative reviews of this film but I can understand why a fan of say Pirates Of The Caribbean might find this a bit dull in comparison.This is the Royal Navy old chap, stiff upper lip with understated British emotion, other than when Frenchie is off the port bow.I think I really enjoyed this film purely for the fact that so few movies are made these days about the British Empire and the Royal Navy. Those that have included them usually show them in a negative light as either the baddies or incompetent such as in The Patriot. This movie returns to the tradition of movies like Zulu, showing the British serviceman as a gallant fellow fighting for what they believe in. Okay it's not perfect, the editing is too choppy for me, but as an Englishman and with so few movies made of this genre these days its hard not to embrace it.For those who don't understand the historical relevance, there's clearly a tie in with Paul Bettany's character and the trip made by Darwin on the Beagle to the Galapagos islands to fine tune his book the Origins Of Species. Without that information the viewer might wonder why the obsession with visiting those islands in the movie.A sequel would have been wonderful but alas probably won't happen. A modern version of Sink The Bismark would be wonderful but alas, once again, probably won't happen. Shame. I suppose we'll just have to make do with movies about fantasy pirates and over the top military escapades with the US Navy such as Battleship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw master and commander, the far side of the world yesterday. Well I didn't like it that much. The movie depicts the fight between a French ship, Acheron and an English ship, HMS Surprise in the period of Napoleon Bonaparte's quest to conquer England. The English ship under the command of Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), fight back hard against the powerful and big French ship. The movie depicts the journey of ship through the sea, the hardship faced by him and his crew and the victory achieved at last over Acheron.Let me be honest while writing this review. There are some sequences which I liked about the movie. The first sequence of escape from the more powerful French ship, Acheron, was witty. The last sequence was also nicely shown. However, the movie passes through a phase of dullness where nothing really happens and it can lead you to boredom. The movie offers a lot about the history where battles were fought in sea and with ships. The cruel lives of the seamen were also nicely depicted but the movie itself failed to keep the momentum going throughout its run time.I wouldn't say its a bad movie, but the storytelling was weak and loose in some parts of the movie, while it was spectacular in others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing spectacular but an entertaining spectacle nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and commander was a good effort at creating a big action picture out at sea. I say effort because although it was entertaining, there were no 'wow' moments and there was a constant sense of deja-vu, as if we've been here before. However on a brighter note, Russell Crowe was excellent as the ship's captain , very convincing throughout and had some fine moments, particularly in speeches to the crew. Yet, I don't know whether others suffered from this issue, but in some scenes, crowe would just say something and the whole crew would just burst out laughing. ??????? And then your left there thinking...whats so funny ??? Anyway , Paul Bettany was also excellently cast as the ship's doctor and he was a likable character - He and crowe 'kept the ship afloat' ( pardon the pun ).However, though it did build up tension at points, I felt this movie did suffer from various lulls in the story. To illustrate...it's based around an unknown enemy stalking crowe's ship. At the end of the movie, you still don't actually know the identity of the enemy which is more than frustrating. This movie received 10 academy award nominations which surprised me , especially as 2003 was a good year at Hollywood. I'm just glad it got beaten by the epic conclusion to the lord of the rings saga.I can't say I loved master and commander, it was a well-directed movie but I feel that in order to benefit from this film, you need 2 things: a passion for ships and a knowledge of 16th-17th Century History. Neither of these do I possess. Neither , I would imagine, does any other late teens or young people. Therefore, I could only recommend this movie to older people who actually gain pleasure from watching men randomly laugh at each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best historical drama about small unit leadership since ZULU</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 major battle scenes, brilliant acting, historical realism on a scale seldom seen. An intelligent script which requires that the audience actually remember things said over an hour ago. This may qualify as a spoiler, maybe not: One critic missed the point completely, when he thought--what a wonderfully convenient thing that the enemy the captain (Crowe) was supposed to be searching for, just happened to show up while he dawdled allowing his best-friend and ship's doctor (Betany), to recover from serious injury on an island. Had the critic paid just a little attention to the fact that the island Captain Aubrey had chosen for the surgery and recovery also happened to have the only source for drinking water in god knows how many miles, he might have put two and two together and realized Aubrey was making the best of two problems : his ships need for a doctor (along with his personal need to keep his friend alive) and choosing the only spot where his French opponent sooner or later would need to drop anchor for water. Consequently his waiting there while Steven recovers could not reasonably be criticized as dilatory. As for boring-- that is in the brain of the beholder. I first saw it at a Sunday matinée in Phoenix with an audience largely male but primarily 10-twenty something and NOBODY got raucous or seemed restless, laughed when they should have and heard generally favorable comments walking out. I think a large number of the unbelievably low scores of one star out of ten it gets when when you search lowest scores to highest here at IMDb result from expectations of a swash-buckler a la Pirates of the Caribbean. It is a high- adventure movie AND a serious drama about duty and friendship which makes it a rare bird these days. Not really a date move, but a surprising number of women I know have enjoyed it. Not as many as loved Gladiator enough to see it twice in its theatrical run, but quite a few; none I have talked to thought of it as a typical male-bonding flick. Well worth more than one look if you are looking for entertainment that doesn't insult your intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just to be fair a couple of factors are going to influence my review:I was a devoted fan of the P O'Brian Aubrey / Maturin novels before seeing the film. Of lesser importance but still relevant, I served in the RN for 6 years (enjoyed it but don't regret leaving either..).In summary, I had more than a passing interest in (and affection for) the subject matter before seeing the film.It's difficult for me to judge the movie as a stand alone entity: for me it'll always be a companion piece to the books. Like many other viewers, I sat down to watch it with a sense of curiosity and some apprehension: will it do the books justice? Which characters will they include? etc. etc.To quote Emily Wilson in the Guardian: "People love the books for different reasons. Sailing buffs adore O'Brian's remarkable attention to accuracy and detail when it comes to life on board a ship of war in the early 1800s. (By about book six, one feels one could confidently captain a ship-of-the -line to India and back, or perhaps throw together a jury rudder, without too much loss of face.) Naturalists adore the bugs, birds and wombats dear Maturin lugs aboard at every port - he's a keen collector, as well as an excellent and adventurous ship's surgeon. Spy buffs adore his secret life as a top intelligence officer - when he's not sawing someone's skull off in a force nine gale, or filling the captain's cabin with bees, he is generally to be found ashore on some perilous mission against the evil French/Spanish/Americans."Other reasons are the deftly handled comedy running throughout the books - more of which later - and the visceral, heart pounding sea battles, often the crescendos to expertly ramped up passages of tension. You can almost smell the slow match burning, feel the anticipation as the ship finally clears for action and the gun crews run 'em out.I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. I was completely immersed from the opening minutes of the film, when the Acheron's broadside came thundering out of the fog and swept the Surprise's deck. I thought the pacing and structure of the film was perfect: the temptation or potential studio pressure to 'over Hollywood' the thing, to cram in battle after artificial battle sequence, was resisted. The result is much more authentic for me.The attention to detail was spot on but, to be honest, it should be with the amount and quality of source material: anything less would have been criminal from the producers. It's more a tribute to Patrick O'Brian's research on the subject than anything.One observation rather than criticism concerns the two main protagonists: Aubrey's character came across to me as less flawed, less comical than in the books: his often hilarious ineptitude in most areas of life other than fighting his ship was missing, but then there wasn't much opportunity to show his being 'all at sea on land'. I also thought this coloured the on screen relationship between him and Maturin and that the balance wasn't quite right: Maturin's character sometimes comes across as slightly weak in comparison overall. Then there's the near complete lack of plot relating to Maturin being an eminent intelligence agent, bar one brief hint. But then there wasn't really the opportunity to show this true depth either.This perhaps curtailed (did you smoke it...) on-screen portrayal of the two principal characters (versus the wonderful depth in the novels) is potentially the main issue for some viewers, particularly in Maturin's case. I can understand it but ultimately it didn't bother me too much. I accepted it as part of an inevitable loss in adapting such detailed source material into a 2 hour screen play.Special mention goes to David Threlfall's Twice Preserved Killick, a real joy to watch. I agree Billy Boyd was slightly miscast as Bonden but in the grand scheme it wasn't a problem for me.I think the movie's greatest achievement is that its simultaneously a great screen adaption of the novels and a great stand alone movie in it's own right (though as I said the latter is harder for me to judge).I'm not sure about a sequel: it'll be hard to improve on this. Perhaps in hindsight the ideal scenario would have been to make a trilogy, with each movie roughly drawing from the corresponding third of books, so that the first film would have been set before this one. Maybe they should make a prequel - Cacafuego anyone?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fabulous film in all respects. The actors are all and I mean ALL absolutely spot on with their performances. Russell Crowe, in particular, plays the part of the Captain perfectly, with just the right mix of the stern mixed with a good sense of humor. Paul Bettany, one of the worlds' most underrated actors, interplays perfectly as the ships' surgeon with Crowes' Captain. I'm not much of a sailor (especially when dealing with a huge ship), but all the seamanship type work was all done very realistically. Action? You want action? PLENTY! They're chasing a French privateer during the Napoleonic wars and they end up slugging it out very realistically, with splintered wood flying everywhere. There's close quarters fighting as well after boarding the enemy ship. Men were men back then! A very enjoyable action thriller!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While the film lacks traditional thrills and pacing, it gets huge marks for replicating what life was like at sea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is a very unusual film because the filmmakers obviously were not attempting to make yet another Hollywood style blockbuster. Instead, they seemed to be doing the impossible--make a film that tries very hard to replicate what life was like at sea back during the Napoleonic Wars. As a retired history teacher, this is the sort of stuff I love--even if in the original, the 'bad guys' were actually the Americans and it was set during the War of 1812! I assume they changed the enemy to the French to make the film more marketable. After all, it would be a hard sell in the large American market to get the audiences to root for the British Navy in this altercation! The story occurs around the beginning of the 19th century. The Brits and French have been fighting off and on for almost a decade (and would continue to do so until 1815). The action is set aboard a British Naval ship commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe). His ship has encountered a larger and faster French vessel and managed to escape. However, instead of running, Crowe plays a very determined man--and spends much of the film hunting down this ship. Along the way, there are lots of adventures--mostly of the variety you might actually have seen during the era. I could talk about them, but frankly this would spoil the suspense.Overall, while this film is very slowly and deliberately paced (which will obviously turn off some viewers), the film is so expertly crafted that for a reasonably patient viewer, it should be a very engaging film. The film looks great--with a lot of attention to details and accuracy. It also has the best looking sea footage you can find in a period film--especially when the ship is rounding the Cape (it must have been amazing on the big screen). The acting is lovely as well--understated but quite realistic. Well done in every way and the director really deserves kudos for this one. While I love films from the same period as "Damn the Defiant", "Captain Horatio Hornblower", "Mutiny on the Bounty" and the like, clearly "Master and Commander" is superior when it comes to accurately portraying the life of a seaman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A damnably fine show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the Aubrey/Maturin novels I was slightly worried about seeing the film, as book adaptions often have a habit of going ary and become not so much entertainment for the audience as much as a form of mild torture. Master and Commander however is perhaps the best book adaption I have ever seen, it was an absolute joy to watch from beginning to end, and a general knowledge of 18-early 19th century ships just makes the whole thing even better. The sheer detail of the film was just incredible (Pirates of the Caribbean eat your heart out) Not a belaying pin out of place(apart of course from when the Surprise gets hammered in that extraordinary first combat). One of the masterstrokes of the film was not to base the film on any one specific book, Eg in Master and Commander Mr Pullings is only a 2nd lieutenant and Aubrey is captain of the Sophie.Yet still retaining the relationships between the characters (especially between Captain Aubrey and Stephen Maturin) which is one of the great cornerstones of the novels. The whole film was Exiting, realistic, heartfelt and in some places just a really good laugh as the film contains many of Aubrey's finest jokes.Thoroughly recommended; be you sailor, lubber or just a true film lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe is a very convincing Jack Aubrey. He projects Aubrey's energy, competence, pugnacity and confidence bordering on self-satisfaction (unlike Hornblower, Aubrey always knew he was good). He also credibly projects Aubrey's belief in the need for custom, tradition and authority, his acceptance of the irrational culture of the lower deck as a fact of life that must be dealt with, and his own irrational streak. Crowe's Aubrey is true to O'Brian's instinctive Tory. He is intelligent but not an intellectual, and he knows that the ignorant, superstitious masses have to be dominated from above rather than uplifted. A.O. Scott of the NY Times got it right when he wrote that this "one of the most thoroughly and proudly conservative movies ever made," for which he expected to see Edmund Burke get screen credit. Scott also got it right when he described Aubrey as "an ideal personification of modern executive authority" and wrote "'Master and Commander,' were it not a movie, could be a Powerpoint seminar advertised in an airline magazine: Leadership Secrets of the Royal Navy." Maturin will be the biggest disappointment to serious O'Brianists. Bettany gives a good performance, but the part is badly written. The Maturin of the books is a scientific rationalist, but of his time and place. Much of the pleasure of the character is to see what he knows, what he doesn't know, and what he thinks he knows that we know isn't so. The Maturin of the books is also, in his peculiar way, devoted to the defeat of Napoleon and the overthrow of all the French Revolution stands for. One might think of this Irish-Catalan outsider as a neo-conservative of his day. A former Irish revolutionary, he has become a devoted supporter of the existing order out of revulsion with his personal experience of radicalism and its consequences, and he puts his considerable intellect at the service of victory.The Maturin of the movie is an anachronism, not merely outside the culture of the Navy but unsympathetic to it. He isn't merely upset that the ship's mission interferes with his naturalizing, as the Maturin of the books often is. He disputes with Aubrey the need for the mission itself and the intensity with which Aubrey pursues it. O'Brian's Maturin is a dedicated, competent and merciless secret agent for the Admiralty. Weir's Maturin isn't an intelligence agent, and I can't see how he could be or would want to be.Weir also wastes Maturin's great narrative potential as an explainee. In his 15th century text on painting, Alberti wrote that a religious or historical scene should always include an "interlocutor" in the foreground; a figure who draws the viewer into the picture. Since few people in Western societies have military experience any more, a good modern war movie needs an interlocutor, both to inform the audience what is going on and to be an emotional intermediary, reacting as one not hardened to war. Leutnant Werner does this job in Das Boot, Corporal Upham in Saving Private Ryan.Maturin was O'Brian's interlocutor. His peculiar inability to learn anything about seamanship gave O'Brian the chance to have members of the gunroom explain things to him repeatedly, as well as some low comedy when Maturin tried passing this knowledge on to those even more ignorant than he. With very minor exceptions, Weir doesn't use Maturin this way. He limits Maturin's interactions pretty much to Aubrey and Blakeny, leaving out the kind of easy social intercourse with the other officers through which O'Brian fed the reader technical information. His Maturin is also too emotionally distant from the struggle in which he is involved; he sulks and almost sneers, but he does not seem moved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>History, explosions, Vaughan Williams - what more do you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Brit with an interest in History, this film had instant appeal to me and I looked forward to it. I'm not a big fan of Russell Crowe the person but as an actor, he is without doubt one of the best of his generation.And so it proved. The attention to historical detail is captivating. Some people may not understand the plot about the Officer who commits suicide because the crew thinks he has evoked a curse on the ship. But during the Napolenic Wars, naval crews gave much attention to folklore and superstition and were constantly looking for symbolic events that dictated positive change. Likewise crews were always on the lookout for someone or something to blame when the tide or winds were against.The claustrophobic and squalid nature of life below deck compared with the relative luxury and decadence of the Captains cabin is very accurate. But what takes the film to another level is the relationship between Crowe and Bettany - one a dynamic leader with total focus on the task in hand, the other, an academic with a humanitarian heart. Socially and intellectually they are poles apart and yet are best friends. Crowe has to wrestle with his own conscience when his friend has a near death experience. An historical epic and buddy movie rolled into one.The cat and mouse chase across the Southern Atlantic and round the Cape is fabulous. The battle scenes are brutal and exhilarating. But for me, the soundtrack was the clincher. Using Fantasia from a Theme of Thomas Tallis by Ralph Vaughan Williams provides one of the greatest movie soundtracks in living memory. How fitting that a classical music masterpiece is used in an historical masterpiece.Brilliant stuff!!</fullReview>

As a result, I wasn't very excited about it upon its initial release. However, I was pleasantly surprised not only by how good it was but also by how intelligent. It does have the feel of a good old-fashioned Hollywood swashbuckling adventure, but it's also got a brain in its head, thanks to its screenplay and the careful performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany, as the ship's captain and right-hand man, respectively.The special effects are amazing, but so subtly so that it might be easy to dismiss them. I remember thinking how much better the effects were in this than in "The Lord of the Rings," which won that year's Oscar for visual effects, after seeing how they were accomplished.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films, and in my opinion, one of the most well crafted movies I have ever seen. I love movies that really put you into the time and place that they depict, particularly with historical films, and this will leave you feeling as if you were there for every second of it. If you ever wondered what it may have been like to sail with the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars...well, this is the closest you'll ever get.The performances, particularly by Crowe and Paul Bettany are flawless. The screenplay is brilliantly written, the cinematography is exquisite, and the direction by the masterful Peter Weir is perfect in every way. The film could have taken the easy way out and focused mostly on battle scenes, but those come second to the story and well crafted characters. And trust me, when you actually care about the characters, any battle scenes that happen will be 100 times more intense than any of the bland, underdeveloped action films Hollywood churns out.That being said, the battle scenes are incredible, and will leave you on the edge of your seat. The film really leaves me with no doubt that this is what naval battles of this type, during this time period, would have been like. There is also an incredible scene during a storm that has to be seen to be believed. It is so realistic, that I cannot fathom how it was done.So, in a word, BRILLIANT. If you are a film fan who appreciates good writing, directing, acting, and cinematography, see this immediately. You will be utterly captivated from first frame to last. I would love to see more books in this series turned into films, with Peter Weir at the helm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rum,bum and concertina...............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patrick O'Brian is the John le Carre of the sea story.Where the earlier acknowledged masters of the genre(C.S.Forrester always excepted)often gave life in King George's Navy a gloss of glamour it never possessed,Mr O'Brian detailed it with a cold eye for the squalor of the Lower Deck.He also invested his adventure stories with the trappings of literacy - involved plotting,character development,historical research that,combined,made him virtually sui generis. Certainly "Lucky Jack" Aubrey and Dr Stephen Maturin are 20th century men nearly 200 years before their time. The good doctor is brave and cool - headed enough to operate on himself to remove a lead ball form his chest,passionate enough to play a Bach gigue on his cello,percipient enough to grasp the significance of the Galapagos Islands to Naturalists and stubborn enough to gainsay his Captain who,after all,has power of life and death over his crew. He is the mirror - image of Aubrey himself,who,if a slightly less complex character,shares many of his friend's qualities. Life for the crew - many of whom would have been press - ganged - was generally recognised to centre round "Rum,bum and concertina" and two of the three are well represented in "Master and Commander".The third may be read in the glances given to some of the many very young boys scampering round the gundecks. Aubrey (Mr Russell Crowe) is respected and feared by his crew.Whilst by no means a tyrant,he knows that sometimes discipline can only be maintained by taking hard action and does not hesitate to do so when faced with a potentially explosive incident caused by inaction by a weak officer. This is a long movie,but the strength of the plot and the quality of the performances and,above all,the realistic scenes aboard ship in heavy seas and in battle,the creaking ropes,the decks slippery with blood,the deafening roar of the guns and their devastating effect on wood and flesh,keep it sharp and riveting. For all his acuity,Captain Aubrey is not omnipotent,and this frailty - if it be one - makes him even more sympathetic,as the end of the movie proves. An exceptionally well - made movie that makes one hope for a sequel - and I don't write that often.</fullReview>

Wonderful tho they may be, they are less then stirring, and detract, more then contribute, to the overall atmosphere of the the picture.

		<shortDescription>A Rather Interesting Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a pretty enjoyable film if not a bit over-hyped and overrated. I can see why this film was nominated for several of the Oscars. This film is a decent film that tells a story about naval warfare between the English and the French in the early 1800's.This film tells a simple story. The main characters are the captain and the doctor. The other crew members just blends in the whole tale.The acting is phenomenal. Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, and Billy Boyd did very good jobs. They were believable and they did not seem to make any mistakes.The scenery is great. I saw some nice shots of the ocean and the islands.Most people might not agree with me on this fact, but I could'not help feel somewhat bored during some scenes of the movie. This is why my rating is pretty low for a great review like this.Overall, this is a great movie. Peter Weir did a great job. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film-not necessarily Oscar material though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Relatives of mine who saw this said it wasn't very good because it had only twenty minutes of action and two hours of contemplating strategies of war. Yes, the movie does have some action, (mainly made up of a skirmish in the start and a large fight at the end), however the real goodness in this movie comes from how the characters interact with one another. This makes the movie, at least to me, very enjoyable to watch. "Master and Commander: The far Side of the World" is about friendship and how a captain keeps his men together as one over a rough sea voyage and defeat their French attackers. I liked many of the technical aspects to the film such as; the sound editing, photography, and visual effects. The work of the costume designers and set-decorators brings an 18th century to life. And the performances are flawless, particularly on Crowe's and Bettany's part. This is one of 2003's best films; however, I think it did not deserve 10 academy award nominations (winning two). Yes, it is a great movie, but in my opinion, not necessarily Oscar material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marketing and questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated it the first time I watched Master and Commander!! Why and why did people not like it? Why did i change my mind? Let me explain, project and second guess! Well, let me tell you: It was the Marketing. The film with its trailer on TV and Internet marketed the movie as the New Pirates of the Caribbean. Big Ships, Big Battles, sword-fights and all. This raised especially after the success of Pirates, the expectation for Master and Commander to be alike. Yet, what the film really showed, was human relationships at sea, drama, with suspense elements some action and a battle here and there aboard an 18th century ship.That's why people's expectations were disappointed and in terms of Box Office revenue it dropped of so quickly from week 1 to week 2 but not to week 3. That is interesting.The Marketing promised and did not deliver! Would like to know who else had this experience, cheers, R</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>first rate adventure film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The major difficulty in selling an adventure film to an audience is that it is not an action film. A good adventure film usually has two action set-pieces, one at the beginning, one at the end, but most of the rest of the film is given over to questing, suspense, drama, humor. Occasionally an adventure film does wander close to the boundary of the action film - The Wild Bunch is so violent, the fact that its structure is that of an adventure film (rather similar to that of Stevens' Gunga Din) usually gets overlooked. On the other hand, some adventure films lack a violent set-piece - The Wizard of Oz is an adventure film as well as a musical, and nobody slugs it out in a fist-fest, although of course the Cowardly Lion offers to.Master and Commander is a first-rate adventure film. Those who complain of the long chase with its complicated back-story plot-twists miss the whole point - the adventure film is all about those back-story plot-twists. The reason is clear: the adventure itself is usually a very simple problem about how to get from one point on the map to another (where some great deed is to be accomplished, etc.); all the excitements and meanings of the experience are in the complications - Gunga Din can't become the hero of his film if the British soldiers don't stumble about making mistakes. Although essentially brave, good-natured men, the soldiers oft give in to temptations to be greedy, lazy, dishonest - never Gunga Din.Although Captain Aubrey is certainly at the center of his story, we only really learn why he is 'master of the ship and commander of the men' from the events that occur around him, and from his relationships with his friend, his sailors, and, though they meet only briefly, the French captain. He knows not only how to make the hard decisions but also how to live with them, and still maintain a relative calm and generosity.The film is magnificently photographed. The historical detail is very convincing. The acting is first-rate. And after it is over, you feel as though you have experienced something new and wondrously strange - you have lived an adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I've seen in quite a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was nothing in this film I didn't like. Folks, the naysayers of this movie probably missed the flash and dazzle of special effects (some call it eye-candy). But that was here. The attention to detail was magnificent. Crowe's acting was understated brilliance and I will be lumping him with the likes of Anthony Hopkins for mastery of the subtle nuance. Some have called it a slow film. On the contrary, the time is definitely compressed. Life on a ship at this time was long periods of nothing. In this film something was always going on even if it was just character development. There wasn't a character in the entire movie that you couldn't appreciate. I liked this movie so much I watched 5 times over the course of two days. A fine film worthy of great praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Peter Weir (Witness, Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show) this is a film I had previously tried twice, and, somehow, got bored in the first 15 or so minutes, I'm glad I stuck it out the third try. Basically it is 1805, during the Napoleonic war, and the Royal Navy ship HMS Surprise led by Capt. Jack Aubrey (Golden Globe nominated Russell Crowe) who is under orders to sink or capture the French attack ship. The film is basically battle, chat, battle, chat, battle, last chat, a bit repetitive, but still fun to watch, for the battles anyway. Also starring BAFTA nominated Paul Bettany as Surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin, The Lord of the Rings' Billy Boyd as Coxswain Barrett Bonden, James D'Arcy as 1st Lt. Tom Pullings, Lee Ingleby as Midshipman Hollom, George Innes as Able Seaman Joe Plaice, Mark Lewis Jones as Whaler Mr. Hogg, Chris Larkin as Royal Marines Capt. Howard, Richard McCabe as Surgeon's Mate Mr. Higgins, Robert Pugh as Master Mr. Allen, David Threlfall as Captain's Steward Preserved Killick and Max Pirkis as Midshipman Blakeney. The performances are good, the battles are all eye-catching, a good film. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual Effects and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 46 on the 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindblowing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It blew me away. Peter Weir crafts an immensely compelling, superbly acted sea-faring epic that does an impeccable job of making the audience feel as if they are shut up in a ship in the middle of the ocean. This ongoing battle with the mysterious phantom ship is a great device for some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, but the best aspects of the film is when they aren't in battle. It's the relationships between these complex characters that create the most engaging scenes and highlight the absolutely incredible performances from the entire cast, primarily Russell Crowe and the always underrated Paul Bettany. They both deserved Oscar-nods, as far as I'm concerned. The complexity of the ships friendships, leaderships and characters is some of the most well-written work of the decade. Just superb in every single way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the finest movies to realistically show what life was like in the days of fighting sail. Totally believable adventure-drama as British warship hunts down a much larger French man of war off the South American coast in 1805.Crowe brings Captain "Lucky Jack" Aubrey to life and fits the role perfectlt. He gets good support from his co-star Paul Bettany as the ships doctor-and naturalist Maturin . They both were good together in "A Beautiful Mind" and these two have a chemistry that works perfectly. Much attention is paid to historical detail and we get a good picture of what it was like to live-and fight on these wooden ships. We get to see all the details, the food, the cramped quarters, the thrill of the battles, the dangers of the sea and the monotony that existed when the ship was stuck in calm weather where not a breeze of wind was to be had. It was a tough life-and a dangerous one too and the film doesn't gloss it over. This one is up there with 1962's"Damn the Defiant" as one of the best sea adventures ever filmed.An intelligent and exciting movie, a rarity in todays age of dumbed down high concept so-called "movies".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful, tragic, moving, exciting and daring adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since Gregory Peck in "Captain Horatio Hornblower" in the 1950's have I been taken with a film about the sea, and in particular about the British navy. What is there not to like about this film. There is not a single weak performance in the film, and there are several that stand out. Russell Crowe almost makes you want to join his crew, even under the horrific conditions that prevailed in that time period. Paul Bettany plays the part of the doctor with great sensitivity which contrasts beautifully with his role as Silas in "The Da Vinci Code." Especially captivating is young Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney, the young midshipman who is obviously admired by all of the crew. And the performances go on and on. It is an adventure story, but also one that tests the boundaries between friendship and devotion to duty. The music that underscores the film is magnificent including a portion of Ralph Vaughn-Williams "Fantasia on the theme of Thomas Tullis" which is a quintessential piece of English composition, and one that I had wondered why had not been used in a film soundtrack before?I only regret that there has been no mention of a sequel, since the film left the door wide open for one.</fullReview>

It has the perfect blend of action and dialogue, moving from battle scenes and action to some very witty lines and also the tense and powerful scenes between Crowe and Bettany when conflict arises.The music score is brilliant in this film, including things like Bach, plenty of cello and violin music as both these instruments are what Aubry (CRowe) and Stephen (Bettany) ply in the film and wonderful directing from the amazing director who brought us 'The Truman Show'. The atmosphere in this film is great, realistically true to what it would've been like at the time and the plot is simplistic yet clever. I highly recommend this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe,(Capt. Jack Aubrey), gave an outstanding performance as a Captain of the very old "Tall Ships" era and their mighty sails and rough and tough crew members. This is a very realistic picture and full of adventure, as Jack Aubrey is chased by a French vessel and almost completely wiped out at sea and then proceeds to fight back at very bad odds. There are young men (boy's) a board serving as Cabin assistants and a very smart lad who enjoyed biology and samples of living creatures when ever they found the time to land. There is lots of action and not one woman aboard, however, the Captain did spot a very sexy and attractive gal along side the boat and you could almost read his thoughts. Great look back in History and the rough and tough life of being a sailor in the British Navy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of recent years (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mater and Commander isn't the least bit revolutionary ? it isn't going to change or advance cinema ? and it doesn't really tread any new ground, but it does what it does so well that I can't help but feel that it's one of the best films of recent years. It gets better every time I watch it (which is always the sign of a great film).What I like most about Master and Commander is the way that character drives the film rather action ? all too often it's the other way round with big budget films. But here there are only two big action sequences, one at the start and one at the end, and while they're exciting to watch, they're not as interesting as the relationships between the characters.The main relationship, and probably the most engaging, is the one between Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe, who's excellent in the film, although he doesn't really have to push himself) and Doctor Maturin (Paul Bettany, who's outstanding - he outshines Crowe). They're two very different people who work well together and who compensate each other's failings ? one is forceful and instinctive, while the other is thoughtful and reserved. But although they have different temperaments and opinions, they're both passionate and they both have a shared love of music ? when they play they can forget their differences and act in harmony. But while their arguments and their musical interludes say a lot about the dynamic between the two characters, it's the smaller things that are more telling. For example there's the way that Aubrey abandons chasing the French ship to go back to the Galapagos Islands so that the Doctor can be operated on after being accidentally shot. Like most men, Aubrey is loath to admit that he's worried about his friend, but the gesture says everything. Then later on the Doctor abandons his expedition on the island so that Aubrey can continue his pursuit of the French ship. Each man gives something up to help the other. And while that in itself doesn't make for earth-shattering cinema, it helps greatly in generating a warmth of feeling for the characters. It means that the final action sequence isn't just empty spectacle.I also like the relationships that the Captain and the Doctor share with the young Midshipman Blakeney. Again you get the see under the surface of the two men. Both kind of put on a façade of being tough (a façade that is necessary in such circumstances) but neither are unmoved when the kid has to have his arm amputated (the sounds in the amputation scene are outstandingly grotesque). And the Captain in particular is affected. He gives the kid a book about Nelson, and while again nothing is said, you can see that he feels guilty about indirectly inflicting such an injury upon a child.But the kid's tough and he befriends the doctor, almost becoming his assistant. And again there are some good scenes between the two and again the cumulative effect is to build up good will for the characters. And it works completely. In the final action scene, when Blakeney and the Doctor fight alongside everyone else, you're more heavily invested in their fate. And there's a nice moment at the end when the one-armed kid stitches up the body bag of one of his dead friends. For once the characters don't feel like faceless pieces of meat whose only purpose is to be slaughtered for the audience's amusement. Their death at least has some sort of impact. But I also like the fact that there isn't any empty sentiment. Not much is said, and when it is said, like in Crowe reciting the names of the deceased at the end, it doesn't feel manipulative ? the emotions for once seem genuine.But the film is also bleak in parts. As well showing you what hell is must have been to be a sailor at such a time, there's the whole section about the 'Jonah' ? the sailor who's bad luck. He's hounded into committing suicide. I guess it shows how easily people resort to superstition when their lives hang on luck and the whims of nature. (The excellent drowning scene shows how perilous such a life can be.)However, although I like this section, it does kind of bring the narrative to a grinding halt. It seems like a film within a film, much more so than the interlude on the Galapagos Islands. But given the choice between that and empty action, I'd choose the nightmarish Jonah sequence any day.And I do have to say that as much as I like the film, the action isn't quite as thrilling as it could have been. I love the sound design, the splinters of wood and the photography (visually the film is magnificent ? some of the shots of the two ships fighting with the smoke and fire look like paintings), but the hand-to-hand combat feels a little pedestrian in the way that its staged and filmed. And it doesn't help that you know that Aubrey is going to be okay. In fact, that's one of the film's few problems. While you may not be certain about other characters surviving, you know that Aubrey is going to be fine. Just look at how many books his character has sustained.But I haven't mentioned one of my favourite things about the film: the music. Ordinarily such a film would attract a bombastic score, but Peter Weir opts mainly for classical music. And the pieces that he picks are superb. I especially like the piece that he uses when the Doctor is carried to the tent on the Galapagos Islands. It helps add another layer to the film. It gives it greater feeling. And that's the biggest compliment that I can give the film, that it not only works as spectacle but as a character piece too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb - This will remain my favourite film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought a video of this film, then a DVD because the surround sound is marvellous for the soundtrack of this film. I can't count the number of times I have watched it and as soon as I had seen it I began reading all of the Patrick O'Brian 'Aubrey and Maturin' books. When I cameto the end of the novels I felt quite bereaved. I hope that Aubrey and Maturin were not one film wonders and that further movies about the pair will eventually be made. O'Brian's research was impeccable and the film helps to bring the naval history of Napoleonic times truly to life. Crowe and Paul Bettany were also superbly cast, although Bettany does not quite resemble the Maturin of the books and there is little evidence of his spying activities. This is not a criticism however, simply an observation. Wonderful film. I think possibly my favourite of all time. AND... I am glad there were no women in it. I think if there had been it would have taken away the sheer adventurousness (is that a word?)of it. I almost forgot to mention the wonderful music score. I particularly liked the music Crowe and Bettany played in the times they weren't warding off the dastardly 'Acheron'. I am hoping that the soundtrack has been recorded. I haven't seen it on sale but I suspect it must be out there somewhere. One further point about the message written by the twenty year old girl. I am sixty four years old but this did not make me less enthralled with the 'action'. I could almost feel as if I were one of the crew of the 'Surprise', who were also marvellously cast. I am not a great 'movie goer' and so I missed seeing it on the big screen which I would not have done if I had known what a superb film it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fairly simple plot, but with memorable characters, a great director and full-blown, exciting attacks between the British and the French naval ships, this film manages to rise above the rest. One of the best relationships in this story is between Captain Jack Aubrey and Doctor Steven Maturin, seeing how they interact with each other, in a brother-like way. I am not a seafaring person, but I still found this movie enjoyable, with the history and sets (I am told) almost perfect. One of the truly touching scenes is when Lord Blakeney, a maimed boy, leads fully grown men into battle. Look out for the neat twist at the end. Real adventure movies like this are not made anymore.

		<fullReview>This movie took me by surprise. By the commercials for it, it seems like the movie would just be battle after battle. But Peter Weir is too good a director for that. The movie is based upon the best historical fiction books ever written, by author Patrick O' Brien. The cast was amazing. This is Russell Crowe's best performance since the Gladiator. Also has performances from Russell Crowe's, "A Beautiful Mind" costar Paul Bettany, "The Lord of the Rings" star Billy Boyd, British actor James D'Arcy, and new, but talented young actors. It teaches you a lot about what happened in the 19th century, between the British and the French. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in historical fiction movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, seasick. That's me, after watching this in the theater. I don't know if the DVD would have the same effect, though. Amazing that the rocking and the leaning during the heaviest of storms could have that effect on me when I'm only watching it, but it did. That is what I call film making at its best. I wondered, while watching this boat rocking back and forth, and knowing full well that it was not a real boat they were on, if the actors themselves got seasick? They must have! I don't see how they could miss, if they were at all prone to it.Anyway... this was a very heart wrenching movie about Captain Jack Aubrey of fictional fame. Such a story! I felt Captain Jack's pride... his hopes and his expectations. His refusal to let his beloved ship HMS Sophie be taken by the Acheron. His sweet violin music enchanted me. His integrity and honor impressed me. But he was not the only actor in this movie that won my heart!I adored the Doctor Maturin almost as much! What a loyal fellow... and such dreams! You had to want him to find those places that would show him the secrets he yearned for all his life! I felt every bit of this movie, and with few exceptions (I felt the wiggling whatever it was on the table was rather UGH!) thought it was beautiful and brilliant! If you want to see a rugged sea captain at his best, and like Russell Crowe, I recommend this movie highly.Just in case... better keep Dramamine handy. I am certain there will be a sequel. The HMS Surprise must have more worlds to conquer... and I do hope it will be soon.</fullReview>

Lot's of new faces such as James D'Arcy, Edward Woodall, Robert Pugh, Chris Larkin and so on. The Midshipman in the movie are very promising young actors, Max Pirkis, Max Benitz, Jack Randall, Richard Pates are very good young actors, Lee Ingleby also plays a Midshipman. The story is well set, Russell Crowe plays Jack Aubrey, the captain of the Surprise, Paul Bettany plays the ship's doctor. Hunting the French ship the Acheron in the pacific, makes a good movie. 95% of the movie takes place on the Surprise, a stop is made on the Galapgos islands is very beautiful. The acting is superb, beware, this movie does contain some very sad deaths, one of a young kid. Very exciting, wonderful music, great cast, including Billy Boyd, Pippin from Lord of the Rings. Contains some language, nothing to bad,a lot of Lord of the rings type violence, a boy's arm gets amputated early in the film(the camera is focused on the boys face.), the doctor has to do surgery on himself(a bit graphic might want to cover the little ones eyes or have them and weak stomachs out of the room), there are dead bodies seen at the end, this might be very sad for all of us, especially young children. i recommend that 11 years and up for kids.

		<shortDescription>I had a bad feeling about this movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...probably because the previews portrayed it to me as an odd combination of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'The Perfect Storm, that left my aesthetic sense dreading the idea (color/visual variety and shot juxtaposition-wise) of a movie shot almost entirely at sea--a setting that yields potentially monotonous combinations of blue sea, grey fog, and brown hull.However, in this film, that drudging monotony of color reflected the dutiful behavior of the military "commander" and his crew in the film, and the extended toil of their long and exhausting journey. Being who I am, I kept getting so P***ED that the Doctor character kept getting SCREWED OVER whenever he tried to go to the Galapagos to collect samples for scientific study.Yet, despite my initial indignation, I soon realized that this misfortune also showed (ultimately) the necessity of the captain's sacrifice or repression of all other endeavors and personal vendettas in order to complete his assigned mission. It isn't a pleasure cruise the crew is on: they have orders that must be followed. Even if it means screwing the lovable doctor and the rest of the world out of fascinating new biological discoveries that lay only a stone's throw away. These conflicts made the movie for me: the obligations of a leader to his country clashing with his personal loyalties to friends and crew, and the related conflict of whether it is best to prioritize the military or the erudite when time and resources are in short supply.So, I still think it is not -my- type of movie, exactly. But, certain things I recall with admiration--the sly camera-work, for example, like the bouncing of the camera offside of the "ship" (mimicking the undulation of waves) done in combination with the rocking movement of the actual ship set piece was a nice subtle touch. And the characters were well developed (or well played, if not both). The children, the officers, the crew and captain were all memorable and demanded empathy from the movie-going audience -- even if you did enter (like me) convinced the film was going to be an epic lacking cinematographic grandeur and bursting with sappy (Seabiscuit style) dialogue.My apologies to those who love Seabiscuit. Again, not my type of film.But this one was well done. I especially was struck seeing snippets of it a second time when my grandmother insisted on watching it again to get more time alone with Russell Crowe.Oi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSPeter Weir's film, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World," is breathtakingly magnificent. The scenes are fast moving and kept me on the edge of my seat.My only complaints are of the excess violence ("Lord of the Rings" kind of violence) and the lack of special features on the DVD (maybe because I rented it from Hollywood Video where they probably took out the extra special features DVD). Above all, this film is great for action flick fans and fans of Russell Crowe. Too bad Crowe was not nominated for best actor for this film; he truly deserves a nomination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film brings history to life in a way few movies do. Set in 1805, the movie follows a British ship led by Captain Jack Aubry (Russell Crowe) in pursuit of one of Napoleon's fleet. Whether it was the accuracy of Patrick O'Brien's novels or Director Peter Weir's devotion to detail in his recreation of life at sea, I felt as if I were on the ship myself. I might have also felt this way because of the film's unwavering vision to its subjects rather than conventional Hollywood storytelling. For example, in a story set at sea, we would naturally be looking forward to seeing exciting naval battles. While we do get our share of exciting naval action, we mostly experience the HMS Surprise, where every minute of the movie takes place, spending their time waiting and trying to maintain their sanity so that when a battle actually does come, you realize the magnitude of it. The human element of the movie, of course, is the multi-layered relationship between Crowe and Bettany, a duo seen before in Beautiful Mind that does not disappoint</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Commander is a magnificent achievement by Peter Weir and all the cast. It is a film that undoubtedly improves with each viewing. Russell Crowe delivers, IMO, his best performance since his Oscar-winning turn as Maximus in Gladiator. His under-stated performance as Captain Jack Aubrey is a total contrast to his showy John Nash in A Beautiful Mind. Why did Russell Crowe not get an Oscar nomination for this?Paul Bettany is a revelation in Master and Commander. I liked him in A Beautiful Mind but he is wonderful here as surgeon and would-be naturalist Dr Stephen Maturin. His scenes with Aubrey are a centrepiece of the film...some of the scenes with Aubrey and Maturin made me laugh out loud. That he did not get a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for this role is a travesty!The supporting actors are all magnificent...especially Max Pirkis, who plays a 13-year-old Midshipman who loses his arm early on and who develops a close bond with Maturin, due to their shared love of the natural world. Max Benitz is also very good as the cute and winsome Midshipman Calamy. Richard McCabe provides plenty of light relief as the hapless surgeon's mate, Higgins (the surgery scene was too funny for words), and likewise David Threlfall is excellent as steward Killick...his character is just as I imagined he would be from the books.This film will not, I don't think, appeal to fans of no-brainer action movies. What this is is an intelligent look at life aboard a ship in early 19th-century England. Russell Boyd's cinematography Oscar was so well-deserved, and the special effects are wonderful. All the scenes come off as completely authentic...it is almost as if you have stepped back in time to 1805, with no anachronistic scenes or dialogue. The film is true to the spirit of Patrick O'Brian's books...I really do think that he would be very proud indeed of the film. I didn't mind the lack of women in the film...thank goodness there was no regulation "plucky" heroine to be rescued by the dashing Captain Jack...I'm glad to say that Master and Commander was a welcome cliche-free zone.I highly recommend Master and Commander. I found the film exciting and moving...several scenes had tears springing up in my eyes (especially the funeral scene at the end). I am very thankful that they still make movies like this in Hollywood. And I never thought I would say this, but...I want to see more of Captain Jack and his crew. Bring on the sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of adventure filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Peter Weir's adaptation of Patrick O'Bian's superb novels strays from the source material, combining multiple novels into one, along with some material of it's own invention, it brillaintly captures the spirit of the books. Let's remember that there are 17 Aubrey/Maturin novels - Filming al of them ala Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" would have been absurdly impractical, if not downright impossible. I believe this film gives you a better sense of the overall series than simply doing a straightoforward adaptation of "Master and Commander" (the first novel) would have, and simply doing a completely straightfoward adaptation of "The Far Side of the World" (the tenth novel) may have been too confusing to audiences.Crowe and Bettany are excellent in their respective roles. Crowe IS the Captain Jack Aubrey of O'Brian's novels come to life, in every respect. Bettany may not look like O'Brian's description of Stephen Maturin, but I can't imagine another actor capturing the soul of the character so well.Weir's direction is flawless - who knew we was as good with action as with characters?Patrick O'Brian wrote some of the greatest adventure novels ever put on paper, and Peter Weir turned them into one of the greatest adventure movies ever put on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent. One of the few historical fiction movies that can't be criticized for historical inaccuracy. It shows how sailors of the British navy lived at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany were perfect in their roles as Jack and Stephen; they both had their characters down great, and they excellently captured the friendship between Jack and Stephen from the books. I highly recommend seeing this movie, and then reading the books. Don't watch this movie as an epic, watch it for the characters, or else you'll miss what makes this movie so great!

		<fullReview>It is hard to say enough good things about this movie -- you just couldn't get a better presentation than Russell Crowe does. When he growls a line like, "he's done this to me two times, there won't be a third" you can feel the determination and authority that O'Brian's Jack Aubrey is.Of course there is so much that are in the novels that isn't even touched in the movie. The character Jack Aubrey is certainly a genius when it comes to anything nautical; in almost any other venue he is almost a complete buffoon. This is very important to the character. The best the screenplay can do to show this is show him spitting food over his table in a clowning act; it just doesn't work very well. The Stephen Maturin character is similarly short-changed. He becomes a backdrop character instead of a second protagonist, even though they wrote in a crucial role for him in the plot.Most of this sacrifice is to give you stunning sea footage and up-close-and-personal battle scenes. I'll tell you the guys who did that in real life were crazy. So the real star of the show is the ship and the water around it. That at least is where the movie version has real value over what any book can provide.Enjoy the movie, but don't equate it with the books. It would be great if they did more of the books' stories with this cast.</fullReview>

I feel that the movie was well written and produced. It makes me want more. I keep buying books related to Naval Warfare during that era. My only gripe is that it started at book 10 in the series. There are 9 books worth of great movie material before Master &amp; Commander even starts. Not to mention 10 books after. It is obvious to anyone who knows the series and saw the movie. There not only needs to be a sequel (or 2), but at least one prequel. I wouldn't be happier if the turned this into a trilogy or, better yet, a quintrilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand people not liking this movie. They have just seen Pirates of the Caribbean and The Return of the King. They were expecting blood, and thrilling action from the beginning to the end. And what did Mr. Weir gave them? A long, detailed tale of how life was on a war ship, those who look so beautiful from the outside, but were nothing like a vacation to live in for months and even years. And that is awfully hard to do! It merely proves how great a director Mr. Weir is, and how good actors Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are. This is a movie for those who can go a little deeper into every situation that's shown to them, and this is a movie for those who can understand how hard it is to move cameras in such little space. I think this is a magnificent movie, that from now on will be considered the reference for all age of sail movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Master and Commander with average expectations, I thought it would kinda like Gladiator on high seas and a little overweighted...well it wasn't, it was actually a pleasant surprise.The plot although generic, is enough to push a great epic adventure. Russel Crowe plays Captain Jack, an old fashioned, hard boiled British captain who gets obsessed with the idea of bringing a French ship down. In the meantime, dozens of misadventures are lived and blood spilled.Sometimes it might feel the movie tries to append many many subplots within the main plot, but I did not find them distracting at all, and they all added dramatism and depth to the characters in the ship. It is weird to see an all male movie though, I can't remember when was the last time I saw one.After I saw the film, I have been trying to persuade my friends and family to see it, but no one seems to believe me this is a great, fun, and exciting movie with adventures from beginning to end and great acting from all people involved. So take my word, board this ship and live a major adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Master and Commander was released I saw it with high expectations, Paul Bettany and Russel Crowe bring a great deal of talent to the project. and the cinematography promised to be spectacular. Both the acting of these two thespians, and the sweeping vistas deliver as promised. The problem that I have with this film is that it spends a great deal of time introducing and developing the characters of Capt. Aubrey and Dr. Maturin, but next to no time is spent developing the supporting characters. We learn very little about them, and really don't grow to care for these characters. this makes it difficult to feel any deep level of sadness at the deaths of several of them in the Final battle scene, beyond the normal feelings of "oh they died, that is too bad". The scene where the sailors are laid out in preparation for burial at sea draws very little emotional response, had we been allowed to get to know these characters a little more this could have been a deeply moving scene.If pressed I would give this movie a reluctant thumbs up, based on the performances of Crowe and Bettany, and the amazing visuals, but I would not place this movie any where near the top 50 movies I have seen in the last 5 years, and if pressed for a one word description of this film, I would be forced to use the word overrated.** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every 20 years, Hollywood remembers a genre that needs a good update, and this year's genre's been sea adventures. First, one of the best movies of the summer, "Pirates of the Caribbean" (congratulations to Johnny Depp for his nomination) and then, now, one of the year's best movies (with permission of "The Return of the King", probably the best)."Master and Commander, The Far Side of the World" Is more than a "ships movie". A wonderful story, full of the details that give depth and feeling to a movie. Script, Characters, Landscapes, Music and Stages are first quality, as all the cast. You know when cast &amp; crew believe in what they are doing, and this time it's obvious. Peter Weir, First-class director and writer, builds a majestic movie around a majestic story, where every FX serves to the scene, without overloading it. His sense of narration is great, and a long and not-full-of-action movie elapses in an eyeblink, leaving you crying for more.One of the things I liked most was the relation between Capt. Aubrey (Russel Crowe) and Dr. Maturin (Paul Bettany). Both, strong and experienced men, share an educated, artistic mind that comes in conflict when Aubrey, a Soldier, must choose between carrying out his orders, or make Maturin's dream of become the first scientist in the galapagos come true.To sum up, a deep and intense movie, very real and realistic, that deserves the 10 nominations that has received.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Epic of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Return of the King may have just won the Golden Globe for Best Picture-Drama but I find Master and Commander to be superior. ROTK may be the more visually stunning film, although Master certainly has some breathtaking visuals. However, Master and Commander is just a little better to me.I have noticed that some people were disappointed by Master and Commander and its done poor at the box office (Made 84 million with a 150 million dollar budget). Those people were expecting another Pirates of the Carribean. I know they were disappointed because this is undoubtedly the superior film. Pirates is fun because of some of the action, while there is action in Master and Commander it is much more character-oriented. The film moves at a slower place to allow time for character development and interaction. Master and Commander was on a high budget and it shows in every scene. The visual effects are flawless. The films two big battle scenes are crafted with an undeniable skill. The typhoon is flawless looking. The ships are also flawless. Master and Commander is a stunning looking movie but the visual effects are not the film. There is a good deal of costume and make up too. The scenes at the Galapados(Spelling?) Islands are beautifully photographed. The acting is also strong. Russell Crowe turns in a fantastic performance. Crowe has an undeniable screen presence and its more on display in this film than Gladiator. However, matching Crowe's performance is Paul Bettany. I have always noticed the actor in supporting roles and found him to be scene-stealing. But Bettany does much more acting here. His performance is not as showy as Crowe's but it equals it. Peter Weir maintains tight control over the film. Once you strip away the visual effects, you will immediate see this is the kind of character-driven film Weir does best. However, Weir never lets the visual effects overwhelm the film. Weir has crafted the best Epic film of the year and one of the overall best films of the year. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Weir's "Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" is a great adventure epic, beautifully photographed with a fine eye for period detail.The film follows Captain "Lucky" Jack and his crew who have been sent to capture a French Superfrigate during the Napoleonic Wars.Russell Crowe is perfectly cast in the lead as an arrogant but likeable leader who's both warrior and thinker. Even though Crowe won the Academy Award for Ridley Scott's "Gladiator", in the coming years this performance will be known as his signature piece. Paul Bettany, unrecognizable as always, is Crowe's opposite in a quite, never showy but strong performance. The other cast are as great as the leads especially the younger actors.Everything about this film looks authentic. It has a documentary feel as though you were watching real people in real situations during those times. There are moments of great humour throughout which helps the film to be more accessible to a modern audience. The cinematography is strikingly beautiful and never at any point can you say for sure what is a model and what is a computer generated visual effect. The scenes filmed at the Galapagos Islands is a little disappointing visually but interesting in a nature special kind of way.This is an all out man's film filled to the brim with testosterone but it also has a gentle side to it. A man's film does not necessarily mean its just fighting and bloodshed. There are themes of loyalty, honour, comradeship and unfortunately fear. Phobias and superstitions thrived during these times and as shown in the film they sometimes have dire consequences.Weir should be commended for bringing this story to the screen. It's an old fashioned film with cutting edge visual effects that never overshadows the brilliant cast. It's not yet known whether this will be the first of many to come as this film is based on a series of novels. Personally I would like to see more of these characters and if they're done with the same enthusiasm and perfectionism as this one, then I would whole heartedly stand in line for the next one.</fullReview>

You are pressed as a crewmember from the opening shot and remain on board utterly until the final goofy/charming scene in the Captains quarters that just exudes directorial brilliance.

Russell Crowe wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of "Lucky Jack", but he proved a fine captain, loyal to the character in the books. Maturin was most convincing and also true to books. ...and by the way, this is not a "guy" film (I'm a chick and I loved it), it's a film for anyone who enjoys all things seafaring--from ships to sea shanties (with some swashbuckling thrown in).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fine piece of film making from Peter Weir who adopts a realistic and detailed approach to a celebration of effective leadership on the ocean waves. In many ways it's a `how they did it' movie ? how the Royal Navy operated at the turn of the 19th century. Russell Crowe's Aubrey is a dashing commander, not without his faults, but decisive and humane, more so than his near contemporaries Cook and Bligh. Aubrey's own hero is Nelson, also a derring-do type, but perhaps a bit more ruthless.The relationship between Aubrey and his old friend the ship's doctor Maturin, the man of action versus the man of science is, shall we say, unusual. It could be said the two characters are different sides of the same person. All their serious conversations take place with no-one else present, which is just as well since Maturin is a stern critic. I'm not sure why the Galapagos got roped into the plot, with Maturin prevented by the `requirements of the service' from scooping Darwin on all those swimming lizards and flightless comorants and stumbling upon Evolution? perhaps it helps avoid this from being just another Hornblower. Or perhaps it just makes the point that this is another Peter Weir movie, not just some Hollywood hack's. It's nice to see an `art' director coming up with a commercial movie that's not an artistic cop-out. It is beautifully constructed, with well drawn characters whose stories are vividly told with considerable insight and great economy.Russell Crowe fills the Aubrey role perfectly. Aubrey is a straightforward guy and it must have been a relatively easy rule to play (compared to Paul Bettany's Maturin). It's definitely a bloke's movie, (only one brief female glimpse). Makes a change from all those romantic comedies. Hugh Grant could definitely not play Aubrey, though he possibly could have done Maturin. The rest of the cast are high quality. I really liked Max Pirkis as the absurdly young Midshipman Blakeney ? a real-life Peter Pan. Robert Pugh was also good as the cautious ship's master.Overall, a thinking bloke's action film, superbly realised and well acted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is two things:1. A highly superior action movie. It's exciting, emotional, beautiful and honest. The sound design is particularly good and I suggest choosing a cinema with a better than average sound system if you possibly can. They are very successful at creating the life of the warship, this little floating world, travelling around our world, but not in it, with its own independent, isolated life, subject to the awesome power of the weather and the sea. The actions, with cannonballs crashing about your ears, and the seas off Cape Horn, are awe-inspiring. The heat, the cold, the possibility of running out of water, of accidents, disease, the isolation, the responsibilities, being 'stuck' with your shipmates, the resilience and sensation of living only in the present - all this is superbly conveyed, and that's before you even mention the enemy.2. A pretty good Patrick O'Brian pastiche. It's not like the real thing, but it's a very worthy tribute. Crowe and Bettany may not be Aubrey and Maturin, but they're about as good a try as you could possibly hope for. If you have read the books, just relax and don't worry about the plot of either of the books this is based on - there isn't room for that kind of plot in the time. Treat this as a new sea story. You should recognise some dialogue, which is all to the good as O'Brian's brilliant dialogue is one of the best things about the novels. What they've really gone for here is physical historical accuracy and great acting. If you haven't read the books, but seeing the film has made you want to, just start with "Master and Commander".Age range: I think anyone of 10 upwards would be fine, but parents should use their discretion in taking a younger child. Although the violence is not especially graphic, it is realistic. There are some emotional scenes of characters being injured, killed, or buried at sea which might upset an imaginative child. On the other hand, there are also scenes of very young characters showing great courage and responsibility.Some people have found it difficult to follow. I see that one reviewer simply couldn't understand the British accents, which probably does make it tricky, and two seperate people on the message board have mistaken the brief glimpse of a cricket match for baseball. (Both of them enjoyed the film, though.) If you don't need subtitles, why not give it a go? If you do, you might have to wait for the DVD, which is a pity as this is a big-screen flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if the plot is not so dense of facts, to tell the truth everything starts from and goes on - from the beginning up to the closing titles - with the seek for the Acheron to the point that, at first sight, the spectator will come to think that every other scene has been added in order to make the movie a little bit longer, this is one of the movies that won't delude you. It's superbly shot (probably the director will receive a nomination to the Oscars, in case he won't we will know that critics are blind) and well balanced. Although the plot is centered on a battle, in fact, we have more by this movie: we can enjoy the true meaning of friendship, a relationship that endures despite opinion divergences and that eventually overcomes even navy orders, we will be light up by our commander firm authority just as his crew and finally we will win the fight against Acheron.Involving and real as never seen in movies of this genre, this is not a film everyone can look at: scenes like the surgeon's self operation are not tolerated by someone, so if your neighbour puts his hands on his own eyes you'll now why he acts like that!About the cast there's nothing to say except congratulations. Everyone has played his character in the finest way. Russel Crowe could really have been a frigate commander, even if sometimes he smiles too much for an authoritative Jack the Lucky. Anyway he should gain another Oscar nomination for his skill in playing such characters. We've yet seen him in "The Gladiator" and here he's not changed too much, impressive. Paul Bettany is the perfect companion for Crowe and as he did in "A Beautiful Mind" even here he is perfect. The surgeon isn't of easy interpretation since it's a double faced character. He cannot understand why his captain can be so wayward in following his orders so that he cannot forgive his friend to have broken his promise, but he is able to recognize the true friendship that links them when he finds himself on the Caymans shot and near to death. He cannot share the same views of his friend but he doesn't hesitate to set aside his interests when needed. These opposites find an unique harmony in his performance and this makes the surgeon so fascinating.Photography is enchanting and gloomy as needed in such a realistic sailing movie. Every shot is orchestrated so that the spectator feels part of the crew, struggling with them to obtain another victory for their commander and master of life Jack the Lucky.No one can say, after Master and Commander, it was easy to be on a frigate but everyone would love to have been on it, at least one time, at least as a spectator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read all he books, I am not a big fan of Russel Crowe, I wasn't happy they where picking and choosing from a bunch of books, and I complained about how Hollywood would screw this up for he last six months and... It was an excellent movie. It truly captured the feel of the books. I expected them to make an action movie with some cool effects and not much else(that seems to satisfy enough people for a movie to make its money). They could have made a stale period piece, like those Gettysburg or Gods and Generals, that satisfy obsessive history buffs but don't have any drama, They didn't. They made an excellent movie, with an exciting pace, that happened to take place all on a ship and a deserted island. I don't want to give any points away, if you want to see the terminator vintage 1805 and have the attention span of a flea, you'll be as disappointed as a few others who have written here have, If you want tortured protagonists and excessive pathos, go see Mystic River( which was great), but if you want to be taken on an interesting adventure, with compelling characters, that doesn't insult your intelligence I think you will like this movie. thanks to good writing, directing and cinematography, you will really feel like you've been cramped on a tiny frigate, and chasing a superior enemy across two oceans. (yeah it is supposed to feel long when you are stuck in the doldrums!) I can be a movie snob, i usually point out what was wrong with most movies I like, but I think they did as well as possible, only one scene was over-dramatic (Jonah). You should still read the books, Stephen is more complex and Jack has more flaws. a sequel should have more on land, where roles are reversed and they can work in Diana and Sophie. I didn't think Hollywood could make good movies from books, but with help from the folks down under they've done well the last few years. Finally, I think I have forgiven Crowe, for that God-awful Gladiator, I'm sure he can sleep better knowing that. Well, worth your $8.00---------10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This ship is England!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ranks right up there with all the great sea adventures ever filmed and I think you can make a case that this is one of the best. The script is based on the novels of Patrick O'Brian and it carefully balances the magnificent battle scenes with character development so we can understand the way these men behave during war. The story is about the men on board an English ship called the HMS Surprise and Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is the Captain in charge. Also on board is Ship Surgeon Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) who is greatly interested in biology and a good friend of Aubrey. The Surprise gets involved in a sea battle with the French warship Acheron and they are forced to flee and repair damages. Its 1805 and they're mission is to keep the French from controlling the waters off of Brazil. Aubrey heads to the Galapagos Islands and figures out where the Acheron will be going so they can try and find it. Aubrey wants to continue the chase but Maturin questions his logic and suggests that they go to the nearest port for the ships repairs but Aubrey rejects that idea. During the voyage we see the Surprise get caught in a terrible storm where Aubrey has to give the order to cut the line and leave a seaman floundering in the water. One of the Midshipman is Lord Blakeney (Max Pirkis) who is only 13 years old and after the first battle with the Acheron his arm is broken and has to be amputated. During the stay at Galapagos Aubrey gets an idea of disguising his ship as a whaler and getting close enough to initiate a battle. This exciting film is directed by the great Peter Weir and while his talents as a director are more towards character development I think thats why this film works so splendidly. The film consists of two battles with another ship and sandwiched in between is the peril of a fierce storm that endangers the ship to a point where it could sink. Weir does a great job of allowing the viewer to get to know each character intimately and in certain scenes we see that some of the seamen have been shanghaied. It reminds us how different things were during war and young boys were put in charge. Its hard to shake the indelible image of a 13 year old with one arm leading grown men into battle! The core of this film is the performance by Crowe. He's perfectly cast and its because of his incredible charisma on screen. The role of Captain Aubrey had to be cast for an actor that you would believe could lead men into battle and Crowe is that actor. Like Mel Gibson in "Braveheart" and Kenneth Branagh in "Henry V" we can envision Crowe inspiring men to go to war. Once again Crowe proves to be one of the best actors of our time. Aubrey plays the violin and we get a sense of how well rounded a person he is. Bettany is also excellent as Maturin and his friendship with Aubrey is evident. He seems to be the only one capable of matching wits with him and we sense that is one of the reasons Aubrey admires him. The battle scenes are both brutal and exhilarating. We watch as cannon balls rip into and through the sides of ships and its the type of warfare that we haven't seen very much in films, at least not filmed this great. This is a truly rousing adventure film on epic scales and its extremely exciting to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 'Master and Commander' Russell Crowe delivers a performance equal to his role as Maximus in Gladiator. He brings Captain Jack Aubrey to life, making him perfectly brilliant and courageous. Crowe's supporting cast is priceless. Filled with stars and others that aren't too known in Hollywood, the casting is superb. From Paul Bettany (if you recall, he played Charles, Nash's roommate, in 'A Beautiful Mind') as Dr. Stephen Maturin, to James D'Arcy as 1st Lt. Tom Pullings and new young faces such as Max Benitz and and Max Pirkis ... the cast is perfect.The cinematography is awesome, taking the audience from the middle of the ocean to foreign islands. The different colors bring this movie to life and create a feeling as if you're actually under Captain Jack's command and experiencing right there with the crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A jolly-good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fascinating film that would only bore(the common critics complaint) if you went seeking the typical Hollywood swashbuckler. This film is much more rooted in reality and true history. It is full of a light-hearted humor and eloquent fiddle music. Russel Crowe has again brought to the table all he has to offer and it shows. He leads the strong cast(which contains a surprising strong link in a child) with his sea-toughened charm and leadership. Bettany also shined with easily his best performance of his career. An admirable job. I think that the reason this film could be considered boring is that the reviewer went into it under the wrong impression. It is a very scantly plotted film. There is not much to it. It is really just a series of events, cause and effect. The plot, if there is even such a literal thing, would be Aubrey, a British captain in 1808, is on chase with a french ship which recently attacked it aided by the element of surprise. But the film does end up much more then that and as I said its the series of events that dictate this. The battle scenes on the sea are unparralled. The effects blend wonderfully in with reality. This all creates arousing battles which hold the attention and excite the heart. Master and Commander is highly reccommended as a contemplative yet occasionally thrilling nautical adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action packed. Thrilling. Music, Medicine and Mayhem are the basic ingredients -in reverse order - with 90% mayhem. This film and its many seaquels will give Godfather fans the testosterone pop they crave - and that's "gender neutral" testosterone so my daughters don't knee-cap me. The Patrick O'Brian books could be retitled `Sea Trek' (1 to 23) or for as many books as Patrick O'Brian has written and cares yet to write. I've never read one. I will now.Beyond non-stop action, great moments justifying the ticket price: (1) The on board surgery theater and gallery for 1805 medical procedure at sea . fascinating; (2) The age dispersion of the warriors . . . and of the leaders among them. . . eye-opening; (3) The practical application of a naturalist's curiosity into a warrior's passion; (4) Digital sound's persistent reminder that you're on a wooden war ship as the plot unravels; (5) Guerrilla tactics on the high seas at the dawn of the 19th century; + the sheer quantity of grog consumed. . . buy some Barcardi Stock next week.It's long on character chemistry, brilliant photography, screenplay pacing, and the birth of screen heroes - making its 160 minutes an excellent investment of your time and money. It's short on bathroom breaks so empty the bladders before taking your seat; then pound a little grog after the show. Earns an unwavering 9 on the 10 scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not often when a movie based on beloved books actually exceeds one's expectations. Having accepted the reality that no 2 hour film could have everything, or even a 10th of the information that's in the books, I was hoping for something that would give the feeling, the experience...the thrill one gets sitting in one's arm chair. Weir, Crowe and Bettany, and all the behind the scenes artists have certainly done that and more. From the crowded quarters, the friendships, the dangerous daily routines, the ear pounding canon fire to the Naval traditions, its all there with heart and thought. Casting is uniformly excellent, with special mention going to the actors portraying Tom Pullings and Lord Blakeney. I knew Crowe and Bettany would be wonderful.... the young actors, James D'Arcy and Max Pirkis, new to me, were a wonderful surprise.Simply spectacular to see, I wish the movie had been longer... and how often do you say that?!Huzzah, Huzzah, Huzzah and an extra round of grog to all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe does it again! The savior of Rome, "Gladiator", brings to the screen another commanding performance. I heard women take in "small pursed-lipped gasps" looking at Russell Crowe on the posters, as we entered the theater. They were enjoying the night before the lights were even dimmed. This swashbuckling adventure had all the trappings of an Errol Flynn epic, Mutiny on the Bounty and yes, you can still hear Maximus in Russell Crowe's voice. Max Pirkis(Midshipman Blakeney), in his movie debut, shows this young man can have a future in film, if he desires. His emotional display during the amputation scene was felt by the entire audience. Every woman in there wanted to hug him. Every man admired him. Paul Bettany (Dr. Stephen Maturin) helped to keep Russell Crowe from taking himself too seriously in this movie. The Captain has the command presence expected of someone in his position. He is an inspirational leader, leading by example. He is a role model and father figure to the young midshipman. His strong sense of duty and patriotism drives him to go above and beyond what is expected in his mission. This movie should do very well in the box offices and do even better on DVD. This is definitely a keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films, like Chinese cuisine, pass through you so quickly you hardly remember they were there. Others linger in your mind, sometimes even subconsciously, growing, so that by the time you see the film again it's something more than it was the first time. Master and Commander is deceptively simple. You could sum the story up in a single sentence. But the levels of nuance and texture go beyond almost anything seen on American screens in years. It manages to be exciting, bloody, adventurous stuff without ever becoming inhumane. And it's subtle, human, and beautiful without ever stagnating. Not a single performance bears a false note. The world of the film is so rigorously invented that one can't help but fall into it; it's completely absorbing. But on reflection, it's an amazing high-wire act. It stands as single, overpowering proof that a film with the best visual effects of the year can also be the most clever and intelligent. Maybe it will be even better the third time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How nice it is to watch a movie that concentrates on the relationships between the characters rather than relying solely on cheap thrills from explosions and gunfire. It's true that the action is transferred from the Angl-American war of 1812-1815 to the Napoleonic Wars in order to appease American sensibilities but it's still a fascinating insight into how the Royal Navy of the day operated. I won't bother mentioning the main points of the plot seeing as plenty of reviewers have done so already but I will offer a word of advice - if you're unlikely to appreciate this movie's finer points then stick to watching Rambo I, II, XXVII etc. Those are the movies you're more likely to respond to - you redneck morons :0) .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where have all the heroes gone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite Mel Gibson's best and frequent attempts to make the English/British look cruel and ridiculous, it has taken another two antipodeans to give us back our pride. Master and Commander is both masterful and commanding for its portrayal of the "Senior Service" as an organisation where man management took place on a personal basis, everyone was committed to a common cause and people of all ranks looked out for themselves. While this utopia is no doubt idealised, and we are given an idea in the film of the fate of those who don't "fit in", it is nonetheless such an an uplifting and encouraging view of the world that I now watch it at least half an hour every day. Bravado aside, the screenplay is deliciously witty and inventive, taking us into the territory of Darwin and the origin of the species (I trust that's not a spoiler). Seeing Crowe and Bettany again on such symbiotic top form after "A Beautiful Mind" is just the icing on the cake. If only the British could make films like this about themselves, Bettany and a few others excluded of course.To quote the great Roger Ebert: "...to see it is to be reminded of the way great action movies can rouse and exhilarate us, can affirm life instead of simply dramatizing its destruction."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong Revolution, Wrong Red White and Blue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander brings to the screen Pat O'Brien's epic of Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey's (Russel Crowe's) hunt for the privateer Acheron. Russell Crowe renders a bravura performance in the swashbuckling role of Lucky Jack's exploits in the Napoleonic era wars. There's a Captain Kirkish charm and a star-trek tingle in Lucky Jack's adventurism but there's a serious side too. Captain Jack teaches a middling mid - shipman who constantly fails the test for Lieutenant that a leader is neither a martinet nor a friend to the crew.The movie is set against the background of the Napoleonic Wars. But it derives from a book in which the swashbuckling Captain Jack unleashes his furies on a different Red White and Blue flown by a different cast of Revolutionaries. Americans lacking Britannic objectivity might not flock to the cinema to watch their lads blasted out of the water through ruses de guerre worthy of themselves.Yet the script is so well written that there are many hints from which a keen observer can penetrate the stand - in foe.Hollywood made the French, America's ally in 1776 and co-belligerent in 1812,the feared and resourceful enemy. In 1812 the US picked the wrong moment to jump into the Napoleonic Wars on the losing side. The US tried the fast and lose tactics of the privateers, pirates hired by Congress, in the Revolution without much of the former successes. The Regular US Navy under commanders like Perry and Decatur however did make its mark.The US was nearly over-run by the British with the collapse of Napoleon's regime. Fortunately General Andy Jackson humiliated Sir Edward Pakenham at New Orleans ending the war as positively as it could. Too bad Sir Edward didn't have Lucky Jack with him. Civilisation might have been restored to North America.Britons do not live in memory of past glories when the chips are down as much as Americans do. The Hollywoodization of Patrick O'Brien's sea tale of Captain Jack Aubrey's pursuit of the privateer Acheron had to be toned down for US audiences. The movie only alludes to America as Britain's enemy; with a fresh coat of an alternative or variant Red White and Blue (Bleu, Blanche et Rouge) donates the Acheron to the cause of a different Revolution.There is a Captain Kirkish charm to Russell Crowe's performance and his relationship with the ship's surgeon approaches that of the gritting comradeship of Captain Kirk and Dr Spock.There's some swashbuckling adventure, some exploring the universe and some amateur psychology to merit the accolade 'The Star Trek on the high seas.' Otherwise the story is a formula war story played in cockney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale of another great Peter Weir movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen a Peter Weir movie that I didn't like. "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" further backs that up. Russell Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey, leading a ship around the world to chase a French frigate in 1805. He and his shipmates have many experiences, all the while sticking together and remembering their duty.It's especially interesting that this came out the same year as "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl". I guess that this combination affirms that movies about people sailing the high seas always make for something good, as "Gilligan's Island" long ago ensured. You're sure to like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a historical movie--The Historical Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful movie, an intellectual movie, and an action movie. Flashing fog shoots cannonballs; the moon paints shadows of ropes and climbing crewmen upon the sails; lizards, birds, and insects flee from a pile of opened traps. Military strategy, history, evolution, superstition, friendship, and leadership are all philosophical subjects discussed in the picture. The movie is really about two warships--and their captains--trying to destroy one another, with several minor adventures mixed into the story. The realism is such that never for a moment do you doubt that these people are from the turn of the 19th century, that they are on a ship fighting during the height of the British Empire. This movie is the Das Boot of the 1800s. Although I'd recommend this movie to anyone, if you're really into films with a lot of fast CG cars, CG tentacles, idiotic teenagers, or idiotic teenagers falling in love, you probably won't enjoy Master and Commander as much as I did. If, on the other hand, you're tired of boring historical movies or vacuous blockbusters like The Patriot, this is a film that will restore your faith in the belief that good movies can be made once in awhile, even in this day and age.</fullReview>

Punishment or Piles perhaps. I am not a big fan of Crowe because of his off stage antics, but you can not deny that he is a great actor and this is by far his best yet. I was wondering why a French ship of this period would have been built in Boston, but I see from this site that it was an American vessel in the novel. I wonder how our take on this film would have been altered it they had left it as a War of 1812 battle instead of the Napoleonic Wars?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's not to like about this movie? I've seen this film a dozen times and never tire of it. Peter Weir has created something more than a film here. He's created an unforgettable experience, time machine that actually places you on board the HMS Surprise.His attention to detail for that period is almost perfect. The dialog is accurate for that time in history and closely follows the Patrick O'Brian books (the film is a combination of two O'Brian books). Some have criticized the movie as dull, boring, etc., the books have been criticized as that, but Weir has made a film here that doesn't follow today's tired format full of explosions and trite dialog. This is definitely a "thinking man's" film.Paul Bettany is outstanding as Dr. Stephen Maturin and Russell Crowe is the perfect casting choice for Capt. Jack Aubrey. Bettany is a highly underrated actor, if you want my opinion. He plays the role of the on-board surgeon quite well.In fact the entire acting crew has been perfectly cast. My only disappointment is there are no plans to produce more movies from the fascinating series of O'Brian books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting and a wonderful script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When they are first attacked in the beginning of the movie, I thought I was really under attack. I had never seen such great special effects in a real movie. I've come to expect great explosions in science fiction films, where we don't really know what it would actually look like, but this was real. I saw cannonballs ripping the ship into slivers right in front of me. And the people who were hurt were real people, not some gory monsters from a horror film. What I'm saying is that real people, saying things that they would really say, can make the special effects even more stunning.But this movie is not about effects. It's about a captain's quest for revenge and a scientist's quest for knowledge, and the beauty of the relationship between them. There are virtually no women in this movie, and only one joke. But the movie is enthralling. The emotion is real and raw, and the dialog is fantastic. The suspension of my disbelief was complete in this film. The acting is perfect. The people are so real that I felt I actually knew them, and cared about them very much. I feel almost as though I was in the movie. How great is that? I thought it was the best movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a 25 year veteran of the US Navy, most of my sea time on submarines, the one thing that strikes me about this film is how well they've captured the rhythm of life at sea. The routines of watchstanding, crew meals both in the wardroom and lower decks, the occasional "beating to quarters" or all hands on deck to handle some casualty or other, are all very real. Even in today's nuclear Navy, some things haven't changed. It was very easy for me, and should be for anyone who's worn the blue and served at sea, to be able to relate well to this film. I sincerely hope that Peter Weir will make another O'Brian book into a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander was a hell of a movie. It's not just another remake. It seems like all movies made now are just remakes. This isn't a remake. Its the kind of movie that will be remade 40 years from now. It is an original movie. If you can't understand the plot of the movie, I pity you.Basically the Interceptor gets orders to take a "prize" the ship Acheron. The movie begins with a great little battle and from that point goes to chase mode. It doesn't seem like the movie would be that long just because the plot is so simple. However, along the way we get a lot of character description. This is common in the more classic movies, movies that are truly great. i.e. Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Raging Bull. The setting is described flawlessly. The ship looks exactly as a ship from the 1800's would look. It shows the cramped living conditions, the poor dental hygiene, and the more primal mind frame during this period of time. The acting performances were outstanding. Crowe does a good job and really seems to be a sea captain. The actor playing the Doctor did an excellent job as well. Its amazing to see him come from A Knight's Tale as a comedian to Master and Commander as a serious cello playing doctor that has a thirst for discovering new species on the Galapagos Islands.This movie has few flaws and for that should be considered one of the better movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Film-making Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my criteria for great art on film is being able to see spectacle that one would normally not be able to see. I love films that carry me away to another time and another place, to see remarkable things. Master and Commander reminded me of classic adventure films from the last century, done with impeccable modern and seamless special effects and authenticity. Like, you could not obviously see CG in use, or notice scaled down models. I think it is a remarkable film on all counts, acting, cinematography and visuals, story, costumes, music, and detailed authenticity. Even the editing is noticeably superior, because action sequences are fast paced, yet easy to follow (unlike other contemporary actioners using the ultra-close, blurred and jumbled mish-mosh that is in vogue). Acknowledging that there were many other great films in Oscar contention this year (2003), I believe Master and Commander was the BEST PICTURE (but unfortunately released the same year as the conclusion of a great trilogy, which had to finally receive a collective Oscar recognition). I especially loved that the naval strategies made some sense. Both the hero and his adversary were wily, smart fighters and strong leaders, and you could understand why the crew wanted to follow them. The characters were all likable and all of them were superbly acted. My favorites were Captain Aubery, the Doctor/Naturalist (played by Paul Bettany), and the young Midshipman, Mr. Blakeney, whose characters were wonderfully developed. It is somewhat violent, but I highly recommend Master and Commander for everyone. I love this film.</fullReview>

I enjoy films and programmes based in that period so maybe thats why i enjoyed it as much as i did. But people who aren't big fans of these types of films still enjoy it. People may claim 'how could Crowe do what he did when the French had a superior ship and superior man power ?'...well he did and they could've ruined it concerning this fact but they didn't.

You only have to read Lavery's "Nelson's Fleet at Trafalgar" published by the National Maritime Museum, to see how realistic this movie is, and how well a film can be made.

		<fullReview>"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" tells the tale of Jack Aubrey (Crowe), Captain of the HMS Surprise, an English ship of war circa 1805, as it seeks to hunt down a French privateering vessel of greater size and speed. Hailed by the critics and well received by the public at large, this seafaring adventure flick fills up the screen with Crowe and Crowe and crew and more Crowe as it takes the audience on a wet and sobering open-ended journey of conquest on the high seas off the coasts of South America. Well crafted and sticking to the rigors of the period and place to the extent it is possible for a Hollywood commercial product with a PG-13 rating to do so, "M&amp;C" makes for an energetic and exciting watch sans women with cannonade broadsides, boarding parties, a scientific expedition, and the nemesis of every sea captain, boredom aboard.

The battle scenes and sailing sequences are just outstanding. Unfortunately, the plot is paper thin and only about 3 of the characters are developed at all. There is about 30 minutes worth of plot in a 120 minute movie, with the rest being semi-related filler material. A little editing would have made it much better.

Well-staged though they are, I found the 'confrontational' scenes rather tiresome. I much preferred Russell getting stroppy with the good Doctor and his other crew!Crowe seems to have cornered the market in playing iconoclasts, and Aubrey is a scarcely different addition to his canon.

		<fullReview>OK, so the title is terrible (*Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World*???), but Peter Weir's big-budget extravaganza about life on the open seas during the Napoleonic Wars is a welcome return to old-fashioned entertainment. The many negative comments here -- "talky", "boring", "not enough action", etc. -- tells us more about the viewers than it does about the film, which, I assure you, has action to spare. It's a measure of how vapidly hyperactive today's audiences have become when 5 minutes of dialogue can be described as "endless". Grow up, people.The movie is really not as "intellectual" as its detractors make out (nor as intellectual as it wants to seem to be of its own accord). Generous critics will probably make too much of the presentation of the alternately conflicting and cooperating roles that War (personified by Russell Crowe's Jack Aubrey) and Science (personified by Paul Bettany's Stephen Maturin) play in the progress of civilization. *Master and Commander* is not a philosophical piece. Rather, it's a boy's adventure tale (even featuring a largish role for a 12-year-old midshipman) in which derring-do AND smarts win the day for our heroes. However, the smarts are not accompanied by 21st-century-style, hip, Tarantino-esque wisecracks loaded with F-bombs, and so the movie's appeal will probably be lost on the average idiot at the multiplex. Our main heroes, Capt. Jack Aubrey and naturalist/surgeon Stephen Maturin, are definitely men of the Old School: Duty before pleasure; an enthusiasm for the Life of the Mind (even macho Aubrey is not above taking battle-strategy tips from his egghead friend Maturin); a preference for classy things like Bach suites, which they saw together on violin and cello in Aubrey's quarters (I felt the movie was pushing it a bit here, but whatever).One gets irritated after reading complaints that there's "no plot", when the plot is abundantly clear: England and France are at war; Aubrey has been commissioned to bring in a marauding French frigate -- the nicely named "Acheron" -- back to England as a "prize"; the Acheron turns out to be a Yankee-built monster that is better-gunned and better-manned, or at least more-manned, than Aubrey's ship. Thus, Aubrey &amp; Crew take the retreating position in the cat-and-mouse game that ensues. One of the pleasures of the film is watching how Aubrey dodges the French ship with clever ruses like setting adrift a decoy-raft hung with lamps after nightfall: Acheron pursues the decoy, and Aubrey escapes. Presumably, these displays of cleverness must be the "boring" parts everyone's referring to. Well never mind. If you're still able to enjoy the pleasures of classical storytelling in this age of pachincko-like cinema, *Master and Commander* will be right up your alley. *Matrix* fans will want to avoid the movie. One other note: no females in the movie, except for a longing glimpse at a South Pacific girl. I realize this will further limit the appeal of this film -- i.e., no women for the female audiences to identify with -- but, considering the setting and genre, I felt relieved to not have to endure yet another anachronistic, butt-kicking chick wreaking havoc on Napoleon's legions. Ladies, give us guys this one, OK? We promise we'll go see *Love Actually* in exchange.</fullReview>

I am pretty confident that no Royal Navy captain would adopt this pose. The concept of sailing along in the rigging is more reminiscent of Kevin Costner in "Waterworld"!

		<shortDescription>The buckles were not particularly swashing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of this movie looked promising. Watches made their way through the different decks of their vessel during the night. We saw an attempt to authentically recreate the gloomy stuffiness of life below during the great age of sail (it was almost too authentic, being little more than a series of lantern-lit tableaux).Individuals were introduced to us with very little preamble, apparently on the basis that we'd get to know them as the story unfolded. Well; I'm afraid I didn't. The story that did unfold was a cat-and-mouse chase caper that has been done more times than I've had ships biscuits and a tot of rum. For the most part it has also been done better, as in 'The Enemy Below'. Russell Crowe is competent as a hardcase with a vulnerable side, but that's a pretty easy pose, being the stock-in-trade of any number of one-dimensioners like Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone and so on. I found very little to empathise with, and so when the cannon-balls flew, I didn't much care who was in the firing-line.The battle scenes were very feisty, after the fashion of 'Saving Private Ryan'. I suppose we must take their realism on trust, nobody now being alive with first-hand experience.And then there was the sea. Sometimes it was rough, other times it was calm. Always it was big, but never magnificent. I am told that a camera was fixed to the prow of a tall-ship that was fortuitously heading for the cape at time of filming, in order to get some genuine high-seas footage. They needn't have bothered. A force-5 in The Solent would have delivered the goods.The French vessel had a mysterious way of ambushing them and laying chase - shades of 'Duel' there. And Cap'n Crowe pursued it with dogged zeal, even over-reaching his orders - shades of 'Moby Dick', now.Most of the personal conflicts and discoveries were formulaic and predictable (You just KNEW the doctor would find the French vessel on the other side of the island after good Cap'n Crowe had sacrificed the chase for his welfare). At other times it dragged like a kedge anchor, particularly during the 'musical' interludes.One interesting anomaly was the complete absence of rats. Remember; these vessels put to see for years. When rats got aboard - as they always did - they bred and bred, and having nowhere else to go: ran riot. There was no warfarin in those days. Furthermore, the crew were often in the habit of crapping in the ballast holds, giving their furry tenants an ongoing supply of offal to munch. And the stink? Well, what do you think? Likewise the cockroaches; They bred even faster. You shared your hammock with them. Perhaps Mr Crowe's starring sensibilities would not admit of such intimacy.I would like to say something positive about this movie. But apart from a profound relief when it ended, I can think of very little. If you're going to be authentic then do it right - or stick with Errol Flynn. Recently I watched an old 1950's movie called 'The Cruel Sea'. That was about hunting German subs rather than French Frigates. But in every aspect of presentation, from character to story to hardships, it was incomparably superior, and on a far more modest budget. Doubters should see them both back to back. And everyone who likes nautical movies should see the latter.As to 'Master &amp; Commander'; for me it sank with all hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious and forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never read the series of books upon which this film is inspired, but hopefully they are infinitely more rousing than what translates to the screen in this endeavor. The film opens well enough and nicely establishes the rigors and hardships of life at sea on a British vessel during the Napoleonic Wars. Unfortunately, it does not go anywhere after that establishment. The remainder of the film is basically a drawn-out cat-and-mouse game in trying to avoid/confront an enemy vessel while navigating around South America. With the exception of three characters, all of the British seamen blend together and have no distinctive personalities. I swore the character played by Billy Boyd was killed at least three times only to pop up later unharmed making this viewer realize that it was just someone similar and equally forgettable who met their tragic end. Max Perkis stands out as young boy who loses his arm in the opening battle. Russell Crowe packed on substantial weight to take on the role of Captain Jack Aubrey, but one wonders at the effort since the role is a relatively straightforward one of a stiff-upper-lip British sea captain essayed as well, if not better, in a least a dozen superior films. Paul Bettany is exceptional as the boat's surgeon and the film really becomes interesting whenever he is on screen. His side trip to explore the indigenous life on the Galapagos Islands is a nice passage. The remainder of the crew are instantly forgettable and at large unsympathetic. A subplot where the superstitious crew hounds a young crewmen to his death because they blame him for the bad luck and weather plaguing them makes them even less appealing. The fact that the captain seems to support their stand is probably believable, but hardly inspires confidence in his abilities. Even worse, the movie seems to halfway buy into the superstitious stance, which is reprehensible. After the initial battle, the few remaining battle sequences become increasingly repetitious and boring. We learn little to nothing about the enemy vessel, and with a horde of unsympathetic seadogs on the British vessel, it is difficult to become emotionally involved in the outcome. Film is entirely too long and flaccidly paced. It actually concludes in the middle of a pursuit, but it seems unlikely anyone will care about the ultimate outcome. It incredibly received a number of Oscar nominations, but no major wins. To its credit, it does convey one major aspect of life at sea to the viewer ? unending torpor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scott's Best -- Magnificent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this movie is right up my alley, but still.. It's intelligently written, incredibly well-acted, exciting (in a slower way than most modern action flicks) thoughtful, and true to the fighting sail genre. The production values are outstanding as is just about everything else. It's obviously a work of love.On the other hand, if you've read the O'Brian novels, you might miss some of the finer points of the Aubrey/Maturin relationship. Personally, I read the books after, so it wasn't an issue. I must have watched this ten times by now, and I still marvel at some of the detail. My only caveat is that it is not your standard Hollywood production which has been written trying to appeal to every demographic. It is what it is, so you'll need to be interested in the subject matter. If you even remotely are, you should find it a very rewarding viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing Poetic Diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Beautiful Looking Film is an Adventure, a Study of Salty Sailors and not an Action Movie. To be Critical, the Action Scenes, Especially the Hand to Hand Battle may be the Weakest Part of this Excellent Exercise.The Focus is on the Ship and Mates. The Captain and Interaction and Lifestyle aboard, in the Early Nineteenth Century. Her Majesty's Navy Sailing the Sea and Looking for the Navy of Napoleon. There is Superstition, Surgery, and Song on deck, along with Camaraderie and Combat Preparation. All done with Delirious Detail.The Camera is only Less than Impressive when it is in that Final Battle. Here Hollywood's Current Fascination with Shaky Cameras, Quick Cutting and Close Close-Ups during the Action, are Irritating and Incomprehensive as to Who is doing What to Whom and the Whole Intensity is Lost in these Confusing Images. But to the Dismay of Many, these Battle Scenes are Short and Few and do not Distract from the Overall Magnificence of the Movie. It could be Called an Old-School kind of Film that isn't made much Anymore, Especially in this Genre and it is a Nice and Poetic Diversion from all that Overblown Stuff that has Drowned the Drama in Recent Years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Favorite Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite movies if not my very favorite movie ever. Extremely engaging and exciting plot with the right amount of action-packed violent battle scenes at the right times. Perfect movie for military warfare and history buffs like me and for men and boys. I love period war films. ^^ Also what made this film a most enjoyable experience for me, as an avid classical music listener and violinist, is the use of classical music in the soundtrack. I especially loved that very poignant scene - with Corelli's Adagio from his Concerto Grosso in G Minor playing - of the injured Maturin being carried into the scenic Galapagos Islands and also that scene when they reached the Islands themselves with Bach's Cello Suite Number 1 Prelude playing. I also liked the fact that Aubrey and Maturin were apparently not just excellent at their respective professions - let alone Maturin's naturalist hobby - they just so also happened to be an excellent violin-cello duo! This film was truly the best of both worlds for me. In reality though, the adeptness of this pair at so many skills would seem most improbable and make me extremely jealous, but in fiction, well - it's just awesome! xD Although I would have preferred Russell Crowe could have at least have not held the violin so clumsily though. He could have done with several more violin lessons! :P Still, amazing how these film technicians can somewhat simulate the actual fingerings for those pieces into the actor's hands. Not exactly a perfect simulation though as any cellist or violinist, or any musician for that matter, can still tell it's being faked, but very cool nonetheless!Gave this a perfect ten. Even after the fourth time or so watching this yesterday, I couldn't help smiling and laughing like a giddy boy at the excellently played-out battle scenes and especially at that "lesser of two weevils" joke. xD Russell Crowe also really played his character like he truly was Captain Jack Aubrey and I could not help but feel extremely moved and inspired by him whenever he rallied his men during his speeches - as if I was right there among his men, listening to him. This film, unlike most, gives its characters the kind of depth you often only find in book characters; you become attached to them. Like how this film explores Aubrey's struggle to compromise his conviction toward his duty and his men, sometimes having to "choose the lesser of two weevils". :P One may think they are one and the same, but the film shows he often had to choose between one or the other - whether to head back to land to save his best friend's life or chase down the Acheron, to save the life of a man overboard or risk the lives of his whole crew and ship during a storm. The film expounds on themes of fellowship, friendship and duty in a time of war when they become tested. Although I haven't yet read the books yet, I feel confident in saying that this film does justice to portraying the books. I've downloaded the whole collection to the book series just because of this movie and I will get to reading them eventually. I have a feeling that the books will prove equally or more exciting. Here's to hoping that they'll make a whole film series eventually! This is much more deserving of its own series than that superficial Pirates of the Caribbean crap. It would be incredibly disappointing if Hollywood would leave this largely untapped cultural treasure to waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, Heroic and Inspirational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am taking the plunge, and giving this movie my first "10" rating.In the mid-18th century, Russell Crowe, a Commander of a British Man Of War ship, faithfully discharges his duties to the Royal Navy and the King, pursuing a troublesome French warship which is larger, more heavily armed, and of a higher class than his own. He must use all his skills and leadership abilities to overcome his superior foe.Excellent acting all around in this movie. Life aboard a British warship in the 1700s was quite rough, with most crews being treated by their officers as little more than prisoners. However, Russell Crowe has all the military education of old-school Royal Navy, without any meanness or narcissism. He is a firm leader of his men, who brooks no nonsense, but refuses to be unnecessarily cruel. He displays a high degree of personal integrity, and treats everyone, regardless of rank or station in life, with respect. As a result, his crew has complete faith in his leadership - their loyalty is unswerving, and this plays a very crucial part in what is to come.Encounters with the French warship are unsuccessful at first; Crowe is forced to retreat, to avoid destruction, but does so with a cleverness that amuses his men, and their morale does not suffer from the defeat. In their extensive travels, the Brits enjoy some interesting diversions, including exploration of the Galapagos Islands. There are casualties, including the Captain (Crowe) himself, and an intriguing sequence where the ship's surgeon is accidentally shot through the abdomen, and must operate on himself, with an assistant holding a mirror. The youngest officer on board is gravely wounded in battle, his arm smashed by a musket ball, and must undergo an amputation, without anesthesia. Barely a teenager, he not only endures, but impresses all with his courage and strength, fully recovering (except for the loss of his arm) without complaint. This boy-officer even plays a key role in a pitched battle with the Frensh warship, boarding the enemy ship and fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy. The sailors he commands - all much older men than himself - are literally spellbound by his performance in battle. The crew, impressed by their Captain's leadership and humanity, draws strength from him, as he does from them.It is a story of bravery, intelligence, coolness under adversity, and true leadership ability. The Captain is far above the norm in this regard, and his performance is inspirational - not only for his crew, but for the audience watching this movie. All of us wish that we had leaders like this man in our lives and workplaces.Of course, I will not reveal the ending lol. You must watch this movie, but I highly recommend it. It's a "10". It's a "must see, don't miss".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful and commanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene in "Master and Commander" that encapsulates the spirit of this movie. It is not one of the spectacular action sequences or a scene of tension between the characters. Rather, it is when the officers of 'HMS Surprise' dine with their captain, Lucky Jack Albury, Russell Crowe's character.The men around the table range from senior officers to young midshipmen. The dinner is formal and the men are respectful of the captain's position; it is also obvious that they hold him in high regard. One of the officers asks the Captain if he would tell an anecdote about Lord Nelson. Aubrey obliges and holds his audience in the palm of his hand; the scene not only reveals the awe seamen had for Nelson during his lifetime, but it also captures a feeling for the language, the humour, and the temper of the times.Like everything else in the film it is the details, lovingly observed, that make it an exceptional experience.Cinema has produced some memorable films about life in the age of sail, but "Master and Commander" can stand with the best of them. In fact, the film's production team had compiled clips from about 50 of the best sailing and period movies ever made. This was done to learn what worked on the screen and what didn't.Directed by Peter Weir, the film is based on a series of books by Patrick O'Brian. These feature Captain Jack Aubrey and Doctor Stephen Maturin, played by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany in the movie.Weir's script captures the fabric of the times and the characters involved. This is true to the philosophy of Patrick O'Brian, who felt that fabric was far more important than plot.While on patrol off Brazil, 'HMS Surprise' is ambushed by a much larger French battleship, 'Alcheron'. With his ship damaged, the captain of 'Surprise', Jack Aubrey, decides to pursue the unscathed French ship. The ship's surgeon, Dr Maturin, feels the captain is doing this out of sense of wounded pride and this places a strain on their relationship. A violent storm and tension amongst the crew adds to the drama, especially when one of the officers is thought to bring bad luck ? a Jonah.Another strand of the story involves Blakeny, a young midshipman who loses his arm in the first battle. Played by Max Pirkis. Maturin recognises his thirst for knowledge and encourages his interest in botany, especially when the ship arrives in the Galapagos.Eventually, 'Surprise' finds 'Alcheron' and the scene is set for the final showdown. Sometimes, a powerful opening sequence can overwhelm subsequent events, but not here. The final battle, after the pursuit around South America, caps a movie that rarely puts a foot wrong.Russell Crowe finds just the right tone for Lucky Jack. Balancing devotion to duty, a sense of humour and a dash of obsession he emerges as a leader of men not unlike his Maximus from "Gladiator", but far less gloomy. The actors sound authentic ? there are expressions and snatches of dialogue that transport the ear as effectively as the camera transports the eye to another time."Master and Commander" is one film that almost demands a sequel, but so far Peter Weir doesn't seem interested. A pity, but at least we still have this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As thoughtful as it is gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best failures to launch a franchise in film history, Peter Weir's beautiful sea-faring epic, Master and Commander, was overshadowed commercially by that other ship-based film to come out the same year, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. While Gore Verbinski's box-office smash was a lot of fun and managed to re-create the sense of comedy-adventure perfected in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) (while making billions with its sequels for Disney), Master and Commander goes about its business quietly, creating tender scenes of human interaction alongside some magnificent sea-battles of its own. So the novels of Patrick O'Brian are seemingly destined to remain an untapped resource in cinema, but there is still plenty to enjoy here as a stand-alone film.During the Napoleonic wars, captain of the HMS Surprise, 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), has been given the task of pursuing French privateer Ancheron, and to 'sink, burn, or take her as a prize'. When one of the crew hears the distant sound of bells one night, the Surprise is taken unawares by the immense power of Ancheron, which is near twice the size of Surprise, and wields much more firepower. Almost fatefully damaged, Aubrey takes the Surprise and retreats into the fog to repair the damage, only to be attacked and pursued again. They reach the Galapagos Islands, where Aubrey predicts Ancheron will head to in order to attack Britain's whaling fleet, and will allow time for the ships doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) to walk the islands to gather specimens and notes on the wildlife.After the exciting opening that shows the almost complete destruction of the HMS Surprise, Weir takes us in close quarters with the various levels of the ship's hierarchy from the mates who lie packed like sardines inside the ship being fed on gruel and rum, to the spacious quarters of the captain and his lieutenants. Drinking wine and eating steaks in what looks like a grand dining room of aristocracy, Aubrey and his immediate underlings are certainly privileged. This is mirrored in the scenes of Jack and Stephen playing violin together, and while these moments are key to understanding the close friendship between the two despite them clearly being men of differing values, it also shows their upper-class backgrounds. The shipmates are less so. They are happy being rewarded for good work with double-helpings of gruel, but have an almost necessary brutish nature that becomes apparent when they begin to bully Midshipman Hollom (Lee Ingleby).As well as portraying the societal structure of Britain within the confines of a ship, the film is also about the trappings of power. Jack and Stephen's philosophical discussions about this subject when Jack's hand is forced for the survival of the ship, causes Stephen to compare Jack's behaviour to Nero. Jack argues that the men require discipline and a strong hand to follow while Stephen advises that such an attitude can lead a man to be seduced by the trappings of power. There is also the matter of Jack's pride. At what point does duty end and ego begin? The pursuit of Ancheron will surely lead to the Surprise's demise and the death of its crew, but the men will follow 'Lucky' Jack no matter what.Don't be fooled though, Master and Commander offers scenes of relentless action, with the Academy Award-winning cinematography and sound editing coming together to form scenes that are as beautiful as they are breathless. The hand-held camera gets deep into the action, as cannonball's smash through the ship, sending razor-sharp splinters into the air and taking men's limbs with them. 14-year old midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis) loses an arm in the opening battle, and his idolising of Jack and Stephen forms the heart of the film. Jack is strength and leadership, Stephen is calm and thoughtful, characteristics on opposite sides of the spectrum, but Blakeney wants to be both. Sometimes it can feel crammed with too many ideas, but Master and Commander is a terrific film, and, like a lot of Weir's back catalogue, manages to be as thoughtful as it is gripping.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow sea epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of life on the sea, living our adventure after adventure, has always fascinated me. This is the first real movie of that nature that I have seen (save "Pirates of the Caribbean"). The story is of a crew during the Napoleonic Wars that are on a mission to take down another ship. Of course, the other ship has the same orders, resulting in several scenes of cannons damaging said ships. The lead stars, Russell Crowe as the captain and Paul Bettany as the doctor, are a great pair whom you may remember from "A Beautiful Mind". The film is well done and realistic. The only downfall is that it is a bit difficult to follow and it is somewhat slow on top of that. It is definitely worth watching, but just be aware.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set during the Napoleonic War, Master and Commander paints a good picture of life aboard a warship. Aboard the HMS Surprise, the British Captain Jack , a fearless strategist, battles the French ship the Acheron. Although there are slower scenes depicting the monotony of travel on the high seas, there are also graphic scenes of sailors getting wounded and receiving treatment. It also portrays the relationships of the crew and hardships of battle at sea. The drama between Russell Crowe's Captain Jack and his friend Steven Maturin is especially well-acted. It's somewhat harder to tell the difference between some of the minor characters who get lost in the mix with bad lighting and poor weather. Overall, this is a good movie and I would definitely recommend it to friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually epic adaptation of the first three books in a series that I have yet to read, if not excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you start arguing with me, I want to say that I have yet to read the books in which I will someday, so why have I decided to see this? Because I've heard that it had Russell Crowe in it and since he's such a great actor in big hits like Gladiator and more, I became very interested and watched it on a DVD copy from a library yesterday, hoping that it would exceed my expectations. A few hours later, it did, but before I could go to the positive aspects, I believe there's only one flaw that quite ruined the film for me and that is the music.I have listened to original music from other great films like "Titanic", "The Lord of the Rings", "Jurassic Park", and "Batman", but the music in this film was, shall I say, forgettable. It didn't match the epic proportions of the entire film. Had this movie get one of the other music composers like either Howard Shore, James Horner, or John Williams, it would've made this film much more epic.With the flaw aside, everything exceeded my expectations surprisingly well. The scenery is beautiful with some great details of the islands and the oceans which were used as battlefields for the action sequences in the beginning and the climax of the movie, and even the cinematography gives the movie both scope and sweep in the process. The costumes are the epitome of the word brilliant, the pacing is never fast and never slow and the direction from Peter Weir was magnificent with a lot of focus, but what stands out the most is the cast and actors to carry out this film. Russell Crowe is appealing as the lead and he managed to play out his role very flawlessly, Paul Bettany did a good job as a physician, and all of the other actors did excellent with the roles they've been given especially the child actors. Another thing that stands out, like the acting, is the amusing ship battles between the HMS Surprise and the Acheron they would leave you completely breathless.Like I said before, I never read the books or the first three this movie was based on, but I think that the director gave some excellent details in order to make it quite amusing for the audience when it was first released. I've heard that fans of the series are waiting for a potential sequel to whether or not be made despite it's under-performance at the box office, but given the magnificent positive reception in this film, I would also want to see a sequel as well because I agree that this is, in fact, one of the greatest action epic films in the history of cinema. With all my heart, this deserves a thumbs up from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this excellent film, i couldn't help but compare this with Star trek. Star trek always involves providing solutions in impossible situations, with a tight nit group that has the fullest respect for their captain. But that respect and trust was gained through three years that the original series of Star trek was on. These men that starred in this gritty, realistic version of deep sea war fare, managed to capture that sense of trust and loyalty in two and a half hours. You can tell how much labor of work that was done to make this film happen. And what i loved most of all, is that if any CGI was used, i couldn't tell. The director Peter Weir is a true talent, and captures every aspect of this beautifully filmed movie flawlessly. Russel Crowe is completely believable as the ship's captain, and made me feel like if i was ever out on the big sea, in search of a battle with a ship that is exceptionally capable of certain death, i'd want to serve under him. The supporting cast, was fantastic as the ship mates. They definitely made sure to keep the authenticity of the situation expressed on their faces. Overall, a very good film that certainly deserved every Oscar nomination it got.</fullReview>

The characters in the film are straight out of the books and as a reader, you get to know them. The series is really one continuous story that takes Aubrey, Matuarin and the rest of the crew to the four corners of the earth where they do battle with the bad guys--usually the French but sometmes the Americans--which battles O'Brian describes in graphic detail. This film is one you can watch over again without the onset of boredom. My only complaint at this time is that other Aubrey-Maturin stories have not been filmed.

This movie also managed to give likable heroes, unlike Stupidian, whose heroes are lawless drunkards who fight over silly women. In MaC, the heroes are patriots who will defend their country at all costs, even if they are outmatched. Russel Crowe makes a better Captain than you-know-who, and his crew actually remain loyal to him. The sub-plots of the doctor wanting to visit the Galapigos Islands (sic?)add to the movie and make it more enjoyable. I would watch this movie again.</fullReview>

I thought it was great how well the music in the background complimented the scenes especially when they brought it into the movie when the caption and doctor played together. The movie shows good relations between characters. The movie left you with a question in your head in which I particularly didn't not appreciate. In the end the movie I think was good but not as good as I think It could have been. OK, well basically the movie takes place in the early years and the entire movies takes place on the ocean. The ship has a captain with slaves as his shipmates the ship gets attacked a couple of times throughout the movie and at one point even causes a forced man overboard who was not a slave, which gives you a good sense on the captains character. They travel to the galopogis islands in the search of new species and rest or the injured doctor from there ship, they travel back out to sea, and surprise attack the enemy ship at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great screenplay and direction by Peter Weir, Master and commander: The far side of the world is a depiction of a constant endeavour of a captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) to destroy a French enemy frigate during the time of Napoleonic Wars, thus putting the lives of the entire crew in jeopardy for vengeance as well as for the sake of his country.During his crazy will to take on the Acheron, the enemy Frigate, Jack is often contradicted by his closest friend, the doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) and albeit he never gives up the hope of invading the French frigate, he is constantly put in adverse situations wherein he is compelled to feel remorseful for the decisions he made. However he manages to keep the faith of his crew members alive and pursues the Acheron without giving an eye to the doctor's concern and interests. A series of unfortunate events occur and their ship suffers bad luck every now and then but that doesn't stop Jack from taking on the Acheron eventually.Some great acting by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany makes the whole movie an adventure worth watching. The situations that they were put in certainly demanded pluck and patience which was manifested well by Jack Aubrey.This flick would make you fathom how things were really dealt with earlier. Back then when the technology wasn't advanced enough, how sails were used by the crew and how much work was supposed to be done during a shipwreck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For England, for home, and for the prize!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The real traditions of the British Navy are rum, buggery and the lash." ? Winston ChurchillPeter Weir directs "Master and Commander", an old-fashioned adventure which finds actor Russell Crowe captaining the HMS Surprise, a British ship tasked with chasing a French frigate across the coast of Brazil.Such nautical cat-and-mouse films were common between the mid 1940s and early 1960s ("Crimson Pirate", "The Black Swan", "Captain Horatio Hornblower", "Blackbeard", "Captain Kidd", "Damn the Defiant!", "Seahawk", "Run Silent, Run Deep", "The Enemy Below" etc), but faded, ironically, thanks to advances in film special effects. Early audiences accepted models, rear projection, giant water tanks and sound stages, but from the 70s onwards, wouldn't buy anything other than location shooting and full-scale mock-ups of 19th century ships. Such an approach was fine for sedentary sea faring flicks like Marlon Brando's "Mutiny on the Bounty", and later, 1984's "Bounty", but simply wasn't practical for bigger action movies. So what happened to the nautical cat-and-mouse adventure tale? It went high concept, taking the form of submarine thrillers ("Das Boot", "Hunt For Red October", "Crimson Tide") and space movies ("Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"), submarine and spaceship models being not only much cooler, but easier to blow up, convincingly create, and didn't require sailors running across their decks. It took the availability of CGI and the huge water tank used to shoot James Cameron's "Titanic" to bring 19th century nautical mayhem back to the screens, this time in the shape of films like "Master and Commander" and the "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies. The former was directed by Peter Weir, so it has a certain classiness, restraint and intelligence which differentiates it from other Hollywood thrillers. But like most of Weir's films, "Master and Commander" also has a huge identity crisis, the director's impressive technique, handing of actors and material always clashing with scripts which are far too safe, too Hollywood and too watered down. Every Peter Weir film wastes a great concept. So though "Master and Commander" pretends to be realistic, its actual script is packed with clichés ? the storm at sea, the petty squabbles, the boy in charge, the last act death, the captain's gambit, the cannon battles etc - pulled from 80 years worth of seafaring pictures. Better to embrace the film's pulpy roots and serve up a fun version of "Wrath of Khan" on water, or ditch the pretentious tone and give us a genuinely realistic look at life on board a 19th century ship.But no, Weir wants it both ways. He serves up a cartoon plot and then uses his skill and much solemnity to con us into thinking this is somehow more realistic and deep than, say, "Cutthroat Island". Weir directed "Picnic at hanging rock", so he is a master of ambiance and gets away with his con job, but don't mistake what he delivers here for real shipboard life. Real shipboard life was far more fascinating, with a complex class system (imagine Altman giving this the "Gosford Park" treatment), 12 hour shifts, muscular crewmen, disease, shared sex rope dolls, much homosexual activity, colourful swearing, sea shanties, crazy superstitious beliefs and constant routines involving carving, knotting, scrubbing, cleaning etc. Even Weir's actors don't look right, with clean clothes, skin and perfect teeth. Essentially a floating prison ? and landlubbers often described them as such - these ships also often had "peg boys", young boys used for sex. This sounds gross, but such perversions sprout in any environment in which males live in close quarters for lengthy periods of time. In "Buggery and the British Navy, 1700-1861", for example, writer Arthur Gilbert states that on these ships, homosexual activity was so rife and sodomy so regular that both were treated as being "natural" by all those involved. So the squeaky clean "Master and Commander" is ultimately pure military romanticism, the kind of simple values (honour, brotherhood, camaraderie, glory, heroism, gallantry, self mastery) that only works with a light-hearted Errol Flynn or William Shatner at the helm. In this regard, observe how the film's best moments feature both audience and cast sharing a kind of boyish, childish glee. The film's a boy's adventure pretending to be grown up, and everything else is just filler until playtime. 8/10 ? The film is handsome, well crafted, its dialogue has a lovely pang and the "cat and mouse" set pieces work well on an archetypal level. Unfortunately the film isn't as swashbuckling and fun as it should be and its air of solemnity and "realism" is false and pretentious. Still, it's a shame the film didn't do better business. A couple sequels would help to loosen things up, and give Russell Crowe a chance to develop his character. The first Star Trek movie ? itself essentially Sharpe or Hornblower in space ? was likewise very stuffy, its creators only embracing the franchise's pulpiness with a sequel. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping naval drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sat down to watch this I rather expected a somewhat old fashioned film where the gallant heroes would chase the dastardly enemy and then be victorious with out too much bloodshed or conflict within the crew? I was wrong, or at least partly so. It is true that the story follows an heroic crew as they pursue their enemy but it is by no means plain sailing for them and the French are portrayed as a worthy enemy without any stereotypical scenes of them plotting, in fact we only see them during the scene of hand to hand combat near the end. Russell Crowe is excellent as Jack Aubrey; Captain of HMS Surprise. He and his crew are hunting the Acheron, a French privateer, off the coast of Brazil when they find themselves coming under attack from their superior quarry. Once repairs are made Aubrey is determined that rather than returning to Britain he will follow the Acheron even if the means rounding Cape Horn and heading deep into the Pacific.From the start where the Acheron attacks out of a fog bank there is plenty of action, as the crew must deal with both the French ship and the weather that gets worse as the head south. The weather looked real as the ship was drenched by both waves and rain frequently reminding me of something Turner might have painted, as it was so atmospheric. The battle scenes were also gripping filmed in a way that the viewer is drawn into the action. Once the battles are over the film doesn't flinch from showing the dead and wounded and the treatment they received. It isn't all foul weather and fighting though; there are a few humorous scenes and the crew do get a brief break on the Galapagos Islands where the ship's doctor, played by the excellent Paul Bettany, wishes to study the local wildlife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Weir's "Master and Commander" is a superb follow-up from "Dead Calm", the "other" sea &amp; sails movie from the Australian director. But both movies can, apart from being filmed on the ocean waves, hardly be compared: "Master and Commander" is truly an adventure movie that, I'm sure of it, will not only make mature but also younger viewers (age up to 10, there are some bloody scenes) really enthusiastic. I could't find a serious flaw in this movie - on the contrary, in my opinion it's perfect in all aspects: story-line, cinematography, acting, and sound. You wish this film would last for ever. There's so much to enjoy and I love the way how Weir interweaves the heritage of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Thank you, Mr Peter Weir!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The attention to detail in this movie is one thing that really impresses me, particularly in the actor's wonderful job of studying and speaking 18th century British Naval lingo and accents flawlessly. You feel immersed in the belly of this tiny British Frigate (at 28 guns, it was indeed a tiny warship for the time and barely worthy of the title Frigate) which brings me to the first of many minor complaints.We are shown a very skillful and apparently distinguished commander, who apparently served with the immortal Nelson himself, yet this man, at the apex of his career, is commanding what might today be called a patrol boat. He should be commanding a massive 74 gunner ship of the line by this time in his career, and we are offered no explanation as to why this is not so.The reason of course is because of production values. No 74 gunner exists any more in the world and would have to have been re-created completely digitally. That they managed to do this with the 'French' Constitution class heavy frigate is proof it could have been done though.Apparently they originally had the British against the Americans. This would have made a far more enjoyable movie for me, since the American Constitution class 44 gun frigate, (armed with 24 inch main guns, btw, not 18 as stated in the movie) was never loaned to the French.Secondly, such a boat would have eaten the lowly British frigate for breakfast on the first engagement, fog bank or no fog bank. The inequality between these two ships is so massive as to nearly beg impossibility of any good outcome for the Brit boat. The passage of such a unique ship would have been known, and the British would have dispatched at least 2 (more like 4 for good measure) 36 gun frigates in pursuit.But technical errors aside, where this movie shines is in the acting, and in the costumes, set and the passion the actors threw into it to get the mood right. Wonderful job, I suspect the director sent them all off on a tall ship sailing adventure cruise to get their heads into it before the movie began.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ship to Crowe About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In April 1805, Napoleon is the "Master of Europe" and only the British Navy stands before him. In oceanic waters off Brazil, English Captain Russell Crowe (as "Lucky" Jack Aubrey) of the H.M.S. "Sunrise" receives his ship's battle plan - "Intercept French Privateer 'Acheron' en route to Pacific ?sink, burn, or take her (as) a prize." Captain Crowe's ship is damaged in an early scuffle, weathers a bad storm, and finally engages its enemy in the destined battle."Master and Commander" subtitled "The Far Side of the World" is a big, splashy production. With polished direction by Peter Weir, and based on the respected novels of Patrick O'Brian, it still does not convey the same level of awe found in classic seafaring pictures. When you think of Herman Melville or "Mutiny on the Bounty" you think of colossal allegorical conflicts, between good and evil, or man and God. Here, we have the British against the French, and some bad weather.Crowe begins by looking a little like Charles Laughton, but is soon revealed to be more Richard Burton, pontificating with best friend and ship's doctor Paul Bettany (as Stephen Maturin). The men disagree amicably, debate decisions, and play musical instruments together. The latter may explain why they like each other so much. Other crew members are interesting, due to the different sacrifices they make. The most obvious is young Max Pirkis (as William "Will" Blakeney), as you'll see.While the cameras spend most of their time finding the aforementioned three actors, others have memorable roles to play. Due very much to their fates, it's interesting to follow James D'Arcy (as Thomas "Tom" Pullings), Max Benitz (as Peter Myles Calamy), and Joseph Morgan (as William Warley). The writers' added "Jonah" character is nicely played by Lee Ingleby (as Hollom). Uniquely, he can see the enemy, but can't match his skills with the story; just like the movie, just out of sync.****** Master and Commander (11/14/03) Peter Weir ~ Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Max Pirkis, James D'Arcy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It says something about the general dullness of 2009 cinema when you can go back to a (at the time) somewhat mediocre-seeming 2003 slow-paced meditation on seamanship and find some redeeming value in it! Six years ago, M&amp;C mostly disappointed --- when His Flabbiness Russell Crowe suspended himself sideways from the rigging, you mostly feared that the main mast would surely give away due to the considerable added weight, and Paul Bettany's petulant, annoying, balding MD was another nuisance. Also, the porked-out midshipmen hardly looked like one's imagination of the sea-worn products of early 19th- century cuisine and lifestyle. And what was the plot again, exactly?Inspired no doubt by the success of the "Hornblower" TV mini-series, M&amp;C set out to give us the big-budget version of Hornblower, with bigger storms, bigger ships, bigger VFX. And it mostly succeeded, somehow, even though at the time of its release it seemed like a failure. But then again, how can you possibly fault a film that has the good sense to use Bach's cello suite #1 for its breather in the middle, the totally-pointless-but-still-wonderful Galapagos episode?I think the trick is to approach this movie like a French art-house film from the sixties--- where nothing ever happens, no plot lines are ever resolved, and where the ending seems oddly circular and to come out of nothing ("Whoops Mrs. Miggins, the enemy captain is actually still alive -- so let's turn the ship!"). Like I said, it's a kind of meditation, so the whole idea that this movie should deliver on the basis of action scenes was flawed to begin with. It's much like "Moby Dick", except that in this version the white whale never gets caught for more than five minutes. Which doesn't make it any less enjoyable, especially if you consider the wonderful sound design. So my recommendation would be to watch this together with the "Hornblower" TV series---the two artistic visions wonderfully complement each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master &amp; Commander, with Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany.I love this 2003 movie because it is a sailing movie, with a great actor, wonderful dialogue and plot twists. It has incredible hand to hand, canon to canon battle scenes, set in 1805. The raw violence is juxtapositioned with the English Captain (Crowe) maneuvering his ship like a chess piece to outfox his rarely seen French opponent, while he and doctor spend their evenings playing the violin and cello music of Mozart and J.S. Bach.Master was filmed with full scale replicas. It was nominated for Best: Art Direction-Set Decoration, Costume Design, Director, Editing, Makeup, Picture, Sound Mixing and Visual Effects. It won Oscars for Best Cinematography and Sound Editing. Crowe did most of the violin playing on camera, but the cello playing is Yo Yo Ma's work. The soundtrack is available from Decca (ASIN: B0000DG07D).Bettany is best known as the sick Silas in The Da Vinci Code and the charming Chaucer, with Heath Ledger in A Knight's Tale.Master was directed by Petter Weir, who has remarkable writing and directing credits: The Truman Show, Dead Poets Society, Witness, The Year of Living Dangerously and Gallipoli (another great war movie).</fullReview>

The film portrays an Englishman ordering the suicidal attacks on the Turkish machine guns when in fact history shows the man ordering the charges was an Australian.

		<fullReview>"Master and Commander" is an interesting film that tries to combine pure entertainment with philosophy and historical detail. To some extent, one could say, it is successful. This is not so much because of the story (which is pretty thin), but more because of the interest Peter Weir puts on the crew and their internal dynamic. The strongest parts of this movie are in its non-battle sequences, when the interest is almost fully on the captain and his crew. To make it short: What we have here is a character-drama-blockbuster. But: As a blockbuster it may be too slow for a big part of the audience. And as a character drama, it doesn't go deep enough, it stays on the surface. But the result is still better than most of the blockbusters today, you just have to take it for what it is and you will be able to enjoy it very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well crafted film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie about the HMS Surprise, commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey, stalking the French vessel Acheron to the "far side of the world" during the Napoleanic era. The film is intricately detailed, and while I am no sailor, most of the details strike true. I do know that the British Navy by the time of this story absolutely revered Lord Nelson, and that reverence is played out in this movie when several younger officers ask the Captain for impressions of Nelson during one of his two meeting with the Admiral. The cannons have names, the bells number the hours of the shipboard day. A knotted rope line is played out to measure the ship's speed in knots. A sounding is taken to read the depth of the sea, and sextant lessons are given to measure true noon. In fact the level of detail is overwhelming, but the story is just as good.The Acheron is the superior ship, and at first it seems the Captain is also superior. He surprises the Surprise twice, once coming out of the fog at the beginning of the movie and once by hiding in an inlet and letting the Surprise chase on by. Captain Aubry only barely manages to escape into the fog the first time, and into the night the second.Russell Crowe's performance as Captain Jack Aubry is spectacular. I was also immensely impressed with Mix Ppirkis's portrayal of young Mr. Blakeny. The photography and camera work were absolutely first rate, as well as the tremendous attention to detail.This is a really great movie on so many levels. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Peter Weir took on the mammoth task of adapting two of Patrick O'Brain's novel to make this film, he encountered the same expectations as any writer, producer and director would, especially when the film is guaranteed to be scrutinized by a well established fan base across the world. Not only had the film had it's bedrock fan base it also had the fans of it's two main star attractions. These were Peter Weir and Russell Crowe. The expectation of both of them were huge.Peter Weir had made his name for himself in the mid 1970's and early 1980's by directing some of Australia's finest films such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Galipoli. He along with Jane Campion, Mel Gibson and Geoffrey Rush be came known as the Australian New Wave. His career in Hollywood blossomed resulting in a C.V. littered with great films amongst them, Witness, Mosquito Coast and Dead Poets Society. His reputation was built on strong, moving story lines of men re-examining their existence through a events out of their control. Master and Commander: The Far side of the World has these very themes running through them. With a career already based on thorough examination of themes Peter Weir was the best person to adapt the novels and produce them for the big screen. Therefore his very best was expected with his film.Russell Crowe's ascension from American B-movies and Australian Independents to Hollywood blockbuster had been nothing short of magnificent. Not only had he the success but in the wake he had left 4 memorable characterizations and three academy Award nominations and one win. But his arrogance and temper proceeded him and lost out on a second Academy Award through an incident at the BAFTA awards. Master and Commander: The Far side of the World was to be his follow up movie to this incident and every one wanted to see if this self proclaimed great actor was in fact a good as he said or would he fall flat on his face. On top of this there was the building pressure to nail the vision Captain Lucky Jack Aubury that the fans of the book had and of course the concept that the Late Patrick O'Brain had personally envisioned.Master and Commander: The Far side of the world tells the story of Captain " Lucky " Jack Aubruy, Captain of the H.M.S Surprise and one of the finest naval officers of his times. Assisted by a loyal crew of officers and able seamen, he patrols the seas of the British empire and protecting the Kings ships from Napoleonic attackers. On the Admirals orders Captain Jack must track down The Acheron, a French privateer ship, which is looting British ships. Captain Jack pursues relentlessly pushing his crew to the limit against the advice of ships surgeon and best friend Stephen Maturin. Due to his persistence Aubury runs the risk of losing his crews respect and his friendship with Stephen Maturin. As the intensity builds Captain Jack Aubury must face the prospect of losing for the first time.Weir and Crowe do not disappoint with this film. I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable film. Weirs direction is flawless and as every bullet flies and cannonballs fly you can believe that you are on the deck with Captain Jack Aubury. He mixes the action with drama with precision and although the action sequences are spread out you never really see them as essential to the storyline until they actually happen. What is great about the storyline is as the chase goes on and the stakes become higher our anxiety grows with the ships crew. This is helped by the cinematography of Russell Boyd his camera work creates a claustophic look at 19th century naval life. His handling of the battle scenes is amazing and the result is that he won an academy award for his trouble.Weir also handles his supporting cast very well there are a few fine performances from the younger crew members, but the under rated performance of Lee Ingleby as the doomed Midshipman Hollom whose ship life existence and fate brings a dark sinister tone to the film. Paul Bettany is also very effective in the role of Stephen Maturin. His character his the voice of reasoning in Jack's ear and his skill as a surgeon amplifies the patience he needs when dealing with Captain Jack Aubury.Russell Crowe is fantastic as Captain Jack Aubury. He captures the essence of Aubury in all his magnificent glory. Underneath the decorated clothes of a celebrated Naval Officer lies a man institutionalized by the navy. Aubury is the Master and Commander of his ship. He knows every plank of wood and every nought in the HMS Surprise. His discussions with Maturin reveal he is a man that has never faced the prospect of failing and in his mind that is not an option and it never will be. He is conservative and very superstitious. All this is down the lifestyle he has chosen to lead. He is not an easy man to reason with as Maturin finds out. Crowe is very subtle in his characterization of Aubury, his manner is pleasant yet he speaks with a firm tone. He is very believable in the role and although it is forgotten about due to the amount a negative press Crowe had received at the time I think in years to come it will be fondly remembered.All in all this film is quality viewing, the worst thing I could say about it is that it can drag at times but other than that it really is worth the watch. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

His books certainly bear out that characterization. Read them and you'll see why!The movie is taken from material of several of the early books, but it stitches all that stuff together into a great story standing on its own merit, which rings true to the spirit of the O'Brian sea novels.And the movie has fine casting and acting, and really top-rate cinematography.

		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is one mouthful of a title, but a gloriously entertaining adventure of epic proportions, documenting a ship of the Royal British Navy and its captain during the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Aubrey (Russel Crowe) and his sailors have been ordered to sink or capture the superior French vessel and all of the sea is their battlefield. You feel the weight of such a challenging task at all times and this acts as a device to get us to really sympathize with, and pull for, our British heroes as they struggle at sea. This is a magnificent, beautifully shot and crafted war-drama and best of all, it features no love interests in its plot to distract and detract from the realism of the adventure -- but is a straightforward portrayal of events, as based on the novels by Patrick O'Brien. It is simply genius not to cast some annoying supporting actress running around in a corset and acting as a loved one. Finally, a war-drama that gets it right! In terms of action on-board the ship, this is near-perfection and what Pirates of the Caribbean should have been like; it is gritty, realistic, exciting and sprinkled with a fine dose of humour to balance its dark war themes and the hardships that one may face on a ship.Because Master and Commander is an adventure film, it is also fairly forgettable -- I hate to admit it, but it's true. There is, however, one thing that's stuck with me from the film and that is the visit to the Gallapagos Islands. These few scenes are really gripping and powerful and the bizarre setting of this island creates a strange, almost haunting effect. It acts as a pause in the otherwise fast pace on-board the ship. I truly feel that this film deserves more credit, praise and remembrance.8.5/10</fullReview>

And these qualities are consistent in both performances.I have found Mr. Crowe's films to be much like a good novel; difficult to stop before they end, and much enjoyed with repeated viewings.I have discovered one negative quality about Mr. Crowe's films: when I've finished watching all I have, there is little else that proves sufficiently, or equally as entertaining to watch.</fullReview>

It is truly is flawless and probably one of the best execute film I have ever seen.Base upon two books of twenty, Master and Commander and The Far Side of the World is about friendship and the history during the Napoleon era. What I like about the movie is projecting the lives of the sailor during that time. The Script is brilliantly written, they definitely have done they homework on researching because it is accurate and very insightful. The directing is too good to describe by words. Plus, the casting and the dedication of each and every actor on the ship can be seen in the movie.Overall it is masterfully done movie, though some of the things in movie might not be up to every body liking. Like the story might be a little predictable and absolutely no female in the movie, which in the way very accurate indeed but very kind of weird cinematically. And the movie is a little slow with and the used of old English might not be easy for some viewer.Recommendation: Brilliantly Done, Look Out For Behind the Scenes ?

The film starts in the south Atlantic ocean where a battle begins between the British HMS Surprise and the French Acheron. Jack Aubrey (Crowe) commander of the surprise is both himself and his crew surprised and out gunned by the larger Acheron. After he narrowly escapes defeat he goes on the hunt in a cat and mouse game with the french Acheron it 's witty captain who Jack Aubrey knows nearly nothing about. This film is bound to leave even the most anti English fan howling for more. Both the story and the action make this film a masterpiece that will certainly command any screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise Is On Our Side!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This past weekend, I toured the HMS Surprise, the ship that was used in M &amp; C and I was reminded of how much I adore this movie. That this film was not awarded Oscars for Best Picture and Director has to be one of the hugest errors ever made by the "esteemed" Academy. M &amp; C is something of an anomaly. Here's a movie about the glory of Old England that was financed by Hollywood studios, filmed primarily in Mexico, directed by and starring Aussies! The villains are the French, which struck me as sort of funny. And this movie is a celebration of values that seem so alien to us today; in M &amp; C, patriotism is a virtue. It almost makes you want to shout "Hurrah for British Imperialism!" Almost. Now I'm no historian, so I can't comment on the authenticity of the battle scenes, but the important thing is that this movie is gripping and feels realistic. There's a nice balance between the battle scenes and the portrayal of daily life on board the frigate. It's all so beautifully done, with my favorite part being the crew's first glimpses of the Galapagos islands. I'm a big Russell Crowe fan (is there any actor who is more likable on screen?), and this is my favorite movie of his. My favorite character, though, is the brilliant doctor, brilliantly played by the underrated Paul Bettany. The doctor is a fascinating character, a sort of proto-Darwin, and makes a nice counterpoint to the captain. If you haven't seen this movie because you were put off by the trailer, know that the trailer did not do the movie justice. The brilliance of this movie is that even if you don't care about the Napoleonic War or British naval history, you will still be entertained and even touched by M &amp; C.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rousing, entertaining, technical marvel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World ? the big-budget (requiring three studios to finance) blockbuster of an action-adventure picture adapted from two of the celebrated novels authored by Patrick O'Brian ? is as a whole, a resounding success. While it may not be the most faithful page-to-screen adaptation, it is a rousing, extensively detailed epic of high-seas battle in the times of Napoleonic War, and it's supremely entertaining.Russell Crowe stars as Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey, commander of the English HMS Surprise who, in 1805, has orders to intercept the French privateer Acheron. When, out of the fog, Acheron finds the Surprise before the reverse can occur and makes a devastating attack on our heroes, Captain Aubrey must retreat and carefully strategise the best way to overcome the bigger, better and faster French ship. Bookended by two magnificent, immersive battle sequences between the two ships, the middle act of Master and Commander explores the lives of the men ? and in some cases, the children ? onboard the HMS Surprise. Director Weir carefully develops the keen sense of camaraderie that binds the crew of over a hundred, and in particular explores the relationship between Jack and the ship's doctor, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) ? good friends who nevertheless have conflicting ideals. There are several subplots in the picture, which play out and resolve themselves completely within the film's second act (ie the bits in-between the breathtaking battles). These are largely uninteresting and a little cliché, and drag the pace of the picture just enough to keep this good film from becoming a great one.Master and Commander is, as its massive budget (over $120 million) suggests, a technical marvel. Nature's wrath, which takes the form of several raging storms while out at sea, is realistic and believable, and the computer animation involved in the picture is well done enough to never distract. The sound design, which it deservedly won the Oscar for, is enveloping down to the creaking of the rocking ship, but where it really shines is in the battle sequences ? so absorbing, and a real treat of a cinematic experience. Amidst the technical triumphs come convincing performances, specifically from the two leads ? Bettany as the doctor whose steady surgical hand is as assured as his desire to discover new species in the Galapagos Islands, and Crowe as the charismatic, good natured captain who's put enough of his own blood into the HMS Surprise that it could qualify as a relative. He's as inspirational and dignified as the character as penned, and his Jack Aubrey is a testament to the actor's diversity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good visual effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Master and Commander' takes you on a voyage where you can virtually smell the sea and feel the storms. This film is about a captain, and the film focuses on the relationship that he has with the surgeon on the ship. The two come to understand each other through their differences; at one point, they stop at an island for the surgeon to collect specimens from that island. Meanwhile, the Napoleonic wars are raging on, and there are many storms and sea battles. Although a long film, the visual effects are well worth seeing this film for, and they make this film as strong as it is. A lot of detail was put into this and put into the film in this area. The acting is also very good, and this is a film about characters more than about battles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an acquired taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie, I was a bit too young to appreciate it. When I got a bit older and I viewed it again, I was hooked.Contrary to some expectations, this movie isn't a pure-action film about two ships trying to destroy each other. It's more of a 'life aboard a man-of-war thing. The attention to characters and details is superb, and the actors (especially Crowe and Bettany) make the entire crew of the Surprise come alive. I especially liked the dialog: the arguments between Captain Aubrey and Dr. Maturin, some of the exchanges between the midshipmen (when Will is in sickbay, and when Hollom is about to commit suicide), and some of the dialog gems between the ordinary seamen.The lack of romance in this film is not unnerving: in fact, it's a refreshing change. An action film with good characters and no romance...hurray! Folks, if you're looking for a film that moves at breakneck speed with lots of action, this is not for you. If you want something that requires some thinking and patience, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" might be it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was fascinating. Interesting and quite accurate of the way of life (and death) in those times. I am a big fan of the author. Alos, I have worked and sailed on a number of tall ships. The tall ship that appears in the film is (or was) the "HMS" Rose. She is a replica of a real British ship that was - by necessity - one of the reasons for the beginning of the American Navy. When I sailed on her she was under the command of Capt. Baily, one of the finest tall ship skippers I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. The beauty and stateliness's of the Rose was captured perfectly by the director and film crews. It was a thrilling chance for me and all film goers to experience the majesty of a bygone time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than 'Gladiator'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this an 8.5 which rounds down to an 8 because i'm American, I gave 'The Patriot' an 8. There should be some sort of intelligence filter on this board. I particularly loved 'BabyGenius' who thought Russel played a cello in the film, which is a hard instrument to play like a violin (his actual instrument in the movie).Peter Weir feels a bit out of his element in this one, being more accustomed to soul-searching drama, (the classic 'Dead Poet's Society') than courageous naval warfare. This is however a rare film, and Russel's Crowe's best, but he's more convincing as a gladiator. 'theTeague' from the UK alikened him to Richard Burton, although Russel does not have the polished presence of Burton or the flair of Erol Flynn. Much praise for correctly portraying the Cromwellian nature of the time period, with all it's puritan 'taboos' and Christian ethic.So the question ' How did the English take over the world ?' is mostly answered here. Magnificent cast, plot, cinematography, and attention to historical detail. Bettany is a fresh breathe of acting air, brilliant and flattering, however Darwin didn't plop out until 1809 and the biology is out of place and turns into a Herman Melville novel. Also The almost monotone color palettes, bleck, this was the height of warfare for the last 2000 years and the next 600 to come ! ! ! ! liven it up ! ! ! Overall ranks up with 'Bridge over the River Kwai' in war films genre. A keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully bold and imaginative action epic; the best sea yarn in decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the greatest sea epic in decades, probably better than anything done by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Erroll Flynn, Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, or Gregory Peck. I was in awe of its historical accuracy, and thoroughly captivated by Russell Crowe's performance.Those who carp about the story should probably carp about the book instead. To those who carp about its accuracy, however, I can only infer that they have not served in the Navy and know little of naval history. It is obvious Peter Weir does.The first words uttered by Crowe when he comes on deck in the movie are, "Where away?" Those were some of the first words I heard in my young naval service 40 years ago, when I made the mistake of telling the Captain merely that we had a ship on the horizon. "Where away?" he fired at me; I looked perplexed. "Do you allude, Captain, to the transitive verb meaning 'to erode?'" I smartly replied. He did not find this amusing, and made me ask everyone on the ship what it meant. Fortunately there was an old Chief Signalman who had been around since before Pearl Harbor, who smiled and said, "I haven't heard that in years," and then explained it meant "What is the relative bearing and range?" Peter Weir has got it exactly right. And yes, Midshipmen might well be on board a ship at 14-15 years old in those days (17-18 today on a summer cruise between school years), and if it went to "General Quarters" as we do today or "drummed to battle" as they did then, well, the Middie was just in the thick of it.This is just a wonderful tale, well told, with a nice surprise ending that gives the pleasurable prospect of an equally glorious sequel. I cannot wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Russell Crowe Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the WorldStarring: Russell CroweRated PG-13 for Intense Battle Sequences, War Violence and Brief LanguageGenre: Action/Adventure/Drama/WarStar Rating: ****1/2 out of 5Another great movie where the wonderful Russell Crowe delievers another great performance. During the Napoleonic Wars, a British frigate, HMS Surprise, and a much larger French warship, the Acheron, with greater fire power, stalk each other off of the coast of South America. Russell Crowe brings great intensity to the role of Captain Jack Aubrey. Lucky Jack, as he is referred to by his crew, is well regarded by his men, who trust him implicitly, even after the first devastating battle and an apparent personal vendetta against the French captain. While the naval battle sequences are quite fantastic, the film is successful because director Weir chose to build the story to get to know the men who are locked aboard the tight quarters of a small ship and how they interact everyday. The officers and the mates are well-known by the time the final battle comes. This was a well done movie with great adventure and thrills! This movie won two academy awards for best cinematography and best sound editing and it was also nominated for best picture, makeup, editing, director, costume design, sound and visual effects. I thought that Russell Crowe should have been nominated for best actor in this movie!BOTTOM LINE: GREAT!</fullReview>

This is filmaking at it's best. Weir draws you into this story. Everyone was perfectly cast. You care about every character. The script nicely ties in theme and resolves them effectively. I did not read the books so I don't know how close this movie captures the spirit of these novels. Crowe makes for a commanding Aubrey in this film and gives yet another great performance. Bettany has his best high profile role to date and he was very good. He deserved a Best Supporting Actor nod from the Academy. I was a fan of the LOTR's trilogy and felt it should have won best picture for the overall achievement of the trilogy but seeing this made me slightly regret thinking that way.

		<shortDescription>A classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's a shame that so many people think this movie is "slow". I loved the pacing and character development - classic movie-making at its best. The scenes in between the battle sequences detailing the interactions between the crew members are totally engaging. And the sequence in the Galapagos? Sweeps you off your feet.In my humble opinion, this movie is hard to fault. It is very tightly edited and no scene seems extraneous; the music is perfect for the mood of the movie. I read a comment on some message board where the writer criticized the musical score for not having enough punch. Talk about intellectual and emotional impotence. Maybe we should start putting drumrolls in comedies so the audience will know when to laugh. Funny thing is, I have this movie on DVD and the parts I like the most are the scenes leading up to the final showdown. I'll usually watch the movie up to the final showdown and then stop.I do hope they make sequels, as long as Peter Weir comes back to direct and the studio doesn't try to meddle with the formula to get more crap Hollywood whizbang. I've been fairly disappointed with even "the best" of what Hollywood's put out lately and it's important to support classic storytelling that uses new technologies instead of being a commercial for the latest in computer graphics technology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2003.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolutely wonderful film, and yes, it should have taken Best Picturehonors over both Lord of the Rings (a sympathy vote from the Academy) andMystic River (too messy/ unresolved).This film is proof that the sum of the parts are at times greater than the whole (or main plot). I've read several reviews that knock M&amp;C for not being the action blockbuster they'd hoped for, but the film simply has a different kind of structure to it. It's more a series of vignettes (like Pulp Fiction) that might lead you to believe the climactic confrontation with the French Frigate is really the point of the movie (see PF's opening restaurant holdup), but by its conclusion, we''re reminded that the crews' personal moments are as telling of the times (if not more so) than the English vs. French battles at sea. The scenes of the man-overboard dilemma, the doctor's own surgery, the midshipman's self-doubts, etc., are powerful and haunting long after the film's conclusion. The French captain's scheme near the end is a great discussion- starter (see the forum). The music is wonderful-- how cool to make classical music hip again! ;-)Action-film fans may be disappointed to see this film is a little smarter than their typical audience might be, but drama, history and classics fans, enjoy! Weir's attention to detail here (and yes, even to nautical-story stock, at times) is highly commendable, Crowe's portrayal of Jack Aubrey is tough but respectfully experiential, and the cinematography of both land and sea is astonishing.The conflict between the captain and doctor over the Galapagos-stop may not be entirely thrilling, but it does add a nice cultural and scientific backdrop to the Napoleanic-era fighting scenes.See this film as soon as you can, if you haven't already. Then, call Hollywood and ask for a Best Picture (and Best Director) recall. ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I throughly enjoyed this movie and would not discourage others from spending an hour or two watching this film (if they have the time). There's not so much of a solid plot that can be followed throughout the movie, but there are minor themes involved and it's easy to lose oneself in the action and drama of "Master and Commander." I'm only a high school student but I do know a little about naval warfare and the war/conflict that circled around the brits and the french...it was really interesting watching an itty bitty of history play out on film. I expected the battles to be longer, but the time allotted to these sequences was sufficient.Don't be disappointed by the lack of female characters...the film does fine without any romantic twists...I'd focus on the relationship the crew had with the main characters (i.e. tension between the 'cursed' guy and the crew)...they added a lot to the film, especially the dr and his affinity towards scientific research. I thought this film was good. Although it lacked a strong plot, nothing was overplayed and this movie's a new experience to enjoy if you're into action...ships...intricate themes- themes that most other movies lack and themes that have more substance in this movie than in other movies (due to the overshadowing of a main plot).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good stuff! But try to watch it on a large screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERS!!The plot is very simple. Russel Crowe is Jack Aubrey a Captain in the British navy during the Napoleonic Wars. His order is to hunt a larger and faster enemy ship that seems to appear and disappear when least expected.There is certainly the influence of Moby Dick here,although Captain Crowe's obsession for the French flag never reaches the extremes of Bligh Achab for the White Whale. The film is realistic and the director's (Peter Weir)camera moves confidently from one deck to another - (we feel the wind the rain and the cold, the boat rolls up and down and the wood and sail make noises all the time)- and the Battle scenes appear to be quite realistic because of the Blood, the wounds and the splinters. Master and Commander has all the the typical elements of any "Ships and Sails" kind of movie: The Storm at Cape Horn, the flogging of the insubordinate, the swashbuckling, the -no wind- situation with the thirsty men under the sun..etc. But in the end, Peter Weir's main aim seems to be the depiction of the life on Board, of the definition of the different characters and of the relation between officers and crew. This comparison between the Ship and Society is further emphasized when towards the end Crowe tells his crew of how their ship stands for the nation they are fighting for.As in Gladiator, Crowe here is quite imposing as a Leader, and his presence in the film probably helped the production a lot. And like in Gladiator, he seems more comfortable when he is has to fight with swords. Paul Bettany is very good as the ship doctor with 'Darwininian' tendencies, although few fans of the O'Brien books will identify in him the Dr.Maturin of the original novel. The rest of the cast is mostly unknown, but this contributes to the realism of the Film. Better if you see it on a wide screen, I think it would loose a lot on a small one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie on DVD because my husband kept wanting to see it and it was always out! Well I was very impressed. It is the first seafaring movie where I felt that I was seeing the details of life on board an 1800s UK Navy ship without too many of the usual corny clichés. From what I have found out about the writer of the novel upon which it is based, he is an erudite man who has researched this area in detail - and has been compared to both Jane Austen and Homer. I am glad that the movie makers brought that detail into the film. What impressed me the most was how incredible the tradesmen on board were - rebuilding the ship after a hit whilst at sea - it made it all seem so possible and so real - and making weapons. The age of some of the officers in training was a surprise and I think that the boy who looses his arm was excellent! I am not a great fan of Crowe anymore - I knew he had 'It' when I first saw him in that silly movie about hearts set in South America with I think the lovely Bridget Fonda (what has happened to her?) but unfortunately despite his brilliance, he seems to know it too! But in this role he is a warm and kind man, and even in his Aussy element of all that machoism - he is very likable as the Captain and as usual dam good!Highly recommend this movie - you feel that you have learned something beyond a good tale!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is not as impressive as its title. Russll Crowe is Capt. Jack Aubrey from the British Navy, also known as Lucky Jack. His friend and surgeon on his ship is Stephen (Paul Bettany). They encounter a French ship and although that one is much bigger and their own ship is damaged Jack wants to follow and attack the French ship. Stephen and of course others are not really sure of this mission.That is basically the story although there are some more interesting human stories. For example there are teenagers on board who have higher ranks than some older adults. A sequence on the Galapagos Islands is a nice little part on land. But the story is not what makes this movie interesting. Well, not for me. I liked the way the characters developed, especially the differences between Jack and Stephen, but I wanted to see an epic tale on the ocean.Partially I got what I wanted. Unfortunately there are only two main battles and with 140 minutes running time it seems to take a lot of time before they arrive. A good thing is that when the battles come they are terrific. Sometimes a little hard to follow may be, but overall it looks great. Not only the battles for that matter; the costumes, the art direction and set decoration and the cinematography are all flawless. For the looks this movie would be a masterpiece. The movie as a whole is not a masterpiece but it is still good. I just think it could have been better in some ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The far side of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far side of the World is an action sea faring yarn that examines the ethics and morals of men during the days when the French and English were fighting for control of the seas. Russell Crowe portrays the Captain as a well rounded father figure. He is stern yet kind. He is a musician. He is a man of honor. A man of discipline. He is the Captain Kirk of the Atlantic Ocean. He is the ideal man. He is the model for the modern soldier. He states :" Men must be govern" He is being pursued by the French who have built a faster and better Ship. It is mentioned in the film that The French Captain is only pursuing them because Captain Crowe is an intelligent seaman. Egos at sea. The problem here lies in that we never meet the French Captain. It seems that the point of the film is to show fine leadership. There is a twelve year old boy who shows braveness when his arm is cut off. We get to see a brain operation. We get to see a doctor operate on himself. In between these graphic operations we get more Crowe's wisdom and more waves crashing. The film rambles on and on with Hollywood antics of waves smashing while Russell Crowe dictates commands. The film is shot with exquisite taste. The ship is a marvel to look upon and the boyhood wonder of travel feels the senses. It is pure fantasy based on reality. The film rarely touches on the emotions of the crew. The effects of the long lonely days and nights are rarely realistically portrayed for a film that is trying to take itself seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Commander is a reasonably diverting film, and undeniably beautiful to look at, but it strings out a minor naval episode into a pretty inconsequential two hours. Battle scenes are not Peter Weir's overriding concern ? they only take up 15 minutes at beginning and end ? so you would expect rather more subtlety of dialogue and character development than there is in between. These seamen are just too noble to be realistic; OK, so there's a dash of rum and a flick of the lash, but nothing of the third major sailing ingredient. Are we expected to believe that, on a ship half-full with rosy-faced teenage boys, none of them were (like the French ship they are chasing) ?vulnerable at the stern'?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plenty to recommend this. No nonsense boys-own storytelling, attention to detail, not only period subtleties but the camera dwelling on them (e.g. that's why sailing speed is measured in knots, geddit?) AND in the end the French get beaten. Felicitations, Msr Weir!The film looks great - if a little dark during the storms or at night. It does have a patchwork feel to it though, moving as it does from one set piece to another. It's as if there's a tick box system in operation, with the story built on these episodes rather than integrating them.The Paul Bettany/Russell Crowe double act is better than I thought. Bettany as the ironing-board-backed surgeon is unlinkable to his Cockney hard man roles. Crowe is almost perfect for the Captain of the ship, the acme of acting action hero. However his personal wrestling goes on at rather than deep below the surface; I think this role needs to be played out at more of a distance - the scenes with Bettany 'am I talking to you as captain or as friend?' offer sufficient personal scrutiny. See it on a big screen, if not in the cinema. 6/10</fullReview>

The star of the movie is Russell Crowe as Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey. Crowe does an outstanding job in the role of a competent, capable commander, who is also clearly a flawed human being. Paul Bettany is adequate in the difficult role of Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon. I found the dialog hard to follow, and some of the sub-plots hard to understand. It was difficult to differentiate among the younger officers, and follow the plot threads that involved them. Much of their dialog was lost in the wind's howl and the cannons' roar.This film is worth seeing for its battle scenes and the glorious views of the sea. If you expect subtle performances and profound plot, you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes it is eerrrrrrmmm! when does it start...nice photography, good music, great acting, but where is Master and Commander going...first 10 minutes some action then for the 1 hour and 15 minutes talk talk talk with little or no action, then about 10 minutes at the end...Mind you no one could have played the Master like Russell Crowe has, he held that film together, well it sure wasn't the director, to be honest it was a bit of a mess, but nice to see Ian Mercer (Gary Mallet) from Coronation Street in a small part...well marks out of 10...1 for Photography...2 for the acting, 1 for the music total 4, big dissapointment...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this 7 out of 10. Good on far side of the world poor on master and commander. It's got great production and looks well. The characters are interesting if a little jumbled up and sometimes too slightly drawn. The music is good and the theme, Napoleonic era sea chase from south Atlantic to Pacific Ocean of underdog English ship verses French super-frigate is attention grabbing. Where it lacked a little in strength was the central character of Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe's character) who as a master and commander I did not believe, the portrayal beats stiff upper lip but I never got the sense that Aubrey would have you keyhauled if you sneezed out of place which is the mark of a true master of discipline. I found Paul Bettany's character, Stephen Maturin, (very Irish name that) as the Irish doctor with a hobby of natural history and cello playing more realistic, also his role proped up Aubrey rather than merely supporting. The script was a bit weak on the captains character but strong on event and happening and it keeps ones interest. I found the incident of the midshipman Hollom badly handled and unrealistic. The crew were all too clean, pale skinned, soft and pudgy to be early nineteenth century sailors and with all their pearly white teeth and educated english stank of poor realism which is what the Captain needed to offset his rather relaxed approach to running a ship crewed by the unfortunate, pressganged and criminal. Pardon the pun, there was some hardship, but the abscence of scurvy and deaths from disease and so on gave the impression of a bunch of actors on an adventure holiday, I just couldn't take it seriously. Might impress the 12 year olds its aimed at but my advice to them is to read books if you want to become a proper master and commander. Better movies are from the 1930's and so on like Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab in 1956 Moby Dick or Charles Lawton as Captain Bligh and Clarke Gable his alter-ego in Fletcher Christian,in Mutiny on the Bounty in 1935. Gregory Peck in Captain Horatio Hornblower, 1951, Burt Lancaster as the Crimson Pirate 1952 and many more all better harsher and stronger, more master and commmander characters</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that if you missed this motion picture in the theaters, you truly missed out. It was an amazing special that left you realizing WHY they invented movie theaters in the first place. If you've read the series of books, Master and Commander, you were left frustrated that they left out so much. Again, its a two-plus hour movie, so I understand. I went with some friends that did not read the books and they were very confused about a lot of things. All in all, it was great to see it as a film and considering how many films-from-books get slammed about the differences, this was no John Grisham, The Firm - type let down. Russell Crowe did an amazing job and it's unfortunate he was overlooked by the Academy this year, but I guess Sean Penn has been due for some time now - I'm just glad he was there to get his Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's happened to Russell Crowe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I was prompted to add this comment because, living in a small village in Southern England, I was intrigued to see the previous comment from someone in the village next door.So from almost the same spot in rural Kent, the diametrically opposite view.Someone in LA has clearly looked over the Ioan Gruffyd Hornblower series and spotted the fact that British naval history hasn't been deep-mined since the 40's. If you haven't seen any of the recent Hornblower, made for TV specials, they're out on DVD. They bring a fresh eye to the subject, and the naturalistic playing, photography and editing are all new and a delight. The C S Forester plots can be a bit thin and Robert Lindsay appears to have strayed in from some earlier adaptation but they're great value for money and completely erase the painful memory of Gregory Peck in the same role.Russell Crowe would have done well to study them as he's off by from here to Venus with his portrayal of Aubrey. He's an unconvincing Englishman at the best of times but as a 19C man of adventure, culture and sophistication he falls well short. He hits a few correct notes here and there but they're drowned by some appalling stuff, particularly the reflective set pieces. The weevil joke could hardly fall flatter if Stan Laurel told it. I don't know what's happened to Crowe, too many good reviews for average work, perhaps - though he certainly was amazing in LA Confidential but throughout M &amp; C, Paul Bettany seems to be holding himself in to flatter the big star and keep his Hollywood options open.Photography is great and M &amp; C probably cost more than all the Hornblower series, and you see the cash on the screen but Crowe's failure to get under the skin of Lucky Jack leaves it holed below the waterline.However, given reasonable box office, high DVD sales and the success of films like Pirates of the Caribbean, we may not have seen the last of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece but still another gem from the Ausies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a question: How come Hollywood still approves ambitious projects for sea-oriented motion pictures? This is a big question, in my view, because there are so many pirate movies and movies with extensive shooting on the ocean that their costs bloated like a highway project. Those films (apart from the shrewdly marketed "Titanic") ended up losing great deal of money (Cut throat island, Water world and list sails on and on). But still, when veteran and an extremely talented director Peter Weir came up with an idea to film the story of Ocean battles (who were shot in a location near Mexico, exactly where "Titanic" was filmed) during the 19th century clashes with Napoleon, the studios handed a carte blanche (French for: 150 million dollars) to turn the didactic story to a very convincing epic film that, unfortunately for all parties involved, sunk.The plot, in essence, is about Jack Aubry a.k.a Lucky Jack (Russel Crowe) who is the captain of a war vessel with contagious zeal and charisma which enable to conceal his impulsive, ego motivated and fickle philosophy (what we refer today as "Politician"). The quest, seemingly after a French super modern vessel becomes a feast of strength for Jack and his followers who include a young trainee who turns out (naturally) as a brave and resourceful youngster, A first lieutenant that can't garner respect from the ship members and, finally, the Doctor/zoologist/ Voice of reason on the ship. Before I elaborate further, I must stress out that every sea-oriented motion picture has to include its fair share of adventure. This movie, is no exception and it provides with very compelling (although sometimes, to elaborate to be coherent) battle scenes that portray vividly the confrontation of two war vessels back in the days where attackers saw what or who they were attacking.There are two schools regarding Russel Crowe acting, some say he's one of the best working actors today but others claim he's overrated (no man in his right mind will refer to Crowe's acting as bad). I belong to the former and I think that although the cast in this movie (especially D'arcy, the Doctor) is great in general, Crowe's performance as the skilled sailor and secretly sensitive captain, makes the movie a real treat. What denies the movie of the Masterpiece title is the lack of added value of the movie, a trait that many other Weir's films have in abundance (Dead poets society, Fearless, The Truman show and so many others, all of which I strongly recommend).Summing up, the movie is well written, acted, directed, shot and paced and if you're not in an overly pensive mood, this film, although not Weir's finest work, is yet another evidence of its skill in the 7th art. Unfortunately, the fact that the movie didn't do very well at the box office means that future "location is the ocean" pictures will be either a thing of the past or a fluffy adventure flick (like the curse of the Caribbeans).8.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.P.S. Just in case you were wondering, "Ausies" is a nickname for Australians which is where Weir was born and where Crowe lives. Cheers, mates!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and realistic epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed when i missed the chance to see this movie at the cinema, and rightly so as when i saw it on DVD i realised this is one of the best epics i have seen, and it would have been spectacular on the big screen. Peter Weir created an excellent atmosphere and made you feel like you were part of the crew. The sets and costumes were also all very realistic.The location and score complimented the movie beautifully and provided a good backdrop to some excellent acting by Paul Bettany and Max Pirkis, and some fantastic battle scenes. Russel Crowe's performance however wasn't as good as i was expecting having seen him in Gladiator i found his character in Master and Commander slightly 2-dimensional, but this didn't affect the movie thanks to the quality of support acting.On the whole this movie is definitely worth viewing more than once as watching it a second time lets you appreciate the detail in the sets.9/10 - because it needs a sequel to complete the story as the ending stopped to abruptly and lack of female characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great to Look at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly thought this movie was ok. It looked to be more like a documentary about seamen at sea instead of a film. Don't get me wrong I did like parts quite a lot and it was wonderful to look at but as far as a story goes I found it to be very poor as it seemed to lack in parts.The opening shots were excellently done and very dark. I loved how the shot starts from under the deck where all the men sleep and from it to go up to the bow. Russell Crowe was suited to his part and played Lucky Jack very well and has established himself as more of a serious actor here. I thought that's what he didn't do in Gladiator and was shocked when he won Best Actor when I think he deserved it for A Beautiful Mind more. The supporting cast is good and the whole film is very good with great direction. There is just no story which I could get into and take hold of. I believe that the ship itself overthrows the story because you are looking and admiring it more than you concentrate on the story and that's because there isn't one. There is a good character study here, like in the scene where Jack and the doctor played beautifully by Paul Bettany are playing the violin and cello. You see their delights at sea as well as looking after there men. Peter Weir is a fantastic director and hasn't made a bad film yet. Gallipoli is his best followed by Dead Poet's society and The Truman Show and I think this goes up there with his best but I was hoping for a Mutiny on the bounty kind of movie without the Mutiny but somehow didn't manage to get it. I found myself hoping for the film to be over quite quick as parts did go on. I am not into the pirate, war in the ocean kind of films and Master and Commander didn't change my mind. It just doesn't do it for me. Overall everything else is worth a watch but just don't hope to get a story to go along with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Gladiator plays a British captain hunting a better, faster, younger ship.Some interesting things in there. I didn't realize kids so young were in the Navy. It was also fun seeing battles with older, limited technology, where each maneuver might take a day or two, instead of the high-speed heat seeking death-at-the-push-of-a-button we're used to today.Still, the movies was absolutely mediocre. I can't really point out huge flaws, but I can't recall anything that grabbed me either. Actually, the twist at the very end had promise as I worried about the young captain on his own, but that didn't end up going anywhere as the movie immediately ended.Someone had highly recommended this movie to me, while another had spewed bile all over it. My advice is, if you've got nothing else to do, go ahead and watch it, but if you have anything at all to do, you won't miss much skipping it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Globalization Mark 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first world war was fought between the British and the French in the 18th century culminating in Napoleon's defeat in 1815. The decades around 1800 saw the world opened up as never before. It was a time of political, economic and intellectual revolutions. Capitalism found in the whaling industry its first genuinely global enterprise. This is the setting for Patrick O'Brian's series of twenty novels about the exploits of the sailor, Jack Aubrey and his doctor friend, Stephen Maturin. O'Brian was born in 1914 in London of Anglo-German parents with the surname Russ. After the second world war, he abandoned his wife and two children to settle with the wife of Count Nikolai Tolstoy in a French Catalan village, where he reinvented himself as an Irish novelist. He was 55 years old when he wrote the first in the Aubrey-Maturin series, Master and Commander, and was in his seventies when he became famous. He died soon after his second wife, Mary, in 1999. His example interests me because I am from Manchester and settled in France seven years ago with the aim of reinventing myself as a writer in what many people regard as late middle age. I began my first novel a year ago and saw this movie in a Paris cinema with a mainly French audience.It's not a great movie, but the story had resonance enough for me. The protagonists represent the man-of-action and the intellectual. The author lines himself up squarely with the Irish-Catalan doctor-naturalist-spy, Maturin, whom he represents as a proto-Darwin or perhaps successor to the great scientist, Joseph Banks, whose biography he wrote. But the hero of course is ?Lucky' Jack Aubrey, the Royal Navy captain, whose military priorities systematically undermine his friend's pursuit of scientific knowledge in this film. I was also struck by how it echoes the themes of Moby Dick, as interpreted by the West Indian writer, C.L.R. James in his masterly Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: Herman Melville and the World We Live In (1953). James argues that whaling (an integral part of this story) was the leading sector of early industrial capitalism, the whaling ship a mobile factory whose voyages connected all parts and peoples of the world. Melville wrote his masterpiece on the eve of the American civil wat which ushered in a new phase of state capitalism. We need to gain some perspective on these antecedents of our own era of globalization and Patrick O'Brian's novels have some claim to being one of the best introductions to that first phase. Peter Weir has done us all a great favour by translating some parts of them into the medium of the movies.The only cinema still showing Master and Commander in Paris was the Grand Pavois at the end of Métro line 8. The name has nautical connotations. The journey back home gave me time to reflect on my own first round-the-world trip in 1972. I was flying to Australia from London in order to do a job in Papua New Guinea. I'll never forget the shock when the British Airways captain announced our flying time to New York. I had assumed we would be flying east, but it turned out that our journey was the other way round, via New York, Los Angeles, Honolulu and Fiji to Sydney. A baggage truck hit our plane's fuselage in Kennedy airport and we were delayed 19 hours there. The crew plied their truculent passengers with lots of booze, especially on the Los Angeles-Honolulu leg where we were allowed free champagne.My traveling companion was an Australian film-maker of my age. He tried to tell me how lively his country's cinema was at that time, but I was more impressed by the information that his brother was the lead guitarist in the super-group Procul Harem, whose A Whiter Shade of Pale has to be prime contender for the most pretentious and meaningless rock song of all time. We were tired, drunk and not a little rebellious. My new friend and I devised a competition to see who could fill in the Hawaii immigration form with the most outrageous address. He won hands down with `Notre Reve, Fandango Avenue, Moony Ponds, Victoria.' The flight was 30 hours late by the time we reached Australia and, as a final insult, the plane was diverted to Melbourne.We must have exchanged names at some point, but the two of us were content to make the limbo of that nightmare journey our self-contained world for a couple of days. Later I told myself that my companion was Peter Weir.14th March 2004</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good seafaring movie, probably the best pure seafaring movie of all time as some critics claim but not the best sea movie, the Hunt for Red Octobober and Titanic are a step above it. Stars Russel Crowe and Paul Bettany as they try to take down a french vessel called the Acheron, whose captain seems to get the best of Lucky Jack. The movie mainly focuses on the relationship between Maturin and Aubrey, though screen time is given to the crew and how sea life was back then. The dialogue throughout the movie is laced with nautical terms and slang that adds to the authentic feel of the movie. Action sequences are top notch and the graphical shots hard to spot. Directing is excellent, as is to be expected from Peter Weir. The problem with the movie is that we don;t connect enough with any of the characters to really care about what happens to them. The only two individuals i cared about were midshipmen Blakeney and Hollom, while the rest of the cast seemed caricatured. Another problem is that the hero Aubrey is not as charismatic as a fellow character in the same vein by the name of Hornblower. PErharps this is due to the numerous films in that series compared to only one here but we feel every emotion with Hornblower, while with Aubrey, we relate to his as we would relate to our remote, he is just a label (captain)doing his job (leading). I realize this is a setup movie and it is a fantastic start but not deserving of a best picture nomination, that only shows the relative weakness of movies this year.Summary: Good picture but stick with the Hornblower series</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but SOMETHING was missing, but what!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched the movie i am kinda confused, i actually thought it was a good movie, but why does it feel like there is something missing, and i can't quite figure out what i feel is missing, lets dig it.First of all what drives this movie is that it is a well directed movie, and it has stunning cinematography, that was one thing i really loved about it, absolutely beautiful scenery and settings.First of all one of the losses in this movie is that all the persons except the doctor and the captain feels kinda distant, it feels like they are there becuase they have to be there, many of them are just faces you recognize but you don't get to know any of them very personally, which is why you later on won't feel much sorrow when some of them dies. More intensity to the personalities of each main character would have made a better movie i think.Also one of the things that struck is that the movie spends most of the time building the background for the initial fight with the french ship, and then after the end fight is over, you're left, wondering why it wasn't a great fight as you had hoped and expected for, that's sad becuase the start out small fights are so well made, and then the end one is just a big dissapointment, that kinda let the movie down.The last thing i felt wrong was the twist made very late in the movie about the doctor about the other ship, someone please tell Peter Weir not to include a twist in the movie if he does not wish to explain the outcome of it, that totally ruined the ending in my book.So overall i thought it was a good movie, but there are some things, some major things, that i thought was either missing or wrongly done, but you can't take away from the movie that it has some fantastic breathtaking scenes at times, and some pretty solid action. And it is entertaining after all, just has a few flaws hehe.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first problem with Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is the name. This is a movie about a Captain who is obsessed with a mystery ship that defeated him and his crew in a short-lived combat that took place in the Pacific ocean. This is pretty much Moby Dick with a French ship replacing a whale. So far, not so bad. However the name of the film makes you believe this is a movie about the life of a Master and Commander, not just his obsession with mending a lost battle.The name of the movie is ambiguous. As you watch the story roll, you realize that the plot suffers from the same problem. We know he is after a corsaire ship. We know the forces of Napoleon are threatening England, and he sees this French ship as the enemy of his country. But his obsession isn't believable. He never becomes fully dictatorial. He doesn't run his ship like a democracy either. And during his quest to defeat this ship, a lot incidents take place that have nothing to do with it. A clear example is that scene where a man shoots the doctor by accident. Can you get rid of that scene without affecting the plot? Yes. The incident could have been removed from the film, and it wouldn't have suffered at all.A captain who wants to defeat a ghost ship full of Frenchmen. However the target of his obsession doesn't have a personality at all. What we see is two members of the captain's crew explaining to him why the ship is superior. Other than that, the enemy is totally devoid of personality. The Captain might as well be chasing a cardboard ship.Master and Commander has its downs. However this film is saved by the fact that it is a dose of fresh air. It is not about criminals that are utterly bad shooting people for no reason other than showing the viewer that they need to have the word bad on their foreheads. It is not about a ruthless killer that loves death because his life wasn't as good as yours and mine. The enemy are corsaires. Unfortunately this new antagonist wasn't developed properly. With the good acting and the good choreography, what a great film this could have been.Master and Commander is a good film. But it needed to focus more on the plot and less on the things that happened to every single person around Captain Russell Crowe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Master &amp; Commander: The Far Side of the World' is a modest thrilling high-seas adventure film. Russell Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, the Commander-In-Chief of a British sea vessel navigating &amp; battling in the high seas during the 19th century Napoleon wars. The film also co-stars Paul Bettany as the supportive, but yet, conflicted ship doctor whom is also Captain Aubrey's confidant. Crowe &amp; Bettany, as they both did in `A Beautiful Mind', deliver potent performances that were beautifully executed. Auteur Peter Weir's astonishing direction of high-seas battle sequences was the work of a skilled craftsman. However, I must admit that i was drowned with boredom with the film's screenplay, which was as long-winded as some of the sea storms shown in the film. `Master &amp; Commander: The Far Side of the World' is unnecessary lengthy but it does not deserve for you to `wave' bye-bye in midway through its cinematic voyage. *** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Master and Commander earlier today and came out of the cinema slightly disappointed.The acting was good enough, storyline reminiscent of many sea chase movies - Sink the Bismark comes to mind - sound was superb, effects were great, so what was wrong?Maybe I wasn't expecting a 'Boys Own' type story. (I haven't read the books). Perhaps it was the dreadful attempt that Mr Crowe makes at violin playing - listen to the music and watch Russells' playing at the same time - unintentionally hilarious!I got another laugh out of the sudden appearance on board of the cast wearing whalers outfits. Where did they come from? Maybe the local Galapagos branch of their favorite department store.This was supposedly a serious movie. I seemed to be laughing in the wrong places.A really annoying trait in todays movies is the close-up, fast moving, blurry fight scenes where nothing can really be seen except flashes of light on the screen. No wonder audiences couldn't tell who was French and who was British.As sea-faring movies go my all time favorite is 'Ghosts in the Noonday Sun' close behind is 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. Johnny Depps' acting in the latter was superb.So, Master and Commander or Pirates of the Caribbean - which is the lesser of 2 weevils? Work it out for yourself. After all, who got the Oscar nomination for best actor and who didn't?6/10 overall - 8/10 for unintentional hilarity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst I must admit that M&amp;C is a very good film technically, there are some subtle twists in this film that make a very one sided view of the Napoleonic wars.Firstly, even though the movie does not say this literally as it would have the wrath of the historians, it does hint that France and not Britain was the agressor in this war. This is not entirely the case. The only reason Napoleon rose to power in France was because Britain was waging a war against France. After France's revolution that saw the end to an autocratic leadership and saw a people's revolution, Britain decided that that kind of personal freedom in France was not good for its politics and fearing that the revolution would spread waged war. Secondly. Britain was not fighting for freedom, but for the economic power in world. At this point Britain had violently conquered half of the globe and had fought the USA etc. This war was about nothing else but economic power, but this is hollywood so you can't say that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see why this movie got nominated for Best Picture. It is very well made. I read somewhere that they actually built that ship for this movie. The scenary is spectacular and the silences are well placed. I liked the way Russell Crowe portrayed Jack Aubrey, although I don't think this was a strong enough performance for a best actor nomination.Having said that, I found the movie to be boring in the middle part. I could feel for the characters- they were very real- but the story itself does not captivate the audience (at least it did not do it for me). The part I liked the most was when the captain ordered the ship to the land, and the doctor and the boy were doing nature research. Overall it is a very well made movie; I just did not feel it was a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie - but not Patrick O'Brian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie - for what it was. Having just finished the book (yet again) I feel that the movie was jut not Patrick O'Brian The only similarity between the book and the movie are the title, the characters and some of the dialogue. Apart from that, NOTHING of the book is in the movie. Not the love affair between Hollom and the Gunner's wife, their subsequent murder by the Gunner, his suicide, the capture of two prizes, Maturin falling overboard with Jack jumping in to save him - and both being left behind in the open sea, their rescue by island maidens who leave them stranded on an island to be later rescued by the 'Surprise'. None of that. Later they find the ship they were chasing beached on another island. Many of the crew of the 'Surprise' are ashore when a storm comes up and the 'Surprise' is forced to put to sea leaving them stranded. Subsequently there is a land battle between to 'Surprise' crew and the privateer crew. There are NO shipboard gun battles in the book! Consequently, there was no young midshipman who lost his arm after a gun battle. Maturin does not set foot on the Galapagos Islands! I would imagine that the reason for using a French privateer - the 'Acheron' in the movie, instead of an American privateer - the 'Norfolk' as in the book, was purely political correctness. As I said, I enjoyed the movie as a student of that particular time in history, but it was just not a movie of a Patrick O'Brian book. 'Loosely based on the Patrick O'Brian characters' would be a better description.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movies of 2003 must of been bottom low if this piece of crap can get an oscar nomination for best film. The plot is slow and uninteresting. The characters don't evolve in anyway and actually Mr. Crowe is terrible in his role. Even Bruce Willis could of done this much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a movie is a book with more than half of it left out. peter weir's "master and commander: far side of the world" includes incidents from two of the twenty jack aubrey/stephen maturin novels of patrick o'brian, but it feels like a parallel structure, not an adaptation.no line of meaningful dialog has been taken from o'brian's original keenly comic and sharply dramatic writing; but in the weir adaptation the dialog is serviceable if not distinctive. yes, o'brian did tell the "weevil" joke but it is so far below the standard of his own wit that it serves only to illuminate aubrey's character as a simple seaman.russell crowe's aubrey has the requisite charisma, bluffness, courage, and joy in both sailing and in battle; his wisdom in handling men; his assiduity in teaching the midshipmen; and his delight in music. what is missing is his simplicity of spirit and his iron separation from his men and officers other than his friend maturin (so that the "jonah" subplot never comes to his attention). we do get some sense of his naval duty and his absoluteness of command, but not in the subtly varied way presented in the novels.the saddest hint of the "classic comic book" level of sociology in the movie is the utter failure to deal with the aubrey/maturin friendship in any meaningful way. this no doubt proceeds from the decision to make maturin a mere foil, rather than aubrey's co-equal. they forgot to make a buddy movie when the opportunity demanded it.the shocking violence of both the warfare and the medicine of the 19th century is well-captured; the actual sailing scenes are magnificent; the model work is more than adequate; and the fact that there is very little plot other than "a man o'war makes a voyage" is forgiveable.the attempt at giving maturin equal stature to aubrey by having his galapagos islands scientific explorations shown in detail is, however, unsuccessful. no hollywood movie is ever going to give science the same emotional weight as warfare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hornblower and Aubrey are different captains. The Hornblower stories concentrate on the action and details of naval life. The Aubrey books by Patrick O'Brian concentrate on the doings and character interplay of Jack Aubrey the naval captain and Stephen Maturin the doctor and spy, two stories in one series of books. This film did not do justice to either character. It combined episodes from a number of the Aubrey-Maturin stories and as such it seemed disjointed and assumed too much prior knowledge by the movie-goer of the previous background of the two men.Nicely filmed and good action sequences but they don't make it a good film.One IMDB commentator has made the point about the French in this film being made to look dirty and inept sailors. Well it makes a change from Hollywood making out the English to be the baddies. Still what can you expect from the US film industry, one moment the English are the evil ones with no redeeming features (Braveheart, Rob Roy, Irish 'Troubles' films). Come 9/11 and its aftermath, the Brits go to war supporting the US, so it is the French's turn to be in the baddies role. Next year it will be someone else's.If there is a sequel let's hope they make a better job of it than in this film.Score 5/10 at the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film and a failure at the same time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film will not disappoint fans of the books, but the director, writers and producers still blew it. They made a great film, but their stupidity has ensured this is the last in the Master and Commander series. I wanted to see more books made into films, not just one!They spent $135 million to make this film. A smaller budget would have ensured profitability and possibly more films in the series. And frankly, it doesn't even look like there is $135 mil on the screen! I could not see what accounted for such a massive budget. If Peter Jackson can direct the infinitely more elaborate LOTR movie for $90 mil, why can't this film come in at $60 mil?For some reason the writers skipped ahead in the series to one of the later books. Dumb! They missed introducing the lives of Captain Aubrey and Dr. Maturin. The books were about their friendship and seeing how it started was magic. Instead, it focused on the one armed boy and not enough on the two main characters.Peter Weir probably read each book, but his short term memory won out. He forgot how good the early books were, and the last one (Far Side of the World) seemed best to him because it was fresher in his memory. That's just a guess, but its probably right.The worst cut was removing all the romance! That's how you get the other 50% of movie goers (females) into the theaters. The books have romances with Aubrey and his wife Sophia getting together, and Maturin with Catherine. And its better than a soap opera! It would have been extremely interesting for women. Instead, there is scarecly one woman in the whole film. I've got no problem with having films with all men or all women if that's what the subject calls for, but be responsible to the budget you are given!The writers also cut out the intrigue of the books. Maturin is a spy, which you can't even tell from the movie. This one aspect would have added much more tension to the film. Instead, things are far too relaxed throughout.With all the cuts you would think it was a tight film. It's not! I enjoyed each scene, but so much could have been cut in favor of the elements mentioned above. The long piece with guy who jumps overboard because he thinks he's cursed could have easily been cut. Instead, the friendship of Maturin and Aubrey get short changed in favor of a series of vignettes that are not even related.In my opinion, there is absolutely no conflict between the artistic merits of what he wanted and marketing factors. He could have had his art film and also have remained responsible to Patrick O'Brien. Now the producers of the film who front the money will give up on this as a franchise and we will have no more sequels. And that is a very big crime considering the quality of Patrick O'Briens novels.</fullReview>

I found this movie to be above the standard old sea battle period piece...in fact, I found this movie to be outstanding at presenting life aboard an HMS at the turn of the 19th Century. I found the sea battles extraordinary in their accuracy and the storyline of Lucky Jack to be very interesting telling, indeed. This movie will play on the small screen as well as the theater..but I recommend catching it in the theaters if you can to get the grand scope.

Russell Crowe was very good in the role in demonstrating true leadership. Supporting performances were adequate but what this film lacked was any love interest or background of any of the crew including Aubry the commander.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn April of 1805,the majority of Europe is under siege from Napoleon's invading forces.Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) commandeers his battle ship,the HMS Surprise,across the Atlantic ocean,hoping to intercept any sudden attacks.Along the way,they cross paths with a nasty French ship by the name of the Archeron,and are soon engaged in a full scale,all-guns-blazing battle for victory that will test Aubrey's leadership skills to the absolute limit.I can tell when a film is boring the living sh*t out of me,'cos as I'm sitting there slumped in my auditorium chair,I'm getting easily distracted and having silly thoughts in my head (which,had I poorer self restraint,I'd be thinking out loud.)The first half of Master and Commander certainly bored the living sh*t out of me,with it's droning,monotonously told tale,numourous cliched wartime battle ship characters and scenarios and lack of any actual structural coherence to the story.This may be a depiction of actual events during the Napoleonic wars,but surely they could have found a more deep and meaningful way to convey them?The second half's a bit more fun than the first (if the boredom hasn't caused you not to stick around long enough to see it),Crowe had considerable screen presence in the lead role (though I could ultimately give or take him) and there are,it has to be said,two spectacular battle sequences at the beginning and at the end.They are comparable,in a way,to those of Saving Private Ryan,though nowhere near as devastatingly realistic (although all the wood and shrapnel flying everywhere does have some kind of frightening reality to it.)Since it's not as long as it could have been anyway,Master and Commander is a just about tolerable and sometimes rather enjoyable endeaveur,just in no way unmissable.***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could say I loved this film.As it is, the scenes on board the ship are second-to-none. The sense of historical accuracy is always there, and the absolutely fascinating glimpse of how a ship in Nelson's fleet might have operated two centuries ago is just breathtaking. And the performances are top-notch, from Crowe to Billy Boyd (go Pippin!) to the young Max Pirkis, who I'll definitely be keeping an eye open for in the future.But it's just so *boring*!To be fair, I haven't read the books, and I really would like to now, just to compare them to the film and to see what's been included and what's been left out. But there is so much extraneous crap in this film.Being an aspiring author, I once received two valuable pieces of advice. I think they apply equally to any form of fiction, whether book, film, or something else entirely:Firstly, every word should earn its place on the page. Gramatically, thematically, and otherwise.Secondly, every scene shall accomplish at least two things, and one of those shall be to advance the plot. The other may be characterisation, worldbuilding, thematics, whatever. But there shall be no scenes that fail to pull their weight--if there are, that's where the reader's attention is going to wander.**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**In that case, why on earth are we forced to sit through the interminable drudgery of Hollom's story? Hollom is a young officer who has lost the respect and goodwill of his men. He struggles to control the men, and struggles to be the man he ought to be if he is to serve in His Majesty's Navy. Captain Aubrey too, has his own struggle about the man he ought to be: the captain of his ship and a man of the Navy, or a friend to the ship's surgeon Steven Maturin with whom he shares a long history of friendship.There is a definite resonance between Hollom and Aubrey and the decisions they make. Hollom's presence on the ship and his actions do dictate large chunks of the story. However, Hollom, his story, and all the characters who relied upon him for depth could so easily have been cut.Hollom, in the film, is nothing more than a distraction from the real meat of the film--chasing a ship that has you outgunned and outpaced thousands of miles and trying to hold a crew together while you're doing it. The nautical challenges would have been enough without Aubrey having to deal with Hollom and his effects on the crew.Alternatively, Weir could have chosen to actually strengthen the connection between Aubrey and Hollom, and actually foreshadow it from earlier in the film, in order for Hollom to actually have an impact on Aubrey's decisions and the plot of the film. As it is, the film's resolution is reduced to a hackneyed series of events that only occur thanks to sheer chance that could be seen coming from a (nautical) mile off.Not to mention the auctorial choice of resolution to the Hollom situation, in my eyes, left much to be desired.Or Weir could have placed the focus much more squarely on Blakeney's journey and created more parallels between his character and Aubrey's.I do hope Master and Commander wins Oscars. I just hope it doesn't win Best Film or Best Screenplay, because there are other films out there far more deserving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good enough if you haven't read the books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(AHOY there, matey! Spoilers and much ambivalence dead ahead.)Being a Patrick O'Brian fan (two of whose twenty-book series were conflated to make this screenplay), my expectations were cautiously high. Story- and character-wise, I was disappointed. Jack Aubrey, (Crowe) isn't nearly the ebullient figure of the books, Steven Maturin (Bettany) is simply all wrong; much too "touchy-feely" personable and nowhere near as self-absorbed as the O'Brian character. (You'd have to know the books to understand that last.) The other characters are much too superficial (except for Ingleby's Hollum); but then Weir didn't have twenty book-lengths in which to develop them.Failures of detail involve a shot of the Surprise from above and behind in which she's making 4-5 knots, and the sails are dead flat; Jack Aubrey's favorite saying, "There's not a moment to be lost" replaced by Crowe's "There's not a moment to lose" (picky-picky! &lt;G&gt;); and Capt. Aubrey's two gold epaulets instead of the one he should have been wearing (he wasn't yet of Post Captain (two-epaulet) rank).Given all this above, the attention to details of ship's life among the crew and officers, the ship itself and its rigging, sailing depictions and details, battle action, damage, weapons, etc., were EXCELLENT; I found myself visually absorbed in every exterior scene. Sound (effects) was incredibly believable without ever getting in the way (having never been in a sea battle situation, I cannot comment upon accuracy), although the musical soundtrack pretty-much sucked. The use of Vaughan-Williams' Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis for every "dead and dying, or burial-at-sea" scene was inappropriate as the scenes were more maudlin than the accompanying music which is simply gorgeous and not quite elegiac enough for the scenes in which it was employed.For those unfamiliar with the O'Brian Aubrey/Maturin series (who won't be as persnickety as us "swabbies") the film is a good enough sea-going swashbuckler that they will feel entertained to a "good value" level, and will prolly recommend it to their friends.For me, the deus-ex-machina at the very end which discloses the ruse played upon Aubrey by the French captain (the French ship's surgeon had died months ago - how did Maturin know this?) was ridiculous in itself, and cheapened the film by leaving a too-often-seen cliffhanger of sorts upon which Weir or others will base a series of sequelae.I have to wonder what Patrick O'Brian himslef would think of this effort. I have a feeling that he's spinning dizzily in his coffin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well okay I went to go see this movie today because while I don't like Russell Crowe that much, at least as a person, it was getting excellent reviews and one of my friends told me it was really good. So okay the movie starts and before you know it we have a battle at sea. Okay now while this battle was really cool, I do have one question. Why didn't they bother to tell us which character was which. As I watched this movie I got better introduced to the characters, but like by the end of the movie I still didn't know what half of the characters names were. But this is the only real flaw in this movie. After that the movie gets going. The locations are beautiful, the acting is excellent (particularly Paul Bettany), and the battle scenes are incredible. Now of course this is a long movie and will probably have some people running to the bathroom every ten minutes seeing as almost none of this movie takes place on land. Another warning, those who get motion sickness, take dramamine before this movie. But otherwise the film is wonderful entertainment, and should do very well in the long run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved the movie! It seemed very realistic with great sound effects. I wondered, though, why the Acheron, and therefore Captain Lucky's ship, would have been going around Cape Horn rather than through the Strait of Magellan. The Strait was well-known and used by this time and would have been far safer that rounding the Cape. I suppose that is my answer - less excitement. There was one goof that I noticed during the scenes of the storm going around the Cape: thunder and lightning. It is far too cold in that part of the world for this phenomenon. I grew up in the city of Punta Arenas, port city on the Strait of Magellan, and I can tell you there was never any lightning there, so there would not be any even closer to Antartica!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of historical accuracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is destined to be regarded as a masterpiece of historical accuracy of British naval life and sailing vessels of its time -- roughly 1803.It tells a story -- not a particularly compelling one in the sense of, say, "The Sixth Sense." It's absolutely in the slice of life genre although spiced by the action of some storms and battle scenes.So those who want a narrative to hook them, to fascinate and rivet them, are not as likely to enjoy this film. Those who enjoy understanding what people in other times and places experienced, those with an interest in sailing and history, e.g., the British Navy, historical vessels, those familiar with Darwin's later voyage on the "Beagle" in the 1830s, etc., will be far more than amply rewarded. Fifty, or perhaps even one hundred years from now, I suspect this film will be still be used and viewed for its accuracy in historical depiction.I'm a long-time sailor, also interested in Darwin, evolution, the history of naval life and vessels, and a retired therapist. I thoroughly enjoyed its impeccable accuracy in portraying the life and values of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seen at a recent preview.Peter Weir takes the typical themes of his films - connection between characters, tragedy and the world they inhabit - and translates it to a high seas adventure at the time of Admiral Nelson which is a perfect introduction for young and old to life on the ocean wave.Containing the best interior fight sequence I have seen in a film since the Nepal bar shootout in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, MASTER AND COMMANDER is much more than a movie about battling boats. The relationship between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany and their compelling conflict which keeps the film on balance is the root essence of this story. After the spectacular opening salvo battle between the Surprise and the Acheron, Crowe and co have to retreat to fight another day, but new discoveries on islands, notably by Bettany's ship doctor of new species, provide surprising truths about the objectives that this band of men have to face in the film.Peter Weir has always been a competent director who has provided memorable moments on celluloid and he doesn't do himself an injustice with his latest offering. Russell Crowe continues to impress, but it is Paul Bettany who steals the film. The younger members of the cast also acquit themselves with some of the best child acting since Mark Lester's days and heighten the camarderie inherent in this splendid adventure.A great Christmas offering and one to see if you can't get a ticket for LOVE ACTUALLY.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be an even number of comments, both pro and con, for this film and that is to be expected. Having read a number of the books about Captain Aubrey and crew, I believe that the director did a fairly good job of bringing its essence to the screen. And, therein lies the issue with the film. If one is an avid fan of the Age of Sail and associated naval engagements, then the film is replete with references to it, and surprisingly well intended. If, on the other hand, one is simply in the theater to be entertained, then the film may well have missed the mark. The life of a seaman, regardless of rank, in the British Navy in 1805 was anything but exciting and daring. It was dangerous, cruel, and often short-lived. Boys at 12, or younger, became midshipman, and many did not live to attain a higher rank. The powder boys were often even younger (their smallness in stature made them perfect for racing back and forth from powder storage to the guns).Needless to say, I enjoyed the film because I believe it was an honest attempt to portray life in the British Navy at the time of Napoleon's desire to rule the seas as well as the lands. It was not without its flaws, however. For example: The French captain was obviously a clever individual as he outwitted the equally clever Aubrey on more than one occasion. With this in mind, I find it hard to believe that he would have been deceived into mistaking the Surprise for a whaler. That would be like a modern day naval officer not being able to tell the difference between a cargo ship and a destroyer. It would be exceedingly difficult to disguise gun ports with a new paint job - especially at close range. And this says nothing about the shape of the ship or its difference in rigging. And, finally, the last scene in the movie shows us a fully rigged Surprise chasing the fully rigged Acheron across the ocean. If I recall, the Acheron lost her main mast in the final battle of the film. You can't just pull one of those up out of storage and re-rig the ship like you can a yardarm or a boom.Still, in all, I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was greatly looking forward to this film, and was happy to see it getting such good reviews. Sitting through it, I couldn't understand what other people enjoyed about it so much. It is admirably subtle, focused on character, and stately. What they left out is any kind of excitement or momentum.I am not one of those viewers that need an explosion every two minutes, and while this film clearly avoid delivering over-the-top moments, a little suspense wouldn't really hurt. Even toward the end, the direction is so reserved that the climactic battle unfolds with no satisfaction or triumph (it also hurts that you can't tell the ships apart). You could compare aspects of this film to Star Trek II, in which the captain of a wounded ship also uses a clever ruse to gain a battle advantage on his more powerful enemy, as here, but there the audience is allowed to be excited about the cleverness of the trick, and feel some satisfaction when it works. Here the attitude seems to be that any kind of visceral excitement would be too below the film, and YOU should be ashamed for wanting it. And these are huge battles between massive ships we're talking about--it seems you'd have to work hard to drain the drama out of that. I would understand if they had decided instead to get into the mystery and romance of tall ships, but the feeling is that any kind of emotional response but the most reserved would be improper. Perhaps this duplicates the tone of the books, and I think that tone would work much better in a novel.If you have read a great number of sea novels and narratives, you can also start ticking off the (albiet well-handled) nautical clichés. You know it'll only be a matter of time before someone says "sell our lives as dearly as possible." Someone's going to mention "Davy Jones." The nautical instruments are going to be displayed and demonstrated at an even rate. We're going to be shown ship's food and hard tack. Etc. There are many (perhaps too many) admirable aspects of the film. I liked the complexity of Crowe's character, and the prickly relationship with his whiny and pedantic doctor friend. And there is something good about the naturalistic flow of the story (although the time compression does make it seem like the ship is repaired in two days and the doctor's bullet wound is gone after an few hours). Those familiar with Captain Bligh's 45-plus-day effort to round Cape Horn in consistently punishing weather will be surprised by the ease at which the problem is handled here. Just head South! No problem! In one way you could say that this film "doesn't insult the audience's intelligence," but in another way it does. It insults you for wanting to become engrossed in a story, and seems to view you with distain for wanting some suspense and excitement, which it resolutely is intent of denying you, primitive viewer. To me this is the movie equivalent or Grape Nuts cereal... it's good for you, but would you want to eat it?--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise - Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprise, of course, is the name of the British ship and I had been forewarned this was a marine version of Gladiator. I was pleasantly surpised that this was not so. The plot was a pretty straight forward telling of an epic naval sea chase and battle in the early 19th century with exceptional attention to detail of life on a three masted warship of the time. (I swear I felt a little seasick during the storm scenes). There were a couple of holes in the story: medical miracles from on-deck brain surgery, all-to-quick-healing gunshot and sword wounds, and the seemingly instantaneous shipboard repairs after the battles. A realistic timeline was probably 6 months or more but it seemed more like six weeks in the movie.All-in-all, excellent entertainment value for the price of admission and most will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (in three months no one will remember this title) is very well done. It's beautifully done. It shows that Russell Crowe is every bit as good an actor as people have been saying he is. And as his contrasting companion on board the Surprise, the ship he commands, Paul Bettany is most excellent. What's wrong? Nothing is wrong, if you love salty swashbucklers: this is one of the best ever. For those who tire of on board conflicts, coming of age experiences, and battles with French frigates, there are the Galapagos. The brief sequence of scenes on the island where the recently wounded Maturin (Bettany) hunts natural specimens with an assistant and an adorable little midshipman (Lord Blakeney, Max Perkis) is unforgettable. When you first see the figures walking on the island you can't help saying, `Thank God! Dry land!' Weir's handling of shipboard events isn't totally claustrophobic, but, well, there are few respites. And no women. Lots of man. And -- a novelty -- lots of boys: we're shown that in the late eighteenth century a British ship could have some extremely young (apparently mostly blond) midshipmen on board. Lord Blakeney is thirteen, and loses an arm, and is temporarily made captain: those are new twists for a seafaring epic. There's a dark haired midshipman who has the misfortune of being nearly thirty: he commits suicide. No comment.What's not quite right overall about Weir's strong new film is that one expects tremendous polarities, titanic conflicts, and a huge narrative drive toward a suspenseful finale - and they aren't there. Master and Commander is more subtle and complicated than that. Certainly its stereotypes are understated, and its dialogue clear and civilized. But in its very complexity, it fails to pull the swarming mass of events and people on the old sailing ship together into a stirring adventure. Too many episodes have equal weight.What emerges best is the conflict and friendship between Captain `Lucky' Jack Aubrey and the ship's doctor, Stephen Maturin, the two central figures in the Patrick O'Brian 20-novel series. There are some interesting subplots - too many, since they remove any sense that the chase after a huge French frigate is as all-important as it's been cracked up to be early on - and the younger midshipmen (especially Perkis) are particularly charming. The medical interludes are realistically gruesome, but they just add another dash of flavor (whereas many of the more nitty gritty details of the lowly seamen's lives are omitted). There's that episode of the unfortunate aging midshipman who sees no way out but to jump into the sea carrying a cannonball. But the only interpersonal relations that leave a lasting impression are those between captain and doctor.Perhaps what the film is really about - but you finally can't say - is leadership. The aging midshipman is Aubrey's foil in this. He lacks the courage and strength to lead his men, and they've turned against him. Aubrey tells him - too late -- that he needs to focus not on being liked or hated but on simply asserting strong authority. This is what Aubrey does. He's a true leader. He leads. If you were stranded on a strip of ice like the men of the Endurance, Aubrey might pinch hit for the redoubtable Shackleton. Maybe his determination to conquer the French ship even when two encounters have failed is hubristic, but the men are ready to follow him wherever he wants to go. This, however, is a theme that is too often interrupted to be fully developed.Not being a Patrick O'Brian fan, I can't say how authentically the film evokes the atmosphere of the series. But it seems to me questionable that two of the books were used to make Master and Commander (its duality is signaled all too clearly in the double title and the colon). Obviously more focus was needed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Weir's Master and Commander is a wonderful movie to behold and participate in. Having not read either of the books this movie is based on, I approached the film as a young mid-shipman might, full of anxiety, excitement and fear. Which Russell Crowe would be at the helm? The over the top Maximus? The head thumping Bud White/Hando? The little man in lifts wearing his father's Victoria Cross out on the town for Oscar night? I'm pleased to say it was none of them ? but instead a fresh face and true Master and Commander of His Majesty's Royal Navy, a genuine man's man. Hat's off for Crowe's turn, he's definitely found his sea legs. And where has Paul Bettany been hiding? ? What a performance!Strong supporting cast, script, effects, and pacing makes this a true epic film that somehow manages to maintain a sense of intimacy known only by a small group a of people trapped for months at a time enduring great common struggle with humor, faith, courage, setbacks and triumph.Score was a bit wanting and repetitive, but not distractingly so, and it's highlights outweighed its low points.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Russell Crowe. He and the character of the doctor were wonderfully done. I agree that it is more of a documentary sort of thing, than an entertainment. One never feels one's emotions being pulled or aroused. The movie seems to allow you to look in on this wonderfully detailed picture of life at sea in 1805, but never draws you in totally. I'm not sure why. But nevertheless, it is a fine movie, well done, and the characters and situations are developed in detail. Maybe the movie would have been more emotionally gripping if Capt. Jack (Russell) was a more complicated man, but he was all one note, "Hooray for England, we must all be strong, etc..." If he had had some deep secret or dark side, it would have been more interesting.</fullReview>

The only 2 actors I recognized were Russell Crowe of course and Billy Boyd who is in the Lord of the Rings movies. Other than that most of the other actors were first timers. The movie does drag at times though especially during lulls when the ship is simply floating around and not moving. The dialogue can get too boring ,if you have ever watched a mostly British cast movie in a drama then you will know what I mean . This movie is not for those expecting alot of battle action either , there are only 2 scenes of battle ,in the beginning and at the end. The only thing good I noted was the cinematography ,some nice eye candy of the ocean,islands and other sights. I would not recommend blowing 8 or more dollars for this movie ,wait for the DVD or for it to move on to the theaters that show movies that have been out over a month for cheap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Master and Commander last night, and it a really well put together film however, the plot is pretty weak, the HMS Suprise (Crow's ship) is attacked at the begining and so the Surpise try's to hunt down the ship that attacked them. The acting was really good. But, the plot and dialouge wasn't that strong. There were lots of parts that had nothing to do with the plot, and useually that is to build character for you to like or dislike the characters but I really didn't care if anybody died or not. But that isn't the acting that was bad, just a weak weak script. There wasn't much meat to this movie, and if this movie is nominated for any Academy Awards for acting (the script made the acting weak), someone is getting robed.

		<shortDescription>It has elements of literary elements but is a good sea yarn without them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Weir has a penchant for the weird: `A Picnic at Hanging Rock' drips with symbolism and sex and remains my favorite Australian film of the ?70's; `Truman Story' leans heavily on allegory about media control. His new `Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,' starring Russell Crowe, has literary elements but is a good sea yarn without them.1805 British Navy Captain Jack Aubrey (Crowe) commands a vessel in the Pacific chasing phantom French frigate Acheron, which is faster, bigger, and almost as creative at navigating and fighting as Aubrey's `Surprise.' The story is an amalgam of Richard O'Brian's Aubrey sea tales, filled with falling yardarms and demanding dreams, like the mast of the Acheron and Aubrey's goal of taking down a Napoleonic symbol.Aubrey refers more than once to Admiral Nelson, seemingly a device to catapult the action into an emblem of England stopping Napoleon's westward advance. As Weir is wont to do, he layers in another allegorical strand, this one the visit to the Galapagos Islands, where study of survival is new and exciting and helpful when a captain needs inspiration in battle. Courage, determination, loyalty, and leadership are the key thematic elements. Weir does not shy away from suggesting that power compromises one's command or that ends may justify the means.This is not Melville's `Billy Budd'-a sea story about the effects of pure evil on an innocent sailor and the rest of the crew. But it does entertain for over 2 hours, and Russell Crowe easily plays the hero, more willing to play games as if they were war and war is if it were a game. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it was the venue. I saw the movie in a multiplex which usually has a good sound system, but the sound was very unbalanced. I generally don't have trouble understanding British accents, but the dialogue was too soft in comparison to the action scenes. My companion at the movie asked to have the sound level raised so he could hear the dialogue, which they did... but then the battle scenes to me were deafening. I felt that the movie was pretty true to what was happening in 1805, but my stomach could have done with a little less graphic blood and gore. I also could have done with fewer scenes of the ship pitching on rough seas and sitting still in becalmed waters, and more scenes explaining who the people were. I didn't know the red coated guys were Marines until late in the movie; and never did figure out who the young officer type kids were or why they were there. But I did figure out the surprise kicker at the end before my companion did. And I won't spoil the movie for anyone by telling here what it was. I'm sure it will be up for a number of academy awards next year, and as far as acting and cinematography goes, perhaps.... but as far as sound... forget it. And I'm not sure about the screenplay. I must read the books from which this movie was adapted. I don't think the characters were given enough time in the movie to be thoroughly developed. I guess I was looking for something with more character development and less "spectacular cine-shots." None-the-less, I am glad that I saw it. But I probably won't purchase the DVD or see it again on cable TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, the audio was so bad that I could hardly understand anything that was being said. In addition, there were so many unexplained items and frankly ludicrous reasons for the voyage. The original book was of a British ship pursuing an American ship during the war of 1812. It was changed to a British ship pursuing a French ship in waters off Chile and Ecuador. The reason supposedly was to stop Napoleon from gaining a foothold in the western hemisphere (simply ridiculous). The battles appeared to kill everybody in the original battle and yet only 28 of 170 people were killed. Techniques were used to refit the damaged ship which were impossible. And lastly, it was never explained how the French ship was able to locate exactly where the British ship was located (unless they had GPS equipment back in 1805). In conclusion, it was disjointed, unrealistic, inaudible and much to long and bloody. I'd give it a 1-1/2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. An extraordinary film production delivered by famed Australian director Peter Weir ("The Truman Show", "Dead Poet's Society" "Gallipoli" and the overlooked "The Last Wave"). The realism is a bit frightening at times and the ships and fight scenes are remarkable. Russell Crowe is perfectly cast as a strong leader without much to say. His screen presence is on a level with Sean Connery, although his acting ability is still up for debate. Paul Bettany (almost unrecognizable from his role as Crowe's "roommate" in "A Beautiful Mind") deliver fine supporting work as Crowe's friend torn between duty and science. Newcomer Max Pirkis shows some nice work as well. The letdown in this movie is from the script. It tries to be "The Art of War" and "Patton", but fails. The non-fighting scenes are just delays for the battle scenes. What a shame. Worth seeing for the technical aspects of sea battle, but little else. No real drama or emotion involved. Stay for the credits as the number of people involved with this movie is beyond belief. Couldn't help but chuckle as one of the master sailors is listed with the last name Hornblower!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[Grievous and humiliating error in first submission corrected here. :)]Winston Churchill, wherever he is today, must recoil with horror at a quotation falsely ascribed to him about his beloved Royal Navy. Supposedly responding to an admiral's recitation of the Senior Service's history, the portly First Lord of the Admiralty purportedly responded that the navy's traditions encompassed "rum, sodomy and the lash." In "Master and Commander," etc., director Peter Weir serves up two of the service's traditions, rum and the lash but inaccurately leaves the sweating, groping, between decks sex life out.Weir with Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey of HMS Surprise, ably both abetted and challenged by his ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Brettany, draws the viewer into a powerful, gripping but somewhat sanitized world of the wooden warship at the height of its power before steam drove the old ships to wrecking yards.Based on the late Patrick O'Brian's very well received series of novels, "Master and Commander" places HMS Surprise in harm's way as Aubrey searches for a powerful French privateer during the Napoleonic Wars. The fate of England is at stake we are told (several times, actually). The search takes place in the deep reaches where the oceans collide at Cape Horn, in reality not where naval engagements took place during the long war.The time is half past Lord Nelson's splendid victory at the Battle of the Nile and before his crushing extinguishment of the French fleet at Trafalgar where he paid with his own life.Aubrey was a junior officer under Nelson and he regales his wardroom with stories about the one-armed, seasick-prone, philandering naval genius. Well, he leaves those details out. But no blowzy bimbo like Lady Emma Hamilton is in this captain's life. In fact there are no women in the film except for a few seconds when an undoubtedly randy captain gazes briefly at a native woman.HMS Surprise is, unfortunately, surprised at the very beginning of the film when its quarry hits the frigate with powerful broadsides, reducing the escaping-into-the-fog vessel to near helplessness. Aubrey resolves to make repairs and hunt down the French vessel, a decision that sets the pace for the rest of the film. Is he acting out of duty or from ego? A familiar war film issue.Weir cleverly never lets the viewer see much of the French enemy and attention is unremittingly focused on Aubrey, Maturin and a crew ranging from old salts to barely pubescent midshipmen carrying the weight of officers' duties. It's highly effective.And there are few scenes on land although one is vital to the story. This is a true shipboard movie. From the quarterdeck to the swinging hammocks in an impossibly crammed forecastle, with the almost palpable sweat and smell of sailors jammed in quarters so close as to deny any privacy or dignity, this is a film about men at war. Aubrey, of course, is based on Nelson in reality and Horatio Hornblower in fiction. The C.S. Forester novels about Hornblower, tracing his career from junior rank to admiral and lord, are classics and Gregory Peck did a fine job portraying the character in a much earlier film.What Crowe brings to the screen is a complex character who blends an almost gushing love for his crew with the duty to push them to extremes of endurance and towards the god of battle. Crowe could have totally dominated the film but for Paul Brettany's sensitive portrayal as a doctor and would-be naturalist serving as the skipper's only friend and confidant. His acting makes the story far more engrossing than it otherwise would have been. Aubrey, a violinist, and Maturin, a cellist, make some nice music together too.Historical accuracy? The ship's accouterments, the uniforms, the dreadful quarters for the men, the lingo: a lot of research went into "Master and Commander." Jack Tar was legally entitled (until not very many years ago) to a daily tot of grog, a rum-based beverage that actually served to keep him somewhat servile. Aubrey makes sure that good work is rewarded by extra tots. Great, just what a warship needs-crew members inebriated.Impressment was the main "recruiting" device of the Georgian navy and the men were, no pun intended, a rum lot. Speaking of his soldiers, the Duke of Wellington famously commented that he didn't know if they frightened the enemy but they definitely frightened him. That was even more so of the naval seamen of the time but the crew of Surprise are remarkably healthy, happy, compliant and devoted to their commander. Well, it IS a story.The lash: Aubrey is a humane officer in a navy where most commanders resorted to the lash often, sometimes sparking mutinies from a crew that could endure no more brutalization. But when no other alternative is present, he orders all hands aft to witness punishment. Purists will be disappointed, as I was, to see an ordinary whip used instead of the cat o'nine tails that was the inseparable friend of the Master at Arms.The least accurate portrayal is of the companionship of the captain's cabin where all the officers dine together in good fellowship, their captain tipsy if not fully three sheets to the wind. The wardroom with the commanding officer dining became a staple of the steamship navy. During the Napoleonic Wars, a ship's captain generally kept his distance from his officers and dined (dined? Look at what they're eating.) alone in his cabin at the ship's stern. But that's a minor quibble.Viewers interested in understanding what the Royal Navy of the Anglo-French war was like ought to start with an American's view, Herman Melville's "Billy Budd" (the Benjamin Britten opera of the same name is pretty good too).But this is an audience involving, rousing tale that shouldn't be missed. And it's NOT just for male audiences.But an Oscar contender? Not for me. It's a terrific modern depiction of a story line we've seen in many films. Russell Crowe is entertaining but there's no great depth in his character as there was when he played that tormented genius in "A Beautiful Mind."Wanna bet there'll be a sequel. Perhaps Aubrey, older and of higher rank, will command a squadron landing troops to sack Washington in the War of 1812.8/10</fullReview>

Also it was difficult to really identify with the characters. Why were they any better than the French who they were fighting? And so, I found myself not particularly rooting for either side. But again, the action scenes although extremely well done, were not very exciting. There was no real tension in the movie. And there is too much time spent on the inner workings and life of crew and ship. I recommend seeing it--once--but I doubt I would buy it on DVD nor will I see it again.

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good Time Machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will review this movie on three levels. First, regarding the writing: Very good. the plot touches on the expected themes of duty, honor, and loyalty with some interesting asides, although I found Crowe's Aubrey to come uncomfortably close to the stock "commander" figure: wise, modest, dutiful, firm but compassionate. Having said that, however, we see Aubrey's sense of duty really tested against personal loyalty. We also see, no matter how elevated the rank and "enlightened" the personality, superstition still is part of the fabric of the day to day life aboard a ship of the nineteenth century. There is also an intriguing attempt to "pace" the film by repeatedly cutting to shots of the ship's hour glass being turned over and the ship's bell being rung to mark the watches. We also see the conflict between the two ships as something of a very drawn out duel: the antagonist, though unseen, takes on a personality. In the quieter moments we see the French captain given his due by Aubrey without fanfare.On a technical level, I regarded this film as being almost flawless. I don't think I've ever seen a better rendition of "Wooden Ships and Iron Men on a Bounding Mane"...the miniatures are flawless, the water effects first-rate, motion control superb. I've noted that in other movies of ships at sea CG has a very hard time rendering the boundary between a hull and the water, as well as the wake. From what I could see this movie neatly sidestepped most of this problem by using low angles that obscured the waterline by hiding it behind a swell. It isn't pronounced and felt quite natural. The last level I want to mention is historical authenticity. Clearly this movie was well researched and comes pretty close to accurately portraying ship-board life at the time. When I saw how well the film transported me to 1805 I found my expectations raised to the point that I felt a few elements got short shrift. Firstly, we see no effort to impress sailors, a common practice at the time. Also, I felt we didn't see an accurate portrayal of shipboard discipline: whippings and beatings were a lot more common, even aboard ships with so called "benevolent" captains. Also, it was a common practice to spread sawdust on the decks prior to battle so that the crew could keep their feet when the decks became slippery with blood. This was barely touched on. Can you imagine the sense of foreboding this element would have added, especially in the second battle scene after, say, we had been treated to a view of decks literally running with blood? I believe including those two elements would have helped enormously. Also, in one scene we see an attempt to disable a ship using solid shot against masts rather than other ordnance that targeted the rigging. These are however, minor quibbles from a maritime enthusiast looking for a flawless time machine. My only real annoyance with the movie are the scenes where we see the captain and his surgeon "jamming" on violin and cello. It is the most inept mismatch I've ever seen between what we are seeing and what we are hearing. Crowe is totally unconvincing in his depiction of a musician. We might as well be seeing him playing "air violin". We hear at one point a trio and there are only two instruments. We see a cello playing but hear a viola. After all the fidelity given to other elements in the story the effect was quite jarring. That said, however, I'm certain for the majority of the movie-going public it'll be quite adequate. I believe this'll have a long run in the theaters. Huzzahs for Peter Weir, Universal, Miramax, 20th Century Fox, and Samuel Goldwyn Films. I give this film a nine out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an imbedded movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I enjoyed myself in the same way that I enjoyed being imbedded with the troops in the Iraq war. It's not exactly a drama, but if you had a time machine and sent a camera crew to be imbedded with British seamen at the turn of the nineteenth century, this is what you'd get. It was constantly interesting, often exciting, but it wasn't exactly a movie if, by movie, you expected to be moved.</fullReview>

Think about it: Blakeney is a perfect blend of Aubrey's dash, character, bravery, and leadership, yet he seemingly has all of the curiosity, intelligence, and sensitivity of second father Maturin. I have rarely seen this characterization technique, and only recently in the novel "Never Lark nor Eagle: A Fighter Pilot's Story" by Ray Castagnaro It was done very well in this film and played to perfection by Pirkis. I dare say that England has produced a worthy successor to the thrown of now-teenage Haley Joel Osment.This could be the finest film of the year. I see another Best Actor Award for Crowe and (hopefully) a shared Supporting statue for Bettany and Pirkis (Oh that's right... the academy does not recognize fine acting below the age of twenty....)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid in every way, but not great (8 out of 10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By giving "Master and Commander" a rating of 8 out of 10, I'm not suggesting that Peter Weir's latest work isn't Oscar worthy, but I don't think it has that certain "something" that takes a well-crafted, fine film to the "great" level.I'm also not suggesting that Russell Crowe wasn't terrific -- I don't think any working actor would be more suitable in the role of Capt. Jack Aubrey. But will he win another statuette? I don't think it is a lock.The movie is solid in every way, and true to the spirit of Patrick O'Brian's novels, but I don't think it has enough "mass market" appeal to be considered a classic over time.I'll compare "Master and Commander" to "Chariots of Fire," which won Best Picture without being a true Hollywood blockbuster.What is the film lacking? There is no love interest, let alone sex, even though Aubrey has a clandestine on-land relationship with the wife of a superior officer in O'Brian's first novel. Now that would have spiced things up!And there is no real development of the friendship between Aubrey and Dr. Maturin -- in the book, Aubrey "discovers" Maturin and their friendship grows. In the film, you don't get a sense of how these polar-opposite men find their relationship.I'm not trying to be critical -- I had very high hopes for this film -- but I didn't walk out of the theater amazed, just satisfied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Set a course for L.A. Oscars here we come!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander is a visually impressive movie that takes you on a journey into the lives of a Napoleonic-era war ship. Crowe is the captain, and you, as the viewer, become a member of his crew. The battle scenes were really cool, and the symbolism runs deep.I certainly could not help thinking that the movie was dripping with Oscar politics. You could almost hear Crowe yelling out in the movie, "I WANT ANOTHER OSCAR!" As a matter of fact, you could tell which clip they will show if he is nominated as it appears in the film. It was very clear that this was an Oscar vehicle for both Fox and Peter Wier. That, however, didnt stop me from liking it. I dont know if they can actually bring home the gold in March or not, but I think they deserve the nominations that they get.Overall, it was a good "ship movie." Many critics called it boring and dull. They obviously were not sitting where I was, because I went in unsure and came out pleased. Go see it, as it will lose some of its value in your living room.7/10</fullReview>

However I don't think the characters of Jack and Stephen had much of a chance to show the true bond and affection for each other. Also there was no mention of Dr. Maturin's other career with British intelligence. Possibly these can be corrected if a second movie is made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the greater naval action movies out there. Crowe does a great job as Aubrey, this role was made for him. Although it's a little confusing in the beginning, it pulls you in. You never leave the area of in and around the boat, so its a little hard to get a grasp on world events and the motivations of the captain/crew, but overall this was great! Not too much gore, the filmmakers used camera shake very well during the battle scenes to help stay with the PG-13 rating, so this is a Crowe movie (unlike Gladiator) that the younger ones might be able to watch also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting-Definitely; Historically Accurate-Mixed; Oscar Worthy-Not Really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winston Churchill, wherever he is today, must recoil with horror at a quotation falsely ascribed to him about his beloved Royal Navy. Supposedly responding to an admiral's recitation of the Senior Service's history, the portly First Lord of the Admiralty purportedly responded that the navy's traditions encompassed "rum, sodomy and the lash." In "Master and Commander," etc., director Peter Weir serves up two of the service's traditions, rum and the lash but inaccurately leaves the sweating, groping, between decks sex life out.Weir with Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey of HMS Surprise, ably both abetted and challenged by his ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Brettany, draws the viewer into a powerful, gripping but somewhat sanitized world of the wooden warship at the height of its power before steam drove the old ships to wrecking yards.Based on the late Patrick O'Brian's very well received series of novels, "Master and Commander" places HMS Surprise in harm's way as Aubrey searches for a powerful French privateer during the Napoleonic Wars. The fate of England is at stake we are told (several times, actually). The search takes place in the deep reaches where the oceans collide at Cape Horn, in reality not where naval engagements took place during the long war.The time is half past Lord Nelson's splendid victory at the Battle of the Nile and before his crushing extinguishment of the French fleet at Trafalgar where he paid with his own life.Aubrey was a junior officer under Nelson and he regales his wardroom with stories about the one-armed, seasick-prone, philandering naval genius. Well, he leaves those details out. But no blowzy bimbo like Lady Emma Hamilton is in this captain's life. In fact there are no women in the film except for a few seconds when an undoubtedly randy captain gazes briefly at a native woman.HMS Surprise is, unfortunately, surprised at the very beginning of the film when its quarry hits the frigate with powerful broadsides, reducing the escaping-into-the-fog vessel to near helplessness. Aubrey resolves to make repairs and hunt down the French vessel, a decision that sets the pace for the rest of the film. Is he acting out of duty or from ego? A familiar war film issue.Weir cleverly never lets the viewer see much of the French enemy and attention is unremittingly focused on Aubrey, Maturin and a crew ranging from old salts to barely pubescent midshipmen carrying the weight of officers' duties. It's highly effective.And there are few scenes on land although one is vital to the story. This is a true shipboard movie. From the quarterdeck to the swinging hammocks in an impossibly crammed forecastle, with the almost palpable sweat and smell of sailors jammed in quarters so close as to deny any privacy or dignity, this is a film about men at war.Aubrey, of course, is based on Nelson in reality and Horatio Hornblower in fiction. The C.S. Forester novels about Hornblower, tracing his career from junior rank to admiral and lord, are classics and Gregory Peck did a fine job portraying the character in a much earlier film.What Crowe brings to the screen is a complex character who blends an almost gushing love for his crew with the duty to push them to extremes of endurance and towards the god of battle. Crowe could have totally dominated the film but for Paul Brettany's sensitive portrayal as a doctor and would-be naturalist serving as the skipper's only friend and confidant. His acting makes the story far more engrossing than it otherwise would have been. Aubrey, a violinist, and Maturin, a cellist, make some nice music together too.Historical accuracy? The ship's accouterments, the uniforms, the dreadful quarters for the men, the lingo: a lot of research went into "Master and Commander." Jack Tar was legally entitled (until not very many years ago) to a daily tot of grog, a rum-based beverage that actually served to keep him somewhat servile. Aubrey makes sure that good work is rewarded by extra tots. Great, just what a warship needs-crew members inebriated.Impressment was the main "recruiting" device of the Georgian navy and the men were, no pun intended, a rum lot. Speaking of his soldiers, the Duke of Marlborough famously commented that he didn't know if they frightened the enemy but they definitely frightened him. That was even more so of the naval seamen of the time but the crew of Surprise are remarkably healthy, happy, compliant and devoted to their commander. Well, it IS a story.The lash: Aubrey is a humane officer in a navy where most commanders resorted to the lash often, sometimes sparking mutinies from a crew that could endure no more brutalization. But when no other alternative is present, he orders all hands aft to witness punishment. Purists will be disappointed, as I was, to see an ordinary whip used instead of the cat o'nine tails that was the inseparable friend of the Master at Arms.The least accurate portrayal is of the companionship of the captain's cabin where all the officers dine together in good fellowship, their captain tipsy if not fully three sheets to the wind. The wardroom with the commanding officer dining became a staple of the steamship navy. During the Napoleonic Wars, a ship's captain generally kept his distance from his officers and dined (dined? Look at what they're eating.) alone in his cabin at the ship's stern. But that's a minor quibble.Viewers interested in understanding what the Royal Navy of the Anglo-French war was like ought to start with an American's view, Herman Melville's "Billy Budd" (the Benjamin Britten opera of the same name is pretty good too).But this is an audience involving, rousing tale that shouldn't be missed. And it's NOT just for male audiences.But an Oscar contender? Not for me. It's a terrific modern depiction of a story line we've seen in many films. Russell Crowe is entertaining but there's no great depth in his character as there was when he played that tormented genius in "A Beautiful Mind."Wanna bet there'll be a sequel. Perhaps Aubrey, older and of higher rank, will command a squadron landing troops to sack Washington in the War of 1812.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Weir &amp; Russell Crowe at their best, beautiful seascapes, exciting chases and battles -- what more could you want? The relationship between Aubrey and Maturin. This relationship is central to the novels, but almost background to the film. Furthermore, the film is ABOUT Aubrey, not the two of them, and Aubrey is shown to be a man without apparent weakness (far from the case in the books). Perhaps this was intentional -- it certainly streamlines the film, and removes some pesky complexities which one could argue are easier to sustain in a literary form. Nevertheless, I felt something was lost. But go see it anyway, even if you're a fan, it's still a dynamite film on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe delivers a stunning performance yet again in what is definitely an Oscar worthy role. Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, a British ship captain in 1805 who is given orders to disable a French ship and help stop the dominance of Napoleon.The film starts with a near miss as the two ships do battle, then follows Aubrey and his crew in their quest to outdo the bigger and better equipped Acheron. It gives an interesting viewpoint of what life at sea was like during this period.Master &amp; Commander also marks the return of director Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Dead Poets Society, Witness). He is also equally as worthy of an Oscar for his work, provided they haven't already etched Peter Jackson's name on the statuette.Visually stunning and masterfully acted, I believe this is one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering how long I've been eagerly awaiting Peter Weir's latest, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, it still exceeded any expectations I had for it.The film is one of the grandest epics I've seen in a long time and is a meticulous one at that. It doesn't have the sometimes laughably bad cg effects of films such as Gladiator nor does it have the moronic dialogue and stilted acting. Instead, Master and Commander is a film which is both elegant and wildly entertaining at once.As for the acting, Crowe and Bettany have a great repore as the ship's Captain and Doctor respectively. Their opposing points of view both somehow seem valid at the same time and both have personalities which draw in the audience for entirely different reasons.Though I've never read any of the Patrick O'Brian novels, as a film unto itself Peter Weir has made an instant classic. Though extremely traditional in it's methods, everything is done so well that one doesn't want to see a new spin on the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good old-fashioned guy movie in the best sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Russell Crowe shows what a man's man is all about as heroic English naval captain "Lucky Jack" Aubrey, charged with preventing a French ship from reaching the Pacific Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars in 1805. His men love and admire him, and how could they not -- he portrays the classic man every other man wants to be, and that every woman wants. (Not that there are women in this movie -- except one briefly glimpsed flirtatious local beauty whose boat comes alongside his ship while provisions are being loaded in a Brazilian port. With the exchange of a single wordless glance of appreciation and bemused regret, Crowe, under Peter Weir's wonderfully economical direction, tells us everything we need to know about his relationships with women and his sense of honor.)This is a very, very good movie. What keeps it from greatness is that Aubrey is nearly perfect to begin with -- he has no important flaws to overcome or major lessons to be learned when we meet him, just the hard work of commanding a ship at sea and at war, having to make hard choices that affect men's lives for good or ill, with only an occasional moral struggle whose outcome is never really in doubt. Two of Weir's earlier films, both among my all-time favorites --"Witness" and "Year of Living Dangerously" --featured flawed heroes who changed in the course of the narrative. We don't have the pleasure of seeing Jack Aubrey change, but we do enjoy the few hours spent getting to know him better in the course of the story."Master and Commander" offers the pleasure of solid, old-fashioned storytelling. We watch subsidiary characters grow; battles and resultant injuries; struggles with unfavorable weather and conflicts among the men. Through it all, Peter Weir keeps the focus on the characters, not on can-you-top-this action, though there's plenty of action. In going all out to portray life aboard ship as realistically and viscerally as possible, he's created effects sufficiently convincing that (a rarity these days) the artistry behind them is virtually invisible. We the audience struggle along with a watch commander to figure out what we're seeing through a telescope in dense fog. We feel the men's misery in the intense heat in the doldrums, and their relief in the cooling rains that follow. You begin to understand the appeal of the sailor's life, despite the great hardships it entailed. And you certainly admire the courage of those who actually lived the kinds of lives portrayed in this film. For this solid entertainment, we obviously have to thank Patrick O'Brian (whom a friend, a fan of his books, tells me are extremely well researched and detailed), Peter Weir,and the thoroughly excellent cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this watching this movie. You can clearly see they put a lot of effort into recreating authentic ships to create the background against which the story is set. The cinematography is dark and gloomy, and fits the story. Russel Crow in his role of captain does a good job. The interaction between 'the doctor' and 'the captain' forms the core of this movie, but unfortunately goes not very deeply. I really enjoyed to two playing music together at several times in the movie. The movie has one long major theme, right from the start, which I will not tell to prevent any spoilers. In the beginning this is quite entertaining, but towards the end it becomes more boring. Before I saw this movie, I saw the series of Hornblower movies. Although those are lesser known, and did not receive as much media attention, in my opinion those movies -- in exactly the same genre -- are much more interesting, much better done, have a much better story, and are much more exciting. So, if you enjoyed Master and Commander, you must certainly see the Hornblower series!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Napoleonic Wars At Sea with PG-13 Restrained Violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the Russell Crowe Age of Sail epic "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is enough to make anybody sea-sick. In other words, you'll get sick of seeing this formulaic flotsam of clichés long before its interminable 138 minutes has washed over you. Unlike those popular Errol Flynn swashbucklers from the 1930s, Gregory Peck's "Captain Horatio Hornblower" (1951), or the Johnny Depp "Pirates of the Caribbean" epics, "Master and Commander" takes itself far too seriously and features a predominantly male cast, with no damsels-in-distress awaiting rescue from depicable villains. The fleeting moments when women do appear on screen seem designed to reassure any doubting spectators about the heterosexual orientation of the entire HMS Surprise crew. Worse, "Master and Commander" lacks a hardcore villain in either character or physical stature. This lack of villainy undercuts director Peter Weir's film and its overall dramatic impact. The earliest glimpse that we catch of the villainous French captain is after Russell Crowe and crew have stormed their adversary's ship. Oops, did you ever doubt Russell wouldn't feast on frog legs at fadeout? Nevetheless, this literate, authentic looking, tactical game of cat and mouse on the high seas set in the year 1805 between an under-gunned English vessel and a well-armed Napoleonic man-of-war excels in visual and narrative storytelling. Although writer &amp; director Peter Weir of "Gallipoli," "The Mosquito Coast," and "The Truman Show" fame and co-scenarist former physician John Collee have written well-thought out characters with clearly delineated motivations, they have failed miserably at making any of them charismatic, much less memorable. You won't find yourself cheering on Russell Crowe here as you might have in "Gladiator" because his character behaves like a good-two shoes.Some will applaud the documentary verisimilitude that Aussie helmer Peter Weir brings to "Master and Commander" without exposing either the unsavory homoerotic or sadomasochistic undertones persasive in the British Navy during the 19th century. Weir and his collaborators must have poured considerable time and research into "Master and Commander" because each scene appears thoroughly credible, especially with regard to loading and firing cannon. Weir lensed this turbulent ocean-going voyage in the huge aquatic tank in Baja, Mexico, built for "Titanic." Meawnhile, others less enamored of historical detail may keep glancing at theircell phone clocks, chafing in eager anticipation for the inevitable comeuppance that ultimately takes too long to materialize. The battle scenes are the best that "Master and Commander" has to offer. Indeed, the ships appear genuine enough, whether either life-sized or miniature, and the atmospheric cinematography always provides viewers with the most interesting perspectives. Sadly, the drawn-out scenes on the Galapogos Islands amount to nothing more than malingering. Bloody without being sanguinary, Weir stages gritty action scenes, such as a broading party assault during a ship-to-ship battle, well enough. No, the violence in "Master and Commander" won't make you flinch like the graphic bloodshed in Mel Gibson's superior but bloody colonial epic "The Patriot." In a model of restraint, Weir has characters talk about the gore that occurs off screen and only shows its consequences on-screen. Okay, one guy does take a bullet between the eyes, but he doesn't stand around and talk about it. Unfortunately, if you dread closed confines, you'll find yourself sweating like a claustrophobic. Eighty per cent of "Master and Commander" transpires within the cramped confines fo the HMS Surprise. Meaning, time drags its sea legs between the first encounter with the French and the final showdown. No, "Master and Commander" dispenses with the rip-snorting escapades of the gender-bending Geena Davis swashbuckler "Cutthroat Island" and avoids the harsh rivalry between the skipper and subordinates of the 1962 Alec Guinness effort "Damn the Defiant." "Writer &amp; director Peter Weir and John Collee combined two of the late Patrick O'Brien's historical novels, "Master and Commander" and "The Far Side of the World," to serve as the basis for their above-average but predictable screenplay. Set during the Napoleonic Wars, "Master and Commander" opens with the Acheron, a mysterious but appropriately named French battleship, sneaking up on HMS Surprise and giving Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his crew the surprise of their lives. Not only does the rest of the plot chart how Aubrey cleverly evades the French, but also his egoistical refusal to tuck his rudder between his sails. Half-way through the story, this phantom French ship reappears without warning and sends our heroes scurrying again, though they do cobble together a skillful ruse to mislead the enemy.Once again, the British are cast as underdogs! Eventually, 'Lucky' Jack turns to his right-hand man, the ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany, Crowe's co-star in "A Beautiful Mind") who shows his life-long friend how the study of biology can bail him out of tough straits. The biggest problem with this sumptuously produced reenactment of early 19th century naval warfare is its PG-13 realism about life on a British warship. Weir and his scenarist appear more committed to lecturing audiences about good citizenship than depicting events with nominal realism. Torn between the needs of his crew versus the demands of command, Crowe's Captain Aubrey emerges as hopelessly sentimental. Yes, one scene features a flogging, but Weir and company bring PG-13 restraint to the fore with a little blood in sight as possible when a crew member takes his lashes.Altogether, despite its top-drawer production values, gorgeous cinematography, and inspired staging of its sea battles, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" fall far short of those entertaining swashbucklers of yesteryear. Furthermore, its obsession with gratuitous good citizenship propaganda, its abysmal lack of a villain, and a shortage of charismatic heroes nearly sinks this ambitious yarn.</fullReview>

The first thing that becomes apparent is that Weir placed a lot of importance on making the movie as detailed and authentic as possible. Far more realistic than most movies of this genre. Perhaps a bit too slow at times, but interesting. Certainly, casting a "man's man" such as Crowe ? instead of a wuss-like androgynous creature in the mold of O'Donnell, Damon, Cruise or even Di Crapio (God forbid!) ? adds weight to the movie.

		<fullReview>I never give a 10 for any movie. There is always something that can be improved upon. I was hard pressed to find it in this film, other than those that are listed on the films site on IMDb, Goofs. Alas, there is no perfect movie. I do not feel this movie was written for women other than Russell Crowe starring in it. But as a woman, I completely enjoyed the movie. It was powerful and masterfully done. I enjoyed "looking" at the film which is a compliment for the cinematography. The "hooks" "plot points" and "conflicts" were riveting. I walked out of the theater with the group I was with and told them it was going to receive many award nominations. Most didn't agree. In fact I was surprised that 3 out of 4 men, didn't find it a movie they would want to see again. I was very happy not to have to eat my words. The nominations and wins are numerous. Just as in Gladiator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instead of a blood, war film (Troy, Alexander) which get boring after a while, Master and Commander keeps you hooked until the very end. Although not entirely accurate, this may be one of the best Naval films made (although I don't know how many naval films have been made). Taking place during the Napoleonic Wars, Capt. Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe) is under the service of the British crown and chasing the Royal French Warship Acheron who attacked them off the coast of South America. Capt. Jack sets off on an unbelievable quest to capture the invincible Acheron which is heading for the Pacific Ocean. Along the command of Capt. Jack's men is a crew of laughter, hatred, and interest. The ships doctor, Stephen Maurin (Paul Bettany) is also a moral supervisor and a very good friend of the Captain. Along the way, Jack pushes his men too the limits from enduring a week long dry spell to ordering the death of a crew mate to save the ship. The battles are spread out enough for the drama and plot to unfold and present themselves. The ship is beautiful and was actually built for the film. Russell Crowe is magnificent and Paul Bettany holds his own along with him. The crew is fun to watch, when you don't even know their names you feel for them and feel as if you're a cabin mate with them. The film is a bit long, stretching 2 1/2 hours but is well worth it. The film is not all historically accurate but if I wanted a history lesson, I'd read a history book. The film is visually stunning and about 90% is filmed on the open ocean. The effects are wonderful and the plot above average.Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World. Starring: Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Billy Boyd, James D'Arcy, and Max Pirkis.4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intelligent film, not packed with clichés to make a point we have already assumed. It credits its audience with intelligence, as it does it characters. It gives them depth and lightness, learning and introspection. No two dimensional characters here, and for my mind an adventure movie far better than the Indianna Jones series.Russell Crowe shows himself to be an actor who is willing to take real risks with his career, a man who could have made a comfortable living playing tough guys, but has succeeded in playing as diverse a range of characters as Sean Penn, and probably has made better career choices than Mr Penn. The results have not always been happy, a 'Brilliant Mind' although well acted was let down by the sentimentality of the movie, he looked at odds with the result, I think his performance had more truth than the film. Here he is in full command, a confident performance, as was Paul Bettany's performance as the surgeon, both difficult parts calling on a wide range of emotions.The screenplay was a delight, witty and crackling stuff, it avoided the obvious trap of creating a pastiche of the period, just well written English.An underrated movie on the IMDb in my opinion</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep thinking throughout the movie but especially during the first 30 minutes that this movie was like an old Star Trek episode. Remember the episode where the Enterprise meet the starship with a clocking device and an equally talented captain? This movie seems like the same plot. Crowe has the inferior ship but is determined to best the French ship by his "captain tricks". Crowe even sounds like Shatner especially in the scene where he is at the table telling the joke. I kept waiting for him to call the doctor "bones".anyway I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would and I give it 7 out of 10.Small spoilerAt least Crowe did not catch the French Commander and leave him on a deserted island. We would have the sequel the "wraith of Jacque" or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although only winning two out of the ten academy awards nominated for the movie, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is my absolute favorite. The determination, the battles, the locations, and the entire ship itself is pure perfection. Leading the ship "Surprise" is post-captain Jack Aubrey, a fierce, determined captain set out to follow the French privateer "Acheron" to either destroy it, or take it as a prize. Aubrey is accompanied by his best friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a man who is opposite Jack. He is resourceful and philosophical compared to Jack's need to get the ship. Fondly called Lucky Jack by his crew, he engages the Acheron at the beginning of the movie, which includes the loosing of his rudder and the need to pull his oat into the heavy fog. The rest of the movie is the determination of Jack to get this ship and take it back to England as a prize. Peter Weir masterfully directs the movie on the boat, and on location in the Galapagos. My new favorite movie, as it will be for the next few years. 5 stars from over here!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"One Of The Best Films Of 2003"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminds me an era when Director's and Producers wanted to make an epic, didn't matter what the cost was, they just wanted to make a good film that both excites you and makes you think. Russell Crowe gives his most daring performance in years, fans of the O'Brien books thought he couldn't do a real man's performance, he was known as dreamy Russell before now. Crowe is not only being compared to Tom Hanks , but compared to the greatest actors of our time, like Tom Cruise and Sean Penn, and now he's being placed in the category of Marlon Brando and Peter O' Toole. He not only brought back the sandle movies, but now he's bringing back the swash bucklers, wow.THE PLOTThe film is about CPT. Jack Aubrey(known as lucky jack), and his sidekick the doctor(Paul Bettany). They embark on a journey to hunt down an enemy ship, but this isn't the test, this is a journey of finding one's self and coming together to conquer their fears."Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" is an incredible film that will entrance you into the ocean and put you into the minds of the men and CPT. Jack Aubrey. But something is missing, Paul Bettany, he's great in this film but he doesn't have the same intensity that he had in "A Beautiful Mind", or maybe he's not sopose to. Even with that flaw, this is still an acheivement, and nothing can stop in the way of the new rein of actors, and I hope to see more of this cast including Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany.I give this film ****(out of 4 stars).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely deserves a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I would like to point out that I am not Ray Evans, that is just a part of my e-mail ID. I am a female in her 30s! The first thing that struck me about this film is that it is not "romantic" - I don't mean lack of love interest (all male cast), but that it doesn't really contain any clichéd shots of men in white frilly shirts with glinting white teeth. With one or two exceptions they are ordinary, grubby, and have wild hair and bad teeth - just as it would have been. The two leading characters (Crowe/Bettany) have a very close, yet sometimes difficult relationship. They are very different, both in personality and stature (sturdy Crowe / tall and almost delicate Bettany), but seem to be of equal intelligence. There were some good demonstrations of just how difficult a job being Captain was - the chain of command MUST be observed to avoid chaos and mutiny, yet Capt Aubrey's motives and decisions are questioned at times.From an historical point of view I found it most interesting and would imagine that it was very accurate. The appalling injuries the crew suffered, the stresses and strains of dwindling supplies and close proximity of each other, not to mention the battles and loss of close friends. There were some fantastic shots of the ship in full sail and it was always interesting to observe the interior and exterior of the ship and the genius of the men who designed and built them. There is also the sharp contrast of the simple wooden platters and utensils used by the crew, and then shots of Captain Aubrey and his officers dining at a polished table with candles, silverware and wine glasses. Despite these differences however, all the crew, irrespective of birth and rank were all in equal danger and would defend each other to the death. It was also good to hear the commands being shouted in "nautical speak" as it should be. It was not over done, and you could generally understand it all. There was also some good demonstrations of the difficulties faced by some of the officers and what happens if any signs of weakness or uncertainty come to the surface.Overall, I felt that this film was almost a "taster" of what is to come. There is plenty of scope for the development of the relationships amongst the Captain and the crew, and there are many of the novels still to go, so hopefully we will get another installment soon. Despite the presence of Russell Crowe, I do not think this film is particularly a "woman's film" by today's standards, but if you like good (but not glorified) action/violence with thunderous sound, and enjoy historical sagas, then this film is for you whether man or woman. It definitely deserves a sequel!As an afterthought - I have this film on DVD, and if you watch the extra features it really does make you appreciate the time and effort of some amazing people who help to create all the "illusions" of battle, stormy seas and sound effects etc. As DVDs go, this one is definitely worth the money!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing Cliffhanger in the cinema and being blown away by the cinematography. On video it was just a formulaic action flick. I suspect Master and Commander is one of these sorts of films, meant to be seen in large-screen format. The film has everything except for the curious fact that not much actually happens, it's a bit like that phrase of when someone talks a lot but says little. A film that recreates 19th century oceans and naval warfare so well can't really be faulted, I'll just add that Master and Commander is more of a small-time film than I was led to believe.</fullReview>

There is so much "meat" in it that it is easy to miss important tidbits the first time.I almost felt as though I were on an early eighteenth century ship fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. How apropos that the French are the enemy! The movie is based upon two of the novels of Patrick O'Brien. Having read several of them, I know that Russell Crowe's characterization of the courageous, sometimes blustering "lucky" Jack Aubrey is accurate.Definitely a 4-star film--one of the best of the year.</fullReview>

I am not sure what people are looking for or expecting in a movie but "Master and Commander", offers great acting, a good solid script, well drawn and interesting characters, good action, outstanding photography and a true depiction of life on a 1800 English ship of war. That being said, I find this movie one of the best I have ever seen and I do not make that judgment lightly. The ending could have been stronger and I can only assume that the director was leaving a starting place for sequel.

		<fullReview>This film is very interesting if you like looking for what went wrong. It has a great cast, director, a beautiful enviroment, and awesome special FX... But there is something missing. I am not sure what it is, but something is not right about this film. I have some ideas, though. first: the characters.. there is no sense of depth in any of the characters. they don´t tell anything about then, like where did they came from, and what they want. This fact can explain my other thought on this film: it looks like a chapter of a much longer story, like it started from the middle and did not come to an end. That may be why this film looks so long, without any strong characters and goals, its never clear where the story might end. this could be a good thing, but not in this case.. it just makes the film a somewhat unpredictable, but also uninteresting. To sum up, I would say that this film is not worth it, I would rate it as a 5/10, just because of Russel Crowe and his great performance (as usual) and some of the action sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Seamen of Mad King George</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't root for the sailors in "Master and Commander". Why? Because they were the sailors under Mad King George, or George III of England. The same George III that America fought during the Revolutionary War from 1775-1783. And the same George III who burned Washington D.C. in 1812! This story takes place in 1805, at that time England was an enemy of the US, an enemy to be feared. And yet somehow, the English are the "good guys" in all this. And we're supposed to cheer for them. Give me a break! And the French -- the new "Germans" -- are the bad guys. The same French that helped us win the Revolutionary War. The same French that in 1803 sold the US the Louisiana Purchase! And yet these are supposed to be the bad guys? Because they didn't support the war in Iraq or something? Will the French take the place of the Germans in being the new stock movie villains? Will they start selling "Freedom Fries" at movie theatres now?Even worse was watching a portly Russell Crowe waddle around wearing a costume that he must have been stuffed or sewed into. He could barely fit through the doorways in some scenes, and not because he was too tall, but too wide. Paul Bettany's performance may have been the only saving grace in this picture. Yes, "Master" is beautifully shot, but so was "Last Samurai," and both "Master" and "Samurai" suffer from cliched scripts and cardboard characters. I'm surprised they didn't have the French sailors talk with German accents!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Weir is a director who selects very carefully all the projects he takes. It comes as no surprise that he was the right man to bring the Patrick Obrian's novels to the movies. He proves that he was up to the challenge with this latest venture. This is the film that keeps the essence of the texts adapted for this picture, as Mr. Weir makes a very close account of the English dominance in the high seas.The selection of Russell Crowe to play Jack Aubrey is a happy one. This actor makes the viewer believes he is the commander of his ship and that he is in full control of his vessel and his crew. Jack Aubrey is a man that has been around and served his country under Nelson. On the other hand, this hard man of the oceans shows a soft side no one would believe. He is seen as a partner of Dr. Stephen Maturin playing their favorite music, something no one would imagine him capable of doing.As the other principal on the film, Paul Bettany is a capable match to Russell Crowe. Mr. Bettany is a different kind of actor than Mr. Crowe, but his presence in the film is invaluable as his compassion for the wounded sailors and his interests in discovering many exotic things during his travels.The battle scenes are very vividly staged. At times we had to avert our eyes on certain parts where the wounded are being treated. The special effects are splendid, but the real winner is that vast expanse of water so friendly, but yet, so cruel to the men who dare sail the rough seas during a time of war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am writing this while i am still watching the movie, which, I guess, explains enough what I think about it.Peter Weir is one of the best directors I have ever seen. His movies are almost always profound. He is an incredible thinker. I wish I could meet the guy one day and have a good chat over coffee.I see his detail in M&amp;C, but not the story. His story telling is not to the level I anticipate from him. I can only blame the script. Still, I know that life on the ocean is tough, and God knows how humans handled it then. It's a very hard life, and we have a lot to respect such people for. Perhaps this is Peter Weir's point. Given a different source, and perhaps some freedom, I am sure he would have done much better. It does help when scripts are not very obvious.For the record, ocean sailing is not easy. To think what we carry in vessels is nothing to what they dealt with. Mini cities.The ocean is a very alien space for people. When it's peaceful, it's a amazing, and when she's wild, batten down, stay on deck, and hang on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a typical case of 'you'll either love it or hate it'. I for one certainly didn't liked this movie a whole lot but I can understand how to somebody else this movie might seem like a dream coming true, if you're a fan of sea adventures."Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" actually isn't a long movie (138 minutes) but still it feels like an 3 hour+ movie. Reason for this is the storytelling. The movie is slow and basically most of the movie is about the characters talking and having diner aboard and in between they have some battles on the sea. I didn't found to be the story terribly appealing but like I said before if you're interested in this kind of historical stuff this is simply a must see for you. I feel that don't that a movie set almost entirely on the sea is that interesting and appealing to watch. The only movie that ever has succeeded in creating a good and interesting story set almost entirely on the sea is "Das Boot". The movie is well crafted and has some wonderful cinematography and a suiting musical score. The atmosphere is great and wonderfully dark and realistic at times. So visually there is very little wrong with this movie.There are some good battle sequences, with good sound-effects and visual effects but those moments are not good enough to make the movie a must see, or an interesting watch.The movie would had been better for me if it had some better characters in it. I still don't exactly know who all those characters were and what drove them. The only character that are truly deepened out a bit are the characters played by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany, on which the movie mainly focuses. The characters could had made the movie more interesting to follow but instead it remains nothing more than a missed opportunity.Paul Bettany was really superb in this movie. Yes, even better as Russell Crowe, who also was perfectly cast in the movie. The movie has a good supporting cast but their characters aren't really interesting for the story.It most certainly isn't a bad movie but it's a long sit that isn't always interesting enough to follow.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILER WARNING - THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***This film, while technically excellent, was a big disappointment to me. Acting, directing, cinematography, sets - all were flawless. The look and feel of the film was senational, and the interplay between the Captain and the Doctor, and the surreptitious "struggle" for the "soul" of the young Midshipman (warrior or scholar?) was terrific and engaging.My biggest complaint was the ending. Without giving too much away (for anyone who missed my spoiler warning above), what on Earth happened? I was expecting another half an hour of story, at least, as the chase began...and the credits started rolling.Perhaps it's that I've not read any of the novels, but I would expect a film to either tie up its loose ends, or be overtly part of a series of films (such as with the Lord of the Rings trilogy - Fellowship of the Ring ended in media res but it was *expected* to do so because we knew it was part 1 or 3).I can only give "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" 3 out of 5, despite its technical brilliance.</fullReview>

The film begins with a short battle, ok seems interesting. I was then fooled into 2 hours of seamen singing songs, crude surgical procedures and useless plot material. Perhaps one major error in this film was neglecting to develop any of the French vessels crew. Just having a "phantom" boat being the enemy doesn't quite do it. This film could have been many things, a "how to" rebuild a 19th century ship. Not a terrible film overall, almost there though. Acting was solid, I bet the script looked better on paper. Maybe we should change the title to Master and Explorer, it could have been an adventure change the plot a little but you can't disguise this thing as an action packed military film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein. Market forces sometimes twist and break things, even when they have promise. The promise is here: Weir has the ability to create life from the environment. He did so masterfully in `Picnic,' one of the most haunting films of all time. You can see that as well in `Fearless' and `Mosquito.' Ridley Scott does this well in `White Squall,' which was sort of a warmup for `Master.' Crowe has one magical power as an actor: the ability to project himself into the next scene. The books have something of a following, and quite apart from their Harlequin values, they are accurate so far as many facts about shipboard life and operations. So you can see the greenlight: battlescenes, shipboard (and some historical) details, and some attractive characters. Unfortunately, these simple values (battles, authenticity, characters) - undoubtedly micromanaged from the top - don't map well to the peculiar and valuable strengths of Crowe and Weir. Lacking that chance at meaningful art, this film must be judged purely on the simple values the studio emphasizes. Unfortunately, the characters resemble their bookbourne origins as cartoons, and the action scenes are ordinary and studiosafe. The only possible redeeming value might be in the skill with which they evoke shipboard life. Unfortunately, I saw this the same day I saw `The Return of Martin Guerre,' which may be the gold standard for a story shoehorned into an excellent travelogue of the past. `Guerre' went into the past and discovered a story. `Master and Commander' engineers a modern story and cloaks it in trappings from the past. What I saw seemed authentic enough. But it omitted so much else that the world was never fully defined. We had just facts, and among those, a cello and specimen collection seemed as large as obscene scrimshaw. I understand why they would have avoided the long-sanctioned (in the British navy) practice of homosexual `sea-relief,' the complex, really esoteric longlived superstitions, and the many-layered class system. They would have unduly captured the viewer. But to omit carving, knotting, singing (except for one lame scene) the `art of sleep?' To have no tattoos except on some fingers? To avoid the amazingly inventive swearing? To have the clothes so clean and the officer's teeth so white? There is a tradition of veracity in sea films, beginning with `Down to the Sea in Ships' which involved a real whaling crew (and is worth seeing). The books miss the mark by overly simplifying and romanticizing the environment to host a simple melodrama. This film does too.

		<shortDescription>Half-Baked Fare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Weir is one of my all-time favorite filmmakers. 'The Truman Show' is my favorite film, also loved 'Witness' and 'Dead Poets Society'. His magnum opus, 'Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World' has some breath-taking Cinematography and Weir's marvelous direction, but where it falters is it's writing. The Screenplay gets monotonous and begins to bore.'Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World' takes place during the Napoleonic Wars. The Hero played by Russell Crowe gets attacked by it's rival, and so he decides to track them down with his Army. This is the basic plot, which begins superbly, but becomes monotonous 60-minutes into the film. The writing goes off-track for quite sometime and loses it's viewer interest. The climax also doesn't leave the impact, as expected.Peter Weir's direction is marvelous, yet again. Russell Boyd's Cinematography is, as said, breath-taking. The lens-man's work plays like a trump card in this monotonous fare. The Editing is good.In the acting department, Russell Crowe plays his part with utmost conviction. There is not a single scene where he is off character. Paul Bettany suffers due to weak characterization. James D'Arcy does an okay job. Others fill in the blanks.On the whole, A Half-Baked Fare from One of The Most Talented Filmmakers in Film-Dom Today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great enough to make another</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw and enjoyed this film when it was released before I had read any of the Aubrey/Maturin novels. I've just watched it again on DVD after having read and (even better) listened to Simon Vance or Patrick Tull give the characters human voice in the audiobooks and I like the film far less now.They are called Aubrey/Maturin novels for a reason...Stephen Maturin is a complex and mentally (and sometimes physically) tortured character that either Mr. Bettany could not portray -- I doubt that, he seems like a good enough actor, mad monks withstanding -- or the character's heart was removed in editing the final release. I also think it was a mistake not to have included more romance. We have to do more than toast 'wives and sweethearts' to feel the risks of sudden death are above contrivance. My wife taught me that the best way to think of Aubrey/Maturin stories is as complements to the novels of Jane Austen. Jack and Stephen are the men that those heroines are waiting to come home. I venture to say that the movie would have had a better box office if it had found time to portray Sophie and Diana in the flesh.Ultimately, the movie makers try to stuff too much of a twenty book series into the first of what was obviously meant to be a multi-picture franchise. Does anyone remember getting the DVD preview of M&amp;C:TFSOTW in their Sunday paper before it was released? Felt to me like the film had tested badly and the producers were doing anything they could to find an audience. Peter Weir is too competent a director to have crafted this whole thing with no central story -- so I blame the mishmash that ends up on the screen on studio meddling.Too bad...Mr. O'Brian's books deserved better handling than this. That said, I would probably have spent money to see the next film. Especially, once I had heard that Heath Ledger was to replace Mr. Crowe in a prequel. Now whom could they cast as Maturin to give that character more fire? Shorter in stature - Stephen is supposed to be half Jack's size - less of a pacifist and deadly when required - a Napoleonic Dr. James Bond. Tim Roth would suit if he were younger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe plays an English naval commander in this cumbersomely-named, lavish, but fundamentally straightforward tale of the Napoleonic Wars. It's to director Peter Weir's credit that, despite it's great length, this movie rarely drags, and the detail of life at sea is painstakingly reconstructed (although the common bond of endeavour among the crew is perhaps overdone). But it doesn't really catch fire either, lacking as it does a certain moral complexity; Crowe's character is a hero lacking not only in fatal flaws, but any discernible flaws at all. The beautifully reconstructed ships compensate for the complete (but correct) absence of women in the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The books, I think, are the best novels ever written. O'Brian takes you into that period (the British Royal Navy, 200 years ago), gives you a wealth of detail, touches of delightful humour, and characters you feel you really *know*.All of which makes life difficult for someone wanting to bring the books to the screen.All credit to Peter Weir and the crew behind the camera for taking a lot of trouble to recreate the physical world of a wooden warship in the age of sail ... but all too often, I was left saying things like "Jack Aubrey wouldn't say that", "Maturin wouldn't speak like that" or "Pullings doesn't look like that." And there are plot weaknesses too - the Acheron taking the Surprise off guard, as though she knew exactly where the Surprise would be? There's no suggestion that Jack Aubrey had any kind of rendezvous to meet, so how could the Acheron know? And one of the characters says, of the Acheron's mission, "It could tip the balance in the war," or some such. Rubbish. It is an out of the way mission, to which the Surprise, an out-of-date frigate, can safely be sent. And then, after Jack turns back from his pursuit to help Maturin, he finds that his quarry has turned back too, and it's never explained why.Read the books, by all means, and savour all their richness. Then, by all means, watch the movie for a faithful physical recreation of that world ... but no more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell Crowe plays the captain of a British ship circa 1750 on the hunt for the formidable french man-a-war Acheron. Unfortunately not much happens during the hunt - a crewman gets flogged - they visit the Galapagos islands and look at the tortoises - the ship hits a weak-long windless spell - the captain plays his violin. All the action occurs near the end and it's very good.To a large extent this movie is a character study of the captain. He is a smart man who employs a number of clever tricks in pursuit of the Acheron. He is an outstanding leader much loved by his crew and a fierce warrior. In fact, the movie lays it on a little too thick for my taste as his only flaw seems to be a fondness for rum. Nevertheless, when the movie is over you say to yourself, now that's how a man should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Nautical Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite his bad boy image, Russell Crowe is an actor for our time. He can integrate a softer side with power in his roles. This is a great adventure with magnificent seascapes and intrigue. The producers went to great length to make the presentation of life aboard the ship true to the period. Many of the seamen were actually children, even officers, who commanded the older, but less educated crew. As with most movies about ships at this time, the claustrophobic nature of the life was always evident. Crowe's character, Captain Aubrey, is duty bound to risk it all, against better "advice." All choices rest with him; it is his ship. The younger actors project an adulation that leads them to overlook their insecurities and latch on to bravery in the face of insurmountable odds. It's a French ship; they have no choice, thought they may die. The special effects are fine. Like so many movies of it's kind, at times the ship seems 400 feet long and at times 40 feet. So much action goes on on deck and above, on the masts. There are also some real human stories as subplots, including that of a young man who rides at the breaking point. The battle scenes are breathtaking. I wonder if there will be a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie fell flat and for only one reason. There was no element of danger involved in the telling of the story. It was billed as an adventure/drama/thriller of a sea story and it just wasn't there. At all. Crowe, a fantastic actor, is left hanging with a plot that isn't gripping and a movie that doesn't supply enough action to keep its viewers attention. Had they added the necessary suspense into this it would have been a slam dunk. But they didn't. So it doesn't go anywhere but do laps around the ocean like the Flying Dutchman. I hope there isn't a sequel and if there is I won't go to see it. Give this film a pass and leave it on the shelf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a crucial logical fault that I believe is overlooked by the average viewer -- which uses a Hollywood cliché quite effectively. It was demonstrated in the movie that unusually good eyesight was a prized thing. In fact, Aubrey congratulates one of the crewmen for seeing a tiny dot on the horizon that turns out to be a ship. The entire finale to the movie hinges on the other ship apparently *not* having anybody with equally good eyesight. Should we really believe that the other ship is duped into believing they are just a harmless trader rather than the ship they have been having deadly duels with?!? Don't you believe their opponent with good eyesight too, would recognize them at, say a mile away and not walk into their trap? It was an entertaining movie, but I don't like the slippery Hollywood cliché at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a terribly disappointing film. A good old swashbuckling fight, true, but the seamanship was so phony it was actually comical. Examples: over and over Crowe caught up with a ship that was clearly described as being the faster of the two. Then off Cape Horn he brings his ship 90 degrees to starboard in a gale wind, and nobody touches a brace or changes the setting of a single sail! Obviously Crowe knew he was making a film for an ignorant audience who had never seen a ship not driven by an engine. In another place the ship was gliding along at about five knots on a smooth sea with all sails hanging loose on the yards, obviously using her diesel engine. Of course it would have been expensive to tie up the ship and wait for a wind, and the film must have had a high shooting budget already. One can understand cutting such corners, but it makes a sea story that is more cornball than memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very realistic look but a boring story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was some what disappointed after seeing this. I was expecting an action film, but it really wasn't that. Russell Crowe was OK, but no where near as good as his last couple of films. The good parts concerned the realistic look of the ship at sea. I don't know if the ship they built for the movie was actual size, but it looked like it. And during the storms, you really felt like it was real. But I would like to know in real life if the crew really walked around barely hanging on to ropes during a storm like that, and yet not get swept overboard.The plot is supposed to deal with Captain Aubrey, who sails for England, as he pursues a French ship that early in the movie surprised attacked. So, Aubrey chases the ship all around the ocean and to the Galapagos Islands. The Islands proved to be a boring side plot because the ship's doctor wants to study the animals there, but they don't have time to spend more than a day or two there, and he gets mad. That was boring. So at the end, there is a very choppy cut of the battle between the two ships. I didn't like the way it was edited. You couldn't see anything. I guess they did that since is was pg-13.FINAL VERDICT: I only recommend it if you like Russell Crowe, like I do. While it wasn't a great film, Crowe is a good actor and some of the scenes of what's life like on a ship like that were OK. Just don't expect a great story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To supply more than what has already been stated would be simple repetition. The cinematography and scene direction superb.The battle scenes were really well done. Russell Crowe brought a good sense of what Lucky Jack Aubrey was. He really tried. To Crowe's credit, he really does that well.Albeit after working on the water, Crowe's version would come across as a bit of a milquetoast. Yet at the end of the day, I still feel someone else could have been cast in the role. If one doesn't think so, then compare Jürgen Prochnow's portrayal of Capt.-Lt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock in Das Boot. Then sit back and compare the two movies.Master and Commander also suffered from plot disjointness which made no naval sense. Any good French privateer wanting real prizes, would be heading for Madasgar, or the Seychelles. Even Tahiti made no real sense in naval terms.Knocking off whalers at the Galapagos with your top ship of the line makes absolutely no strategic sense to begin with. Suppose these whalers shipped out of Portsmouth, well it would make more sense to stick the bow on station outside Portsmouth. Further the Galapagos is one fifth of the earth's circumference away from the Horn. Heck of a journey for a ship of that period.There was nothing there for a top ship of the line. A schooner could have done the same thing against whalers more efficiently. And any admiral would have given such orders.And there are tons of places to lay in wait such as the Falklands if your into whaling, Jamaica or Trinidad if your into money. Or off the coast of North America in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.So I didn't buy the premise of the movie. Further at the end, it sucked. I cannot believe for a minute that a Captain, any Captain, would break escort when two ships having undergone pitched battle. So the ending dropped the ball so to speak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a lot of attention to detail in the production of this film, but the use of tree-dwelling green (common) iguanas from South or Central America to represent Galapagos iguanas was a major error that impacted the credibility of the film. Related animal shots as seen through the telescope from the ship were also hokey, and one shot of a swimming marine iguana actually appeared twice in this film (same footage!).Many people have noticed the fact that the relationship between the ship's commander and the ship's doctor could not carry the film. In fact, this relationship goes nowhere. The commander behaves inconsistently, letting a man die to continue his pursuit but then suddenly going back to the Galapagos when the ship's doctor is injured. It just didn't make sense.The best things about this film are related to the realism of many of the action scenes at sea, which happen quickly. Key areas that should have been improved substantially to make this a great film are: 1) Total lack of development of the character of the French adversary (huge lost opportunity here), 2) Lack of developed or adequate sense of time and place during a very long ocean journey (quick transition between tropical latitudes and the southern ocean), 3) Lack of clear explanation to the audience (or to sailors in the audience) of positioning relative to the prevailing winds during each combat sequence, and 4) Lack of depth in the main character. It was also hard to understand how the French could miss the gun ports and overall structure of the vessel when it pretended to be a whaler. Would British officers really be this young, or is this based on an adventure story for young boys?Some of these weaknesses may have been due to limitations in the works of fiction from which it was based (I have not read these). The shooting the albatross scene and the becalmed at sea scenes were right out of the Ryme of the Ancient Mariner. The Galapagos material was reminiscent of the Voyage of the Beagle by Charles Darwin, including Darwin's interest in beetles. Nonetheless, as a whole, it was a very good action film, just not a great one.</fullReview>

Now, having gotten that off my chest, I thought this movie was good, worth seeing, but not Best Picture-nominee caliber. It's a good thing the plot was simple because I couldn't understand what was being said half the time, there were way too many characters, and why is every sea captain named Jack anyway? There is no real character study here-no explanation as to why Jack Aubrey is so hung up on this-so it falls far short of what was obviously its' inspiration, Moby Dick and the psychotic Capt. Ahab. The only reasonably well developed character is the naturalist Stephen, who doubles as the ship's doctor and vacillates between being a dove and a hawk. Great period set and you can actually feel the winds blowing and water coming over the bow, but otherwise it's really only a so-so movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie With One Major Weakness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******** SOME MILD SPOILERS ******* Master and Commander is an adventure on the high seas. It gives us the depiction of a cat and mouse game between the captains of two ships. It's a good movie with one weakness. The major weakness of this movie is that it ultimately looks at every character in an analytical way. The result is that I admired the characters but never became attached to them. This might not be bad news for a character study, but it isn't particularly beneficial to an adventure movie. The perspective of Master and Commander is from the captain and crew of one ship. The captain is played by Oscar winner Russell Crowe. There is tremendous attention to detail and the actors give marvelous portrayals of their characters. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany (together again from the movie A Beautiful Mind) shine as do several other actors especially the actor who played the young officer who lost his arm. It is interesting to see what the quality life of the sailors was like in that time period. Beautiful photography and lavish sets abound.There are numerous men aboard the ship living in tight quarters and the men from different walks of life with some being officers, one a doctor and the rest crew men on the ship. This naturally leads to some conflict and tension. For adventure movie lovers, Master and Commander is a good choice. You'll probably be satisfied although not swept away (no pun intended).There is another difficulty, however, for this movie. I believe it is overshadowed by Pirates of the Caribbean which is a tough movie to compete with. There will be inevitable comparisons, and Pirates of the Caribbean will come up the winner.I rate this movie a C. It was better during the second viewing and I think time will be kind to this movie. </fullReview>

But after Beethoven found out that Napoleon crowned himself emperor of France he disassociated the symphony with him. It supposedly irritated Beethoven that Napoleon did that.Anyhow, it would of been a far better soundtrack if they incorporated Beethoven's music instead of music from the baroque era.Another thing that didn't seem realistic was that they never showed the ships crew bathing, cutting hair, shaving, etc. It just seemed too clean and orderly. I would have expected to see a lot more illness, shivering, and downright scuzziness and filth in those type of conditions.The film was very beautiful though, and I really liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read all of the 21 O'Brien Aubrey/Maturin books, and enjoyed all of them immensely. The movie did not even come close to the excitement, historical interest, or characterizations of any one of the books.First of all, Aubrey was a huge, red-headed man, and Maturin a dark, somewhat sinister-looking man. Aubrey was a total extrovert and inveterate punster. He went into action with no hesitation whatsoever. He read the Articles of War to his crew daily. Crowe played him as brooding,introverted, and hesitant, only once showing the punster side. Maturin would never argue with Aubrey about the relative priority of natural science and naval duty, because Maturin was an intelligence agent for the Admiralty, for one thing, and was bound by the same sense of duty as Aubrey. Maturin would never whine about anything, much less about Aubrey not keeping a promise. Absurd.The books spend as much time ashore as at sea, and are novels of English manners as compelling as those of Jane Austin. None of that was even touched on in the movie.Looked at on its own, the filmed story was trivial and digressive because it tried to string together unrelated incidents from many different books. Many of the characterizations -- such as Killick and Pulling -- relied on prior knowledge from reading the books which would be missed by those who had not read them. Similarly some details such as the serving of plum duff, would be missed by non-readers of the books.The photography was outstanding, and the ships and costumes beautiful. Some of the sailing scenes were awe-inspiring. But that hardly made up for the weaknesses.2.5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quick impressions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the DVD last night. Some quick impressions.1. Judging from all the superlative reviews and Oscar nominations, the only conclusion to reach is that all film reviewers are rabid Anglophiles who worship the Union Jack. Given that the Royal Navy burned down the White House a few years after these events were supposed to take place, it seems odd that this film expects us to be cheering for them.2. The only way to make this story interesting was to have the end be what it was trying to be, a titanic struggle between good and evil. But we never meet the French captain and so cannot hate him. In fact, he appears to be a handsome French aristocrat who is so much of a gentleman that his dying request was to hand over his sword to Russel Crowe. So there is NO story here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big movie about a little battle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You certainly believe you have had a taste of battle life on the seas after watching this movie. But, it does leave you with the feeling... so? I mean the battle was not historically significant, and, as it turned out, was just one in a series of many more to come. So is doesn't seem important for them to have gone through it all. Russell Crowe jumps around with his character a bit, first the supreme commander and later a silly juvenile, then back to commander again. Not an uplifting film, but interesting if you like that kind of high-seas-battle-thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mixed bag but much to recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The odd thing about `Master and Commander' is that its strengths and its weaknesses both seem to derive from one and the same source: its subtlety. Based on the novels by Patrick O'Brian, `Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is a seafaring adventure tale more notable, perhaps, for its straight-ahead action sequences than for its finer elements of characterization and conflict. O'Brian has certainly given writer John Collee and writer/director Peter Weir plenty to work with here, starting with an Ahab-type main character named Jack Aubrey, a British sea captain in 1805 who becomes obsessed with overtaking and attacking a much larger French man-of-war ship that defeated his vessel in battle off the coast of South America. Aubrey, albeit a man of sensibility and compassion, often endangers the lives of his men in an effort to complete his `mission,' even though he is routinely challenged by cooler heads on the ship to acknowledge the fruitlessness of the endeavor and to set sail for home an honorably defeated man.Aubrey is nowhere near as neurotic and delusional as Ahab, and that perhaps is the biggest problem with the film. Aubrey, for all his bluster, is really not all that interesting a character. Although we can see where the filmmakers are trying to take us, they never seem able to crack open Aubrey's mind to help us get inside and learn what really makes him tick. One thing about Ahab is that we always knew why the stakes were so personal for him. With Aubrey we don't really understand why he is so single-mindedly set on getting his target. Perhaps the confrontations he has with his crewmen are just a trifle too low-keyed and underplayed to reveal very much about his character. `Master and Commander' may be a more realistic yarn than `Moby Dick' but, in this case at least, subtlety comes with a hefty price. An adventure film set on the high seas needs to hit more dramatic high points than `Master and Commander' is eventually able to muster. Having said all that, it seems a bit perverse and paradoxical to now point out that `Master and Commander' also draws its greatest strength from the fact that it doesn't rely on cheap melodramatics to achieve its power. Thanks to outstanding direction, set design and special effects, we really feel as if we are on one of those early 19th Century sailing vessels, a feeling that is enhanced even more in the battle scenes which are executed with a stunning eye for believability and detail. And there are many moments of silent intensity particularly between Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon and resident naturalist, obviously modeled on Charles Darwin (though 30 years earlier than Darwin), who can't understand why Aubrey has to go off fighting Bonaparte's forces when all Maturin wants is to be able to go traipsing all over the Galapagos Islands in search of new and fascinating faunal specimens (at least Darwin didn't have to contend with some pesky war when he was off developing his Theory of Evolution). The subtle interplay between these two characters provides for some of the most gripping moments in the film. Russell Crowe manages to convey both authority and compassion in his role of Aubrey, and Paul Bettany creates a compelling foil for him in Maturnin. Aubrey is also up against the superstitious nature of his disgruntled crew who attribute much of their troubled journey to the curse laid upon them by a vindictive god (vide `The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'). The filmmakers also do an effective job exploring the internal decision-making process a person in authority often has to go through in weighing the good of the group against the good of the individual. The fact that Aubrey isn't a raving lunatic (like Ahab) lessens the drama but heightens the verisimilitude of the piece.`Master and Commander' is a bit of a close call for me, but taken as a whole, its virtues ultimately outweigh its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good but not fabulous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good story with developing characters, nice acting and interesting interactions... But only of special interest to those who like constant battle content, seafaring talk, weather changes and guts and gore of extreme medical care(and very unrealistic I might add - I worked with surgeons for 7 years and most of the outcomes are ridiculous). Overall, there is not much in the way of clever turns of plot or much to keep the viewer engaged. The most suspenseful and interesting parts are (1) when Aubrey decides to disguise the ship as a whaler and (2) how they discovered and studied the Galapagos Islands, famous for the origin of Darwin's "Origin of Species" theory. The lessons they learned are important and inspiring but not earth-shattering or especially new or deep. In short, the film is good but mostly as a historical study and not even in the top 10 of the year. I rate it 6 or 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's rum, there's the lash - but where is the sodomy?! Master and Commander is a great rollicking movie - but there is an emptiness at its heart. A bunch of men cooped up in a tiny space for months or years at a time - and no sex of any kind? No relationships - whether `bad' or `good'? The result is that where the emotional centre of the movie should have been there is instead a parade of not very well acted sea shanties and drunken dinners. Weir sprinkles black faces amongst the cast - they do nothing. The way science and racism were intertwined is ignored. I don't believe that Weir could have been unaware of the relationship between enlightenment science, homophobia, racism and the frequency of homosexual relationships at sea. Weir has sailed around what should have been the heart of the movie. A great missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok I saw a preview for this film when I went to see Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and thought it looked like it would be worth my 10 bucks for a movie ticket.... well I kinda want my money back. The preview I saw showed lots of action and too me looked like a great movie filled with action and an interesting story. You know set in the times of Napolean, setting on a boat. I love movies that revolve around the ocean. So i went and saw it and by the end of the first hour I was completely disinterested. The only action in the movie was in the preview. The rest was just drawn out diolouge between Crowe and the rest of his shipmates. I rated this film 6 out of 10 because I know a good technical film when I see it and this one is one of them but the boring story is what kept it from getting any higher. Crowe had no emotion in this movie whatso ever and hope to god the academy does not nominate him for this. The only actor that i think should be nominated is Paul Bettany. His character was really the only one that interested me and kept me from falling asleep. Yes I do understand that the Academy likes these types of movies and probably will give this film a boatload of nominations (pardon the pun) but the only ones it deserves are technical ones and and perhaps Paul Bettany for supporting actor.In Conclusion if you haven't seen this movie... wait till it comes out on video...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite good. Assumes that the audience is paying attention. Can tell that it comes from a [book] series since this movie starts and stops rather than begins and ends. Consists of a series of seafaring scenarios told while the overarching storyline keeps the movie moving towards a stopping point. Different supporting roles rotate into the limelight and are dealt with dramatically. While this might not sound great, it works well here. This movie is directed by Peter Weir, afterall. Lots of seafaring action, some of which actually makes sense! Much of the dialogue is muffled, but it, nevertheless, has its own compass and logical direction. Crowe will get a nomination out of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly let me say that I enjoyed the movie. It depicted as near as possible the conditions on board a British man of war in the early 19th century. However, even though it was adapted from a couple of Patrick O'Brian's books, it was almost plotless. Apart from the opening and closing battles, almost nothing happened. Very little was explained and at the close of the movie, most of the characters remained anonymous. To those people who had no interest in the Napoleonic era, the movie would have seemed deadly dull. It would appeal to die hard O'Brian fans who would have seen the O'Brian characters come to life. American audiences, raised on a steady diet of wham bang action and special effects would be bored silly. Still, it was streets ahead of the 'Hornblower' series which was full of historical inaccuracies and very much misrepresented the fictional Hornblower character. Personally, I felt that Crowe, even though he made a good attempt at the role of Aubrey, was miscast - as was Paul Bettany as Maturin. I saw Gerard Depardieu as being the closest to the physical Aubrey, Stephen Rea as a perfect Maturin, and Peter Postlethwaite as a sublime Killick. Kevin Whately would have made a very good Tom Pullings. Oscar winning material? perhaps. I rate this 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually this was an impressive film and Russel Crowe's screen presence held my attention throughout. However, I felt that the film could have benefited by also showing the story from the French crew's point of view. A battle of wills between the French and English captains would have really brought the whole thing to life (see Pacino / De Niro in Heat).Judging by the box office success I guess there will be a sequel and hopefully they can add a bit more "spice" to the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of this film was done very well, particularly the opening 15 - 20 mins. I was hoping for a Das Boot gripper, but after the opening, it didn't really deliver, except as an education into life in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars. Maybe readers of Patrick O'Brian will say that's exactly what the books are so we shouldn't expect anything else. I don't know. Considering the story made a point of the hardships a 18th-19th century sailer had to suffer at sea, I expected the men to be tough and gritty, no nonsense types. But unfortunately they were no more than the old stereotypes we are used to seeing in any movie made about sailors of wooden ships made in the last 100 years. The end came as a bit of anti-climax, as it all ended so quickly and easily. This movie is essentially about one ship chasing another ship, but the motivation for the chase lacked weight. There didn't seem to be any great reason for them to be after this ship, apart from the captain saying they had to. The film would have benefited going deeper into the psychology of the captain as he becomes obsessed with defeating the French ship, creating more conflict with his fellow sailors as he risks their lives for his own personal desire to win. What we get here is a cardboard cutout of a heroic captain from some kind of 1950s comic book. But maybe that's what Patrick O'Brian's books are like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone must know, this is the most visually breath taking films out there. Alot of work went into this and that kept my attention more than anything else in the film.So why did I snooze? The length? No way, I sat through very awake and with great interest JFK and Fanny and Alexander (uncut) in the theaters. The acting? Well, it was nice but in the words of a fellow poster, "..and the point is?". I just didn't care about these folks. And besides, there are going to be more "visually breath taking films" to see. Here's the rub: can you provide a story that keeps one's interest along with this? This one, for me, errr--didn't. Ya gotta surround yourself with the characters, story and situations and beyond the style, this one didn't.Yeah, its my fault. I didn't read the books, nor did I care about the characters before I walked in allowing me to develop an interest as I sat there -- but the ships and the waves and the battle were wonderful...but the lack of the men "HEAVING"....it was a man-ly movie made for man-ly men! Sorry, I'm just not a man-ly gal.But...I cannot WAIT for this film to come out on DVD. I hope its box screen, and will look just fabulous on my Plasma TV! But a $10 movie going experience? Not for me.Honestly, it could be due to my attention span because as I watched the film I expected Fabio to come out (remember him from those covers of books like this gals?!?!)....he just seemed to have a place that was deleted from this film..on purpose I think...he didn't need to say anything but just to be there with all that style..and the wind blowing through his hair...wearing the same stuff Russell Crowe does...yes...just to add to the style of the film...and to keep me... awake.Master and Commander is one of the best of the stylish films done this year, But that's about it. I could have waited to see this on A&amp;E or PBS. Without Crowe as the lead, a big budget and Mr. Weir, this film would have gone the way of "Art House" releases, make no mistake.</fullReview>

Which time?Was the enemy ship in proper position to do damage to the helm of the Surprise? How fast could a ship pull along side another, given the speed of vessels in this movie (knots? Km?)Who repaired the Surprise? Where did they get the raw materials? Where did the new hats come from? There's a parable here somewhere.Under what physical conditions did the good doctor first observe a warship?Why do you need to form a band of Marines on such a ship as the Surprise? Like, what new function would they possibly dream up to have on an 1806 vessel?Did you think the smoke disguise looked like a burning tower?Where were the French badguys, on the overtaken vessel? I didn't see any French. I saw some somewhat middle eastern looking guys.War is the lesser of two evils is a REAL BAD PUN...Commerants are the highest flying birds we know of.It would probably not be a good thing to release biological specimens on the opposite side of the Galapogos island.A Non-indigenous beetle gets a ride from Galapogos to Ireland. Now, what could be a consequence of that, i wonder.Did anyone notice that this movie was an entire parable? Watch the hats. Find actual evidence of a warship. Whether based on fiction or historically correct (see dipshit review in RS), THERE WAS NO ENEMY WARSHIP. WATCH the movie.Regards, engineer bored of action flicks</fullReview>

The movie presented a series of beautiful pictures. Other than that, the only thing I can only say is that it has been the most uncomfortable experience I have ever had in a movie theatre. The plot didn't get interesting until the last 15 minutes of the movie; the first two hours were full of long gaps and scattered pieces that don't relate to each other, although some of them were heart-warming and dramatic on their own. The characterization of this film failed Russell Crowe; he was made less a character than other roles such as the physician and the little boy. I fought alongside Maximus in the colosseum and followed John Nash's thought when he wrote on the math window in Princeton's library, but this time, I was sitting in the theatre, sickened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the Napoleonic wars a British warship commanded by Russel Crowe's character is mysteriously attacked by a French warship. The captain who had no idea that this was coming takes it as a blow to his ego and despite the ship and the morale of his men being damaged, decides to go after his newfound nemesis.Seems fun? Not really. The film moves along at a very slow pace and doesn't really manage to truly grab your attention. The characters, though decently acted, are weak with Crowe definitely not giving one of his better performances. He just doesn't have enough things to work with to make himself interesting. Well maybe I can ignore that but what really got on my nerves is that Peter Weir has simply made the whole 138 minute movie into one long stream. The tension, which could have given a lot to the movie is virtually non existent. It makes it seem like being attacked by the most powerful warship in the French navy is no different than having a cup of tea.As for more technical things, it really annoyed me that there was so little music. That too could have added suspense and more life into this dull picture. The cinematography was pretty good, though somewhat difficult to comprehend at times. The ships and costumes of course were excellent and filled with detail. The battle scenes, or what little there was of them were pretty well done but yet again, as seems to be the case with most Hollywood films, confusing and a bit too shaky at parts for one to understand what is going on.All in all not that bad of a film but if you are looking for something along the lines of excitement like Pirates of the Carribbean then this is not your picture.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are platitudes about how great, and lucky, a naval commander Jack Aubrey is; there's chatter about the even greater Nelson (Britain's famous naval hero, who died in the Napoleonic Wars). Based on Patrick O'Brian's novels, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is fine at romanticizing the sea, shipmen, boats and war, and there's adequate appreciation for detail. The story, however, is lacking. In the movie, the conversations between Aubrey and the ship's surgeon (played by Paul Bettany, who had even more frivolous squabbles with Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind") expose the men's differences and not much more. The captain wants to achieve the glory of Nelson and save Britain from Napoleon; the surgeon wants to achieve the glory of Darwin and go searching for new species in the Galápagos Islands. I don't think cinematography of water, or the lackluster battle scenes were the focus. (In the first battle, Peter Weir takes from "Saving Private Ryan", with Crowe doing the deaf and shocked thing that Hanks did so well.) Overall, I think Weir failed; I wasn't captivated, thrilled, touched or left in wonder or contemplation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, but so boring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems there are quite a lot fans of naval history movies. They liked and will like this film, and I cannot but respect their right to like the genre. As I do not belong to the category, I did not enjoy it at all - on the contrary I found it just boring.Not to be mistaken, this is by no means a bad movie. I can guess that a lot of work was invested in documenting the historical period, the naval rules, life, and battles during the Napoleonic wars. All this deserves salute, but does not save the movie in my opinion. The problem with the film is that it is linear and flat, the characters are from the beginning to the end the same, the action is too thin and too easy to predict to be interesting at all. Russell Crowe plays here what wants to be another great epic character, but what a difference between the complex and memorable Maximus in 'Gladiator' and the role here, without any nuance, any evolution, any surprise. His acting is decent, good even maybe, but even he cannot save the film. Be warned, unless you are a fan of history or naval movies, and despite the money, effects, and research it took to make this film, you may regret the time spent watching it. 6/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MASTER AND COMMANDER : THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD (2003) **** Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy, Edward Woodall, Chris Larkin, Max Pirkis, Jack Randall, Max Benitz, Billy Boyd. Masterful adaptation of the vastly popular books by Patrick O'Brian about the adventures of 19th century British Naval Captain Jack Aubrey (portrayed with stoic nobility to the hilt by Crowe) in his pursuit of an adversarial French vessel during the Napoleonic era while maintaining his crew and ship withstanding the elements, horrible living conditions, skirmishes with rank and the unstable unchartered waters advancing upon them. Director Peter Weir captures the grandiose epic storyline in his adaptation with John Collee by encapsulating the first and tenth book of the novel series that uses a large canvas of valor, sportsmanship and camaraderie when things get rough and ready at the task at hand. Bettany acquits himself as the ship's surgeon and captain's confidante with aplomb. Excellently realized production design by William Sandell incorporates several scaled versions of the ships themselves and impressive moments of fear, trepidation and ultimately courage. One of the year's best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too slow at times but a good tale with solid battle scenes - not as good as has been suggested but still a good adventure story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a skirmish off the coast of Brazil, The HMS Surprise, under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey is left badly damaged by the much bigger French warship The Acheron. Loosing their pursuer in the sea fog, the Surprise undergoes sea repairs in order that they can prepare to reengage the Acheron and prevent it from doing further damage. As tensions among the men rises and the Acheron continues to lurk, Captain Jack plans for a final battle where stealth and cunning must make up for their lack of size and strength.With talk of `Gladiator at sea' and Oscar talk aplenty, I was looking forward to this film quite a bit even if the subject material didn't really appeal to me. I think that it was because I felt I `should' see it, but I never got around to seeing it in the cinema and had to wait until it came out on DVD. I think, in one regard that I did myself out of an experience by missing the battle scenes on a big screen with a sound system that has a higher capacity than my amp and two speakers! The majority of this film is focused on the characters on the Surprise and, as such, it is a rather slow affair that requires patience and may upset those who had come (as I had) with the promise of action and high seas adventure. Of course, you get that as well but in smaller doses than the advertising campaign would have you believe. For me this was not that big a deal although it took me a moment to settle once I realised that it would be this way. The reliance on character makes the acting and the scripting very important - there are few big action scenes and noise to hide behind here! Happily the film bases itself around the relationship between Jack and Dr Maturin, which just about manages to be engaging for the time. The support characters may not have a great deal of flesh on their old sea bones but they do OK and there are just about enough little asides to make us care for the characters. This also has the dual effect of moving us when characters break or are injured, but also it involves us a lot more in the battle scenes and increases the tension.The action scenes are good even if they are so chaotic that it is difficult to really follow the action at times. If the film used CGI then I didn't see it as everything seems so very real - a plus for me in this over digitised world! The direction by Weir is good despite the chaotic action scenes - although in fairness I imagine he meant them to be like that. It is important for the characters that the acting be good and happily it pretty much all is. Crowe is a man's man yet again and he takes the lead with confidence. However he is not as overpowering as he was in Gladiator and he leaves room for his co-stars here. In particular Bettany rises to the call and is good as the doctor. Support is roundly good no matter how good their characters are - they are not all `sea dog' clichés (even if it skates close at times) and the dialogue is good enough to make them seem real whether they have few lines or a few sentences.Overall this is a good film even if it is not as good as the critics and the Oscar buzz led me to believe. The action is great but I think it could be improved by experiencing it on the big screen with a great sound system. The focus on slow build up and characters means that the film stands out from the brainless action movies that will always be produced but the downside is that it requires patience from the audience. So if you're ready for that and not expecting action from pillar to post then this is certainly a high class piece of swashbuckling with good turns from a good cast.</fullReview>

CONS: The action scenes were scattered &amp; confusing because there was a LOT of cameras swinging around quickly giving only glimpses of many of the action scenes.

The movie was recommended to me by my Father who also likes Richard Bolitho books by Alexander Kent. If QE2 is like Admiral Bolitho then I am like her loyal nephew Adam Pascoe whom the Admiral treats like a Son. In my Scence Fiction Wellfleet of Moons, My Moonship makes metal model warships, never the same one twice. Some of the Ancestors of my Grandfather the Creator chosen Messiah King George VI Windsor and I were Viking leaders so it could be interesting to make Viking Longships as well. Eventually Moon 168 will run out of real warships to make but All good things must come to an end. I believe that the Ki Et and Humans are immortal. King Bertie always had target practice with 1 .38. In my Science Fiction the 123 Friendly KI Aliens and 15 Human Artificial Intelligences not counting the Ambassador Joseph Kennedy are called BrushPass 138. I am pleased to say that would include the Artificial Intelligence Computer of Caroline Kennedy the Daughter of JFK. Ambassador Joseph Kennedys AI has to be available to negotiate with any other spacefaring Sentient the Ki Human alliance encounters at some far point in the future. Remember since I represent Love to the KI and my Daughter Julia Ann Ruth Morgan represents Peace to the KI that my Love Fathers Peace and that is Good English.

		<shortDescription>Slight But Worth A Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Weir's early-19th century sea drama (based on the work of beloved writer Patrick O'Brien) feels like a movie that has no real beginning or end--it's as if you've been dropped into the middle of an eight hundred page novel and that the story being told is perhaps more of a subplot. Actually, it seems surprising that there's a plot at all--the novelty in this day and age of a project about early-19th century seafaring is certainly odd enough to forego a storyline. Weir himself appears to recognize the novelty and spends a lot of his time doting on the ship's stateliness or detailing the inhabitants' everyday world (much of which seems to have been lost in the cutting room; there's a scattershot feel to the picture, as if there were too many digressions to fit). Russell Crowe plays the hero, Captain Jack Aubrey, as he chases a French vessel around the South American coast during the Napoleonic era. Crowe plays it safe here--he's on the verge of becoming the new Harrison Ford, a colorless hero who's traded his acting chops for audience adulation. This being a Weir film, there has to be some kind of class warfare and the simmering, antagonistic relationship between the ship's crew and their officers (most of whom are adolescent aristocrats) is examined, although only in fits and starts. (In one of the film's more ethereal moments, one of the young officers is actually driven to suicide.) But Weir somewhat confusingly co-opts his normally sympathetic views of the working class by making Crowe's character loved blindly by his men, a champion they pledge undying loyalty for, even though his obsessions put his crew in harm's way more often than not. Though it's difficult to shake the film's slightness and its lack of focus--it's hard to figure out what it's about, really--it's still worthwhile: in spite of its aspiration to epic greatness, it does manage to retain a sense of intimacy that allows for plenty of opportunities to take it all in and simply observe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually powerful, action however a string of absurdities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: I will discuss some detail of the action.The small British frigate Surprise chases a French privateer bound for the pacific to take British whalers. The privateer pops suddenly out of dense fog and starts immediately firing at the Surprise with deadly accuracy at a distance at which the guns of the Surprise can't bear. I suspect the French had radar for fire control. The Surprise manages to get away in the fog, badly damaged.It turns out that the French sail a frigate of the Constitution class bought from the US. How can they afford what was at the time the most advanced type of frigate and why would the US sell it in the first place? How will they ever make a profit catching whalers? Privateering is a business, you know.Later the officer of the marines wants to shoot an albatross. He performs a wild dance, turning in circles and wildly flailing the gun. He ends up hitting the doctor in the belly.The British finally catch up with the enemy. Since the French will blow them out of the water in a straight fight, they decide to board. So they disguise the Surprise as a whaler. Now that is like disguising a tank to look like a pickup truck. Anyway, captain Aubrey is worried that the French will try to get away once they realize that they are facing the Surprise and decides to cripple them by shooting a mast down. Unfortunately the guns do not have the elevation to do so at boarding distance, so Aubrey runs them out and has the rear wheels removed from the gun carriages. This gives the British just one shot since the guns can't recoil. He also sends the marines (in disguise) up into the rigging so they can take out the French crew. The French do not notice the guns and the men in the rigging and get taken by surprise (pun taken right from the movie).All this is quite ridiculous: Knocking down a mast with just one salvo would be exceedingly lucky, even at close range and anyway, only a couple of feet away are the French, vastly outnumbering the English and a wonderful target for grape shot and chain and all the other nasty stuff one can put into a gun.Whoever wrote the screen play had no clue.The movie ends with a cliffhanger, a sequel is likely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MASTER AND COMMANDER is not a bad movie, and sadly it is not a good movie.I was hoping MASTER &amp; COMMANDER would be GLADIATOR on the high seas. Maximus Decimus Meridas, Commanding General of the Army of the North, now becomes the intense, focused leader of 197 souls aboard a heroic fighting ship!But all of this is missing. The screenplay, direction, and the total lack of dramatic music torpedo this first voyage of the mighty HMS Surprise.General Maximus Decimus Meridas did not have time for fiddle concerts. The Gladiator did not swap jokes and get drunk with the boys. Violin playing Captain Aubrey seems overly distracted while drinking his way across the oceans. Master &amp; Commander lacks steady intensity. When the subplot about natural science begins, the movie stops dead. When the subplot about the jinxed officer begins, the movie stops dead. When the subplot about the ship's busy-body doctor's operation begins, the movie stops dead. The audience is left with far too much spare time.In MASTER, a swear word not allowed on TV is spoken one time. Crusty sailors fight battles against the enemy, and fight with each other. There is a flogging. The older sailors yearn for pretty girls on the distant shore, etc. The salty words spoken are clean enough for TV. Then, the one loan swear word is uttered, and it stands out badly... "Wait folks, here is our required PG-13 moment, @&amp;!$@#, OK, now on with the movie."Take a look at the GLADIATOR -- see the Roman Legions, the Praetoriae, the Felix Regiment, the Centuria -- no kids are seen in military service. Likewise, MASTER &amp; COMMANDER should not be the adventures of Peter Pan. What is believable about the English Navy employing 10 year-olds as officers? It is difficult to believe that hardened 30 year-old sailors would follow the orders of a little kid who is given command. What is with all of the kids in MASTER? Burt Lancaster had no need for little kids aboard his glorious pirate ship. Captain Kirk was the better for not having to share command with 10 year-olds. Finally, the most dramatic theme music ever made comes from epic sailing movies and big budget space operas. Although there is some sparse drumming and some light classical music occasionally, Master &amp; Commander is devoid of true theme music. MASTER &amp; COMMANDER badly needs a powerful dramatic film score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this flick.The story, in and of itself, was solid - however, at times it was needlessly slow paced, a bit like wading through old pudding. I know the movie was based on two books (which I admittedly have not read), and I have gathered that it sticks quite close to these books - but, as far as pacing goes, there are things that work in literature, that just don't work in movies - unless you have the characters and the acting and the dialogue to back it up. And even then...Now, about the characters...I'll get the positive stuff out of the way first. Max Pirkis, as the Blond Boy Who Looses His Arm, was the most accessible, sympathetic, and memorable character in the entire movie. The ship's doctor comes in a solid second - I think his bland lines/ direction had more to do with it than his acting/ screen presence, which were pretty solid. Then comes Russel Crowe's character, which was suitably boring, predictable, and bland (the same character has been seen in countless movies/ stories since...ever). The ship's crotchety cook was quite entertaining - actually, I found him more entertaining than Crowe's character, so we'll just bump the cook up to slot 3. After them...nope, no one. The rest of the characters may as well have been cardboard boxes with English accents and bad teeth. The movie attempted to make you care about the entire swollen roster of characters...or, at least, I think it did. Rather lame attempt, in actuality. Before the Jonas subplot played out (which I'll mention in a moment), I found them all to be quite boring and indiscernible - which was fine, and to be expected, given the movie they were inhabiting. Then came one of the (pointless) subplots, in which the entire crew, hit with many runs of bad luck, blames a young man for it. They then drive him to kill himself through psychological torment and social ostracization. All this because of irrational superstition and the ramblings of an old man with a head injury. Now, I know that this is perfectly believable, as is the fact that the captain seems to feel the same as the crew. But then the movie tries to make me agree with the jerks. It did not have the intended effect...I found that to be just as disgusting as the act portrayed. From that point on, I was kind of hoping that 40% of the crew would meet a violent end. When the final battle with the French vessel finally rolled around, the only thing I cared about was seeing a couple choice s.o.b's die. And they did. Aside from Max Pirkis's acting, that was the only tangible entertainment I got from the entire movie. Oh yeah, other characters died as well, but pfft. However you cut it, the viewer should care about the characters he/she is following, should care whether they live or die. In this flick, whenever they showed a character's death, or the other characters crying over it, I was checking my watch. What, another cardboard box got stepped on? Whooptie-tit, recycle.Now, the movie had some good scenes. The battle scenes (all two of them) were suitably exciting, the two main surgery scenes (kid - arm, doc-on-self) were excellent, in both acting and direction...can't remember any of the others... It had some great shots, and some great costume design. It was pretty. But even then - being a sailor in the Royal Navy back then was far from pretty. The whole movie was too clean. Too shallow.All in all, I found this movie to be 35% enjoyable, 85% predictable, 90% visually appealing, and 100% "meh."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I appreciate that a great deal of research and effort went into the production of this movie, and that if you are a genuine navy buff then you will find such an astonishing level of detail a delight (as other people have commented here). If like me however you are not such a glutton for authentic early 19th century naval warfare then you may find this movie a tad dull. Yes the production values are excellent, yes the movie is well shot but as for the quality of the script I have no idea. Not because I wasn't paying attention, but because I basically couldn't hear a word of dialogue. Russell Crowe is a great actor (should have beaten Denzel to the best actor Oscar for a Beautiful Mind) but for some reason his acting in this film consists entirely of talking gruffly under his breath. Jack Aubrey may have been the most inspirational character to grace the screen in the past 50 years, but all I could think was 'speak up you mumbling idiot!' Not for the hard of hearing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Long Running Time and Title, and Totally Overrated Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is the Captain of the British frigate 'HSM Surprise', assigned to battle against a bigger and more powerful French war frigate. Like in 'Moby Dick', Jack becomes obsessed with the idea of capturing the enemy vessel and pushes his crew to the limit in a very long voyage in South America. I recognize that this movie is well produced, has a great reconstitution of the Nineteenth Century frigates and has great shots. However, the story is too long and sometimes boring, and is based on two lead characters only: the very fat Russell Crowe and the excellent Paul Bettany, in the role of Dr. Stephen Maturin, the surgeon of the 'HSM Surprise'. I took three of four naps along the story and I had to use the 'rew' button of the DVD to see the scenes again. In accordance with the cover of the DVD, this movie received ten nominations to the Oscar, therefore it is completely overrated. 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' has a long title, a too long running time and is nothing more than a good adventure. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'Mestre dos Mares ? O Lado Mais Distante do Mundo' ('Master of the Seas ? The More Distant Side of the World')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-crafted, but lengthy and way overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Master and Commander starts off very well. Leaving away any unnecessary and lengthy introduction, the plot is immediately introduced by putting you amidst a gripping sea battle. All battle scenes are very well-done, exciting, realistic, and they lack any artificial flavour (the very limited use of CGI effects does pay off).BUT, battle scenes alone don't make up a good movie, and it seems the producers had the same opinion here. However, instead of coming up with one single and thorough storyline, they decided to beef up the movie's very thin core story (one ship chasing another, battling each other from time to time) with a number of completely pointless side-tracks. Like: an otherwise unimportant officer driven into suicide by his weak leadership capabilities. Like: endless discussions as to whether the ship's doctor may investigate wildlife on the Galapagos islands or not. Like: numerous endless surgical scenes. And. So. On.There are so many side-tracks that the movie runs over two hours, even though there's only a very weak core story. In other words: it is boring. The end is foreseeable, and the film ends in exactly the same way it starts.Summary: 5/10 points. Only watch if you're willing to trade 90 minutes of boredom for 30 minutes of (excellent) sea battles.</fullReview>

The rest is filled in with observing beetles and a flogging scene which doesn't serve much purpose except maybe they felt the movie was running low on homoeroticism (besides repeated use of the word "seaman" of course)Don't be fooled- this is absolutely nothing like "Gladiator." They both contain combat and R. Crowe- that's about it. The script is episodic, lazily put together- maybe this worked as a book but little effort has been made to structure this into something the audience can care about.Kind of typical of adaptations of novels- they jump through so many hoops, like changing the villains from American in the book to French for the benefit of the historically uninformed in the audience (that'll teach 'em to help us achieve independance and give us the Statue of Liberty!)- but at the end of the day they would've been better off writing a story from scratch that works on the big screen. "Gladiator" is a great original screenplay, this is a half-hearted, half-assed adaptation that goes way too many directions at once and never builds any tension whatsoever.I was fidgeting in my seat throughout. I kept hoping it would break into unintentional comedy but that never quite happens either- it just sort of meanders along, there's a big battle, and it ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this film touted as Oscar material, and being something of a fan of Russell Crowe and Peter Weir, I bought this DVD on spec. Sorry to say, I was disappointed.Although supposedly based on a true story (it was written in the early 70s as part of a series, and loosely based on a real captain in the Napolenic Wars.) In short then, it is not supposed to accurately reflect a historical event.Which left me wondering why not simply tell the story of Nelson at Trafalgar, since we're asked to believe Captain Aubrey was a friend of his anyway? Instead of being a strong naval figure who can inspire his men like Captain Bligh or Hornblower, in M&amp;C he comes across as a rather bland older brother. We find out he is intent on pursuing a french warship whatever the cost, but why, is never explained? At no point is he particularly wronged, and at no point did I ever really feel the HMS Surprise was in any danger.Likewise the relationship with the ship's doctor is supposedly full of humour, and double-act of sorts (according to the publisher of the books.) However on the screen the relationship came across as bizarre - a slanging match between the captain and the doctor over whether to go and collect animal specimens or fight the French??? Who exactly IS in command here?And as before, since the doctor is essentially a fictionalised Charles Darwin, why not make "The Voyage of the Beagle" - the movie - instead of this pulpy serial?In short I found it wholly lacking in character development, I didn't really believe many of the characters, and those that I did I still couldn't care whether they lived or died.A shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was suspicious when the ads and trailers started appearing with great seafaring scenery, yet barely a clue as to what the film would be ABOUT. I was not familiar with the books, but if I had been, I would probably have been even more disappointed! Actually, the ads were pretty accurate, Russell Crowe, scenery, and battle sequences, that's all there is. It is hard to feel sympathy for characters whom are barely defined or even introduced. The only exception is Paul Bettany as the ships doctor. Otherwise the film barely has a soul and is merely an exercise in filmmaking on the part of the normally excellent Peter Weir. In other words, the film is boring, but not for lack of action. I could blame a weak script, but Weir co-wrote that too. The cinematography had to have been the ONLY reason this film was nominated for Best Picture over several more deserving films. The good acting almost redeems it, but I still think I'm being generous in giving this a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A high seas ramble with great attention to detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing so much about this being a great movie, I decided to rent it and see for myself. The only good thing I can say is that now I've seen it, but I should have saved the five bucks. I loved how accurate everything was, but Here is the plot: A warship (the H.M.S. "Surprise") captained by "Lucky Jack" Aubrey does battle with the "Acheron" and then chases her around...and around, and around. We see brief glimpses of the men's lives, but not ever enough to care about them or see their struggles. (Yes, Hollom struggles with being an outsider, and other men struggle with losing their friends at sea, but there is never enough of any one person's struggles to make it interesting.) They keep *almost* catching the "Acheron," but never quite do. At the end, they take her, but Jack assumes the "doctor" (actually the disguised French captain) is telling the truth and the "Acheron" and her captain get away. So Jack and Stephen sit down and play a lovely piece by Bocherinni (the best part of the movie, I thought) to pass the time. All of this is accompanied by a strange selection of classical music by Bach, Mozart, Vaughan Williams, and Corelli that does NOT go with the moods portrayed on screen.I was impressed that Russel Crowe learned to play the violin for the movie, but that did not make up for a two-hour ramble on the high seas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is at Sea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does not seem to really know where it's going. Is it an account of the excruciating naval surgery available on board one of His Majesty's warships in the early nineteenth century, or about pre-Darwin natural history buffs or one man's obsession? The story line is confused and very thin.In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars a Royal Navy commander (Russell Crowe) is ordered by the admiralty to pursue and capture a French naval vessel. Surely the movie might have been more interesting had it focused more on the crew and the motives of the enemy ship as much as was done successfully in both World War II films of "Sink the Bismarck" and "The Battle of the River Plate". It is a pity with such a good cast that the movie's great potential wasn't realised.Honourable mention should be given to Mike Pirkis ( he was only 14 when the film was made) As Midshipman Blakeney (Pirkis also performed well in the recent HBO TV series "Rome" where he had the role of young Gaius Octavius, the future Caesar Augustus. Credit is also due to the stick insect which the Commander mistakes for a twig and the Galapagos beetle not to mention that duck that can't fly. But the two weevils are best forgotten. The film has several historical goofs or anachronisms , but one would forgive these , if the movie was otherwise excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was nominated for Best Picture?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin I want to let everyone know how I rate movies.*-Watch it on Tv **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy Used DVD ****-Worthy of a Blind BuyWith that being said, I would like to share my thoughts on the 2003 Peter Weir film Master and Commander: The Far Side of The World. Like Matchstick Men, I didn't find myself interested by the trailer for this film. I rented it because of it's Best Picture nomination and after seeing it I do not know why it was nominated. I was not impressed by this movie and did not see what I assume many others saw. I found myself disinterested throughout the first hour of it and after a few events in the film I gained a slight bit more interested. However, I was still not impressed. The action was surprisingly minimal. There are, I think, a total of 3 battle scenes and I found myself a little bored by them. The performances were all very good, Russel Crowe and Paul Bettany were both in top form. The scenes with Crowe and Bettany were the high point of the film. These two actors play well off of eachother, as they did in A Beautiful Mind. You really get the feeling while watching this that the two characters are good friends.I admit, I have not read any of Patrick O'Brian's novels so therefore I cannot compare the movie to it's source. Overall I was disappointed. As I said before, I do not see why it was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I do not believe it was worthy enough for a nomination, however it certainly earned it's oscar for Best Cinematography. I would have to give Master and Commander **. It is worth a rental but will not be joining the rest of my collection of DVDs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World: 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one main reason how you can tell that Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World was originally going to be released in the summer. Not the huge budget or the `special effects', but because of its obscenely long title. Any movie with a colon in its title seems to be big budgeted, mindless movies. Obviously, Fox, Universal, and Miramax didn't think that it was, so instead of releasing it in the summer, they decided to do so in fall, when the Academy would remember it for Oscars. As I was watching it, I was having trouble thinking what Oscars it would hope to win.It wouldn't win best visual effects. It had exactly the effects I have come to expect from Fox and Universal. Universal has always had cheesy effects that weren't believable, which was only added onto by Fox, whose gunshots are just bright yellow lights. I can't believe that Fox needed two major companies to assist with the funding. It certainly didn't show. Some of the shots of the boat on water looked very good, however, but not real in any way.It wouldn't win best cinematography. It seemed like often it was trying to go for something a little different that wouldn't really be noticeable but would have people saying, `Something was different about this movie.' However, for even the easiest of shots to shoot (that were probably even done with second unit), the camera couldn't even stay still. If what they were going for was an amateur feel to the camera work, then they succeeded. Near the end, in the obligatory huge fight scene, the fighting was barely visible. Everything was so quickly cut it was impossible to see what was happening.It wouldn't win best screenplay. Every single character, even the lead, had absolutely no development to them. When Cap'n Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is seen in the beginning, he is writing a letter to his girlfriend to show how lonely he is. However, he neither shows his loneliness nor even references his girlfriend again. People who we don't know anything about suddenly become involved, and it's impossible to tell people apart. And this could be that I'm just not that learned in the history of the British Navy during the Napoleonic era, but why would eight-year-olds be allowed to be in the navy and be allowed to kill various people?It wouldn't win best director. The way Peter Weir directs it is leisurely at some times and haphazardly at others, both at inappropriate times. At the climactic fight scene, Weir is so interested in making sure we know that the British will win, he doesn't bother on the small stuff that is actually important, like being able to tell what is happening! Who is doing what to whom? It's impossible to see. You can't even see who is British and who is French!It wouldn't win best actor. Russell Crowe does his typical shtick, trying to act well to get an Oscar, but he just doesn't work here. The only other semi-large name is Paul Bettany, who starred with Crowe in A Beautiful Mind. See my note for Crowe. All of the other actors were rather invisible; most of their dialogue was just barking orders to and fro. There wasn't really any room for acting.It wouldn't win best actress, mainly because there's only about two in the entire film and are both on screen for a total of five seconds.Lastly, it wouldn't win best picture, mainly because as much as the Academy enjoys long, boring movies, it rarely goes for action movies like Master and Commander tries to be. It had too many subplots, all mainly there for an excuse for the ending `resolution'. Most didn't go anywhere. If they had been taken out, then it could have been a more tolerable length, not this, at an overwhelming two-and-a-quarter hours.If I were to say one redeeming quality of Master and Commander, it would be to say that in the beginning it was quite good, with a good action scene right off of the bat. After that, however, it just seemed like randomly people started to fight and it soon veered off into boredom. The subsequent action scenes aren't good, because I was too bored during the rest to really be entertained by the action, or by the rest of the movie.My rating: 4/10Rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences, related images, and brief language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The poor quality of many screenplays that are made into films is amazing. If you've got the bucks, you can make a film out of a screenplay that wouldn't pass a beginning reader working in a shoebox Hollywood agency.If you have seen "The Thin Red Line," you may have noticed the similarities between these two films. Like Malick in "Line," director Weir is so fascinated with his set and surroundings that his attention to the ho-hum plot seems like an inconvenient chore. Yes, all the details of life aboard a 19th-century warship are interesting, for maybe 15 minutes maximum. Same for the Galapagos, unless you have paid to see a documentary on them.And come on, give the audience a break. How are they supposed to tell the difference between French and British sailors fighting aboard ship when most of them are dressed exactly alike? How can they tell which cannon is firing on which ship during close-ups?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have never read the books I would imagine this is quite a sweeping adventure and Russell Crowe has the charisma to carry it along. Peter Weir was painstaking (but not quite enough) in his recreation of the British Royal Navy at sea during the Napoleonic era. Paul Bettany did a creditable job as Steven Maturin. Lee Ingleby stole the movie as Hollom - that is one self-possessed kid and a damn good actor.Now, for those who have read the books (which I have) this movie stank. It is a beautifully filmed Discovery Channel special that had me squirming in my theater seat wondering what it would end. Peter Weir and John Collee rewrote The Far Side of the World into an unrecognizable mess with one plot and no subplots. Get the French ship. (That's your plan? Get her?). What he did, essentially, was rewrite the plot into Desolation Island, stripped of a) the intrigue, b) the espionage, c) the Dutch, d) the on-board epidemic... I could go on. I like my movies a little more meaty, please, especially when they're based on some very fine novels.There is no depth to the characters or the plot. By the time the action of this entry in the series takes place, Maturin and Aubrey have been friends for years but you get no sense of that from the actors. During the action sequences you are never given any reason to care about what happens to the characters (except for Hollom and that was solely Mr. Ingleby's efforts) never, ever made to hang on the edge of your seat. Mr. Weir is notoriously bad at creating nail biting moments for all that he's made several films that included tense action moments - he simply has no sense for creating them.Overall, this was quite disappointing for the amount of talent and money that were combined for this movie. In the hands of a director like Ridley Scott this would have been a masterpiece of both acting and action.</fullReview>

There are also a subplot in the movie that should have been cut from the movie, as it wasn't interesting at all. If you would like to see a movie/TV-series about life at sea in the Napoleonic Wars, I would really recommend the Horatio Hornblower-series starring Ioan Gruffudd instead.

		<fullReview>I really don't know what to make of this movie, but I know I didn't like it. In fact I felt sickened after watching it and fast forwarded through the last 10 minutes.Spoiler Alert***************************************I consider this the movie that betrayed itself 1/2 way through. It was quite interesting at first. The depiction of the early battle scenes was quite gritty and realistic along with the portrayal of life aboard a naval ship. It was the plot, themes and characters that I found so distasteful. Frankly, I hated the British captain and most of the crew and by the end I was hoping they would get the deaths they so richly deserved. I guess this was supposed to be a manly man honor movie but to me this movie was basically about a bunch of psychotic drunken murderers.The whole Jonah theme is central to my dislike. The ship was blessed and cursed by god. In the crucial moment the British captain "turns aside" from his vendetta to help his doctor friend. This causes God to shine down upon his holiness the captain and bestow upon him his blessing to use pirate tactics to basically murder the French crew. The betrayal of the character of the doctor also appalled me. First he is the anarchistic, peace promoting doctor and then he sees the French ship on the other side of the island and is so anxious to see battle after weeks of trying to turn the captain against the idea. Then it got even more silly (historically true maybe) that a British war vessel can be disguised like a whaling ship enough to fool a seasoned French captain. At that point I started fast forwarding...</fullReview>

At one point rounding the Horn A sailor has to be sacrificed, the scene is so lacking in any power or feeling .. You would be hard pressed to even know which character has been lost.. The Galley scenes are pathetic with no narrative or plot drive and come over like some weak soap opera. The Surgeon is well potrayed but only works when hes on his own, when hes with RC even the blocking of the scene is embarrasing to watch as they fumble with there musical instruments..(NOTE to directors things that work in books dont always work on film)...One puzzling aspect to the film is why there is a lack of cohesive thematic scoring..this would at least give you some clues as to where the drive of the film is because you would be hard pressed to catch it in the performances.. Instead we have to put up with inserted excerpts of Classical Music which are all totally inaproppiate (what the hell is Vaughen Williams fantasy on Thomas Tallis doing in there)..Absolute waste of time...It resembles a film where so much time was spent on second unit work that the director failed to realise he didnt have enough coverage to actually put a story together before it was to late...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Floating around for way too long!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars, the H.M.S. Surprise, a British ship, is under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey. Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and the Surprise's current orders are to track and destroy a French privateer named Acheron. The Acheron is currently in the Atlantic off South America headed toward the Pacific in order to extend Napoleon's reach of the wars. Aubrey's single-mindedness in this seemingly impossible pursuit puts him at odds with the Surprise's doctor and naturalist, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettaney), who is also Aubrey's most trusted adviser on board. Facing other internal obstacles, Aubrey uses Maturin's scientific exploits to figure out a way to achieve his and the ship's seemingly impossible mission. At what point did you fall asleep? "Master &amp; Commander" is one of the most boring films of all time. Sure, it looks pretty when Russell Crowe dresses up for what looks like a history costume contest and the big ship travels across gorgeous landscapes across the oceans. The cinematography and editing here are very well done, but there is hardly anything to hold your interest. Crowe gives a dull performance. He never gets into his historic character. This is like reading a history book. The internal conflicts Peter Weir throws at you are not powerful enough, nor do they hit hard. We spend so much time floating around at sea that it's hard to understand what the heck is going on elsewhere in the world. It would have been nice to spend time with their enemies as well to understand both points in the conflict and to make the story more interesting. Peter Weir knows how to work a camera during battle sequences, but he doesn't know how to make time pass. "Master &amp; Commander" is so slow that it will be a challenge to sit through this voyage. Not one scene is entertaining or intense! Weir also shows he is a fan of character development, which doesn't help in this film due to each character being more unappealing than the next. Many say this shows the ultimate challenge of a leader but to be honest, Crowe's character is kind of a wimp. I hardly thought he portrayed leadership at all. His character doesn't even have that much struggle from what it seems. "Master &amp; Commander" floats around for ever, but never reaches land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring movie without surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a very poor movie. I expected much more than I got. The story was not enough to fill a two-hour movie. The characters were not arranged well. There is no challenge among captain and others who oppose going further after the first battle. I have to add that there was no sympathy toward the characters. In fact, its normal to feel that invaders deserve to be defeated. So you don't feel compassion toward the English guys who attack the French ship and ultimately were killed. I was really disappointed from this movie. The only good part of it is character of Doctor and nothing more.He has some points to make, but the captain is too stubborn to change his mind. On the whole, no challenging characters, no surprise and no new idea in this movie. I would score 3 out of 10 to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lord of the Seas: The Two Ships.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very strange piece from Australian director Peter Weir (who is best known for "Witness", "Dead Poets Society" and "The Truman Show") has Russell Crowe leading a British Naval Fleet in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars. The crew is very diverse to say the least as there are those who are pre-teens and those who are very elderly and of course every age group in between. Some in the crew include doctor Paul Bettany (Crowe's cohort in "A Beautiful Mind"), deck-hand Billy Boyd ("The Lord of the Rings" fame) and odd-ball cook David Threlfall. Gloomy camera-work early on foreshadows a duel in the sea between Crowe's ship and a mysterious phantom fleet that has to be from the French military. As the movie moves along side-stories galore occur, but the constant is always the chess match at sea between the two ships. Situational whirlwinds make a showdown at the finale the only legitimate outcome, but what happens when everything is not quite what it seems? "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is one of those films that has been praised outrageously by critics, but in the end I found the movie to have quite a few big shortcomings. The screenplay by co-writer Weir never does really come to life. The battle sequences are impressive, but there is so much dead-time in this picture that it feels like the film-makers had to have a minimum 140-minute running time (which is really too long here) to get the movie made. Beautiful cinematography on the sea gives way to a sickening claustrophobic feel deep in the bowels of the ship as the camera literally seems to sway constantly along with the sea (this is a neat innovation, but you might need a motion sickness pill while viewing). None of the characters are particularly interesting either as Crowe's part is really short-changed to make way for other crew members who turn out to be little more than pirate-styled caricatures. I really felt no connection with the key players at any point. All in all the film is still not bad (especially considering the messes we have had to sit through in 2003), but I still had many reservations by the time this set its final course. Definitely worth a look, but this is no "Lawrence of Arabia" on the water. "Gladiator" on the water? Perhaps. "Gladiator" had lots of problems with it too. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film moves very slowly and is not historically very accurate. The battles scenes are really done on the cheap. It relies on a certain amount of creativity to cover this up, like the flash from the French ship coming out of the mist. I could see much action. A tsunami might have helped. Also Russell Crowe seems to have a Kiwi accent, not the cut glass one expected of a Royal Navy Commander. As usual, the French are depicted as posh idiots or as cowards.The film tries to copy the Horatio Hornblower books, but in slow motion. If you want to see good battle scenes from the Napoleonic era, watch "Waterloo". If you want to see a film depicting a good cat and mouse game, with warships, watch "Battle of the River Plate".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, you should know where I'm coming from. My favorite genre is historical epic, and I am in general a great admirer of Crowe and his films. In this case, though, the few redeeming qualities of Master and Commander, in which Crowe's performance is included, simply do not add up to an end result that is worthwhile. The only reasons I can imagine to see this movie would be if you were researching for an essay about Russell Crowe, find visual effects to be paramount in a film's overall value, or are unqualified in your interest in all things related to British naval history. Aside from these purposes, I can not imagine how a viewer could leave this film satisfied. While there may actually be a plot, it is certainly hard to discern. At best, it is disjointed and decentralized. All that being said, this film is still a credit to the acting talents of Crowe and Bettany, and to the abilities of those responsible for its technical merits, of which there are many. Sadly, though, these efforts are wasted on a film that is truly worthless otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I should have had more sleep the night before seeing this movie than the six hours I got. But I was trying to keep my eyes open during the first half of the film. During the second half I perked up a bit as the storyline started moving along to its conclusion more rapidly and steadily. And I started understanding the characters. I think a large failing of this movie is that it expects you to already have an intimate understanding of the characters and the dynamics between them. However, that didn't develop for me until the latter half of the movie, so the first part felt forced. Again, maybe I was tired, because other people around me were laughing in spots that were meant to be funny, while I didn't even crack a smile. However, my colleague and I (we work in evolutionary psychology) were the only ones I heard laugh at the line (I think it was by Crowe's character) about Bettany's character being the first naturalist to set foot on the Galapagos Islands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital Surround EX / DTS-ES1805: At the height of the Napoleonic Wars, a British frigate commanded by a charismatic captain (Russell Crowe) engages in cat-and-mouse battle manoeuvres with a French warship.A surprisingly hollow work from director Peter Weir (GALLIPOLI, DEAD POETS SOCIETY), this good-looking epic - based on the novels by Patrick O'Brian - is bookended by a couple of stirring action scenes and features a truly ferocious storm sequence which places viewers at the very heart of the action. But everything else about this high-falutin' epic - nominated for countless awards - is thoroughly pedestrian, with few redeeming features. Crowe adds little to the heroic screen persona he cultivated in GLADIATOR (2000) and is upstaged by co-star Paul Bettany (DOGVILLE) as the ship's doctor and Voice of Conscience, while everyone else simply melts into the background. This is one of the few films in recent memory to feature virtually seamless CGI effects, and the entire production represents Quality writ large, but there's nothing remotely special about either the plot or its execution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been such a good movie. All the ingredients are there: a marvelous setting, a rich array of characters, action, warfare, history, nature, meaningful conflict and interpersonal relations, reverberation with the timeless and universal, and so on. But, instead, it's just fair-to-middling, another big-bang-for-the-buck, test-tube blockbuster off the corporate conglomerate assembly line. Maybe if it were made 25 years ago it might have stood a chance ... Digital soup, a murky, mushy, overly processed digital soup: that's all we get, all we see and hear. Or, rather, what we don't see, don't hear. You'd think with all the whiz-bang technology applied to this film, that we could at least hear what was being said, at least see what was going on. But, no, dialogue and image are blurred and foggy, unintelligible and indistinguishable, as if the film were shot within the soundproof walls of some chilly, underlit, subterranean morgue. Visually, aurally, it has absolutely no life, no zip, an affliction it shares with many other digitized processed "epics," such as the "Lord of the Rings," all of them grey, distant, frigid. Even the animals on the Galapagos Islands were "simulated." All the king's men couldn't put this mess back together again. Unlike Humpty Dumpty, it was never whole, never alive, to begin with.Russell Crowe is too low-key for the role. His one dramatic tool is understatement, especially sotto voce, but when that's all there is, the performance becomes dingy, bland. Here he is, standing before the assembled multitudes, giving orders or reciting the Lord's Prayer, in a voice so soft that anyone further away than a few feet couldn't possibly hear him. He just doesn't ever reach out, extend himself. His relationship with his crew strains credulity. We are supposed to believe he has what it takes to be respected and loved by his men, but we never see it in practice, which is exactly what he tried to pull off in "A Beautiful Mind," a brilliant man who never actually demonstrates a single instance of intellectual brilliance.The single bright light in this dim fog is some well-honed, crisp dialogue, that is, the snatches we can make out. My guess, given its literary patina, would be that it was lifted out of Patrick O'Brian's novels.Weir used to make decent movies, but it seems he 's been promoted up into the big time, up into Ultimate Film Making, that megabuck stratosphere, where everything is synthetic, bloated, and overproduced into extinction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same character names, completely different intent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a long-term, die-hard fan of Peter Weir's films I find it hard toimagine how he could possibly have written this screenplay. Afterfinishing the final book (number 20) of the acclaimed Patrick O'Brian"seafaring tales" starring the honorable, bold and eminently sea- capable Captain Jack Aubrey and his lifelong friend and companion thesecretive, brilliant Stephen Maturin, and having watched the filmtwice, I can't help but wonder how such a miscalculation could haveoccurred. Weir's use of political commentary (such as has appeared inthe past with his films Gallipoli and The Year of Living Dangerously)is plain. In this case, he decided to make his primary focus theBritish Empire's naval ambitions in the 19th century. Unfortunately, neither Weir nor his lead actor Russell Crowe seemed tohave comprehended the greater intent of the series in the slightest.The Aubrey of this film seems to be a domineering, ignorant captain,painted with a thin veneer of civilization. The character of Maturin issomewhat more believable, though radically one-sided; his status as anagent for Britain completely overlooked in lieu of his hobby -naturalist - which ends up making much less sense in terms of theoverall story. Further, Weir's decision to use elements from a numberof the novels (from the first, Master and Commander to at least the10th, The Far Side Of The World) ends up diluting a consistentstoryline in order, seemingly, to provide more more sea battles.I challenge anyone who has read the series to enjoy this film, and anyfan of the film to not cry "foul!" upon reading the series. While it israrely if ever fair to compare a book to its filmic counterpart, thisinjustice to Patrick O'Brian, who the Chicago Tribune proclaimed to be"the best author in the world" cannot be overstated. The true magic ofthe series lies in its detailed treatment of its characters and thereality of life during the Napoleonic War, its subtle but pervasivehumor and its dedication to higher values such as honor and duty. Whatwe're left with after distillation of so much material is a domineeringcaptain who appears mostly annoyed at his surgeon, a surgeon whoconstantly complains about the Naval service and a plot which seems torevolve mostly around ship battles. Whatever the movie is, it bearslittle substantive resemblance to the stories and characters portrayedin the novels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The far side of nonsenses?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although filled with amazing sets and remarkable maritime atmosphere, one word comes through my mind when I think about this movie: propaganda. I won't elaborate here about the stylistic aspects of Master and Commander, but try to underline its strong and shameful political allusions: with M &amp; C, Hollywood has offered the American audience a movie filled with good old Francophobe stereotypes. Tasty clichés in the political context of the movie's release: American's Francophobia (and boycott campaigning) reaches its peak with the French refusal to enter the Iraq War in 2003. What? The coward frogs won't go to war? Then let's eat "freedom fries", tax their wine and kick their bottoms on the big screen! The replacement of O'Brian's American villains by French ones was not done only to avoid American anger. This was also convenient. Let's study a bit our frog pirates.As I was watching the movie, I kept wondering "why the hell those French villains appear so few times?" Other viewers were also obviously frustrated by this absence of two-side perspective. Actually, the answer is clear: the American "war on terrorism" is just transposed on 1800's sea battlefields, with the French as Taliban. Look at the first battle scene (a great one by the way): an invisible enemy hiding in some demoniac smoke, striking cowardly with a stab-in-the-back technique and disappearing again as magic. What does this remind you of? Fundamentalist human bomb Muslims of course! And their bloody bombing attacks. It expresses the American frustration for a new type of war which they are not accustomed to. Namely, having to fight invisible terrorists, instead of well clearly organized adversaries (like the soviets were). The French privateer's aggressive cowardly tricks are just countless: hiding in a creek then falling upon a poor unarmed British boat, hiding in a destroyed piano to ambush Capt. Aubrey (final battle scene). Without mentioning the French captain's final trick,pretending to be the vessel's surgeon, to avoid martial punishment. Really those French privateers are incapable of any face-to-face confrontation! (Interesting detail: Aubrey's trick to have the French privateer chasing a fake ship was an idea of Surcouf, an 18th-19th century's French privateer) After 138 minutes of this kind of brainwashing, the hidden meaning appear as clear as light for the average American viewer: the French don't want war, consequently they are accomplices of S. Hussein's regime and the Taliban. Adding to this their cowardly military history, which seems quite similar to Taliban's terrorist methods, here is the point to get: French are like Taliban, in a sense they ARE Taliban.Bush's biblical superstition is there as well, personified by the old crazy seaman: "I tell you, this vessel is driven by the Devil". Reminiscence of Melville's Moby Dick no doubt. The French vessel is named "Acheron", a complete fictional name referring to Hades's river, the river of hell in Greek Mythology. Interesting subtle hidden message. The poor lad Hollom is a modern Jonas who did well to jump off the boat after all. Clear message printed again on the viewers' brain: "America has to wipe out this weakest link; otherwise it may put the whole organic community in danger". It also reflects the American biggest fear in the context of national hyper security: the psychosis of the terrorist threat hiding amongst the population, the Islamist fifth column. Who knows, maybe this Hollom was a discrete French sympathizer. Good riddance!Let's talk a bit of the protagonists' aesthetics. The very short time you'll be really able to see the French in the final battle is just astonishing. A bunch of pirates you could imagine in a tale for children: toothless mammals, scars, dirty bristly hairs, rags. What a contrast with those British play-boy seamen with their perfect teeth and blond-tinged hair: a bit more of those nonsenses and you would almost see them in a Baywatch's episode. The racial gap is hugely and boorishly stressed by Weir in order to dehumanize the evil enemy. A little homage is even paid to the great British scientist, Darwin, from whom so many racial mad ideologies and pseudo-scientific theories have emerged (loads of in particular in 19th century's Great-Britain, namely a feeling of superiority towards all non-islander populations, considered as threatening aliens. Just take a look at John Knox's works or Herbert Spencer's, an avalanche of scientific and historical nonsenses). God is on British's side, and so is Science then, embodied by the surgeon and his isolated humanistic positions. Fortunately, he eventually rallies to Aubrey's militaristic and Manichean ideals. Patriotic romanticism, scientific rationalism: perfect ingredients for the perfect propaganda recipe.Peter Weir's adherence to G. W. Bush holistic Neo-conservative ideology, and to an idealized world Anglo-Saxon imperialism, has really poisoned every minute of this movie, which is nothing but a masterpiece of silliness, a massive indigestible patriotism cake.P.S: I put 5/10 because the sets are incredible despite the story's disgraceful political position.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eight Academy Awards?! Best Picture?! Go figure. Aside from the battle scenes, which I'm willing to concede may be some of the best sea battle scenes ever filmed, I found this picture to be a drag at best - long stretches of monotony followed by the brief excitement of battle. Now, that may well be a realistic portrayal of life aboard a warship, but it makes for a dull movie.The picture revolves around the pursuit of a French warship in 1805 during the Napoleonic wars by the HMS Surprise, commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe). Crowe puts on a decent enough performance, although he missed out on the Oscar. Aubrey is portrayed as a Captain Ahab type of character, with an obsessive need to find the French ship and take her. His alter ego on the voyage is the ship's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), a naturalist at heart (really a pre-Darwin Darwinian) who would really prefer to be on the Galapagos Islands, where the Surprise weighs anchor for a while, studying the wildlife. The relationship between Aubrey and Maturin takes up much of the "in between battles" times of the movie, as the two try to work out the conflict involved in being good personal friends who have a strong disagreement about the pursuit while on the other hand dealing with the fact that Aubrey is Maturin's commander. Some find this relationship fascinating; I found it typical of the rest of the movie - dull.Needless to say I didn't come away as a fan. For the marvelous battle scenes alone - 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Weir is a fantastic director. Russell Crowe is a wonderful actor. Paul Bettany is on his way to being one. Master and Commander is a useless and pointless movie.My thoughts about this film going into it were that I'd get to see two hours of action and adventure on the high seas. Well, unfortunately I was right. That's all this movie is. Nothing happens for two hours.Yes, they fight some battles. Yes, some important characters have dramatic deaths. Yes, there are some quiet scenes between the Captain and his friend talking about what it all means. The problem is, I didn't care about any of these things. Even though the cinematography is wonderful, the movie does a terrible job of engaging the viewer as part of the story. We are watching dull Englishmen duke it out with unseen Frenchmen. I find it interesting that, in the current political climate, a movie that celebrates thousands of Frenchmen being murdered simply for being French was so well received.Crowe's performance is not even in the same galaxy, or solar system, or whatever, as his performance in Gladiator. There's not much character to Captain Aubrey. His mean both fear and respect him...wow, that's interesting. He plays the violin...even better. His best friend is the ship's doctor, and they confide in each other....are you trembling with excitement yet? Me neither.Paul Bettany's performance is good, I guess, but how interesting is a doctor who is more interested in bugs than he is in his patients? Seriously..his character spends the whole movie worrying about bugs. That is, when he's not getting accidentally shot, in what is the movies' strangest and silliest moment.As I mentioned, the climax of the film involves a battle with a French ship. If you're waiting for the wily hard working Captain to come up with one last heart felt plan to save his ship and defeat his El Guapo, you're watching the wrong film. His idea is to not act like a British Naval Ship. He actually tells his men that. They don't put up their flag. That's Aubrey's big idea. Without a flag to distinguish themselves as British, the French ship is not prepared for an attack. Apparently, the French thought these guys were just coming to hang out for awhile. After all, they don't have a flag.There are countless films that are entertaining enough to stand on their own in spite of any problems there may be with the plot. I never thought that a best picture nominee starring Russell Crowe and directed by Peter Weir would NOT be one of those films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>who greenlighted this crap?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, if not for Paul Bettany, this movie would be right up there with Glitter and Gigli. I'm still trying to figure out how I was supposed to care about anyone else in this movie. I wanted Crowe to lose a limb or at least fall overboard or something.Plus, even though Paul Bettany saved the film from total failure, he was playing a thinly disguised Charles Darwin, who is reality a) made his voyage on the HMS Beagle in the 1840s (way later than the movie) and b) did his studies on ecological adaptations of the beaks of finches, not flightless cormorants.The big flaws are too many story lines, too much Crowe, not enough Bettany, lots of actors that can't enunciate, and lack of character development for Crowe's character or the secondary surgeon (Higgins?) or the "Jonah" of the ship. Maybe if the writers/director/actors had made me care, i wouldn't have spent the last hour and a half of the movie hoping for Moby Dick, Jaws, or a combination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very very boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting of Russel Crowe is boring! He is unable to show more than two different faces. All the time he's smiling smart even if he lost a crewman or got shot down. I wanted to see a dramatic sea-movie like "The Bounty" with Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson but there was nothing like this. It was just a modern action movie. Russel Crowe is unable to act any emotions. He got the chance to act as a captain between hate and desperation, but he doesn't. I tried to find something special about this movie but only the Special FX an the design of the ship rescued this movie. Sorry, but I've only seen a few movies that were less boring than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not my kind of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the acting was phenomenal, I found the story to be a bit drawn out and uneventful for my liking. I'm sure that the historical accuracy was most likely right on the money, I just wanted more. I felt that this film lacked enough conflict, internally or externally. One word about the plot, there was none. The film makers spent so much time trying to get so much in the film, the story itself was lost. You'd do better to watch the Pirates of the Carribean, or even the ride at Disney Land would be more enjoyable than this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A naval war film about Napoleon vs. the British. That's about all I got out of this. To be fair to the movie, I had no interest in seeing this. A friend suggested it and it's been getting great reviews so I figured--why not? Boy, was THAT a mistake!This is a big, loud, overblown sea "epic". Purportedly it's factual and based on real people. I did notice it was very correct in period detail right down to the smallest thing. And I do admit most of the acting was OK--except for Russell Crowe. What's happened to him? He used to be a great actor but ever since that overpraised performance in "Gladiator" he's been lousy. Also it was well-directed (I suppose) and there is some truly beautiful scenery.But....I couldn't follow the story; the movie really dragged most of the way; the British and Australian accents rendered most of the dialogue unintelligable and I couldn't figure out what was going on during the battle scenes.If you're a fan of nautical movies this might be great for you. If you're not--stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word: Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was kind of dull. Well maybe I am being too hard. If you are a 50-year-old male who owns a boat, you will like it.Contrary to the trailer, Gladiator it is not. In the 2 very brief battles (the first one if you blink it is over - saw most of it on the trailers) there is some really cool cannon stuff. But that was it. 15-20 minutes of action in a 2 hour and 18 minute film doesn't make it an action. It makes it a long drama.When you finally get to see the bad guys at the end of the movie they should have worn black cowboy hats because I kept getting the good guys and bad guys mixed up in the fighting.It is a story (or a documentary) about sailing and life on a boat a couple a hundred years ago. That is what the trailers should show and stop trying to trick the public.Sorry. I didn't read the books but I bet you the books had humor and women. This movie had neither. Gladiator had the strength of the emperor's sister and Gladiator's love for his wife and child and his desire to be with them again. Nope. Not in this film.If anyone thinks this is Pirates of the Caribbean, think again. It is a visually pretty History Channel documentary. If that is what you are looking for, go see this movie. If you are not, don't.When you read some of the comments here everyone seems to talk about it as visual poetry. I think those comments are fair. But the simple fact is it is a "chick-flick for guys who like boats." They should promote it as such. Most of the action is in the trailers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many things wrong with this movie. First of all, a good story should take into the plot before the first hour rushes by, and there has to be a meaning in a movie that will keep the audience begging for more; not falling asleep in their chairs and snoring louder than the sound of a bullet being shot from a gun. And the bottom line pretty much is that SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN IN THE FRICKIN MOVIE!!!!!!!! There is not even 30 seconds of action one minute, and then it's just singing folk songs on the ship and eating slop while celebrating. And worst of all, they make jokes that aren't even funny! I'm sorry to say that to the people that worked 3 years on this movie that it completely sucks and it was a complete waste of their valuable time. I'm not much of a war movie fan, but I know a bad movie when I see one, no matter what genre. I understand that this is a war movie telling a true story about actual people, but it's not worthy of being shown on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies ever made. If you need to get some shut eye then this is the movie for you. Castaway will be considered to be an action packed movie compared to this! I hope you enjoyed all the action you saw in the previews for this movie because that's it folks.Whoever said that this is like Gladiator of the sea must have never seen Gladiator. Whoever enjoyed this movie must love being bored. They could have wrapped this movie up in about 15-20 minutes. About 90% of this movie is mumbling and rambling dialogue that has nothing to do with the plot.Don't waste your time or money on this bomb. You're better off watching Gigli.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The begin of the movie is good, but it is the only good spot in it. The whole movie is too long and it has no beginning and no end. All you get from it is two battles that make no sense. Peter Weir has shown us that he is able to make good movies such as Gallipoli or The Truman Show, but this time he wasn't able to convince the audience. The movie was a failure in all the lines. It should have been a lot shorter and the story, that seems to be a good one, needs a little of correction on the beginning and in the end, so that the movie would finally made some sense. The visual effects and the camera are great, but this still cannot stop the film from sinking. It really could have been an epic spectacle, but now it is not even an average movie because of the missing parts of the story. The only bright spot together with the beginning is Russell Crowe, but one actor cannot change the fact that this film was in the depths before it even came out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate those movies that you watch for an hour and still have no clue what's going on. Such was the case with this movie. The dialogue was so soft that it was little over mumbling much of the time. The plot twisted and turned so much that I couldn't make heads or tails of what was going on. After an hour, I turned the movie off in frustration. Other than them being a British ship fighting the French, I never understood anything more of the movie. Perhaps more narration would have helped. As it was, I was too frustrated to watch the movie further. The movie "Dune" is still my #1 worst movie I've ever watched, but "Master and Commander" is a very close #2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So confusing, and boring, not worth anyone's time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so confusing. You would only understand it if you were a sailor in that century, which no one is. There were too many characters for you to know their names, the director expected you to catch their names when they said them, they didn't have anyone say "Sir this is Cpt.Jack Aubrey" or anything like that. You had to give everyone nicknames, like the little boy with one arm or his friend or Pippin! When the guy on top of the sail thing died, I thought they killed off Billy Boyd because I didn't know his name. The worst performance in this movie would have to be Russel Crowe's. His voice is too deep and soft for you to understand. Plus, what makes a good movie is if it has at least one joke. The funniest part in this movie was the "lesser of two weavles" and that wasn't even all that funny. I just don't see how people compared this terrible movie to the great "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl". "Pirates" was great, this was just plain pathetic. Pirates had a great introduction of characters with the whole "What's your name?/Will Turner" also "Well, well, well, Jack Sparrow isn't it?/Actually, it's Captain Jack Sparrow" and it actually had a plot! I never want to hear Master and Commander again! Another terrible thing about the movie was, gore. I know they didn't have good medicine back then, but did they really have to show the pain on the poor boys face when he got his arm cut off?! There was too much implied gore for a PG-13 movie. Again, Pirates was great with that, they only showed the people's feet, this showed people getting stabbed and shot. Plus, it was so unbelievable when the doctor operated on HIMSELF! Thank god, I saw Shrek 2 the same day I saw this piece of garbage. THERE WERE ONLY A FEW GIRLS WHO HAD NO LINES!!! I give this crap a 0/1,000</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sound and fury signifying nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving this film a rating of 1 (awful) in an attempt to save viewers from wasting their time but I fear, having read the reams of tosh from other reviewers, that it will not make much of a dent. The director and actors are praised to the skies, yet there is not a moment of real drama or tension, of surprise, indeed of anything other than a reworking of visual and verbal clichés old as the hills. Nor was the realism so praised by other reviewers there at all except for a few moments. For yes, there were a few, but few and far between. The film is a clever contrivance. No doubt someone with inside knowledge will tell me they spent a fortune and a great deal of time on photographing these scenes. Maybe they did, but the editing is such that one would never know, so much must have been thrown away it looks as though it was done on a shoe-string; from the point of view of film-making it was unenthralling in the extreme, with clips of scenes that never once pulled back to show the wider scene or zoomed in, or panned to give the drama of reality. It is as awful as the film of Mamma Mia and for many of the same reasons. There is a total lack of visual atmosphere and place for which an endless attempt to substitute by background sound does not not succeed. If David Lean or Stanley Kubrick or Alfred Hitchcock or Fred Zinneman or any of the great directors had ever turned out a product like this their career would have ended on the spot. Where it is not awful, it is pretentious. Of course it does not help being shot in the wide-screen aspect ratio which diminishes every film now made when it attempts to work with both large (cinema, for which it was designed) and smaller screens. Now that we are in the digital age and the cost of film is not an issue, could we not return to nearer the 3x4 ratio which is the one that makes dramatic, visual sense in every circumstance? I suggest the director studies My Cousin Vinny if he wants to learn how to make a movie.</fullReview>

This film didn't have one as far as I could tell. And I tried desperately to find one in this LONG LONG LONG LONG epic. Consider this, though: the French killing the English and the English killing the French on the ocean in BIG ships? That is not a plot. That's the background in which a story can be told. The one nice thing about pictures in a museum unlike this film: you can walk away from them in a couple of minutes. This one goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on ..... Oh, yeah, I know I could have turned the DVD player off before the end, but I fell asleep by the time the epic battle scene occurred (good grief, another one?!). There was absolutely no suspense, drama or drive to this snoorer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this flick. What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The story made little sense, the battle scenes were very poorly done - hey director: shaking the camera does make not me think that the battle action is fast-paced and confusing - it makes me think it's too fast and confusing FOR YOU!. On the snooty side- character development was poorly done for several of the seemingly key figures; either that or the editing was terrible, as you must have left many key shots and dialogue on the cutting room floor. As is, the entire film should be left on floor. This film is the triumph of commercial and marketing hype over reason. Your ads and specials said it was good, so all the lemmings voting on this board follow through to be with the crowd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to give this a higher rating, if for no other reason than Paul Bettany's performance. He is exemplary here, and contributes a top notch performance. HIS Performance rates a 9.8/10. Billy Boyd was also a delight.This movie doesn't rate a rating. This was dull, boring, uneventful dreck, made as a vehicle whereby Russell Crowe could show off his talents. I have to admit that this movie does just that. It is lackluster, flaccid detritus, as is, in this reviewer's opinion, Crowe's acting talent. This was a prime example of perfect casting.This film would have suffered, regardless of who was in the lead, but Crowe's presence herein is a SERIOUS detractor of any and all enjoyment one could derive from said work. The pacing is dead, and the dialog delivery was like those horrible Dudley Do-Wright cartoons! I'll save you, Nell! (Dudley voice) That's how stiff and unoriginal Crowe was throughout.Frankly, I hated this. I had no expectations, so there were none to beat, and it STILL failed miserably.As usual, I'm in the minority, but I thought this was an entire waste of film, except for Bettany and Billy Boyd.Sorry, but this rates a 0.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw an advanced screening of Master and Commander. I was really excited to see it, considering that I loved Peter Weir's past work. Especially Truman Show and Fearless.The movie starts off in the heart of the sea. Weir does a great job of establishing the surroundings. The movie is basically a cat and mouse movie. It goes nowhere and it's very talkative.The huge problem with the movie is that it is incredibly slow paced, the characters aren't interesting, and it never really gets past the first act. The goals seem unimportant and the plot is really uninteresting. The dialogue is bad at times and tries too hard other times.Besides some nice special effects, this has to be one of the slowest movies of the year. I really hope this movie doesn't get any Academy Award nominations besides visual effects.On a scale of 1-4, I would give Master and Commander a 1. I don't know what movie critics saw. I saw a mess of a movie.</fullReview>

He doesn't even possess the charm necessary to overcome his lack of talent and when he tries to play the sympathetic captain it becomes farcical. This was just a repeat of every historical naval film ever made with all the requisite brutality included for those who get a frisson out of watching men brutalizing other men. It was so predictable every step of the way, I came away believing I should start my own career writing screen plays. The film lacked any modicum of suspense; the viewer could guess exactly what was going to happen next and what arrogance on the part of the producers/directors to think we wouldn't notice that, to leave room for a sequel, they didn't even bother to give the thing a proper ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was very tedious. It had one decent battle scene at the beginning and a marginal battle scene at the end. Everything in the middle was uninteresting filler. They spent more time on the Galapagos islands then anywhere else looking at animal specimens that I couldn't care less about. If I wanted that I'd have watched Jaques Cousteau. I was expecting a movie about wooden naval ships, but those were more of a background scene in this movie. The character of the captain was also as shallow and see through as plastic wrap. All the other characters around him has to tell the audience how great the captain is because the captain character sure couldn't demonstrate it on his own. The political correctness was also nauseating. Make better use of your time and money by checking out something else. Now let's try others capable actors and not about a fiction movie but the true life of french privateers where this movie tend to go, Robert Surcouf life is 10 times more interesting and passionating than the phantasm of O'Brian book, just a movie telling how Surcouf captured the HMS Kent and so much more British warships would not be a story close to reality, it would be the reality of this times!</fullReview>
