		<shortDescription>Definitely worth seeing!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't give out 10 stars easily unless it's a film that can keep me guessing. A film that will make me want to see it through to the end, not because I paid hard earned cash, but because I truly care about the characters and where they're going to end up. If you like me, then you're going to want to see this one.Will Smith has always been an interesting actor for me. I watch everything he does because I'm a huge fan. I must admit that the idea of him playing another heartbroken, distanced from the world individual (Hancock, I am Legend) made me a little annoyed, but this one was a home run. The character Ben Thomas is such a mystery that you want to know what he plans to do; for others, for himself, etc. As the story unfolds, so does his intentions and not in a really simplistic way. He's a complex person, but not so much that he aggravates me. He's intriguing.The connection between Will Smith and Rosario Dawson is so well done and so believable. This is how it's supposed to be done. There's a chemistry in their acting that I haven't seen in about 10 years or so. I'm not exaggerating. I haven't seen too many films where the chemistry is genuine; kudos to the both of them.It is very touching and sad, yet heartwarming. Geez, did I say that? I walked away from this one feeling good. That's what it is in the end. A feel good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I didn't care much to see this movie. Although the trailer left much to the imagination it looked quite boring.The majority of the movie is mysterious, slightly confusing and will have you guessing a lot. It's almost hard to believe so many loose ends could be tied up as it nears its ending, but it does, and it does so beautifully. Everything culminates in this magnificent ending that will make you want to tell everyone you meet to go see this movie now.Also, I'm the kind of person that is not easily moved. As a matter of fact I can't even remember the last time a movie made me feel something the way this one did.I rank this as one of the top movies of 2008, along with TDK and Slumdog Millionaire. And definitely somewhere on my all time top five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first time I have ever posted. I saw this movie and it made me want to post. IT seems Seven Pounds is getting a lot of negative press and I felt like I need to do my part to let some people know that this movie is SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL! For me, this was a rare movie that stays with you. I found everything about this movie beautiful..the acting, the music, the directing and especially the beautiful story. A story of giving..sacrifice with purpose. I am not the biggest Will Smith fan, but I must say that his performance for me was ASTOUNDING. I felt his pain and was moved by what his character was doing. This is not a easy story to tell in 2hrs and I think they did a really fantastic job. This movie will not be for everyone...it moves slowly and may be confusing..until you figure it out...then the reality of his purpose will crush you emotionally and at the same time it is so beautiful....SWEET PAIN (it did for me anyway)....Seven Pounds is a wonderful movie that will stay with you long into the night and next day.....Thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this movie doesn't touch every sentimental nerve in your body and reach to the core of your soul, you are not human. This movie will touch your heart in places you never knew existed. Each of us has seen those movies that reach deep within and cause the light tear to seep out of corner of our eyes and we quickly wipe it away and hope no one sees us. You will indeed be seen crying on this one. You will need a box of tissues. I do not know how or what the so called self critics are seeing, but I don't think it's the same movie I just finished watching. Yes it's a little slow, but its real?. This is a human in tune with what he wants and doesn't let ANYTHING stop him from completing what he started. It's a Shakespeare tragedy in today's society. A movie you should definitely see. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this film doesn't get nominated for an Academy Award, there is no justice. It was an astonishingly good film. The storyline unfolds piece by piece and keeps you guessing until the end, trying to figure out who this character is and what he's up to. The juxtaposition of such a dynamically humanitarian man being an IRS auditor is the first thing that piques your interest and the mystery grows from there. In order to be an excellent film, you need a good story, good screenplay, and good acting. Seven pounds has all that and more. The story was upheld by outstanding performances by Will Smith, Rosario Dawson and Barry Pepper. It's more than a touching film. It's one of those rare films that actually makes you take stock of your life and reexamine your priorities. Kudo's to all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds follows the story of Ben Thomas, an IRS agent on a mission to redeem himself from a haunting secret. We follow him on his mission to seek out seven strangers in desperate need of help. Ben's plans are complicated when he meets and falls in love with Emily (Rosario Dawson), a young woman with a terminal heart condition. Italian director Gabriele Muccino brilliantly pieces together a tragic modern day Shakespearian love story, weaving between the present day and glimpses into the dark past. Seven Pounds is not a kick back and zone out film, you have to work as an audience member to put all the pieces together. The more you allow your mind to work in this film, the more you will get out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie... is amazing. Not even watching "The green mile" and "Million dollar baby" did i get the same feeling i do off this. This is truly a masterpiece.I wont go in to detail about the movie, since there is already a lot of comments here to get that information. No, i wright this comment ( my first ever) because i wanted to express myself. This is my new favorite movie, and if you don't go see it, you misses out one a truly amazing experience. I think i cried to 1 movie before, not a lot of crying, but still and that was green mile. But this.. this movie got me crying for real. The sacrifice Ben (will smith) makes in this movie is truly a gift for the people he does it too. I don't think i said to much to spoil anything, i hope not, cause that will be me taken the joy out of what is a amazing movie.Now, after you read this, you should go buy this movie (when it comes on DVD), and watch it. And treasure it, and maybe it will bring something to your life, as it has to mine.Love Tais.</fullReview>

Some of you may say that this film is just another in a list of movies such as Pay It Forward.This is a fallacy. This film here grabbed me from the start and will stay with me for weeks. It's a very powerful film and Will Smith and the rest of the cast deserve our applause and respect for playing their roles so well.

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best films i have ever watched by far. The direction of the film along with the acting was simply world class. It's an emotional roller-coaster. Yes it is slow, yes it gets a little boring, but whilst your watching the movie your always taking in the story line and my does the movie make up for it in the last 30 minutes when the jigsaw is put together and the full plot is revealed. I think this movie is actually better than The Pursuit Of Happiness which most will know was also a very good film. Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, Michael Ealy and Barry Pepper all deserve awards with there 10 out of 10 performances. This movie for me is a must see, i am still actually getting over the film as it quite simply blew me away.10/10 easy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*I mark where there are spoilers! Overall comments: If you can take a serious movie, go see this. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Don't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on! The movie fits together nicely in the second half. I will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens. I was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago, when Will was going around promoting the movie. He was great--spent a lot of time with the fans. Thank you for the picture Will! About Will's performance: A lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie/show, you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie. I didn't picture the Fresh Prince (lol) when I was watching this movie. He was completely and utterly convincing in this very, very serious role. He has grown immensely as an actor. I think he will at least get an Oscar nod for this performance.About his character: Ben is very conflicted and tormented. He's sad...guilt-ridden...very determined, but very scared. Very true to himself. His character has a lot of depth...and somehow, Will managed to bring that to life.About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a nice job portraying Emily, a woman very much behind on her taxes. Maybe she's not the shining star Will is in this movie, but she was very convincing. I think her character just did not have as much to work with as Will's did.About the plot (no spoilers): I admit that I did NOT like the movie until the second half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it, and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so. But when things eventually fit together, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you.It actually takes a lot out of you to watch. In the theater I was in, most people were crying towards the end--even grown men. When you realize what Ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment...******* Minor SPOILERS***** Which is why it's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away. I feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it. There was a lot of symbolism in the movie that I enjoyed, though. I will mention some of it here (without trying to give a lot away).-The fish that Ben was keeping in his hotel room. At first, it makes no sense whatsoever. There was a LOT of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish.-I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. By the end of it, I loved him and hated him. That's how convincing Will was. I thought Ben was being a huge jerk to Ezra, a blind man just trying to make his way in the world. Why he was treating Ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie. Wait it out though. Everything in this movie: wait it out.-Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he won't forgive himself for. It's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt, or if he genuinely wanted to help people. I think it's a little bit of both...I think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate him because of what he is doing to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Nice job Will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Or as I like to call it "Will Smith can cry like a..." well you know what</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds, this was the movie where I was just convinced Will Smith is really going for the "I'm going to make you cry" films. One thing I can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. My only thing is, as moving as the story is, Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? But nevertheless it's still a good movie. I do have to admit it made me cry, but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson, I absolutely love this girl, ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton, I knew this girl was going to go far. She's beautiful, charming, funny and talented, can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go. But her and Will Smith, not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film.Two years ago Tim Thomas was in a car crash, which was caused by him using his mobile phone; seven people died: six strangers and his fiancée. A year after the crash, and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer, Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother, Ben, an IRS employee. Six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named Holly. After that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations. He finds George, a junior hockey coach, and donates a kidney to him, and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas. Two weeks before he dies he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. She suggests Connie Tepos, who lives with an abusive boyfriend. Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish. One night, after being beaten, Connie contacts Tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house. She takes her two children and moves in to their new home. Having stolen his brother's credentials, and making himself known by his brother's name Ben, he checks out candidates for his two final donations. The first is Ezra Turner, a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano. Tim calls Ezra Turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger. Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy. He then contacts Emily Posa, a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. He spends time with her, weeding her garden and fixing her rare Heidelberg printer. He begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation.Seven Pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look, I would just recommend going for the rental vs. the theater. Will Smith pulls in a good performance, but not his best, just most of the film required him crying in every scene, but the last one with him is a doozy. But I loved the ending, it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted. There is still good people in this world and Ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need. Although he went a little far, but it was still a beautiful story.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hold the elevator ? Seven Pounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all starts with a suicide. Or is it a car crash? I guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. Director Gabriele Muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film Seven Pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning, showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call. This is one powerful movie; maybe that is because I'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk, dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances, but either way, a film works best when it truly touches me, when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre. And this is from the team that brought us the overrated, sappy, and not all that redeeming Pursuit of Happiness, so I'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown. With all that, though, I was with Seven Pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled. Even though you figure out what Will Smith's character is doing, that secret mission he is trying to complete, it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear-filled smile at the end.Our entry point is a bit jarring, leaving us off-kilter trying to comprehend what is going on. Smith's Thomas has lists of names, one of people we don't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit. Working with the IRS allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give them?a gift that could completely alter their circumstances. He calls an old childhood friend (Barry Pepper) and reminds him to do what it is he promised, to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind. Even in a role as small as Pepper's, you can't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background, hanging above everyone's head. It is his character, seen maybe three times, that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with. His breakdowns, whether tear-streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions, show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way.After that phone call, begins the journey to meet new people. Thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk, trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival. This progression takes many turns, from a "blind, vegan, meat salesman" that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode; to a phase two donor-necessity heart patient, unable to print her line of stationary, or even run with her Great Dane Duke; to an abused and scared Latino mother of two, too afraid to leave her boyfriend; to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community; to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant. There are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day, and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style. Why it is up to Thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his "gift" is unknown at first, as is why this man, seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home, is now living in a motel, driving a beat-up car, going door to door in order to audit for the IRS. As he says, though, "he kind of stumbled into the job".Smith's quest as Thomas is a long and painful one, tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion. As a man with the means to help, he takes his job seriously, crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree. If that means he must yell and make fun of them, he must do it. At every step, though, you see the suffering in his eyes, the pain eating away at his soul, taking each step towards his fate, one as a saint of redemption, not only for those he wants to help, but for himself as well. It is an award-worthy performance and I only wish Smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles, because, while they are fun, this guy is too good for them. The man better win an Oscar before he is done or it will be a travesty?at least in my mind.The rest of the cast is stellar across the board. Woody Harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch-perfect handicap with a joy of life. His shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout, whether on the phone being yelled at, sitting in a diner eating his pie, or at the piano in the park, playing for all who will listen. Elpidia Carrillo, as the abused mother, is fantastic, showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger, allowing her family to finally be safe. And Rosario Dawson shines as the "once hot" young woman, beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays, all but given up on living life to find love and happiness. It is the introduction of Smith's Thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman, a free-spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a terminal cancer patient. I pray everyday that somehow things will get better. Every 3 months I get another PET scan and the tumors have either grown or spread to another area. I remain optimistic and continue to hope and pray. I love my son and my wife and it hurts me that they must suffer with me. What I can do is make the best of what I have. I spend precious time with my family and tell them how much I love them. I do the same with my mother. She is so wonderful. In fact, all the people around me have been so helpful in anyway they can. I am so thankful for this. Whether I get better or not, I am so thankful for the life I have been given and for all the people around me that have been involved in my life.In the beginning I didn't understand what was happening in this movie. When the pieces fell into place I realized why this movie is a 10 and why no other film could possibly stand up to it. Given the state that I am currently in, I have often asked myself if I am a good person. Have I done enough? Have I made enough sacrifice? What do I deserve? This movie gives words like caring, sharing, sacrifice, etc. a whole new meaning. Yes I was moved by this film and I still pray for myself. I also pray for others and am thankful for the life I have been given regardless of what lies in the future. If I have sparked your curiosity at all, then please do watch this film. This film portrays a value that words cannot describe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeking Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The IRS tax collector Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks out Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) and resolves her situation with the IRS. Emily has a serious heart problem and is waiting for a donor, but her blood is very rare and her odds are low. Meanwhile Ben seeks out other people to help them in a journey for redemption for what he did in the past. However Emily and Ben unexpectedly fall in love with each other, but Ben does not have the intention of changing his plans. "Seven Pounds" is a predictable drama with a fragmented non-chronological screenplay about a man seeking redemption for what he did in the past that has shattered his world. The story is simple but the screenplay hides the secret about Ben until the very end. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Sete Vidas" ("Seven Lives")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It baffles me how anybody can say a bad word about this film; the standard of acting... the mysterious, highly intelligent and gripping storyline... the amazingly thought-out scene sequence... the tearful scriptwriting... it all combines to make this film a definite 10/10. I have always liked films with a twist or two, I like a film to be unpredictable and trigger some emotions. Well, this film certainly did that. First of all, the cast members are all clearly highly trained and the best at what they do. Will Smith has always intrigued me as an actor, with his versatile acting ability. However, in my opinion, this film is far beyond what he has shown us before. There was no second-hand casting, as every person does an amazing job throughout the film, which is necessary for the heart-wrenching script/story. If the actors were not up to scratch, I dread to think what the outcome of Seven Pounds would have been like. The story is unexplainable, and I don't want to give anything away but the quality of the writing must have taken SUCH a massive amount of time and effort to produce, because the end result really has amazed the entire world. The way the characters all connect, and the story unfolds itself, is what can only be described as truly magnificent scriptwriting. I would love to have a conversation with the producers about how they connected everything together and tied all the loose strings up, because the story is very complicated and hard to get your head around, which is why you need to concentrate when watching. It is definitely not another Legally Blonde!What makes the movie so astounding is the believability of the chemistry between actors. As I've said, Smith delivered in this performance and truly excelled himself for the role. However, his performance wouldn't have been as interesting to watch, if it was not shown to link in with the other characters, and the emotional relationships he has with them all. Of course, the most real of these relationships being the one which develops between him and Rosario Dawson, who plays Emily Posa. Another role well worth paying attention to, is Barry Pepper, who plays Dan. I found his role immensely realistic as Will's best friend, and thought Pepper did an excellent job which could easily be overshadowed by the other characters.All in all, it is a must-see. I would recommend the film to anyone who enjoys drama and who doesn't mind shedding a few tears!Seven pounds is unquestionably 10/10!</fullReview>

It's easy to make you laugh but it's quite difficult to make a person cry from his heart.Everyone must watch this movie and it's really SEVEN POUNDS!!I will rate it 10/10 and it's in one of my best ever watched movies in English language.</fullReview>

It involves a young man, Ben Thomas (Will Smith putting in a phenomenal performance), and his life - past, and present.The movie is so strong I don't know where to begin to tell you how involved the story is, yet how simple it plays.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie at least 5 times and every time it surprise me and touches me like the first time. And every time I I wondering how anyone could conceive such a perfect movie. The main idea of this movie is so simple yet so amazingly expressed by the directors and producers and through the characters. Will Smith's acting is just perfect. I think that he is the most complex actor alive. No one could be more perfect than him for this role. His character is complex, strange but a true hero. This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen and I recommend it to everyone. This movie has kept alive my hope that there could still be people on this planet that want and can to make up for the bad things they caused in other's people lives. Definitely worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie, I still found it to be absolutely amazing. It will touch you, and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie, or you just simply aren't touched by anything, it is worth seeing. Don't come into the movie expecting anything, just have a box of tissues and an open mind. It is beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, despite that he's yet again playing another lonely depressed individual, is amazing. I believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worst/best experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes YOU feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Excuse for Glorifying Suicide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many moviegoers left theaters angry they had been duped by misleading movie promotions for Seven Pounds. But the damage of this misguided screenplay could extend far beyond the movie theater to potentially destroy hope and threaten the very lives of loved ones who suffer from depression, grief and post traumatic stress disorder. As a society, we should be concerned, if not outraged.The movie is billed as an extraordinary love story, while in reality it deceptively showcases the benevolence of organ donation to justify and glorify suicide. The main character, Ben Thomas, is attempting to atone for causing a car wreck that kills his wife and six people in another vehicle. The excruciating pain of grief, depression and post traumatic stress disorder is extraordinarily deep and sometimes seemingly unbearable, as I know from personal experience. But the pain left behind for others when someone completes suicide is even greater. I also know this first hand, having lost my husband to suicide. There is hope even in situations that are perceived to be the darkest.Yet this movie presents a romanticized portrait of suicide as the heroic answer. Let's get real and take a genuine look at the face of suicide -- the statistics are alarming. According to the latest official data for the United States, there were 32,637 lives lost to suicide in 2005; that's one person every 16 minutes. Set your watch or clock alarm to go off every 16 minutes ? it won't take long before the numbers become agonizingly real. Ranked as the 11th leading cause of death behind a list of diseases and unintentional injuries, suicide claimed more lives than homicide. Each death by suicide powerfully affects at least six other people. If this not enough reason for concern, consider also that for every death by suicide, more than 25 attempts at suicide are made ? that's more than 815,000 a year. Romanticizing suicide on the big screen could increase these numbers; research shows that portraying those who take their lives as heroic or romantic may encourage vulnerable people to identify with the victim and even contribute to copycat suicides.The number of suicide attempts by young people between the ages of 15-24 skews even higher, more like 100 attempts to each suicide death. These numbers are significantly more frightening when you consider this age group represents a substantial portion of moviegoers who would be attracted to any Will Smith film. At such an impressionable age, what message about dealing with life is being role modeled for them in the movie "Seven Pounds?" Suicide in this case is erroneously portrayed as a noble solution with all the Hollywood fanfare. Fortunately, there are truly noble organizations, such as the Suicide &amp; Crisis Center of North Texas, that have taken a strong stand to prevent suicide and provide healing support for those critically wounded in the wake of the suicide of a loved one. The risk of suicide hits closer to our homes, our schools and our workplaces than most realize. Reduce the risk by joining forces with such organizations and by speaking out.During an interview this week in Dallas to promote the movie, Will Smith said, "It's important to stay connected and I work in an industry where it's easy to lose touch." Let's help Will Smith and Sony Pictures stay connected. Let's share real life perspectives about the dangers of glorifying suicide. Let's send a message to Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad at All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone deals with trauma in different ways. This movie is from the perspective of Ben Thomas and how he dealt with his trauma and pain.I didn't expect much from this movie but I had a feeling it was going to be somewhat sad, I got that thought from how the trailer was. Much of the movie is puzzling but you have to pay attention because at the end, everything will make sense. I really enjoyed it and it changed my views on somethings in life, on a personal level. Some scenes and parts are boring but they all have a purpose, to make you feel/care for the characters and understand them more. I think the whole cast did very well especially Rosario Dawson and the little scenes Woody Harrelson had.Again, everyone deals with problems differently. Ben killed seven people in a car accident and decided that he couldn't live with such a big burden so he gave up his time and life to save seven strangers. It's a pretty sad depressing film but has its moments of happiness, no matter, its not a bad movie at all.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clean the beast / Fix the beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beast might be the desire to inflict suffering after enduring it, but smith's character's heart was somehow enlarged more than the grinch's. It's hard to imagine that a 1,000 pound, 100-yr-old printing press can leave its mark on seven sheets of paper with an imprint as gentle as a kiss, but his character accomplished that too: the help he gave to others was as subtle as it was extreme, with no expectation of reciprocity. Most moving was his decision to apply every last ounce of his financial, psychological, and physical resources to literally "complete" strangers: much like the box jellyfish, ultimate power over another person's life can be the most deadly creature on earth. But in his hands it was the most beautiful thing ever seen. Very ironic that I picked up this film on valentine's day! Much more so that I'd never heard of it before; it blew me away. It deserves a top rating for the story concept alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just One Word To Describe This - Excellent! But Be Prepared To Take Tissues With You.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a fan of Will Smith ever since his "Fresh Prince of Belair" days, I was surprised with this one, not forgetting his previous other movies such as "Independence Day," "Men In Black," Men In Black 2," "Wild Wild West" and "Hancock." An aerospace engineer atones for his sins by helping people, after the car he was driving in crashes, killing his wife and seven other but soon, soon falls in love with one of the people that he is helping.Starring Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrleson (still remembered as "Woody" in the sitcom "Cheers."), Michael Ealy and Barry pecker, this is directed by Gabrielle Muccino and is written by Grant Nioporte.Will Smith has gone on to prove that, not only can he act in comic roles but serious ones as well and he has fitted this one very well. The other members of the cast have also done a good job as well and in particular Rosario Dawson.This is a romantic, tearjerker, drama movie, which is excellent and is worth watching. However, if you cry while watching such movies, then take some tissues with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Mysterious Movie Will Stay With You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You spend most of this two-hour film wondering "what's the story regarding the lead character?" Will Smith, as a low-key "Ben Thomas" will keep you guessing. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shocker....but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. Until then, Smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. You know he has a good reason for doing it, but it's never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end.All of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....but don't because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together.This is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho Will Smith film. In fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of Smith throughout this story. It almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots. He looks like he's lost weight and is sick. Smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness.Like a good movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intended to be heart-warming but ends up being creepy, disturbing and stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven pounds is definitely not the worst movie ever, or even comes close. But it is still very bad because you can see the pathetic attempt here to make something insidiously heart-warming and touching. To those who are paying attention though, the movie ends up coming off as the opposite. First, within minutes of this movie starting every one realizes what Tim Thomas(Will Smith) is trying to do. He's upset and obviously self-loathing, and I guess in a way he thinks he has good intentions. This will become clear in a minute. Basically, Tim stalks several random people. Why? Because he intends to donate parts of his body to them all after committing suicide. Do you see what is wrong with this picture already? This isn't just creepy, it's disgusting! It's sick! It's not heart warming, it's stupid!In the meantime, we know what's going to happen, we already have figured out the inevitable conclusion to this film.Even more retarded is that Tim intends to take his own life by sitting in a bathtub and letting a jellyfish kill him. This seems pretty over-the-top, dramatic and again, stupid. Why is it stupid? Because he intended to donate his heart to Emily Posa(Rosario Dawson), and correct me if I am wrong, but the Jellyfish poison would render the heart useless!!!!Turns out Will Smith wants to commit suicide because he is responsible for a multi-vehicle crash where many people(including his wife) died. He wants to atone for what he did. Now, fact of the matter is that instead of sacrificing your life for a few people, why not just live your live saving as many people as you can to atone for your sins?The answer? Because death is more dramatic! Basically because the plot needs him to die, no other reason!Seven pounds is poorly written, and a desperate last-ditch attempt to get Will Smith an Oscar for best actor. It ends up being cruel, nihilistic, misguided and sickening in its moral philosophy.</fullReview>

Will Smith plays a huge roll that has a mix of emotions and he does it perfectly. This film is a masterpiece and it perfectly blends drama and romance together. I guarantee you this movie is not boring at all and it will keep you interested every minute since the beginning of it.

		<fullReview>The movie I chose to write about is "7 pounds". This movies is very inspiring to me. When you watch the movie, especially the first time, it makes you think about what you've done and what you can do to change.This movie is about Ben Thomas (will Smith) had everything going for him, beautiful wife, good paying job, he got that job for going to MIT. Then it all ended when he got in a mass car wreck that was his fault and killed 7 people including his wife. So he dedicates his body parts, stuff it contains, and soon his life to 7 other people who without his help could've died.The 2 peoples life he saves at the end of the movie causes him to do what he does in the end of the movie. One of the parts of his body he donates to someone were his eyes that went to Ezra Turner who was a blind man, and he donates his Heart to Emily Posa.What he does to give those people these things is let the box jellyfish sting him, which will kill you. Before he does that he falls in love with Emily Posa who he was planning on donating his Heart to, The night they start talking about a family he goes to the hotel where he had been staying he let the box jellyfish sting and kill him. He makes sure that the people he lets have3 the parts of his body after he dies are good people and not just people that want to keep doing bad things.That is the reason why you need to go and watch this movie. It could change your life and you never know when someone can come to you and change your life. So keep on the look out for people like this.-Tray Lamar</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the few amazing movies i've seen. I've thought about this movie a lot, and i don't think a better cast could have been arranged. Will Smith usually plays a funny, well loved character in most of his other movies and i think that alone really makes it hard to watch this movie as he suffers. I've seen a few tear jerking movies but i've never actually cried to a film before. This has got to be one of the saddest stories i've ever seen. At about the half way point you begin to feel it, and even just thinking about, its a really hard movie to watch without feeling any emotion at all. This movie was really written for Will Smith to star in it. If the main character had been anyone else but him, i think the emotion would have been a lot less intense. Love this movie</fullReview>

There are movies with suicide, murder, rape, robbery etc... This does not mean that these movies are promoting these acts.

It's moving and I cried several times during it, but this doesn't mean anything, it just shows how good and moving the storyline is. Now, I started thinking in different way. ("What if...") The movie has its message - to help people, try to make their world a better place. I think that every person can find himself in the movie - well, I did. This really was much enlightening as it is.The honors go to the writer, director and of course to the actors. Especially to Will Smith, who showed entirely different side of him in the movie. I think he has never done something like this before. His acting skills are really good, I have never expected something like this from him. Great job, Will. And then there is also Rosario Dawson, which is obviously a really good actress. I was so amazed just by watching her. She was magnificent.People, if you really want to see a movie, which is emotional, moving, life-changing(maybe), different, not boring... just go and rent a video and watch it. It sure isn't something that will make you laugh, but I'm pretty sure, you'll be very much happy afterward, because the story it's amazing.P.S.: It doesn't deserve such a low rating.MY RATING: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most moving film I've seen in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a lot of positive reviews on this website and the odeon, but negative reviews from film critics in the newspapers. I decided to see this film and came out of it absolutely astonished not just how incredible this movie is but that the film critics had the audacity to slate this film into the ground. Though everyone is entitled to there own opinion, but it still angered me. Seven Pounds is a intellectual film it dosen't follow your typical type Hollywood linear narrative. You have to have patience and pay attention to what is going on as there are numerous flashbacks, but I manage to follow it. The basic story is that Will Smith plays a bogus IRS agent called Ben Thomas who give gifts to seven strangers. I shan't go into any more details and not to ruin it for you. But sufficed to say you are taken on a journey of compassion,sympathy, pain and love.This is an unforgettable journey. I have never been so moved by a movie since the incredible Titanic. What helps is the performances Barry Pepper as Thomas's brother and Woody Harrelson as a blind man are convincing and they play there roles with real conviction. In particular Barry Pepper, though he has a limited time on screen as he is mostly just an outside character. You feel the worry he has for his brother.But the best performances come from the two leading stars Will Smith and Rosario Dawson. Ben falls in love with her (she is one of the seven strangers he helps) Smith's acting is absolutely outstanding. I cannot commend him enough. He plays his character perfectly and with real understanding of the pain Ben is experiencing throughout the film. He should have received an Oscar. Through Smith's raw and real performance I felt what he was going through and I was entranced.But of course Rosario Dawson cannot be ignored. Her acting was equally fantastic playing a woman with a heart problem and who is struggling to pay her bills. The chemistry between her and Smith is superb and beautiful. They relate to each other in real depth of the pain felt through there life's. One scene where they are sitting together in a field holding hands and smiling was lovely.As to far as the ending it is very sad and inspiring at the same time. The director Gabriele Mucchino drove the emotional intensity of this film to an phenomenal pitch. The music was wonderful and in perfect relation to the events and characters emotions.What also helped the actors was the script which was intelligent and meaningful. Please do go and see this. It is perfect in every way and has confirmed Will Smith as a real actor not just an all action Hollywood blockbuster type. I have new respect for him. As I said this film should have received Oscars for it's performances and making. It's criminal that it hasn't.One of the best films I have seen and in particular the ending, which I cried at. A amazing movie, which I can't praise highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the career of William Smith is not only impressive, but certain to increase in scope, temperament and professionalism. This young man is to say the very least incredible. His talent as well as his versatile performances speak of a true thespian. Here is a case in point. This movie is called " Seven Pounds " and relates the story of Tim Thomas (Will Smith), a young man driving a fancy sport's car at high velocity at night in the rain. It's bad enough he is speeding on the interstate, in the dark, talking to his fiancée who's examining a wedding ring, but his diverted attention is not on the road ahead. Directly before him on a collision course is a loaded van, filled with children. What transpires next is the stuff of tragic, horrible, unforgiving nightmares. The movie then follows the remorseful hero as he sets himself a nearly impossible task. Establishing his personal penance, Thomas selects seven people whom he deems worthy and needing help. The character is sincere about his lofty goal, but walks a tightrope between legal action and complex spiritual Karma. In doing so, the audience witnesses his personal struggle and his humble admission to make up for his mistake. Michael Ealy plays his brother Ben, while Woody Harrelson plays Ezra Turner. Rosario Dawson plays Emily Posa, the adhesion to the film and a remarkable assets to the story. A good film and easily recommended, despite the fact the movie strains the audience's patience with its snail's pace and tawdry length. ****</fullReview>

Nevertheless the director Gabriele Muccino should be commended for making a film that at first confuses you, then intrigues you, and finally moves you. The film moves along slowly, but is paced just nicely at 2 hours as we gently build up the past that is leading to the present. There are those situations in life you hope never happen to you, those occurrences that can be through some ill twist of fate, or one terrible moment of distraction. How would we behave in such a situation? This is how the character of Will Smith behaves, attempting to positively influence the lives of those that need it, and more importantly, deserve it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS Agent who practically gives the store away to everyone's surprise. What kind of IRS Agent is this?Most of us have all heard the line by an IRS Agent, "Hello, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help." Our smile then spreads into a chuckle that says, "Yeah, right."As you get further and further into this story, you cannot figure this guy out. He goes easy on those who are being audited. What is his motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do good? He helps so much we want him to be our auditor should we get audited, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (kidding, just kidding)The pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on. Intense, repeat intense, focus was on Ben and stays there. The whole movie only works because of Ben as we try to figure him out and I didn't see any clues (what clues you talking about, Willis?). Not reading the box before watching the DVD movie was the better way to go here. By the end of the movie I finally put it all together. Well, it was obvious by then. And, yes, it's over the top, but still a great story, mostly because of Will Smith. Will Smith should have been nominated for a Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast were very good as well. Yes, it's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong. What's the message? Believe me, you will won't need too many clues to figure it out. I didn't. Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing to get excited about. Bland. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

You will want to say (somewhat quietly at first) "Bravo" and "Bravo" -- and then you'll want to stand up and shout "BRAVO!!"Lovely (and they absolutely stuck the dismount) Thank you</fullReview>

		<fullReview>will smith has never failed me in any move so after i heard from two people that 7 pounds was not a good film, i still had to give the fresh prince a chance. i was not disappointed. this movie has both moral and entertainment value. smith's acting was on point and his costars were no primadonnas. you have to pay attention to piece together the story that is foggy at the beginning, but by the end you can understand and appreciate the director's use of flashbacks and flash forwards. this film didn't make me cry like it did to other movie goers but i cant say i wasn't fighting back the lump in my throat. a great movie that must go on my myspace faorite movie list! ;) the prince is still fresh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vanity project that needs to be seen to be believed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hilariously misguided vanity project for Will Smith who wants to be a savior and win that Oscar! The twist is telegraphed from about twenty minutes into this thing and we have to endure a frowny face Will Smith for the entire running time of this fiasco, until the last few minutes of the film where the real comedy begins. This whole thing is creepy dreck, when it's supposed to be a profound drama, but the end is the stuff of unintentional comedy gold. Watching Will Smith commit suicide by jelly fish in a bathtub with the most bombastic dramatic score is epic. No SNL skit can ever reach it's comedic heights, Mel Brooks wished he directed that scene, no comedian in their right mind could come up with something so off the wall hilarious. It's the perfect example of the 'what were they thinking?' scene. Seven Pounds is as bad as they get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start by saying I really like Will Smith and I thought he did a really good acting job in this movie....That being said, I thought this was a really bad movie. It was slow, I keep looking at my watch, and I had the entire movie figured out in the first 15 minutes. The big message in this picture was awful and depressing. I wonder if the other reviewers were watching the same movie. Spoiler***** suicide is never the answer and donating your organs does not make it right!!!! Horrible movie....I understand it was a drama but it was not interesting enough to keep my attention. If you want to help people live better lives you can find other ways besides donating organs to do it. It ignores the reality that Will Smith's character had family and friends that love him and his death will cause them pain. His behavior was self serving and selfish. Hard to enjoy a movie like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morally reprehensible mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is disturbing on so many levels. A guy who wants to atone for having killed people in a car crash breaks several laws to assure that his rare blood-type organs ONLY goes to 6 "good" people (and a family member), when he eventually commits suicide. The reason for the car crash in the first place is his need to answer a phone-call from work (He is a very important engineer in aerospace...) meaning this guy has a big ego! Then he proves that he hasn't learned a thing, by insisting on this crusade to only help good people (who is that anyway - sheesh) as if he is heavenly ordained to decide and judge such things... seriously how big an ego can you get!!! There a lots of stories about self sacrifice leading to different outcomes, but this is by far the most ego-driven I have ever seen. Furthermore the movie tries to trick us into believing he is a good guy, by telling the entire first hour in various disjointed flashbacks and flash-forwards before finally revealing the plan. Then the movies drives into high syrup mode with a sappy love story, that makes no sense what so ever. Technically the movie is long winded and filled with an annoying new age soundtrack running beneath almost all the time. 1 point for some decent acting, and 1 point IF this can get a few people to become donors (for the wrong reasons but hey...), otherwise this mess is preposterous...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderfully acted movie and should be seen on that basis alone. It is powerful with a moving premise that will have most people in tears at the end (including men). In fact, this is the second movie today that had me in tears and I'm going to have to go play some football or leave a toilet seat up somewhere to reaffirm my virility. ;o) Having said all of that, there are 7 problems you should know before seeing it:1. The beginning and somewhat in the middle lag. The beginning of the movie is confusing and it takes you a while to "pick up" on the plot.2. Once you do get the plot, it takes a while to get through it. There are some twists but they come later. Meanwhile, once you "get it", the pay off is long time coming.3. There are factual errors. Donors can't pick and choose to whom they will donate organs. That's illegal (thankfully...imagine the consequences, and even now the rich seem to be able to control getting organs first though the system denies this). The world wasn't created in 7 days, but 6 and on the 7th day GOD rested. 4. Because of #3, it's best to think of the movie as more of a morality play or "It would be nice if" 5. There are some overstretching moments. Toward the end you're not sure if the woman drowns and imagines the next scene as she imagined the scene with Will Smith in her near death experience on the operating table or what. 6. There is some confusion. Some folks thought the Harrelson character (great acting job, by the way, he deserved an Oscar just for the few moments he was on screen) received whole eye transplants at the end. This is not medically possible at this time (another factual error). I disagree that this is hat happened anyway and think he only received money to stop working in a meat factory when he was a Vegan and an introduction to the woman, a fellow Vegan, to love. 7. Last but not least...in fact, most important...It is NEVER, NEVER,, NEVER a good idea to suggest that suicide is a good idea. There are too many delicate folks out there who may think "Well, hell, I'm better off dead so at least I can donate my organs and do someone else good." Very bad to put this suggestion in someone's head and suggest (erroneiously) that they can choose who will get what organs. It's good movie, a wonderfully acted movie, but should be seen as a fantasy and must only be watched by those who are not so precarious as to be unduly influenced by it to the point of harming themselves.Seven Pounds. Seven Problems. Choose wisely and choose life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise of this movie is impossible in the real world. There is absolutely no way that a person can donate organs to particular individuals by killing himself, as the lists used to distribute organs have multiple layers of anonymity built into them and there is no way of knowing who will wind up with the organs. Living people can donate some organs (like one kidney) or parts of organs (the right lobe of the liver) to particular individuals, but a dead person's organs can wind up being transplanted virtually anywhere in the country. Ridiculous plot. I hope nobody is stupid enough to imitate this pathetic movie in real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I expected something else of this movie. A bit more "supernatural". And after seeing it - a bit less naive.The story is great - I admit it. The way the viewer gets to know the main character is really worthsome. You know that he's doing everything in his might, just to ease his moral pain. And that's where the movie forms. Moral responsibility. How often do we hear about one killing dozens while ramming into a bus stop? When do we hear or see the true regret? We take it as a day's bargain in novadays. That's sad, but true. From the beginning of the movie you can sense it - that final devotion, that goal Ben has set for himself. Whilst the form of it may become a subject of discussion (this is the place for discussion,really :P), the moral motivation of the character is at least modest.I'd make the whole movie a bit different. To be honest, I'd make the whole movie different. Ben (to us) should not die. The amount of good he produced after his traumatic events shouldn't be stopped by his sacrifice - It should continue. If that was the case of this film, I'd give it 10/10. Ben comes, Ben sees, Ben does, Ben leaves and the cycle starts over. This would be proper. Of course giving all he has (regarding organs) is great, but not possible, to be honest. I'd rather see Ben leading Ezra into an intimate relationship with a woman, instead of giving him his own eyes (let's skip the medical problems).To sum up - what we have here is a decent movie with a lot of heart-throbbing moments, where our GF will cry into our shoulders (or b-f's in those more "liberal") and those Will Smith believers will say - "Gosh, he can act".To be honest - there were no honest Oscar roles in this film, but it delivered. In every aspect. If you are reading in in 2009 - BUY IT. It's worth the price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds of Bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well. What is it? What is it about Will Smith that I just can't stand any longer? I guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an Oscar. I understand how bias this is, but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons I can't ever see him winning one. He's a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor. He's just not. I give him credit for trying so hard, and being able to cry at the drop of a hat. That's about it.Seven pounds was kind of an eyeroller for me, right from the start. The suicide 911 call didn't intrigue me in any way. I wasn't curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some decent on screen chemistry. Also, I don't know her name, but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife. Woody Harrelson had very limited screen time, but I'd say he stole the show whenever he was on.All in all, just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot. I couldn't help asking myself the whole way through why I cared about any of these people. Never once felt sorry for 'Tim/Ben'. He killed himself with a jellyfish? Was the only survivor in an 8 person accident? Geewiz..didn't see any of that coming...5/10 is pretty generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen more interesting things on the side of a bus. This film is for the type of person that licks windows. Me and a friend picked this film apart in the space of 45 minutes to an hour. Do you know why we did that? Because, it really is that flawed and easy to pick apart. The fact that this film has a 7.7 rating honestly upsets me. Right now let's go through this, the film starts off bad and somehow gradually gets worse. It moves with about as much pace and interest as a dead ant. If you're meant to love the character of Tim Thomas (Ben Thomas) but guess what, we don't care who is who because the fact he stole his brother's identity is the most pointless side story in movie history. Are we supposed to connect with a character where, less than 10 minutes into the film he is shouting at a blind man. Not just shouting at him, he is also insulting him and making his life a misery for that minute. Then, later on in the film, he helps him out. Now, are we supposed to forgive him for the way he spoke to him at the start of the film. How can he decide what type of person he is through such little interaction. Cut to the chase as well, the character of Tim Thomas (Ben Thomas) gives him his eyes after committing suicide. His eyes change colour and unless I'm mistaken, he can miraculously see. This is like something out of a cartoon. It is more inaccurate than a bad guy with a gun in an action film. Let's get one thing straight as I can't be bothered picking this film apart for another 25 paragraphs, this film is not beautiful, it's not moving, it's not soul stirring, it is downright bloody sadistic and boring. Rant over. Thank you and goodnight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salvation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Thomas (Will Smith) hunted by the guilt of the death of his wife and seven others in a car accident, seeks 7 good, decent people and saves their lives by donating his organs to them, eventually a unique and remarkable relationship emerges between him and the people he helps however the story ends when he donates his heart to a girl that he begins to love. The idea behind the movie and the way Tim behaves is kind of rooted to Christian tenets since he seeks peace by punishing/sacrificing himself and he gives whatever he owns "including his own life" to people in need (just like Jesus Christ). An important point here though is that he seems to be extremely depressed and in need of help, it is painful to watch someone seeking peace by destroying himself yet Tim deals with his griefs in his own way with a remarkable temerity, and finally finds salvation. Some great symbolic scenes are presented as well such as: donating your heart/ your life to a girl you love, committing suicide by a jelly fish that has roots in your memories with your father and in the end a blind guy who can look at your love by your own eyes and your love standing there staring in your eyes while your heart is beating inside of her chest. It's a great movie, and definitely worths watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb movie especially if you think that maybe you've had enough good fortune in this world and maybe you should do some "paying it forward". I liked the slow steady pace of the movie, easy to watch, a few puzzles as to why he is doing what he is doing. But it all becomes slowly clearer until you know who the lucky people are that he meets and finds. There is so much sadness because you know he is a good man and deserves to have a good life, but at the same time you know he wants to atone for what he did. The ending is particularly touching as the main recipients find each other and recognise each other. This really is one of those films that can be watched over and over especially when you are feeling a little sad and want to wallow in your sadness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is based on the emotion that follows the audience long after the end. A strong drama, with a good amount of thriller, necessary for the story line, which is being unfolded slowly, to keep the interest up through out the whole movie. Great performances structure the main body of the movie, along with the emotion. The plot circles around the story of a man, Tim or Ben, who has killed seven people in an accident, including his fiancé. From there, he starts an odyssia in order to find the right persons to give a gift, the gift of life. The human drama and the remorse mix perfectly with the simple scenes, that hide, however, the importance of life. Nice soundtrack gives an extra note to the film. All in all, a film that deserves to make you cry.</fullReview>

Not as good as Pursuit of Happiness but still very enjoyable and Smith and Dawson seem to have a special chemistry in this film that makes for a very moving experience. Barry Pepper also does a nice job as Smith's friend.

		<fullReview>Cannot recommend this film highly enough. Will Smith is amazing in it along with Rosario Dawson. Directed by Gabriele Muccino who also directed Pursuit of Happiness again one of my favourites.Seven Pounds takes the audience on an emotional roller-coaster and leaves you in suspense throughout. Will masterfully portrays a two sided character who on the outside acts with strength and conviction whilst inside is really in a state of grave depression and turmoil. The tone of the movie although clearly sad, is kept light hearted enough by Will's admirable demeanour who endeavours to bring hope into the struggling peoples lives he so amicably touches. The connection he builds between Rosario is extremely powerful and the audience is always left with this tantalising question at the end of each scene as to why he is helping these unfortunate seven people. The highly emotional ending answers this question in a starkly clear, but very touching manner. I wish Will keeps bringing out more of these kinds of films. Genius film, genius actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love movies that draw me in bit by bit and become more compelling as they go on. This movie definitely fits into that category.At first I didn't know what to make of it. I'm not a huge fan of Will Smith as an actor and the jumping around between different dates and scenes in the opening twenty or so minutes threatened to put me off. But as the movie progresses the behaviour of Will Smith's character, Ben, is so intriguing that you find yourself hooked. As the relationship between Ben and Emily develops, and the plot builds towards its extraordinary denouement, Will Smith comes into his own as a wonderfully complex and torn character. This is definitely his best acting performance that I've seen to date.My only criticism is that the movie ends so neatly and cleverly that you feel the realism is sacrificed in the end in favour of a good plot. But in a movie that makes you feel such anguish the way this one does, who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable penance, yet phenomenal performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I sat to watch Seven Pounds and within a few minutes, I was able to predict the beginning, middle, and end. Of course, some minor details were not within my crystal ball, but the movie quickly became proof that trailers are giving away far too much of the story. Even still, I sat with the intent of providing Smith with my undivided attention.In fine fashion, Will Smith puts forth a performance worth of an Oscar, Rosario Dawson was phenomenal, Woody was completely believable, and Barry Pepper delivered in a way that seems to be all his own. I knew what was going to happen. I knew why it was going to happen. I knew that predictability could be derived from the title alone. Even with that in mind, I watched the movie, was taken aback at how well each part was performed, and I cried.The depth of this movie and the interpersonal connections made between characters sucks you into their world. While a perceptive person knows what must happen to fulfill the story's needs, he or she will find hope for a situation otherwise. The connection made between Smith and Dawson is one that rivals Romeo and Juliet under completely different circumstances.If you have not seen this movie, you are missing out. If you've seen it, but did not like it then you should watch it again and pay attention the next time.This movie is fantastic far beyond the plot line. The cast pulled a mediocre story together in a way that could not be done as well by anyone else in the industry. Smith, Dawson, Harrelson and Pepper deserve awards that have not even been invented yet. Well done, lady and gentlemen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is an outstanding and very UNDER RATED movie. Those who didn't like this movie probably have a mis-understanding of what it means to show compassion towards other people. From the special features commentary, that came with the DVD, the movie's concept was mildly based on an actual event. Seven Pounds has to be watched, not from a critical eye as to whether this movie achieved this or that, but, from the point of view of someone who is telling their story and you are the viewer. If you ignore the few negative reviews, and enjoy the movie for the compassionate theme it's portraying, you will have a better appreciation for life that transcends the daily problems we sometimes face. The chemistry between Will Smith and Rosario Dawson was great. The movie flowed well; and, the accompanying music enhanced the essence of the feelings being conveyed. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't let the trailer (for this movie) mislead you; the movie is not as suspenseful as it is made out to be; Seven Pounds is more about Love and Compassion. I hope you enjoy the movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My ex-girlfriend recommended this one a while ago. Luckily I caught in on TV.I think everyone knows something about the story, so I won't focus much on it or give anything away. It is a story about guilt, choice, redemption, love, hope and sacrifice.Some movies are just full of heart. Created from the heart, acted from the heart, and felt by the heart. This is one of them. If you are an emotional person, and/or have had tragic events in your life, you should see this one. The more you can relate to the characters, the more you will be moved.Will Smith is great in this one. He doesn't just "do the job" and cash the check, he really is astounding and very believable. All the other actors too are good. Woody Harrelson had a little screen time, but he really made the scenes work and provided quite a punch. Directing is done like it should be done. The story is told just right. Every scene has a purpose, and they never give too much away at once, or too little. So the handling of the story is done very well. Some may think the movie is too slow at times, but I think it is just perfect.There are millions of people who can relate to this film. I am one of them. "Seven Pounds" is a touching and a sad movie. It can make you cry, but it will also make you think about your life, someone else's life, or just life in general. But while this is a sad movie, it also has a warm heart and has a strong sense of hope. That sense of hope never goes away.I'm recommending this one to everybody. Even to those who usually don't like drama, because I believe these kinds of stories need to be seen or heard. This is the best movie I have seen this year, period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was lucky. I came to this knowing nothing about it. For some odd reason, I had avoided the press and those trailers that tell you the whole story.As a result, I was able to simply flow with the story, the way the writer intended, not knowing what was coming next. I had the full mystery, that complex of mysteries that were set out for us. I found the writing amazingly deep. Sure, there are what would be called deep themes: love, redemption and both in novel forms. But its the way the thing is unfolded for us that I find so special. Will Smith does not annoy me. He's a sort of everyman token, like Jimmy Stewart, or better: Fred MacMurray. He does well enough. His true value here was in discovering the story and assembling the team, a competent enough team. The story is by itself enough for me to recommend this to you.The cinematic treatment is something else though. It could have been magnificent. It could have been eviscerating; it could have encircled your heart. There were lots of hooks, written in simply for the camera. That business with the jellyfish is a visual setup, smoky and translucent. The concept of the auditor, who "sees through." the idea of the communication (via texting) that leads to disaster ? the message gone wrong. The idea of love as a bodily giving. The notion of brotherhood allowed via waiting outside.These are the things that cinema was invented for. It has been ready for material like this for eons. Someone needs to transplant this in a stronger body. Someone needs to be the embossed printer.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant! Will Smith pulls it off again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that has affected me this much. It's hard to categorize what genre it fits into, but if I had to try, I'd say it's part drama, part mystery, part romance, but mostly, it's all inspirational.The storyline is hard to figure out at first, as we follow Will Smith's character, Ben, drifting in and out of the lives of 7 strangers. Why? At first we have no idea. But that's the point. Only he knows why, and only he knows the plan that's formulated in his head. These strangers are all people who aren't living easy lives though, this much is clear. Another thing that's clear: there's a tragic event in Ben's past, one that he's struggling to get to grips with. And the manner in which the whole "mystery" comes together and ties the strangers to Ben, is one of the most satisfying emotional journeys I've ever been on.The performances are all well above average, but this is Smith's movie from start to finish. The roller-coaster of emotions that cant etch on his face at any given time are truly remarkable, as he once again displays his full acting range and proves himself more than just an "action star".Some have accused this movie of being "emotionally manipulative", and while I don't disagree, I applaud the movie for having the courage to affect one's emotions. Once the storyline starts gathering pace towards the climax, it would be an unfeeling viewer who isn't touched in some way or another by the events taking place on the screen. I can admit, I surely shed a few tears. And I definitely rate this as the most thought-provoking, powerful and heartbreaking movie I've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So everyone acted well but the premise was ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I saw The Machinist a short time ago but the character of Will Smith did not make any sense. He did not seem to be remorseful for his victims whom he killed because he read his phone. There seemed to be no repercussions for him. What he did after the accident seems like a slow death. It seemed very manipulative indeed. Why did he choose to spend almost all of his time with the woman with the dog? That did not fit with his mission at all. How did he match up with the others so well and so conveniently? How did the woman rise to the top of the list for donors? The reality is that he could not guarantee her his heart, nor Woody Harrelson his eyes. Rules would most likely have eliminated both of them.Someone else wrote that he could have done so much more to satisfy his remorse. I did not find any demand for tears from this movie, both of my eyes were dry. There was a movie called All Mine to Give from the 50's which was a real tear-jerker and this movie was in the same mold but could not generate one tear from me. I think if the movie had been straightforward and let me know what was happening in time with the events I would have given it more stars. But much was hidden for manipulative reasons and it was unabashed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an homage to this film, I'll write this review on my blackberry while driving.At 123 minutes, this film manages to stretch a 45 minute concept quite a bit beyond where it needed to go. This story would have made a great 90-minute made for TV slot (66 minutes of actual film). Viewers are given so much spare time on while watching that we all can collect together the various cuts we would have made to perk the thing up without losing any story (like every scene with his wife, for example); and do it in real time as the film crawled along.I am pleased I stuck through the tedium of the first 115 minutes, because ***spoiler*** the last 8 minutes where the threads of the script were tied together were very nicely done. Even though we can all debate considerably whether suicide is the right solution for anything. ***end spoiler***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very preachy. So if you don't like being preached to, forget about this movie.There are major let downs in this movie. Will Smith stars as...well... Will Smith, you know the same character from Happiness, Bagger Vance or any Will Smith drama. I'm not saying Will Smith is bad, I like him. However this character is getting tired and overused. I'd like to see him make an 'evil' turn in a role. I hear he might be doing the OldBoy remake, pray to God that's not true.Woody Harrellson is criminally underused, getting about 10 minutes of screen time. His character seems real, and you just wonder what his life was like really.Rosario Dawson gives a nice performance in this movie, as she probes to find out more and more about Smith, even though he won't budge.I won't give it away, but there's obviously a twist, and some of the viewers will cry and buy into it, and most will be a little bit ticked off. Then the reason for the twist surely will enrage everyone. It's so so pretentious and we realize Will Smith's character is just pouting and feeling sorry for himself unable to get on with his life. I hated it.A high note for me is the score. I loved it, it was typical drama movie, but just well executed and I feel that no other music would have fit in. I was tempted to give it 4/10, but it doesn't deserve it. 3/10</fullReview>

If you're prone to sobbing to a film, get a towel because this one is a doozy.It tells the tale of Ben Thomas, who works for the IRS, he wants to offer 7 acts of kindness to 7 strangers. As the movie progresses, you figure out more into Ben, and this is the movie's strongest point. As you get to know Ben more, you almost feel connected with him. The film builds up over course to a brilliant finale, which I won't spoil.I feel the that there are no gripes with this film whatsoever, but this does not make for a good film. The music in particular really shines and I do encourage you to buy the soundtrack, it really inspire you to do good onto others.Please check this film out, and have a box of tissues at the ready.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too much of Will Smith, for one. The story became quite predictable. The director wanted to keep the suspense until the very end, but didn't succeed as far as I am concerned. Also, there was nothing gripping either. Throwing unrelated people and scenes together doesn't make a story gripping. On the contrary, it gets annoying.The director, obsessed with keeping the suspense until the very last minute, hasn't done a good job in telling the story. Instead of Will Smith moving the story forward, it could have been moved forward by the recipients, each telling his or her side with relevant back stories. Still not original, but at least we could have related and appreciated the donor and the recipients a bit more.Anyway, it still is worth watching, but at home.Just wondering - are your organs still useful after being stung by an ultra-poisonous jelly fish?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that the film is well made and has an interesting but pretentious narrative structure with good music that really does help is making an emotional scene. Now onto the bad stuff. And there is a lot. This film is totally obsessed with Will Smith. Even the poster is just a big picture of his head! The whole film just constantly shows this unrealistic god like character who is nicer than Jesus walk around improving the lives of everyone he stumbles across. I mean, there's a blind guy in it who apparently will never get a girlfriend and always be a virgin unless he's helped by the hero ,Will Smith, who can give him his magical all powerful eyes! Now that's just offensive to blind people! Loads of blind people have girlfriends and what kind of message is that?! Bind people will be forever alone if they don't have the eyes of Will Smith?! In the end, the blind guy gets Will's eyes and only because of this, gets a girlfriend as the girl is Will's ex girlfriend and only likes the blind man because of his new eyes. This is just one example of this 'Will Smith is Jesus' rubbish that is actually offensive.The next big problem is how pretentious this film is! It thinks it is clever with a deliberately confusing narrative structure full of pretentious enigmatic lines despite not having a complex plot at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The What If Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I can think of for the negative reviews is the idea of suicide. We don't seem to be a society that looks at repaying its moral debts, but are used to going to our religions for forgiveness through our chosen advocates, therefore lacking personal responsibility for the way we live our lives. What if...we were morally responsible and repaid our debts? I am going beyond economic debts, but the deeper ones, the emotional ones, those deep scars we leave upon the lives of others.7 pounds takes the repayment of wrongs to an extreme level that would challenge the fabric of our society as it is set up. The "what if" game is taken to a level that asks all of us, as an audience, not would we do the same, but not to judge what someone would do if they had a power to correct the wrongs inflicted upon others. Perhaps to some, they would get too wrapped up in not being able to undo the past to ignore what he did to help in his present. In a second, his perfect world came undone, to throw himself in the lives of others. He made it his mission to change the fates of others.The story is well told, to let the viewer figure it out for themselves. The pain of living. The choice of giving. To leave with your balance sheet cleared instead of simply saying, "I'm Sorry." There may be many that are horrified by this story and feel very uncomfortable with it, however, you only feel uncomfortable if you watch it thinking, "I wouldn't do that." Maybe that is precisely why this is such a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's actually quite a sad movie, but NOT depressing in the same way "Buried" was (not even in the same league).This one should not be confused with one of those "feel-good"/"heart-warming" movies. This is essentially a tragedy.I was quite impressed with the acting. I think this is the only move I've seen, where Will Smith is playing someone other than Will Smith.I have to say I was HUGELY disappointed, though, when it turned out that Tim was doing all that stuff simply because he felt responsible for his wife's death. I mean, come on! I was expecting him to turn out to have committed some horrendous crime in the past, but... a car crash? Very disappointing.Also, I thought Rosario Dawson's character acted a little too inappropriate for someone, who has such low self worth ("I'm unremarkable in every way and don't deserve a heart") and is almost dead anyway. The way she constantly flirts with Tim and gets angry with him because he won't talk about his past relationships... it's just unrealistic. Not sure whether the actress or the scriptwriter is to blame.I thought the blind guy's character was far more interesting, so I would've liked to see more of him, but, sadly, most of the screen time is given to Rosario Dawson's character (who, in my opinion, was the LEAST interesting out of the other 6 people Tim was helping).Other than that, the movie was pretty good in general.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone; especially those, who enjoys drama.</fullReview>

The film that proves to me that Will Smith really is able to act and has come on leaps and bounds since is very work. An extra-ordinary tale written Grant Nieporte who should write more. This also isn't Director Gabriele Muccino first time working with Mr. Smith as they previously paired up for 'The Pursuit of Happiness', which tells me Muccino really does bring out the best in Will Smith. Smith plays Ben Thomas in this film, a man with a plan. Who will stop at nothing along this journey that really pushes him.

		<fullReview>To be honest with you, I created this whole IMDb account to write my opinion on this film. I saw many other reviews saying this film was full of awful acting and that the plot was too straight forward etc etc etc... The people that write these reviews, however, despite them clearly knowing their stuff, are just too analytical. It's easy to criticise any film if you analyse it from top to bottom aggressively, which isn't what films are made for. Films are made to be enjoyed, and if you watch Seven Pounds without thinking about everything too much, it's absolutely stunning.The plot is quite simple, but that isn't always a bad thing. It does all it needs to do in bringing across the main themes and isn't too long- winded for it to be ruined. I'm not going to review this film any further because then I'd be getting all analytical as well. All I will say is it made me cry. And I'm a 16 year old boy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Seven Pounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you know the true meaning of the movie "Seven Pounds"? I was very impressed by this phenomenal movie and the deep meaning that goes along with this heart pounding film. "Seven Pounds" came out December 19, 2008. It was directed by Gabriele Muccino and written by Grant Nieporte. The stars of the movie are Will Smith, Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson. At the beginning of this movie I was a little confused but once I got deeper into the story, I was pulled in. There would be little clues throughout this movie, but it seemed as though none of them fit together. As the movie goes on and you reach the end, the story makes complete sense. I believe that "Seven Pounds" is one of those movies that everyone should see because of its amazing actors, its amazing true meaning, and its astonishing plot, that once you figure it out, you will never forget it.My expectations for this movie weren't very good to be honest. Before I started to watch the movie I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch it. I had heard from other people that it is very sad but it has great meaning to it. I decided to give it a try anyways. Now that I have watched the movie, I am very happy I decided to. The acting is wonderful and the plot is even better.In "Seven pounds I was very surprised at how well all of the actors did with their parts. One actor in particular that I'm thinking of is Will Smith. Will Smith shows off some of his most impressive acting skills in "Seven Pounds". I have always been a big fan of the way he can really show you the emotions of the character he is playing, and he can make you believe that it is reality. In this movie in particular Smith does an awesome job. He brings the life to a character by the name of Bill. Bill caused a fatal car accident by texting and driving. As a result, this accident killed seven innocent people, including his fiancé. This tragedy created a huge impact on Bill's life. This caused him to turn his life around and help seven deserving people. These seven did not realize that someone was watching over them and that one-day their lives would completely change for the better. Bill disguised himself as an IRS agent so that he could talk to these people personally. As he talked to them, he decided whether they were worthy of his help or not. Will Smith does an amazing job in this movie as his character Bill. He made it feel like I was actually in the movie.There are many good parts to "Seven Pounds" that start to reveal to you what the plot could be. I loved how the writer of this movie slowly brought you into the complete understanding of the shocking plot. He does this by brief encounters between Bill and the seven people he plans on helping. One person that Bill wants to help is a girl by the name of Emily. Emily has a deadly heart condition called Congestive Heart Failure and eventually she will need a new heart. As Bill gets to know this enticing girl, he can't seem to stay away from her. Before he knows it, a feeling of unconditional love for Emily hits him, and the pain of the car accident seems to diminish. Bill has a life changing choice to make between love and the want to help. When I got to this part in the movie I was completely shocked, wondering what would happen next, and it pulled me deeper into the story. Another one of the main characters that Bill encounters is Ezra. Ezra is a blind meat salesman who plays the piano. Ezra shows up at random times throughout the movie and the directors did a wonderful job revealing that Ezra will be one of his seven people that Bill later helps. The first time that Bill and Ezra talked was when Bill called the company the Ezra works for. Bill said some hurtful words to Ezra about his being blind and that he isn't a good person. Later, Bill realizes that what he said wasn't right, and his apology to Ezra would be a sensational gift that no one else would ever think of giving. By the end of the story between Ezra and Bill, I was completely in love with the story line. Like I said before, I loved "Seven Pounds" because of the astonishing plot and the actual meaning to the movie. The true meaning to "Seven Pounds" is to learn from your mistakes and take advantage of these learning experiences by putting them into action. Bill created a horrible accident and learned a ton from it. He learned that even though he took the lives away from seven innocent people, he could also save the lives of seven innocent people as well. All in all, this movie is on the top of my "favorite movie list" and I suggest that everyone should watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redemption X 7</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard mixed opinions about Gabriele Muccino's 'Seven Pounds' but I still wanted to see it. Though there have been films made on similar themes, 'Seven Pounds' takes a slightly different approach in telling the story. Now we already know in the beginning that Ben Thomas wants to commit suicide and I thought that it would have been better if Muccino didn't give out the spoiler at such an early stage but on the other hand it keeps the viewer interested as to why he wants to kill himself. For me, the reason wasn't difficult to predict as this is quite obvious from the flashback scenes. However, I found the Ben and Emily characters very interesting.Of course it helps that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson have electrifying chemistry. Smith is once again restrained and he's only more vocal when the role require him to be. He seems to be pretty good at this (as is evident in 'I Am Legend'). Rosario Dawson is equally terrific as a patient, with congenital heart disease, trying to make ends meet until her world turns around as Ben makes his entry. Woody Harrelson is brilliant in a tiny but likable role.'Seven Pounds' is a well made movie. Muccino uses a slightly washed out blue toned look to create a gloomy atmosphere but it does not look overdone. The cinematography, soundtrack and editing are very good. Grant Nieporte has penned a solid screenplay.'Seven Pounds' is a film about redemption. It works as a character driven and story driven piece. Some might find the theme a little too heavy but it's more than worth the watch.</fullReview>

I confess that I am not much of an emotional person, but this movie made me cry, and I was totally in awe of Will Smith's character.People take unimportant things in life very seriously, they worry over petty things like money,shoes, ipod's, and even more idiotic stuff, but never do people realize that these things matter the least. Look at people who are dying this very moment, who are ill with cancer, who can't get up from their beds, do we ever realize how fortunate we are? When I ask people, what you want to do in life or what you want to have, they plainly say with budding hope in their eyes "I want to go to MIT, then I wanna join a Multinational Company and Become a big player in that company", They forget that we have an implicit duty of making others happy, helping the sick and lighting the lives of people, why can't people talk to helping others in life? Why only MIT or MONEY OR ANY OTHER BULSHIT. GROW UP PEOPLE, REALIZE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Whole Lot Of Tragedy In Too Short A Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most would agree that a tragic film such as this will somehow carry it's own weight, yet Seven Pounds seemed to leave me profoundly depressed and wishing that the story would somehow leave me uplifted. The film somehow fell short in delivering a redemptive message it set out to do.******** A real Spoiler ********** Will Smith proved himself as a solid force to be reckoned with in the industry and has impressed me in many other wonderful films. His character, Ben, is a very lovable guy that seems to have entered into a period of enigmatic crossroads in life. Given his desire to be helpful, it doesn't seem fit that he would pose as an IRS agent to deliver up some kind of blind love for redemption. When a freak accident killed seven people including his wife, he really did search, but found no answers.Although you might think it was a flashback to some other point in time, Ben was a very successful engineer with a high paying job. When his trouble began, his brother, who was with the IRS, allowed him to use his identity and pose as an IRS agent long enough to track down potential beneficiaries of his live organs after his preplanned suicide. I'll be the 1st to say damn!In Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Shilok the Jew, wanted a pound of flesh in payment for nonpayment. This leads us somehow to the thought within the play where we get the speech about "the quality of mercy is not strained, but droppeth like the gentle dew from heaven upon the place beneath". Therefore, we get the old adage, "An Ounce Of Prevention Is Worth a Pound of Cure."The anger &amp; frustration that Ben feels when he finds that his empathy and compassion towards someone in uncertain health circumstances is betrayed is very believable, although, if he feels any compassion towards those people at all, he should soon become aware that all of us are not going live a perfect life and that desperate times can lead people to desperate measures. His pact with his friend and his quest to end his life and somehow prolong others is a noble challenge to take on, however, he should leave this kind of work to Almighty GOD. Even so, Science seems to deliver many blessings to those in need, however, the real tragedy is that man created science in order to compensate for his fall from grace(sinfulness).The tragedies in this film are quite intense and make us aware that we are not immortal, yet we somehow are made to feel that Ben is trying to discern the reasons why good things happen to bad people while bad things happen to good people.There were nice touches left here and there within the main body of the film that pushed you to love this guy regardless of his inner drive to be some kind of angel or GOD's supersaint. We knew he was disturbed from the start of the film, but didn't really know why. In my opinion, it would have been a much better film if the director had left off the first scene. That way we would not have had any idea where his character was going.The jelly fish death leaves us thinking, "How could you die and still be fresh". Well "Not because he was the Fresh Prince", but this has to do with just the neurotoxins of the brain.Many of the supporting actors compliment this film, such as Woody Harrelson playing the part of a physically challenged individual who has lost his sight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart warming tale &amp; a great performance from Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say I'm the greatest fan of the work of Will Smith, but if he continues to produce performances like this I may have to change my view. I found him really engaging in the part of Ben Thomas, a tax collector with a heart? and a secret. There was the occasional glimpse of the clown he's better known for, but these were fleeting enough to ignore. I have noticed he has matured in the last few performances I've seen, The Pursuit of Happiness (2006), which I wasn't too enthralled with, and I Am Legend (2007), which I quite liked. But enough of Mr Smith, I'll tell you a bit more about the film.Ben Thomas is a troubled man, we see him ranting at a telephone salesman, Ezra Turner, for no apparent reason. He has flashbacks of an incident in his past that has obviously affected him deeply. He talks on the phone to a man, possibly a lawyer, about a plan that they have as he goes about his business as an IRS tax collector. He helps an old woman in a nursing home to achieve some dignity after her doctor is less than caring. It's almost like he's looking for good people who are worth saving from the circumstances they find themselves in. As part of his search he finds Emily Posa, a young woman who has tax problems and a heart condition. The pair become friends and, when Emily collapses due to her condition, Ben stays by her bedside, which brings them even closer. There is also a sub-plot where Ben's brother is trying to find him, exactly why I will not say, but it's fairly crucial to the plot. I really can't say any more without giving away crucial plot points, so I'll leave my little synopsis here.I have heard good reports about this film, and so was quite keen to see what all the fuss was about. A very well made film with quite a slow, deliberate pace. The music was pretty good too, but if you put the band Muse in the soundtrack, I'm bound to like it! A great performance from Will Smith as Ben Thomas and honourable mentions also go to Rosario Dawson as Emily Posa, Woody Harrelson as Ezra Turner, Michael Ealy as Ben's brother and Barry Pepper as Dan Morris.I wasn't aware that the director, Gabriele Muccino, had also brought us The Pursuit of Happiness (2006), which I've already said I didn't much enjoy. I was pleasantly surprised though, not just by the performance of Will Smith, but with the film as a whole. There is quite a sense of mystery at the beginning which sets the wheels in motion, unfortunately this cannot be maintained all the way through and it does get a bit bogged down towards the latter third. But very enjoyable none the less with a really great ending that may have you in tears! Over all, a really good, heart warming tale and a film I can recommend.My score: 7.4/10</fullReview>

Lapsing into deep untreated and undiagnosed depression, he embarks on a journey of self-destruction via organ donation, leading to impersonation and lying, eventually committing suicide to enable the final two recipients (one of whom has fallen in love with him) to benefit from body parts that are necessarily harvested post-morten.Worthy End, but horrible and immoral Means. A study of the arrogance that can come from untreated mental illness. Certainly not an adult version of Pay It Forward, no matter how good his chemistry with the female lead. Disturbing, thought-provoking, and challenging well-made movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds of Barf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith as a big-hearted tax collector who decides to kill himself with a jellyfish. I wonder if that's how the original pitch went. In the meantime, he decides to donate his organs to seven deserving cases because he caused the deaths of seven other people by reading a text while driving. Currently 7.7 on IMDb - spooky! And also about seven times what it should be.I suppose the theme is 'redemption'. Will Smith is going to have to donate a lot more than his organs to redeem himself for this pile of dreck. And when I read the late lamented Roger Ebert's 3* review, it put me on to Melville's 'Le Samourai' (qv) which is also a bloated, overrated, pretentious waste of celluloid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super boring movie, with Will Smith just showing off his acting skills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't for everyone, some may like it some like me may absolutely find it dull and boring. It's basically all about Will Smith's acting, he basically tries super hard in order to show off his acting skills. The plot may be a feel good thing, but it's just so freaking boring to watch and feels so freaking narrow. I will admit some of the performances is pretty darn good, but besides that there really isn't anything positive I can say about this movie. The content and substance doesn't even weight seven pounds, it's just a very narrow and boring movie. It ain't even a good heartwarming movie, just boring. Most people probably wanted a refund after seeing this film in theaters. It's a film for Will Smith to show off his acting skill nothing more and even that wasn't anything amazing.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds! I want a refund...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never written a film review before. Having just watched Seven Pounds, I had to somehow release the pent up frustration that built up over the last two wasted hours of my life. I really like Will Smith (not in this film... obviously). I really, really didn't like Seven Pounds. You know the way the films you love encapsulate you from the onset? Well this one doesn't do that. In parts of the film I almost expected little text boxes to appear stating 'This is the bit where you should cry, please' or 'This is the bit you should think of how great life is and how you're going to go jogging in a beautiful sunset to show you appreciate the small things' or 'This is the bit you should feel the main characters deep pain and struggle and remember your pain and struggles in life and how you've had to overcome them'. It was all so forced to the point it became kind of surreal. Will Smith's character drenched as he runs through the pouring rain. Will Smith's character 'testing' the poor blind guy whom we all feel so sorry for because he's just a nice person. Will Smith's character giving his house to some lady he just met?! Oh Come on! That's not serious! No one would do any of those things... unless of course they were conscious of the fact that they were in a Hollywood blockbuster and had to do something unbelievably heroic and tear jerking. It was all just really implausible. I don't know... maybe it's just me.A search for good people?! What's that about? The next person to test me to see if I'm a good person is going to get a punch in the stomach! And then thereare the flashbacks of a tragic past. Oh come on.... That's not good is it... not very original. Obviously, no ideas are original but by the end that whole notion was just really boring. I was bored. I don't want to over slate the film but honestly I just thought it was really bad. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea. A film about goodness and the importance of goodness and how we should all be good people cause that's all that matters. Sounds kinda like scientology. You do good things and get like points for it or something...Pursuit of Happiness was good and I expected more from this. Didn't get it so I was disappointed. Will, you're going to have to go with someone else for your serious films. This guy.. Gabriele Muccino? Naaa.The lighting was good though... so if you want to watch a film with good lighting... Seven Pounds is the one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meaning of entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest this is the first time i'm writing a review. I always tend to consider a movie a way of entertainment. I mean, that's why they are an art, because it's supposed to make people enjoy it. And there are different kinds of enjoyment, of entertainment. Some movies make you laugh, some make you think, some make you cry, but nevertheless they are a piece of art and people pay for it. They pay because they want to be entertained, nothing more. That's why the movies were filmed. But sometimes there's one kind of movie that maybe makes you cry, and laugh, and think, and jump, and cry again, and at the end you found something new. You found meaning in every scene, in every word that was spoken. Seven Pounds is that kind of movie. I don't care about the critics. They are just a guideline, a way of knowing whether a movie is worth my money or not. Lately I'm finding hard to agree with any of the critics of recent movies, specially this one. They look at every detail. I look at the whole picture. They try to find and understand how the movie was made. I just care about the why. Why it was made. And again, most of them are just meant to make us laugh. That's enough, at least for me.Will Smith just demonstrated with his performance that his is up for much more as I'm convinced he will. I believe that no matter what, Will Smith will never win an academy award, just because his too cliché, just like any other Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. No matter what they do, they never do enough for the critics. But I don't think they care at all. Yes, the movie is slow and it only really starts to be comprehensible after the first hour, but every second of it is worth every penny. Because Seven Pounds is real and it could happen to anybody. The question is, how would you react to it? His pain is too much to hide and the guilt is unbearable. And while you watch it, you feel it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i would say that like most people commented about the movie being kept hidden until the end it wouldn't be that much appreciative, WORTH watching if things were revealed from the beginning and the director did what was suppose to be done for the movie. this movie is JUST SUPERB simply to say, WILL smith proved his acting skills once again i think after "Pursuite of the happiness" it made me having tears in my eyes. Rosario Dawson was just beautiful i would say she acted the way character needed not overly charmed not low kept but just the way EMILY has to be. the chemistry in between 2 were simply heart touching. and EZRA on the other hand couldn't able to occupy most of the scene but what the character presented in the film is a fact that in todays ABUSIVE, IRRITATIVE world still some people live simple, calm lives with LET GO, ignore it attitude. i just love the way he reacted to will smith call.i think people do mistake and sometime their mistakes leads to the destruction of many thats what the movie showed but if one is STRONG enough to give himself another chance in life by helping others with all possible ways he can then he isn't questioned for his mistake in after life.all in all its AMAZING, SUPERB, ASTOUNSHING, BRILLIANT movie i em thinking more words to concatenate with my PRAISE sentence. :) its an overwhelming experience. great JOB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw Emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow...I don't know what to say. I just watched Seven Pounds. No one can make me cry like Will Smith. The man is very in-tune with the vast range of human emotion. This movie was skillfully and beautifully done. Rare to find such intense humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare it to "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way. Definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. I have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one. Not usually one for a "bad ending" but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion, raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around. Therefore I do not mind a little pain at the end. It is true to life that there aren't always happy endings. Sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be. Many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost. If you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you'll love this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Affecting performances by one and all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although a tear jerker it is definitely a "feel good" movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith as always, does the job and does it well. I could go on but pick any ten of the "10" ratings and they've said it as well and likely better than I could. BUT, since I must include at least 10 lines to post a comment I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. Her performance was most enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come.AND, this film demonstrates that Will Smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting. It gives out a moral message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I see on this film, I see a lot of comments, which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad...What I really want to point out is the acting on Woody Harrelson behalf, he may not be in many parts of the film, but when he appears or even the intro, I was astonished by Will Smith's and Woody Harrelson "message" they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on.I am not a very sentimental person, I believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it. But a act to show redemption, there is not many films that in my point of view can show this. This is one of them that can.I agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of "suicide" is a downfall, however I do not believe that is the "message" the film is trying to send, but "sacrifice". A bit to the extreme, but that is the message in MY opinion.This film has potential. The acting it is worth every penny, the script is unbelievable. from a person that doesn't really like watching drama films... if you like drama this is a must go watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a wonderful movie. It touches every fiber of a human being. The love in the film is very intense. I thought it was Will's best performance to date. Great directing. Liked the editing. Music was great. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie everyone should go see. I hope people will get something wonderful from this. Overall, excellent movie. I think Hollywood should make more movies with substance. Even action films can have a caring story. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his acting. He had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see. I would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about. For me, I found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film. The outside world was suspended for a moment. It was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world. And with this me generation it was great to see something(someone) that cared about other people more than himself.</fullReview>

He has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen yet. I watched it on Saturday and I still cannot get it out of my head. AMAZING and sad all at the same time. Thanks again Will. You must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie. You cannot miss a thing.

		<fullReview>The emotional impact of this movie defies words. It is elegant, subtle, beautiful, and tragic all rolled into two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures into his acting ability, the full range of it. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to Smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, I'm not sure, but I view him differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief. Don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice.</fullReview>

It's been almost 24 hours and I am still completely affected. This movie left me questioning my own self. How can I possibly compare myself to a character such as Ben who is totally selfless. I loved this movie. I love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end. I feel two emotions predominantly, happiness and sadness. An amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too. I so wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end, they were, forever. If you haven't seen this movie, get it and watch it. Just make sure you have no distractions. You'll want to see every nuance in this picture. One for my library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a movie perfect for Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching 10 minutes of the movie, I said to myself,"wow I think Will Smith will finally get an Oscar for this one". I remember watching "The Pursuit of Happiness" and can't help but feeling something missing from Will Smith in that film. And after watching this one I finally know what that "something" is, anger.Throughout the movie you cannot help but wondering what is Will so angry about. Is he revenging for something or planning to do something bad. Because in today's society we have come to learn that when something seems too good to be true, it probably is. And that is exactly what this movie have achieved, an emotional struggle. So if you feel negative toward Will character, it will portray what kind of person you are.I firmly believe that this character can only be played by Will Smith alone and for that reason he deserve an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Official "SEVEN POUNDS" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie did not get the attention of previous Will Smith movies. Not because it was not good, but it simply had... poor advertisement in my own opinion. The movie starts out with a hook and keeps you reeling in for the answers the entire movie. I would not say this movie is boring at the least, but not completely entertaining either. It is although very confusing throughout and really, until the last 20 minutes or so, you probably won't know what the ultimate goal is for Smith's character. Which I believe is a good thing, as most movies produced today are typical, cliché', and rather simple to predict. The writer did an excellent job executing the possibility of predicting the final outcome of the story. Keeping the audience guessing and theorizing until it finally starts to unfold. Harrelson's character which has a minor role in this film, in which I wish it was more, is known as Ezra. The exchange Harrelson and Smith have in the opening scenes of this movie, are so emotionally acted out, that it almost brings you to tears before the opening credits even end. I think the movie had an excellent cast, excellent story, and excellent acting. I would recommend this movie to friends, but watch out, it isn't for anyone. I couldn't see many teens enjoying this film, because it is very slow-paced, but at the same time, like mentioned above, in an entertaining manner. Most teens only want to see action, or gore... so watch out who you recommend this film to. It will have you in tears by the time the credits roll and the curtains are drawn.-Z.CAPTON</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds was released at the obvious time of the year to push for an Oscar. It's exactly the kind of melodrama that the Academy loves, but it doesn't look like it's going to win one, which is a shame, because this is one of the most original and brilliant movies that I have seen for a while. Whilst confusing, almost infuriating for the first hour or so, you always get the feeling that there is something more to come, and it delivers in astonishing style. If you're logging on now whilst watching this movie, bored and frustrated out of your mind, keep watching. You won't regret it. Smith's performance is notable, but the plot is the real winner here. 9/10.</fullReview>

The plot of the movie was confusing in the beginning but got simplified later, the storyline was pretty simple but the way of presentation was just fabulous.Hats off for Gabriele Muccino.The co-actors did full justice to the roles given to them.Woody Harrelson did a great job in the role of Ezra.I would just say that this is a movie that you should not miss.Its more than worth your money.10/10 Keep Up the fantastic work Will.

I've been reading many of the comments here on this movie, and seeing how many they were and how they did it justice speaking in superlatives I was thinking..."Hey what could you say more, that hasn't already been said about it?". But then further I've seen some negative comments, of which some clearly pointed out that the authors never even SAW the movie in the first place. Or they saw it and they're incredibly dumb and didn't understand anything. Anyway I decided to post just to join the choir of voices who praise it and say that this is Oscar material indeed. What I loved most about it was the fact that after the first minutes I FORGOT I WAS WATCHIG A MOVIE, and that hasn't happened in a while. I usually can't help judging more or less technical flaws in a movie, yet this one really managed to do what any movie should, that is sweep you inside the magic it creates and keep you there till the very end of it. Will and Rosario are great together and there is so much substance in their characters. The whole concept of self-sacrifice lived literally to the very end is striking, powerful and overwhelming. I won't say more except that anyone who loves those really great and beautiful movies that come out once in a while should not miss this one, 'cause... this is what brilliants are made of.</fullReview>

I didn't like it at first because I didn't understand what was going on but after the movie started to get going, then it became a great film. There are many flashbacks in this movie that I didn't know were flashbacks at first and maybe that was confusing. Then as the movie started to get better, it became more sad and tough to watch. When I somewhat knew what was going to happen, it started to become very dark and at the same time very heroic. Will Smith does an incredible job playing Ben. When Ben and Emily are laying in bed and he tells her about the future, it's like I needed my seven pounds of tissues because this was really heartbreaking.</fullReview>

"No! Surely they wouldn't be lame enough to go there? Surely they aren't going to have our hero playing God and forcing a hideous debt upon these nice people?" This is what I kept chanting all through the second half of the movie. But no ... they went there.

There's no REASON for it.Story: Will Smith was in a car accident which caused the deaths of everyone involved, and so now he's guilt ridden and suicidal, and decides to donate organs, body parts, and houses to people to help them.Apparently all of this is supposed to be deeply impactful and emotional, and other stuff like that. I don't know if it was Will Smith's acting, or the writing of the story or what, but about the only emotion I felt was the one that made me shake my head several times during the movie. I guess the ending just had no value to me because all I kept thinking about was how we just came nearly two hours for THIS. Two hours of confusing, meandering, mysterious story telling all just to reach this point.Complaints:**I respect Will Smith, but there's one thing in his performances in dramatic roles that I don't care for, and that's that look he does when he looks like he's trying to suppress tears. Let me be clear, all his other faces are fine, his dramatic face is fine, his sad face is fine, his sympathetic face is fine, every face he makes related to the sad category is just fine. It's his TEAR-SUPPRESSING face that is completely out of the question. It just looks so forced. It's like he's consciously moving his face like that, you can almost see him making real-time decisions on which facial muscle to move next. He needs to tone that down a bit. **Well, speaking of faces, it was silly having Will Smith have that sad face the whole movie. I just explained that his sad face was OK, while his tear-suppressing face was not. This is still true, problem is, it's completely unrealistic to have him with the sad face the WHOLE MOVIE. At any given time, he looks like he could easily be led to tears. From the movie's perspective, how can ANYONE in his universe take him seriously? He literally acts like a mentally handicapped teenager who's on the verge of crying at any given time. Maybe we don't know people as sad or depressed as this, but I just can't imagine any adult with this kind of blatantly sad look affixed to their face permanently, no matter how depressed.**When his brother found him at the end, Will Smith was trying to convince him to please leave. He said, "just go home, you have a beautiful family, go home and join them." What a bad line. With the weight of the situation, do you think giving your panicked brother such a simple directive is going to get him off your back??**I hate the scene where Will Smith indignantly brings the dog into his motel room. They're portraying this scene as if a previously oppressed person is finally standing up and opposing the injustices done to him, but Will Smith is 100% wrong here. The motel CLEARLY has a no large dog policy, yet he still boldly takes the dog into his room, as he utters the ridiculous line "show me the no horse policy" to Manche from Prison Break Season 1..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie lacked too many things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching a drama, I look for, among other things, how well you get to know the characters. This movie failed on this part. The characters were paper thin, I could care less about them. The story had two hours to develop the characters and the movie did not do it. There were so many places that the movie had to develop the characters, but instead it put in bad dialog. Instead of developing characters, the movie played on your emotions, seemingly hoping to cover up the many failings of this movie by trying to make you cry. It does not matter how many times a character cries during a movie, if I do not feel for the character, I do not care why they are crying.The story dragged along during the two and a half hours I sat in the theater. I looked at my watch several times to see how long I had sat in torment. I never check my watch during movies.Another thing that I enjoy during movies is the chance for a director to astonish me with their ability to show you something beautiful with the camera. There were a few scenes that could have been neat, but there was too much wasted space on the screen. It seemed like the director had an idea, but did not take the idea far enough. I wish I could have seen some shots that were breathtaking, but there were none.My synopsis is this: the movie was terrible, it had bad dialogue and no character development. If you wish to see a good movie, don't go see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't write comments very often, but this time I had to add an opposite view to the quite homogeneous comments that all praise this movie. This movie's intentions are quite obvious - to make the audience cry - and the means by which they are or shall be achieved are probably copied directly from the book "emotion driven screen writing for dummies". Actually I think that the principal flaw lies within the screenplay. The dialogs the people are having, the life stories they have or tell about, the motivations by which they are driven seem to have been used in thousands of other movies. Therefore they seem flat and so cliché. Although the actors do a good job and the music is not bad either, the movie unfortunately remains pretentious kitsch for me. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

It is badly written, so that one doesn't really engage with any of the characters. Will Smith, in trying to convey his character's guilt and sorrow, just looks like a pouting, surly teenager -- you want to slap him and say "Get over it". Rosario Dawson tries to deliver a realistic interpretation of a poor, courageous, dignified woman but fails -- mostly because her breast implants are so distracting. Geez! Get a decent plastic surgeon.The last 20 minutes are just sappy. In the end I wanted everyone to die. Especially the writer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, Gabriele Muccino's project is rather mediocre. The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end: hearts human and emotional, eyes physical and metaphorical. Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro González I?árritu's Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with lots and lots of flashbacks. The problem is the story is quite predictable from VERY easily on through the movie. That's too bad, because Seven Pounds could have been as authentically "good" if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Thomas is an IRS auditor but, just lately he has been pushing the limits of his job, using his judgement and perhaps tweaking things to help people. These people appear to be random and his motivations are not clear. At night he stays alone in a cheap motel room with no real possessions apart from a powerful, haunting memory from his past that comes to him in his quiet moments. He appears to be planning something bigger than his day-to-day actions but, as he works towards this, he finds himself befriended and falling for one of the people he has helped, Emily Posa, who is fighting for her life with a heart condition.The grand sweep of the film is emotional ? I will grant you that. Certainly on paper this SOUNDS like this is going to be a real tearjerker with a gut punch to the audience and a lot of people have gotten into it and have found the film to be great ? with a few suggesting a Best Picture nomination is somehow deserved. I have to disagree because for me the film squanders the potential it has and doesn't deliver in the way that the material could have worked. The problem begins early on with the mystery over who Ben is, what he is doing and why he is doing whatever it is he is actually doing. This I found to be intriguing and interesting for a while but, outside of the final reveal, it doesn't move forward as much as I would have liked and ultimately the effect on me was to make me start to lose interest in the characters ? kinda a big problem when it comes to a film that needs to emotionally engage the audience like this one does.The final third is better than what goes before because things do come together and are revealed , which brings the plot to an end ? but not a lot more than that. As I didn't really feel for the characters, I was left curious to see what happens rather than being genuinely moved by what transpired even though, on paper, I knew that what I was watching was meant to touch me deeply. It is a shame that it doesn't really come together as it should because the cast do try hard to make it work. Smith in particular is pretty good and it is not his fault that I didn't come to feel for his character ? it is the narrative structure that prevents it. Cynically he is in "Oscar" mode but only now and again did I think this, mostly I just thought he did what he had to do. Dawson is more natural but then does have an easier character ? she can do "light" effortlessly but this alone was not enough to convince me of her relationship with Smith's Ben and this is a bit of a weakness. Outside of these two Harrelson, Pepper and a few others drift in and out but to no real impact.Seven Pounds is a bit like Slumdog Millionaire in one way ? in a two-line summary the plots of both are incredibly corny or hackneyed. The difference between the two films is that Boyle's film draws you in and delivers in a way that makes the hackneyed material work while Seven Pounds simply does not. The manner of delivery doesn't draw the viewer in, which means that the performances being good or not doesn't really matter and, by the time you understand what Ben is doing, you probably don't care enough to really be moved by it. The melodramatic and polished sheen will make it a good daytime cable movie but it is far from being as good as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-dramatized vs. Over-simplified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I considered myself to be quite melancholy, especially when I watch a great touching and tear-jerking movies. But not for this one (which surprised me!) and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly.There are several disturbing facts throughout the movies: 1. Despite guilt-ridden Ben's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action. Some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly, in the end this was a disturbing action to me.2. The movie story line is over-dramatized, but the logic is over-simplified. Medically, blood type match is required to be an organ donor. Toward the end of the film we learnt that Emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period. Nevertheless, it seemed that Ben had the rare blood type, same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently, despite the rarity of Ben's blood type, he was able to donate not only his heart, but also his kidney, his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen.3. Why the doctors allow Ben's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself?I might be over-analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie. However, some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie. If you go for a soap-opera type of film, go for it. But it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment, give this one a miss!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a waste of time and talent. Please save your time and money and stay home...not that the acting is not outstanding, because it is, but the movie itself is a mess. The message it sends is terrible. Two wrongs make a right and that the way to take care of guilt is to punish your self and manipulate everyone around you so you feel worthwhile. There is absolutely nothing beneficial or positive that the movie has to say about life, human nature, or anything else. It is probably the most selfish action ever demonstrated in a movie but it is clothed in fake-selflessness. The camera work is great, the acting is wonderful. Will Smith and Rosario Dawson are totally believable. We went to the movie thinking one thing from the previews and seeing Will on Jay Leno. We almost walked out of the Theater. We always go to a movie to help celebrate the Holidays but I felt like I needed a shower when I got home. Will, you have a great future as a "serious actor" but not with movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>emotionally flat, illogical, morally disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SEVEN POUNDS: EMOTIONALLY FLAT, ILLOGICAL, MORALLY DISTURBINGThe movie was distributed in Italy as "Seven Souls". I was curious about the original title and, after some research, I found out that it refers to Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, where the usurer Shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant Antonio, who will have to give him a "pound" of his flesh, in case he is not able to repay his debt. Whereas the Italian translation makes Ben's plan something deeply human, characterized by human sympathy, the original one, though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone, makes it, just in its reference to the flesh, something cold, rational, deep-rooted in the physical side of man. Unfortunately, I think that the real quality of Ben's plan is revealed by the original title: it'a a cold machination, aimed at "donating" parts of his body, but lacking any authentic human empathy, at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie. The only exception is the love-story with the girl, which seems to be a sort of non-programmed incident, to which Ben yields, but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement. I really didn't like the idea at the core of the movie: the idea that a person, however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused, takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide: besides being improbable, it makes no sense. I would have liked, and I think it would have been more positive if, in the end, Ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living, thus helping those same people, and maybe many more, just standing near them, and helping them through his presence. He wouldn't have saved their lives miraculously, of course: this would have probably caused more suffering, but I think it could have been more constructive from a human, and moral point of view. There are many illogical and disturbing things: the initial reference to God's creation in seven days (which, by the way, according to the Bible, are six!): what does it mean? And what about a woman suffering from heart-disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad, who can have normal sex with a man who, feeling, as it should be, destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body, doesn't seem to feel so much tried, both emotionally and physically, from his impaired condition? The movie is saved by good acting, but all the rest is pure nonsense, not only from a logical point of view, but also from a human and emotional one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This contains spoilers: OK, this was supposed to be an emotional tear-jerking film...it wasn't.Watching someone slowly kill themselves even if it's shrouded in "good deeds" isn't entertaining.The disjointed plot line doesn't really keep you guessing. There are enough clues in the first few minutes of the film to tell you that Will Smith's character has some terrible guilt and wants it all to go away. And in his guilt he wants to make life better for random people. I was kind of hoping that the people he was helping were all related to the victims of the car crash but nope...they were just random people.I also guess that we're all supposed to be vegans now since two of the characters were vegans. He was also just sitting in the hospital and there just happened to be a white board behind him and there was written "vegan." I wonder how many people left the theater thinking, "hmmm, veganism, think I'll give it a try." This was one of the most depressing films I've ever seen. It didn't make any profound points about life or make us reflect on our own lives.The typical signs of a serious suicide include giving away valued possessions. So this wasn't some moral tale about giving back or anything. They simply took the suicide template and took it to an extreme.The only positives was the acting. The acting was pretty good but there's little else.Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith is a sensational presence on the screen, no question about that. I'm longing to see him in dramatic parts worthy of his talents. "Ali" and most of all "Six Degrees Of Separation" showed what he is capable of. Elegant, ironic, Cary Grantish. Even here in this maudlin "message" movie he manages to inject some kind of truth. But the film is a manipulative, opportunistic (it opens just in time for Oscar consideration)tasteless, silly and confused tale about redemption. If I didn't leave the theatre in the two or three occasions I was about to, is all due to the magnetic power of Will Smith, so much so that I teared up because the sincerity about his sincerity was so amazingly, overwhelmingly sincere. However Oscar is not going to fall for this one, as he did last year with a similar enterprise conducted by the same Italian director. I understand Will Smith's need to be meaningful but somebody should explain clearly the meaning of the word.</fullReview>

This movie will not be for everyone...it moves slowly and may be confusing..until you figure it out...then the reality of his purpose will crush you emotionally and at the same time it is so beautiful....SWEET PAIN (it did for me anyway)....Seven Pounds is a wonderful movie that will stay with you long into the night and next day.....Thanks</fullReview>

This movie is about finding, as selflessly as you can, the next best plan to living with that guilt, and - even though "Ben" may have gone to THE M.I.T. - the incapability of building a Time Machine.Like was mentioned in the movie itself, Seven Pounds is; "The What If" game. What if you, KILLED your happiness, so stupidly... What would you do? How would you live with it? And if you couldn't live with it... Would your suicide method, simply be; shooting yourself in the head... So you may die, as selfishly as you lived?!?Seven Pounds has a compelling message... It's not about religion, it's about forgiveness... It's about pain.Hardly any movie is perfect, true, but, Seven Pounds was gripping.27%... That's absolutely ludicrous. Switching those numbers...

If not for this role, for any future movie her performs in. Frankly, ever since the days of the Fresh Prince, I have liked pretty much everything he has been involved in.But enough of making this review about Will Smith only. The movie is good to great.

		<shortDescription>Suicide is Not Painless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A distraught man phones in his own suicide to a 911 operator, and the scene shifts back in time to a series of seemingly unrelated events. Ben Thomas, well played by Will Smith, berates a blind call center operator, helps a Latina and her two young children escape an abusive boyfriend, and pursues a young woman with a failing heart, all without apparent motive and in the guise of an IRS agent. Along the way, Thomas repairs a vintage printing machine, has heart felt-talks with his loving brother, and dispenses gardening advice: banana peels. Perhaps "Seven Pounds" sounded like a heartwarming tear-jerker on paper, but the film is contrived, unconvincing, and evokes little emotion or feeling for the characters.Unfortunately, the film wastes a fine performance by Will Smith, and, while Rosario Dawson is fine as Smith's love interest, her role is basically a repeat of her turn in "Rent." Woody Harrelson is also on view, but his role is too brief to register. Director Gabrielle Muccino maintains a steady pace, but the events often seem random and disconnected, confusing already confused viewers. One minute, Smith is turned away at the hospital for arriving outside visiting hours, but later shows up in Dawson's room in the middle of the night, and later spends the night at her bedside, unchallenged by anyone. The 50-year-old printer that could not be repaired by experts is working fine after a few minutes tinkering by Smith. Dawson's heart is too weak to pump blood when she walks, but beats just fine when she warms the bed with Smith.There are likely worse ways to pass two hours than "Seven Pounds," but viewers may come away with eyes sore from rolling them at the final revelations. Perhaps soft-hearted sentimentalists may be taken in, but, aside from Smith, the film is instantly forgettable, except for the unique suicide method, which must be a cinema first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gabriele Muccino directs this touching drama that stars Will Smith and Rosario Dawson. Muccino is the man behind The Pursuit of Happiness (2006), which also stars Smith along with his son, Jaden. If you've seen Pursuit, you know it was the film that put Muccino on the map here in the US. That film was fairly successful because Muccino was able to bring the drama in a way that seemed natural and down-to-earth. It's an element that's missing from the lackluster dramas coming out of Tinseltown these days. And while Seven Pounds (2008) is not as well-known or as big of a hit as Pursuit was (heck, I'm just now seeing it in 2015), it is still just as good. In Seven Pounds, Will Smith proves once again that he's matured into a very good actor. Although he did a respectable job in Six Degrees of Separation and Enemy of the State, most of Will's hit films during the early part of his acting career saw his playing an over- the-top, goofball character. So, it was very much hard to gauge Smith's ability to play anything more than the one-dimensional character he portrayed in his biggest hits of the '90s. Well, the turn of the century saw him playing more serious roles in movies like Ali, I Am Legend, I Robot, The Legend of Bagger Vance, and of course, The Pursuit of Happiness. In Seven Pounds, Smith plays Ben Thomas, a severely troubled IRS field agent who takes "do-gooding" to a whole new level. He goes around giving individuals he deems as "good" people an extension on their tax debt. But under the surface, things are not what they seem, and Ben certainly has a motive for all the "help" he's dishing out. Ben ends up falling in love with a young dying Emily Rosa (Rosario Dawson), who is one of the recipients of his goodwill. Much of the rest of the movie follows the love affair that develops between these two. There are appearances by Michael Ealy, Woody Harrelson, Barry Pepper, and Octavia Spencer (pre-2011's The Help of course); however, none of these other characters are on screen for longer than 5-7 minutes total, and as such, we hardly get any back-story on any of these characters, so much so that they all can be written out of the script and it would have little to no affect on the story. The movie also drags quite a bit in the middle. That's why it's a good thing Dawson and Smith have excellent chemistry and are perfectly cast for their respective roles. The dialogue is pretty airtight too, and Muccino does a good job setting the mood. It gets 7 stars for great acting and casting, but the plot is too slow in spots; supporting characters are underdeveloped; it is overly preachy/sends a bad message about a taboo issue; and the big twist at the end really isn't a twist at all. You will pretty much figure it out way before the big reveal, and since it involves one of the aforementioned supporting characters, the intended impact it's supposed to have on the audience really isn't felt since there wasn't much character development for that individual during the film. It's a good watch though for a lazy autumn night.</fullReview>

It gets interesting with time, how he finds people with disabilities and keeps in touch with them.When the movie finishes, it just leaves you inspired. Only then the whole plot gets cleared that what actually was everything about.The gist of the movie which is amply applicable in real life is that it is very hard to live with the guilt rearing inside you. But in the movie he made his choice of paying for the mistakes of his past. But I assure you won't regret watching this movie at the end. It's definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven pounds is an American drama movie, released back in 2008 by Columbia Pictures. This movie is written by Grant Nieporte and directed by Gabriele Muccino, starring Will Smith, Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson. In this movie the main character changes the lives of seven people. Having a lower budget than other movies at that time, the 123 minutes long movie had made quite a bad impression to the critics but it was a box office success.I liked the movie title a lot, the fact of being pretty vague and mysterious chosen, I mostly chose the movies I watch by the title or the poster. After watching the movie I've noticed that the title actually has a significance because the main character has 7 gifts to offer. The movie director got his inspiration from Shakespeare's work in which the main character owes something to 7 people.First of all, the action begins with Will Smith being at the steering wheel of his car and sending someone a text message without paying attention to the road, this negligence made seven people die including his fiancée who he had a child with. This terrible accident kills him inside, making him face psychological problems. It is hard enough for him to take care of his child and his job but he's trying hard to manage for his family, or what's left of it.Second of all, destroyed by what he had done, he makes a decision to save seven people from death by donating his vital organs, which he finally succeeds to do by killing himself, but before that he announces his death specifying that he wants to donate all of his organs to the ones in need.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been that one girl that is sat there with a blank expression while everyone else is crying at the end of the 'no.1 tearjerker this year'. So i decided to just put on Seven Pounds as i'd heard it was good.I was well and truly blown away with this film from start to finish. It intrigued me from the moment i put it on and i felt myself losing track of time in it's endless changes and twists throughout the film. Its ability to tug on every heart string you have just enough to push you over the edge truly sends you in to a blubbering mess (and that's coming from a stone cold monster).However, this is no easy watch; if you aren't concentrating you will spend the entire time asking questions and you won't be moved half as much; which is obviously this film's aim and in doing so it will be a complete waste of time. It is also a little slow to start, though every second is worth it for the last 30 minutes.I would recommend this film to anybody that wants a moving, Oscar quality, fantastic film. Leaving you crying at the end with a sense of warmth and true satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is about a man who goes on a journey to forever change the lives of seven strangers.First of all, the first scene tells you what happens at the end of the movie. It spoils the entire movie. And there's a lot of foreshadowing.The acting was good, which is probably the only good thing about this movie. Rosario Dawson should've been at least nominated for the 2009 Oscars. But it had many clichés and it was slow-paced.What really bothered me was that they barely even showed Will Smith helping out the seven strangers, the entire movie was focused in his relationship with Rosario. I just couldn't wait till it was over.I liked the montage with "Muse - Feeling Good" though.Overall, the movie was slow and boring. I would not recommend this movie or watch it again.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This took me a few days since I watched it ? almost a week ? to finally put my feelings together. For a movie that only wants to provoke emotions, at least it worked. Only?not where they wanted me, I believe. See, it's hard to write anything without giving away the major spoilers/twists of the film, but to be general, I hated the last part of the film. I'm guessing I was supposed to be teary eyed, and joyous for the "helped" individuals, but in reality, I was thoroughly upset and thought it was 1000% preventable. In fact, all the way through it, I was hoping for the best?and got the worst. The movie was well made, despite the all-over-the-place/try-and-catch-up first hour and had excellent acting. Too bad the message is so bad and ruined the experience for me. (Speaking of potential spoilers, I am SHOCKED he was not arrested initially ? or his cohort later on. But, that's our society. The wrong consistently get uncharged.)</fullReview>

Specially when a person dies because of us.. This movies makes us think how much we love all people who love us. Also this movie makes us think that what we're going to do when they are gone.

		<fullReview>First time I saw this movie I gave it a 8, now I give it a 10. The why is simple, I could finally see this movie with subtitles and understand it in all his meanings. The cinematography is AMAZING, all the shots are perfect and they are perfectly married with a great soundtrack that makes this movie a real masterpiece. Usually I don't write reviews but this movie pushed me to write one. Today I had 1 hour free so I wanted to express how much I loved it when I saw it again last week. Will Smith deserves a Oscar, I don't know when but he will get one. He can cover ALL THE ROLES. The director made a great job too, I think he is Italian but I am not sure. The only thing I would have sped up a bit was the editing, sometimes the movie had to be sped up because it was going too slow but I mean, we are talking about little details here. As I said, this movie is amazing and it touched all the right cords.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely emotional and subtly dark. Solid performances and execution to cap a very interesting story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand why some people might be offended by the way this movie portrays suicide as heroic (sorry for opening on the spoiler). But hey, if you're gonna die, there aren't many better ways to go about it. It's possible to predict the ending, but it won't make you enjoy the movie less if you do. This is because the whole movie is about Ben/Tim setting up his donations, and how it all comes together at the end. This also makes the ending on Ben's death feel less forced than it might in something like Gladiator or Dead Poets Society, since the plot up to that point did not necessitate that the main character die. Though suicide seemed like a bit of an extreme way to amend for his texting and driving (which, by the way, is presented in a way that is a lot more effective than any disclaimer or seminar you can go to on the subject) it is the only way for him to give life to Ezra and Emily, and just before he puts himself in the bathtub with the box jellyfish he tries to see if there is any other way for Emily to be saved.The film is very moving in an emotionally horrific way. One of the things that struck me the most was the way that Ben behaves personably and even optimistically toward the people he helped and encountered, but then starts choking up as soon as he thinks they aren't looking. The other people he encounters do this to an extent as well, which I think was probably an unintentional point of symbolism for the filmmakers. At first, it's rather difficult to tell what his intentions are, but that doesn't make it confusing. Another thing that made me uncertain as I watched the movie was the fact that he had only helped a couple of people by the one hour mark and he had to get to seven people judging by the tagline and title. So for a little while I wasn't really sure how everything would work out with Emily getting so much screen time.Though the story is more plot driven than character driven, the characters are a very large element. Ben of course has a lot of depth since he's got his deep, dark secret and everything. Emily Posa's personality is very well developed in a short time. Ben's brother was probably the worst written character, but even he had some depth and such. Ezra had a bit of development, along with Dan. The other minor characters, being the other people he helps, the motel manager, and the lady at the hospital that he contacts, are not developed, but come across as very human in their brief screen time.The acting is solid all around, with Will Smith giving the standout performance as usual. The score wasn't award-winning, but wasn't bad for what it was either. The camera-work and editing was nothing spectacular, but the suicide scene at the end was very well shot.This is an inspiring movie, but not a feel good movie, so think carefully before you watch it. Don't watch it for fun with a group of friends and definitely watch it under conditions where you can hear all dialogue without trouble. It's kind of good as a family flick since it will generate lots of discussion, but it might be a bit of an emotional overload for anyone younger than about twelve. Heck, there are probably lots of adults that can't handle some of the concepts. So grab your popcorn and tissues and set aside a couple of nights to watch this film. Overall Rating: 8.4/10. P.S. If you start to lose interest partway through, I highly recommend that you see the whole thing, though I've included so many spoilers that you've probably already made that decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh man this is easily one the worst movies I've seen in a while. They did absolutely nothing right with this one. It was a pretty cool concept too. I could totally see this kind of movie working. But they screwed it up bad. The movie follows Will Smith as he tries to find suitable people to donate his organs too and he eventually meets Rosario Dawson and they get a thing going. Not a terrible idea by any means. The guy wants to give his organs to people. That opens all sorts of doors for your movie. You can have the movie ask all sorts of intelligent questions, like "how do you determine if someone is good or bad?", and "is Will Smith justified to judge these people?". You can have Will Smith develop a strong, emotional connection will the people he's donating too and make for a very engaging film. BUT. They didn't do any of these things. Actually they did the exact opposite. They basically turned this into Will Smith and Rosario Dawson reading a really bad, awkward sounding script while they stand there and look bored. They force a relationship between the two and they focus on that instead of building ties between Will Smith and his organ recipients, and it makes for a ridiculously boring movie. Neither Will Smith's or Rosario Dawson's characters were written with any sort of personality, so you can't really care about them at all. You're stuck with them the whole movie too. It's just painful to watch. Everything else was done incredibly lazy as well. From directing, to editing, to music choice, from cinematography, it's all really, really bad. All this combined into one movie results to one of the worst films I've ever seen. Stay away.</fullReview>

The lawyer is played impeccably and his lack of emotion early in the film makes his emotions later even more pronounced.As human beings, we have so many things that drive or motivate us. 99% of the time, there is no conflict and we just move through our lives. No purpose. No focus. Just going through life. This is an entirely different way to look at your life.Please see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. This film is very deep and compelling,it really makes you think about your own life and how you've treated others in the past, I found myself questioning if I was a good person, and you know you're watching a really good movie when they make you think something as serious as that. The casting of Will Smith is perfect, there aren't many people that could pull off a character like this, as he is very flawed and at many times unlikeable, but because of Smith's charming and likable personality, we support this character, despite the bad turns he makes and even the harsh things he says. The audience is not sure of the characters motives for the majority of the film, which I really loved, because movies like this usually will spoon feed the audience immediately what the character is doing and why he is doing it, but for in this it is quite confusing, and it keeps us more interested in the story. It is almost like a poem, it always has a message to bring us but we aren't too sure what that message really is until the end, but you'll only find that message if you're looking at it beyond what's right in front of you. At times it is feel good, and other times it is very depressing, but the whole time it is a clever and unique film, and I would highly recommend Seven Pounds to anyone looking for a good drama. A man who is hiding a dark secret decides to deliver acts of immense kindness to seven people who really need it. Best Performance: Will Smith</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better to reveal the secret from the start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haunted by a mysterious past, Tim Thomas (Will Smith) is looking for good people to help for atonement. He steals his brother Ben (Michael Ealy)'s IRS ID to research various people. He donates organs to various people. He finds Connie Tepos (Elpidia Carrillo) who is being abused by her boyfriend and gives her and her kids his home and car. He also researches Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson) the blind telemarketer and Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson). However he falls in love with Emily. His old friend Dan (Barry Pepper) is obligated to help him in his tasks.The movie is a little too precious with the secret. It's not that surprising of a reveal anyways. The movie is better off giving up the secret right away so the audience can count down the people he is trying to atone for. At least that would create a bit of tension. This movie has no tension at all. It has no suspense. Like I said, the secret generates no tension. The acting is fine. One of the problem with withholding the secret is that Will Smith berating Woody Harrelson scene causes confusion. There is an interesting dark character study if only the filmmaker is willing to trust it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think what makes this movie so unlikable to most people is the fact that it's just so sad and depressing. Watching a self loathing Will Smith try to hold back tears as he goes about his final mission for an hour and a half got to be a bit much. Great performances all round though; Rosario Dawson is very good as the kinda girlfriend with the heart condition, Barry Pepper as the best friend is heartbreaking and Woody Harrelson's character, although well acted was just plain confusing.I did like how this movie made little sense in the beginning, with random characters, stories and brief flashbacks before it all comes together in the end (others will probably hate this though) but I like trying to figure things out. I found the end scene with the box jellyfish in the bathtub very disturbing. 02/13</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: Seven Pounds of Emotion and Sensitivity!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds. Will Smith scores big time with this mysterious emotional drama about sins of our mortal life and the ways of redemption.The movie has its strength in its emotions and carefully done drama which has a lot of soul but it does it mysteriously so that you keep guessing what it is all about. Will Smith gives another powerful performance like he gave in The Pursuit of Happiness. Rosario Dawson supports Will wonderfully in emotionally intense scenes. If you buy the complete transformation of character of Will Smith, you will not complain about his unbelievable good deeds. Deliberate slow pacing, interesting conversations and authentic setup help you soak the emotional intensity and care for its characters.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Seven Pounds. If you buy its premise, you will be moved immensely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story rolls out in a very peculiar way. The flow isn't very clear about the present and past scenes. At the beginnings, the scenes don't seem to correlate one another. These things make the movie feel like a detective or crime movie. The mood is kept at a softer feel of gloomy ambiance, all thanks to Will Smith's constant acting on putting that sad look on his face almost all the time. The ending is very much predictable, thanks to the constantly sad mood and the bigger bits and pieces of information shown clearly all the entire movie, yet it's spread all over it so one might need more experience to track back previously shown scenes. Yet the finale is really a great way of fooling the viewers, because for me it shows the small details right in front of me but I couldn't grasp it until the finale rolls in. From what I've seen, Will Smith has acted better. For comparison on the similarly plotted movies, I personally prefer his performance is I Am Legend. Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson did quite a good job here, although I must say that theirs too here are not the best performance they've done so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm pretty sure I saw a trailer or perhaps some small clips of this film while it was out and about at the time, and thinking it looked interesting, and the leading actor cast was appealing, but later I saw low and mixed ratings, but I had to see for myself, from director Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happiness). Basically Ben Thomas (Will Smith) hides a dark secret, he was reading a text message while driving which caused him to crash the car, seven people died in the accident, six strangers and his fiancée Sarah Jenson (Robinne Lee), and a year later he has quit his job an aeronautical engineer and he hopes for redemption by saving the lives of seven good people. He starts by donating a lung lobe to his brother (Michael Ealy), who is an employee for IRS, and six months later he donates part of his liver to Holly (Judyann Elder), a child services worker, he is now searching for five other candidates to receive a donation of some kind, he finds junior hockey coach George Ristuccia (Bill Smitrovich) who needs a kidney operation, and a young boy named Nicholas (Quintin Kelley) who needs a bone marrow operation. Ben calls on Holly to help him find others who need help, and he is pointed to Connie Tepos (Predator's Elpidia Carrillo) who lives with a abusive boyfriend, she denies any help of any kind and urges him to leave, but she does later call him from his business card, he gives her the keys to beach house to move with her children into, but with the proviso that she never tells anyone how she acquired the house and never tries to contact him again. Ben steals his brother's credentials and looks for the two final candidates for some kind of donation, he finds blind piano playing salesman Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson), who earlier gave him a random call, and he only decided he was worthy of some help after deliberately trying to harass him and the man stayed calm throughout the call, he helps by helping him to have an eye operation to perhaps give him back his sight. The final candidate is self-employed greeting card printer Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) who has a rare blood type and a heart condition, Ben spends time getting to know her better, including weeding her garden and fixing some equipment, he knows that her condition is worsening and will definitely have a donation, but he finds himself falling in love with her as well, something he had not planned on. Ben's brother catches up to him and demands his credentials back, and he has his past coming back to haunt him, despite doing these great generous acts, so he fills a bath with ice water, to preserve his vital organs, climbs in, and putting a box jellyfish in the water to sting him and complete his suicide, his friend Dan (Barry Pepper) will ensure his organs will go to Ezra and Emily, the two meet each other at an event and are tearful for what Ben did for them. Also starring Tim Kelleher as Stewart Goodman and Madison Pettis as Connie's Daughter. Smith in this film is doomed to stay pretty much still faced and sad, pretty much no cheeky smiles, Dawson is alright as his love interest, there is only a glimmer of connection between them, and co-stars Harrelson and Pepper don't do all that much, this film was blatantly made to cash in on the pulling heartstrings concept, the problem is it doesn't completely work, the story is not fully thought out, the generosity of the lead character is good, but the atonement here is perhaps a little much bordering on ridiculous, the film if I'm honest was almost too dull, a disappointing drama.

		<fullReview>The movie is stirring, one of its kind. It is one of those very few movies which move you emotionally. It may fail to develop interest initially, but the latter part is bound to make a hit. The story is distinguished and is very much praiseworthy. The movie is not a highly recognized flick, but it should have been, because it deserves to be. It carries a slow pace, unable to produce the urge to watch it in its first minutes, but if you can manage to allow it some time, chances are less that it won't impress you. Coming to performances, Will Smith plays a restless man who is unhappy with his past and wanting to make good. And as usual, the man doesn't disappoint. Rosario Dawson, as the female lead is prodigious. Woody Harrelson, in a supporting role as a blind man has been amazing in spite of getting a short screen-time. Other minor supporting roles played by Michael Ealy and Barry Pepper too have been fair.Editing and Direction, both have been towering. Gabriele Muccino has finely portrayed a ravishing story on the big screen. The screenplay is absolutely worth admiring. Editing has been unique. The movie doesn't reveal the story customarily, but it lets us know about it little by little, which is commendable. Watch it because it's beautiful. You may not have a positive feeling about the film during its first half, but believe me, you'll be probably in tears by the time it ends. Invest a couple of hours watching it and I assure you it will leave you in high spirits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could this be a desperate attempt to prove that" life brings death; death brings life."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever caught yourself texting and driving only moment before you look up just in time to save yourself from a horrific head on collision? Unfortunately for Tim Thomas (Will Smith), two years prior, found himself reading a text message while driving and causes a car crash in which seven people died: six strangers and his fiancée, Sarah Jenson (Robinne Lee).In attempt for redemption, Tim sets out to save the lives of seven good deserving people. A year after the crash Tim begins his mission by donating a lung lobe to his brother, Ben (Michael Ealy), an IRS employee. Six months after that he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named Holly (Judyann Elder). After that, he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations in a desperate attempt to find some kind of forgiveness in his wrong doing. He finds George (Bill Smitrovich), a junior hockey coach, and donates a kidney to him, and donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas (Quintin Kelley). Could this be a desperate attempt to prove that" life brings death; death brings life." The theme of this film is not teach a lesson to pay attention while driving or not to text and drive. This film elaborates on ones desperate effort to feel some kind of forgiveness for something he initiated in the past. Having taken the life of others, Tim wants to give back. In doing so he's willing to pay the ultimate price. He wants so bad to help others that he's willing to die for it. He's going to give everything he has to seven deserving people.Two weeks before he dies, he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. She suggests Connie Tepos (Elpidia Carrillo), who lives with an abusive boyfriend. Tim moves out of his house and into a local motel, taking with him his deadly pet box jellyfish. He later goes to Connie's house to speak with her about her problem, but she denies that anything is wrong, and asks him to leave. He sets down his business card, urging her to "think about it", as he is ushered out the door. One night, after being beaten, Connie contacts Tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house, with the stipulation that she never tries to contact him, and never tells anyone how she came to own the house. She takes her two children and moves into their new home.Having stolen his brother's credentials, and making himself known by his brother's name, Ben, he checks out candidates for his two final donations. The first is Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson), a blind meat salesman. Tim calls Ezra Turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger. Ezra remains calm and Tim decides he is worthy.He then contacts Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. He begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation. Some interesting contrasts to the film as this high-point of the film takes place is specifically lighting and angle. I found it obvious to me, having been in this class for six weeks, how the lighting and angle of a film can affect the "mood" or "atmosphere" of a scene. As Tim is headed to his motel it's raining and dark outside. The director decided it to be dark and raining because this was not a happy time in Tim's life. It was time that Tim had been waiting to happen for a while, this time was necessary for Tim because it's what he wanted. This lighting was dark, only lit by the street lights and raining as he calls Dan to assure him that "it was time". It was time for him to make the ultimate sacrifice and provide for his deserving recipients upholding the main theme. The lighting and angle reiterated the feeling and mood that Tim was having at that time. Tim leaves Emily sleeping after some intercourse and returns to the motel. He fills the bathtub with ice water to preserve his vital organs, climbs in, and commits suicide by pulling his deadly box jellyfish into the water with him. His friend Dan (Barry Pepper) acts as executor to ensure that his organs are donated to Emily and Ezra. Ezra Turner receives his corneas and Emily receives his heart. Afterward, Emily meets Ezra at his concert at a park, and they begin to talk. Ezra cries as they realize what a sacrifice Tim made for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most touching and well done if not the absolute best movie I've ever watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie... this movie.. from the first time I watched it until this day, I can't seem to get over it. very emotional, the story is just beautiful and very sad, it draws a picture of a high sense of humanity and sensitivity, the AMAZING performances of the cast specially Will Smith and the music all these made such an extraordinary film.I feel like I have to take the time to praise the abilities of Will Smith to take a character and live it with his all and present a piece of art. The expressions on his face says it all even without any dialog, the way he moves and looks with his eyes.. he made me feel how Tim was feeling, how drained, tired and in pain he was. Top Class. and Will Smith is like that for me in every movie he's been in specially the ones that have a story about human struggles in life. He's something special.This movie should have got several academy awards and it didn't. Such a shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds is a great movie to see if you like movies that keep you guessing and have a very strong emotional punch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is a great movie to see if you like movies that keep you guessing and have a very strong emotional punch. This movie shows how a particular man (Will Smith as Ben Thomas) deals with a dark secret about his past and how he attempts to make penance for this secret. The main them of Seven Pounds is retribution and atonement. This occurs by Ben helping people throughout the movie. It starts with Ben donating a portion of a lung to his brother. It then shows the other people that Ben has helped; a women who received a portion of Ben's liver, a man who received a kidney from Ben, a small boy that received a bone marrow transplant from Ben, a mom from an abusive relationship with two children that Ben gives his house to and Woody Harrelson (Ezra), a blind man that needs an eye transplant and Rosario Dawson (Emily Posa), a women who needs a heart transplant with little luck of receiving one.Ben spends the early part of the movie, checking people out to determine if they are good people and if they are worthy of the gift that Ben wants to give to them, the movie does show one man that Ben goes to determine if this guy was a good person who was worthy of being help. This man was a doctor at a nursing home, Ben determined that this man was not a good person due to he was not doing all that he could be doing to help fulfill the patient's needs. Ben started to talk to one old woman and realized that the Doctor was having this women punished by not washing and taking care of her due to she was not taking her medicine. Ben does not help this man due to he is not worthy of being helped. All the people that Ben helps, he get to know the people without letting them know why he is so curious about the issues going on in their life and he does not tell them why he wants to help them. Ben's brother (the actual Ben ?Michael Ealy) finally tracks down Ben to determine what he is doing and to get back Ben IRS credentials from Tim (Will Smiths real name) after Ben had a date with Emily Posa. After a romance filled evening Tim sneaks out of Emily's house (to avoid his brother Ben) he goes to talk to Emily's doctor about her condition and what is going on. He finds out that she is now on the heart transplant list but she only has a three to five percent chance of receiving a heart due to her blood type. Tim determines that it is time to put his plan into place. This ties in to the start of the movie when Tim calls in a suicide and the dispatcher ask him if he knows who it is and he states the victim is himself send an ambulance quickly.The themes that I saw in this movie were retribution and atonement ?this occurs by how Ben helps the people in the movie either with a gift of his house to remove a woman and her two children from an abusive relationship to giving a portion of his lung to his brother and a portion of his liver to a women along with a kidney and his eyes and his heart to all of the people that he deemed they needed help and they were good people that were worthy of his help and this would help make Ben/Tim feel better. The motif of this movie was how the circle of life works. Life brings death, death can bring life- shown by the actions of Ben Thomas in one of the flashbacks where he causes a terrible tragedy and how he determines to make amends for it. This is shown by how Ben will only help people that he thinks are worthy and a good person who makes a difference in the lives of others.This movie is similar to the movie "The Green Mile" due to each movie takes the time to set up characters and storyline so that the ending of the movie has a huge emotional impact on the viewers. Both movies have big emotional impacts due to the decisions made by the main character in the film. Another similar movie is "One Good Cop", this shares a similarity with Seven Pounds by how the main character makes a difficult decision to do what they think is right.The dialog of Seven Pounds and the environment of Seven Pounds help to strengthen the themes by having Ben determine if the people were good people and if they helped other people in their life. The environment was a change in environment where it did not rain in the movie until Ben went to the hospital to discuss Emily's case with her Doctor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story about selfless redemption through sacrifice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Seven Pounds was a very interesting story about redemption through self-sacrifice and self-identity. The film opens with the character Ben Thomas (Will Smith) reporting a suicide. The camera then shifts to Ben being boisterous and argumentative with a customer service representative named Ezra (Woody Harrelson) who is employed with a meat company. Ben is a character who has experienced a life altering tragedy. This tragedy gives the viewer an insight to Ben's zero tolerance. The tragedy has left Ben feeling isolated, ashamed and racked with paralyzing guilt. The guilt that Ben feels launches him on his quest to redemption. He takes on a false identity in his pursuit on this redemptive journey. Ben's journey has him encountering characters that are also experiencing life altering circumstances. Ben meets Emily Posa (Rosaria Dawson) who although is in the prime of her life is suffering from numerous health issues that threaten to end her life. I believe this relationship is the emotional focal point of the film. The film seems disjointed at times.. The question I had was why Ben was so driven to atone for his life changing tragedy? Perhaps it could be said he identified with these people on some level. Maybe he did not consider himself a good person. He himself could not go back and change his past history, but had control over a deserving stranger's future and quality of life. This film reminded me of the film One Good Cop. In this film, the partner of Artie Lewis (Michael Keaton) is slain. His partner leaves three daughters to mourn him. Artie tries to obtain custody of the girls but is his attempts are thwarted by Child Protective Services. Through an act of violence he does obtain money to purchase a larger house. The characters in both films are trying to do the right thing out of a profound sense of guilt and overwhelming sense of responsibility to others. The movie Seven Pounds is an emotional and on some levels, a spiritual film. The natural lighting of the breathtaking ocean scenes from Ben's beach house gave the viewer a sense of peace and tranquility. Dark low- key lighting was used in the hospital scenes and the scenes shot in Ben's hotel room. The camera close-ups of Ben's face helped the audience feel the anguish, guilt and torment he faced daily. The altruistic selflessness of the title character through his generous gift helped physically and emotionally changes the seven lives forever. His spirit will forever live in these people</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More romance than redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout Will Smith's career his roles have changed dramatically. From the early days as the comedic 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' to the dynamic, down ? but not out, Christopher Gardner in 2006&#x2032;s 'The Pursuit of Happiness'. He displays his versatility as an actor in an attempt to avoid getting stuck in a rut, not wanting to portray similar characters in every film despite the fact that he seems to constantly play the father figure as of late. Perhaps to bring his children into the spotlight? An admirable but undesirable trait as it often comes across as forced.Following the critical success of 'The Pursuit of Happiness' comes 'Seven Pounds'. Another film about a man who seeks personal betterment. When Ben Thomas (Smith) is involved in a personal tragedy he seeks atonement, aiming to drastically improve seven strangers lives to ease the pain of the haunting event whilst slowly falling for one of them, Emily Posa (Rosaria Dawson). Completely devoted to his cause he is willing to risk anything to improve their well- being.Prior to seeing this I thought there would be an even focus on each of the people he is assisting, however, this isn't the case. It revolves primarily around Thomas' growing devotion to Emily, a sufferer of congenital heart disease and although I enjoyed seeing their relationship develop I couldn't help but wish that Woody Harrelson's, Ezra had more screen time. Having only seen him in comedies I was intrigued to see him in a more serious role after the opening scene which really succeeded in catching my attention whilst bringing me to believe he would play a more significant part of the movie.In fact, excluding Emily the other 'pounds' really don't have a great deal of screen time and feel like more of a plot device, not really being of any significance until the film begins to unravel its twist. Regardless, the closing moments of 'Seven Pounds' make up for some shortcomings as it reaches the emotional finale. The closing sentiment is touching and will resonate with viewers, pushing one simple message, 'Live life to the fullest and treat everyone with a kindness'. Nevertheless I question whether they could have shortened the duration of the film and still have achieved the same reaction as the run time felt slightly drawn out. At its core this is a movie about redemption and bravery and the wait for that final pay-off is well worth the run time. A very thought provoking and inspiring film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart touching film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pounds of GuiltIf you are looking for a drama movie that you do not want to forget about and want to be moved in so many different ways, then Seven Pounds is the movie you want to watch. It is an emotional film that will have you thinking twice about how far you can go to find closure within yourself. There is a lesson to be learned from this movie: life is something so valuable that it makes you realize that no life can be replaced.In Seven Pounds, Will Smith plays the role of 'Ben' who starts out on a journey in which he chooses to change the lives of seven strangers; to do so, Ben (Will Smith), who owns a jellyfish, steals his brother's identity. Ben's brother is an agent with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ben knows how to bring the character he plays to life in this movie by using realistic emotions like sadness, anger and joy. I love that even though this movie is not entirely suspense, it keeps you wondering what is going to happen next by using clever tactics such as jumping from serious to funny scenes and vice-versa.As the movie goes into more suspense, Ben has episodes of a dream in which he sees himself involved in a car accident and another of being at the aquarium as a kid, admiring jellyfish. Somehow, the dream of the car accident becomes Ben's nightmare and then he feels that he needs to change seven people's lives as a result. One of the people is Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) who needs a heart transplant and is given between four to six weeks to live. Ben's main goal in the beginning of the movie is to help Emily with her IRS debt, but without knowing it, he starts to fall in love with her as he tries to take care of her; Emily was very sick with an incurable heart condition. During this part of the movie, I see the amount of creativity from the production; the genuine chemistry between Emily and Ben that the producers are able to create is so believable.Ben also comes across another person, Ezra Tuner (Woody Harrelson), who plays the role of a beef salesman who is also blind. Ben forces himself to insult Ezra and makes fun of him to see if Ezra deserves his help. This was a way of testing whether or not Ezra was a 'good' and 'deserving' person. Ben, with the help of a good friend, is able to help other people by donating a portion of his liver, blood and bone marrow. Ben isolates himself from his brother who tries contacting him too see if he is fine.Next, Ben decides to move in to a motel room along with his jellyfish. Ben's brother finds out that he is at Emily's house, asks Ben for his IRS credentials and warns him that impersonating a federal agent is a felony. After talking to his brother, Ben goes to the hospital to ask Emily's doctor how much more time she has to live. Upon hearing the results, he then calls his best friend and tells him that "it is time." At this point in the movie, the suspense is then heightened and the viewer becomes even more engaged.The ending of this movie is simply amazing because just at the end you will realize how Ben's dreams are connected with him trying to help seven people in need. It is all about connecting the dots. The viewer actually has to let his/her imagination run wild in this movie to be able to understand it. I personally like that this movie is puzzling until the near end because you are constantly asking what is going to happen next. In a lot of movies you are correctly able to predict what will happen in sequential order.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes mind baffling movies because it will have the viewer's attention on a tight thread. You just have to watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie. A little depressing, but absolutely lovely at the same time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot comprehend why Rotten Tomatoes says this movie has an aggregate of 27%. How did so many people not understand the plot or claim that its illogical? This is really a fantastic movie that deserves a lot more attention than it got. And it makes perfect sense. Also people claim that the ending is terrible - that depends entirely on what you are expecting when watching the movie. If you're expecting a movie where the Hero goes against all odds to save the damsel in distress and then they live happily ever after, then yes you'll likely hate the ending. But if you're expecting a movie that will make you think for a few minutes about what love truly means, then you'll likely believe this movie is fantastic. I can't say much more without giving away the plot but I will say this; don't listen to the bad reviews. Give the movie a chance and really think about what happens at the end. And do NOT expect a typical Hollywood happy ending. The ending of this movie is really beautiful if not incredibly sad and somewhat frustrating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven pounds - ?7 pounds at morrisons (lie, it's 3 quid)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film might be a bit sloppy in terms of trying to force emotion. And yes, at times it was corny and a tad bit unbelievable but despite this, Seven Pounds is a good film.It's simple, it's sentimental, it's sad. Will Smith proves he can perform a role which requires a matured person. That, is basically it. Now, i'm astounded to read that viewers had felt as if they were being left in the dark during the slow build up to the conclusion. Even top reviewer have spoken their distress towards this matter. It baffles me. From the opening scenes with it's opening lines, it was obvious what the protagonist was planning on doing. From the get-go, we know that Ben is a disturbed fellow and sadly, throughout the length of the film, we never dive deeper into his character; into his background. Yes, he's depressed and we know his goal but we learn nothing else. And this leads to me saying that Will smith, despite playing a maturer role, didn't actually carry out a masterclass in acting out a well-rounded, enigmatic character. You could also say that Seven pounds has a bout of the similar disease which affected Lionel Richie. It is a creepy, when you stop and think of it, that Will Smith was stalking these people. And again, the tests he puts forward to find out if they truly deserve their gifts are faulty and dour. The kid, for example, could easily turn into some deprived serial killer. Risky, Ben, Risky.It's sad, but it's sad in the same fashion of that of a Animal charity advert: It's made to manipulate and force you to act and this is what the film is set out to do: Too simply get people to leave the cinema and pass the word to others about how sad it all is. Simple, in other words.God Damn bloody simple. Yeah. Everything about the script comes across as a first draft. The acting however is top notch and the direction rolls in it's own poop with the script it has to work with.</fullReview>

Seven Pounds is truly marvelous and I can think of so many more powerful words to describe this movie. I won't spoil anything that happens in the movie for any readers but I can say one thing- I watch a lot of movies and this is probably one of the first movies to ever get me so entirely interested that I wouldn't be able to sleep without finishing it first. Will Smith certainly did a fantastic job producing this movie and acting in this movie, the actors are so good that you forget you're watching a movie, you feel as if you've been pulled into the movie and you're apart of it all. I was speechless once the movie finished and I want to yell this out to anyone reading- YOU MUST WATCH SEVEN POUNDS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds is about loss and love,The loss of someone he cared about dearly,and the loss of 6 people he didn't even know.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is all about loss, forgiveness and letting go. All though it's also about many other things they are some main points. It's not what you'd expect when i say that it's about forgiveness and letting go, because instead of normal movies this is about a man who is full of regret, but won't let it get in front of what he is trying to achieve. I found this movie realistic, even after Ben ( Will Smith) sort of fell in love with Emily Posa ( Rosario Dawson) he couldn't forgive himself for what he did, even if it was an accident. It was all part of a plan that he (with the help of his friend) would help as many of the 7 people he could while he was alive (they were in a way supposed to take the places of the lives lost in the accident) The fact that they didn't make it one of those movies were he falls in love and forgets about everything else, is one of the best points about it. It's what makes it realistic, I mean sure it's human nature to want to thrive and survive, love and forget, but the fact that he doesn't forget is what makes this movie truthful. It's when he walks out of Emily Posa's house and realizes he needs to speed up the plan before he get's attached and does something he feels he doesn't deserve, to live a normal life again. Overall I think that it's a must see it makes you understand that everything happens for a reason, like 7 people dying so that 7 other people could live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the beautiful movie yet again by will smith, he simply is creating new zenith for himself each time he attempts something. The film remains grabbing since the very beginning and the role played by each character remains vivid yet shadowy. The movie was mysterious throughout and not a moment went by where i didn't have a question in my mind; I would always think why or what is going to happen. But waiting till the end was totally worth it. The plot, characterization, movie and acting were all perfect. Above all the story was the icing to the cake. A beautiful way to show remorse and salvation. However, the end of the movie was of course sad, but with Emily really in a state of dying and Tim falling in love with her; saving Emily was more important to Tim more than anything else. And certainly it was Tim's heart that Emily carries for the rest of her life. She now had him completely with her. I would recommend everyone to watch this amazing movie as the manner this movie unfolds is mesmerizing. Kudos!! :)</fullReview>

I have never been moved to such an extent that i am crying my eyes out, tears were literally (i hate it when people use that word incorrectly but it applies in this case) streaming down my face for the second half of the movie.Mr. Smith plays his role to perfection, similar to his father figure in pursuit of happiness he really connects with the audience. I forgot that he was Will Smith which is something few actors can make you do. Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Hanks spring to mind when that quality is mentioned and this performance for me puts him up there with the greats. There isn't a single thing i would change about this movie, the supporting cast was excellent, the soundtrack blended brilliantly with the mood and the characters felt like real people.As for the plot, i won't say anything other than it is tied together brilliantly at the end. Watch this movie, DO IT. But watch it by yourself so that when you start bawling your eyes out, there's nobody around to judge you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven pounds is a movie about a young aeronautical engineer that killed his fiancée and seven people in his car accident while texting and driving. To redeem himself, Tim decided to save the lives of seven good individuals as a sign of redemption of his past act. Throughout the whole movie, the goals of Tim become more and more clear after each action that he make to better someone else's life. In this movie, the major actor is Will Smith also known as Tim who plays the role of the donor and the rescuer throughout the course of the movie. The other major actors/actress in the movie is the receivers of the donation from Tim. The first receiver of Tim's lung lobe is his brother Ben , more known as Michael Ealy, who as an IRS employee. The second donation that Tim made was given to Holly, more known as Judyann Elder, who was a social service worker. Tim made a third donation to an individual named George, also known as Bill Smitrovich who was a hockey coach that needed a kidney transplant. The fourth recipient of Tim's donation was a little boy named Nicholas, also known as Quintin Kelley who was donated a bone marrow by Tim. The fifth person that was the beneficiary of Tim's House was Connie Tepos, more known as Elpidia Carrillo who was consequently abused by her boyfriend. The last two donations that Tim made were to Ezra Turner who was a blind pianist, and a salesman, also known as Woody Harrelson, and Emily Posa also known as Rosario Dawson who was a greeting card writer and Tim's "girlfriend". Ezra was the recipient of Tim's eyes, and Emily received his heart; which is kind of ironic, because Tim and Emily started falling in love with each other. Dan, a friend of Tim more known as Barry Pepper was the person that had to make sure that the wishes of Tim to donate the organs to the individuals that he chose was granted. In this movie there were too many value moral lessons to be taken from it. Other than the redemption theme, the movie offer different types of subject, like caring for others, being responsible for your own actions, and also paying the consequences of a bad action. The lightning of the movie was well established throughout the whole movie, there were some lightning effects that could be notice at the scene where Tim was killing himself, and also at the concert toward the end of the movie the lightning were very well put. The motif of the movie was pretty self explanatory, but nevertheless you had to pay attention real carefully to the details throughout the movie to understand the reasons why Tim was doing the acts that he did, which is because he wanted to redeem himself from the accident that happened.</fullReview>

I was extremely impressed throughout the whole movie. The director and everyone involved did an outstanding performance with this movie and it actually makes me cry every time and I'm not emotional at all.

Will Smith acting was so natural and touching, everyone else in the movie was superb, specially Woody Harrelson face when Ben insulted him at the beginning of the movie, his face impressions were unbelievable,Rosario Dawson relationship with Will Smith and its smooth acting really touch my heart, but the final question is where can we find a caring person like Ben or let's say Tim in this world, I think it's impossible.

		<fullReview>The movie Seven Pounds directed by Gabrielle Muccino is an excellent movie. This film was released in 2008 starring actors Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, and Barry Pepper. To sum up the theme to this film, it is surrounded by bringing life to those who couldn't experience it on their own to ultimately lose life at the end. Tim Thomas (Will Smith) is driving along side of his fiancé when he decides to read a text message that he received. By his action, Tim and his fiancé were in a serious accident that not only killed her but killed six others leaving a total of seven people killed at the scene. Tim decides in order to redeem himself, he needs to save the lives of seven good people. On his quest to find these people, Tim decides to quit his job as an engineer. His first donation was a lobe of his lung to his brother, Ben (Michael Ealy) who happens to work for the government. Not even a year later, he then donates part of his liver to a child services worker named Holly (Judyann Elder). After his first two donations, Tim is on a quest to find five more (Muccino, 2008).Later he finds George (Bill Smitrovich) who's a hockey coach and donates one of his kidney's to him. Then for his fourth donation, he finds a young boy and donates his bone marrow in order to save him. After his fourth donation, Tim reaches out to the child services worker he once donated to for names of people she knew needed help. He was given the information of a woman who had been abused several times. Once receiving this information, Tim decides to move out of his house and take everything with him including his pet jellyfish. He goes to meet with this woman but she refuses his help originally. Once she had been abused again by her boyfriend, Connie Tepos (Elpidia Carrillo) contacts Tim asking for his help so that she could save herself and her kids. Tim Thomas hands her the keys to his home and transfers the ownership over to her as long as she agrees to never speak of his name again (Muccino, 2008).With two more lives to change and save, Tim is on a mission to find two other individuals to donate himself to. He steals his brothers' identity and uses it to gain access to personal records. He then finds a sixth individual he wants to help. Ezra (Woody Harrelson) is a blind man who works as a meat salesperson. The last person to save was Emily Rosa (Rosario Dawson) a self employed woman who has a heart condition and is in need of a new heart (Muccino, 2008). Tim makes his relationship with Emily personal and realizes that as time is ticking, he has to save her life. So as his final wish in a cold and dark setting, he decided to save the blind man's sight and the weak woman's heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie for my had recommended it to me, saying it's a "really emotional film". He was quite right indeed. I'm not going to dictate you the story line here, but just inform that this movie is truly -- an excellent one. I wonder why IMDb have given this such a low rating. The title may not give you a slice of the movie but you know, you never judge a book by its cover!Well-written &amp; gripping story -- A little predictable towards the end but the way it has been performed is what matters and it has been done the right way; Great Acting; Wonderful Ending -- you know there are movies which are quite good but end into something really unpredictable yet unpleasant...This one didn't: A little bitter but a sweet ending.In the end, I'd just like to inform you, if you haven't watched this movie, don't read my review or someone else's and go ahead and watch it -- won't hurt. This is the type of movie which made me write a short review for it but just not give it the stars.Thanks for reading my review!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real heavyweight film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Seven Pounds" is another of Will Smith's attempts at turning to serious acting and again the guy is deserving of praise. He gives another brave performance where he sheds the lovable and charismatic appeal to be more painful and shocking. Unfortunately his choice in the movie may be the reason why he's shut out of major awards buzz again this year though. "Seven Pounds" offers up a great role for him but the movie, despite being fascinating for its first hour or so, also gets frustratingly less worthy of it's high caliber plot and soon just dissolves into heavy-handed sentimentality.Smith plays Ben Thomas, an IRS agent who begins the film by saying "It took God seven days to create the world, and it only took me seven seconds to shatter mine." Flashbacks of a car accident or him enjoying his beach house with his wife are spliced throughout the film. He is a more broken man now but also more determined to make life a little easier for 7 people down on their luck. One is Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a woman with a congenital heart defect that he promises in some way to get on the hospital donors list. Just the more he gets closer to her, the more in love he becomes. During all this Ben has also moved out of the beach house and into a crappy little apartment.Who is Ben Thomas other than a man with a tragic past? He's an asshole when we first see him talking on the phone with another prospect (Woody Harrelson), yet he seems to be a hospital guardian angel as well, forcing the staff to give an old woman a bath, giving people blood transfusions and bone morrow, and even giving a poor family his beach house. What eats away at him so much that he is willing to test and give people things? The mystery is solid as well as heartbreaking and director Gabriele Muccino, who also directed Smith in "Pursuit of Happiness", gives the plot its soul and tension.Par excellence, I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many excellent films I have seen, I say among many of these films touch my heart, but "Seven Pounds" would be the one truly touches my soul. Literally and figuratively. The most intriguing tweak is many questions are unveiled at the last part of the film. As in the beginning, I didn't have any clue what he was aiming for. but really , the idea is very touching. Redemption for what Tim did (Reading a text message while driving), a good lesson for everyone, Seven strangers lives are drastically changed, in a good way, the last part is would he stick with his plan or he loves Emily and refuse to die, then , she dies. it's so tricky , because that's what was happened on her fiancé, so , he is not going to change his plan, and that's is very hard. of course, touched my soul.</fullReview>

IT seems Seven Pounds is getting a lot of negative press and I felt like I need to do my part to let some people know that this movie is SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL! For me, this was a rare movie that stays with you. I found everything about this movie beautiful..the acting, the music, the directing and especially the beautiful story. A story of giving..sacrifice with purpose. I am not the biggest Will Smith fan, but I must say that his performance for me was ASTOUNDING. I felt his pain and was moved by what his character was doing. This is not a easy story to tell in 2hrs and I think they did a really fantastic job. This movie will not be for everyone...it moves slowly and may be confusing..until you figure it out...then the reality of his purpose will crush you emotionally and at the same time it is so beautiful....SWEET PAIN (it did for me anyway)....Seven Pounds is a wonderful movie that will stay with you long into the night and next day.....Thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a very technical, detail-oriented person, so I really enjoyed trying to piece together the seemingly fragmented actions of Ben Thomas throughout this movie. Also, I enjoyed watching Will Smith in his lead roles in past comedy and action thriller movies (Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Men In Black, I Robot), but never seen him portray an emotionally tormented lead character in any film before. Wow. Can this guy act or what; he portrays other human emotions not seen in his comedy/action flicks, such as remorse, anger, sadness, hope, and most importantly, selfless love. So towards the end when I got the answers to my technical questions about why Ben Thomas has done all of these things, I was very satisfied. But Mr. Smith, you also gave me a very powerful life lesson, and that is, "What does it mean to love others?".Selfish, greedy, and unrepentant people in this world should be FORCED to watch this movie should they ever be put in jail for their selfish acts.10 of 10 stars</fullReview>

He didn't choose to live and serve the people but instead he has taken a hard step towards his redemption and selected people who are living their life in darkness or struggling their way to make it. Seven Pounds is his road towards redemption.The Director also did a nice job and I will rate his previous movie 'POH' and this one on a same scale. Soundtrack was also really nice!

		<shortDescription>Gradually slow with a grand finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing close to nothing about 'Seven Pounds' except that Will Smith played the protagonist, I entered the movie clueless and rarely amused for a small period of time during the initiation of the movie. Ben Thomson starts out as a basic character but slowly uncovers the truth of his perceived existence. The insignificant character builds to the slow start of the movie, where I can imagine it lost a share of its audience. But it does not take long to understand why one wants to watch this film. As time goes, the character of Ben Thomson is rapidly exposed and his true objective can be discussed, but is still not certain until the very last minutes of the moment. The complex plot is successfully fulfilled throughout the two hours but could easily produce a project twice as long because of its intriguing nature. The storyline and hanging suspense that lingers throughout major parts of the movie causes the movie to, in the end, hit a home run. As with many movies, it deals with human emotion, connection and interaction. The contrasting and powerful interactions of love and hate, happiness and misery and honesty and falsehood result in a fantastic product that will catalyze reactions in any individual. Not only does one leave the movie with questions and inquiries but one leaves imagining, wondering and questioning basic important human philosophies that are easily avoidable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds starts and ends on a dark note, a real tear-jerker :( But that's still okay because I found it to be quite moving and it does wrench lot of emotions from you.Will Smith does a very fine act of a person ridden with guilt and doing all that he can to atone for his nightmarish past. However, there're some really intense moments when he struggles as an actor to express the tears or pain. Rosario Dawson as the heart patient Emily is hot! and also does a first-rate job. The other highlight of the movie is Woody Harrelson as the blind call-centre employee Ezra. I felt he was excellent in conveying a character who's positive &amp; stoically accepts his fate yet goes through moments of sadness or helplessness. Besides Will's character, it is the strength &amp; serenity portrayed by Woody that lingers in your mind long after the movie is over.The flaws? Besides some struggle from Will Smith during some emotional moments, nothing really.But I really wished for a more positive ending to the story, left me in tears couple of times.Verdict: I like it thanks to the moving plot, I dislike it thanks to the dark ending. Either way, it is quite unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not have much to say about this film. I first saw it in theatres with my brother, and it was a somewhat embarrassing experience, but I just saw it now and thought to go check the IMDb reviews. It seems there is a 9/10 review at the bottom of the page, so I am doing my best to correct that. Maybe you've heard of the movie, maybe a friend recommended it, maybe you just searched for the best movies of 2008. Whatever the case, see this movie. It is one of the great movies of our lifetimes, a movie that isn't out for money, or for the sake of itself. This is one of the few movies that gives you a choice; you can be better, you can be worse, or you can be the same. Though I will never be the same, and I can't imagine you will either.Just see the movie, in a quiet place, alone or with people you love. It's not so much a movie as an expose on humanity. And one well worth listening to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds: It's Just Something in my EyeA unique blend between a feel good film and a depressing tearjerker, Seven Pounds takes its audience on an emotional ride. Seven pounds is a uniquely organized film beginning at one of the last scenes of the movie leaving the audience in griping suspense only to give them arguably obvious clues to the meaning of this introduction. Overall, the film went over well with audiences; however, movie critics were predominately unimpressed. The plot line is relatively scattered. The movie starts with a frantic Tim Thomas (Will Smith) calling a 911 operator to report a suicide. When the operator asks Tim to identify the victim, he pauses in a very emotional state and admits that he is. The film then takes a trip back in time to Tim in his rather lavish beach home ignoring phone calls and in a deep depression. Thomas, who is impersonating an IRS agent by the name of Ben Thomas, begins his search for people of substantial character who are in desperate need of assistance. He finds these people through the IRS network and begins to make assessments of their character. He meets a woman by the name of Emily Rosa (Rosaria Dawson), who has a serious, but treatable heart condition, with the exception of her rare blood type that she coincidentally shares with Tim. Tim and Emily begin an obviously doomed, romantic relationship. Just when things are looking up for Tim his brother, the real Ben Thomas confronts him about his mysterious plans. Through flashbacks the viewer discovers that Tim Thomas was in a tragic car accident that was his fault. Tim's wife and six strangers died at his hands. It is gradually revealed that Tim intends to kill himself and donate his organs, of a rare blood type, to these people that he is testing in order to make amends for the seven people that he killed. This plan is complicated by the love that he feels for Emily, however, when her condition becomes critical Tim cannot wait any longer and sets his plans in motion. He calls the 911 operator and reports his suicide and then proceeds to an ice bath to insure that his organs remain usable. Fascinated by the box jellyfish since he was a child, he releases the jellyfish into a bathtub and allows it to sting him, killing himself swiftly and efficiently. Tim's connection in the donor's society makes sure that Emily is, appropriately and symbolically, the recipient of Tim's heart. When she hears the news, she immediately calls Tim to tell him that they can now be together; completely oblivious that the heart she is receiving is his. After realizing what has happened, Emily connects with Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson), who received Tim's eyes after his suicide. The movie, although emotion packed, is riddled with factual errors which over-analyzing film critics picked at like the vultures they are. For instance, despite Tim's effort to keep his organs usable by the donor's society the box jellyfish has a neurotoxin that would render the precious organs completely useless. Also, if correct, this movie would have never taken place; because he was texting when the accident happened he would have been charged with seven counts of involuntary manslaughter and would undoubtedly be in jail at this point. Sure there were some factual errors, but there aren't many movies without them; Troy, for instance, has an airplane flying in the background in one of its scenes. Movies as a whole should be taken for what they did right and not the tiny details that they missed. Because of these obvious mistakes, critics are unable to process the depth and meaning of the story possibly because of a smaller, more cynical thought process displayed by most critics.Many critics seem to disagree with my arguments that Seven Pounds was an incredible film. Las Vegas Weekly's Josh Bell left an extremely negative review with emphasis on the movies illogical plot line. I argue that this adds spice to the movie, however, Mr. Bell disagrees saying "The film's arty, out-of-sequence storytelling serves only to obscure the clichéd, Oprah-style sentiment at its core." While Seven Pounds does have relatively "arty, out-of-sequence storytelling", this is not used to obscure anything. Seven Pounds is a movie that wears its "Oprah-style" sentiment as a trophy; after all there is a reason that Oprah is one of the richest women in the world. He goes on to say "Smith's leaden, charisma-dampening performance sadly says it all. Even the incandescent Dawson can't make noble-sufferer Emily into anything more than a tear-jerking automaton." This is simply untrue as opinionated as it is. Anything can be said about the movies logic or plot yet everyone, critics included, seemed to view the acting in the movie incredible at the least. The acting was flawless, as expected from Will Smith and Rosario Dawson, adding to the lasting emotional impact this movie leaves on its audience. Smith and Dawson connected at an incredibly passionate level. Smith's performance was intended to be depressing which he accomplishes uncomfortably well. His sad, dreary acting almost places its audience in his shoes and makes an emotional impact, which is the purpose of any drama such as Seven Pounds. In my opinion, Seven Pounds was an incredible film that left its audience bewildered and breathless from start to finish. The movie's chronology was brilliant, starting at the end and using flashbacks and subtle hints to reveal a grim past for Mr. Thomas. The plot line is relatively obvious; however the side plots are interesting enough and are delivered so well that they could make a standalone movie. Aside from that, who (with the exception of film critics) doesn't enjoy to piece together a mystery before it is revealed? Works Cited Bell, Josh. "Seven Pounds ." Las Vegas Weekly.

Maybe this person interpreted it from another angle but my interpretation is that, that didn't happen.Honestly this is one of the best Dramas I have seen since Veronika Decides To Die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this film, Tim Thomas, played by Will Smith, who assumes the name of Ben throughout the movie, has devised away to deal with a horrible memory of his past. Seven Pounds is a movie packed with an all star cast of some of the most talented actors/actresses who have ever graced the dimensions of the big screen. The always intriguing and multi-talented Will Smith as Ben/Tim Thomas, Woody Harrelson as Ezra, Rosario Dawson as Emily Posa, Barry Pepper as Dan, and Michael Ealy as Ben Thomas to name a few all give an outstanding performance. It's a movie of complete and total sacrifice; sacrifice that is not without a great price but with an even greater purpose. It's a very dramatic and highly emotional film, so be sure to take a box of Kleenex to the theater?you're going to need them! Some may say it's confusing at the beginning; however, I feel it's more suspenseful and mysterious because of what he says in the voice over of the second scene. And what he states in the third scene captured my attention and held it all the way to the very end. I don't remember a dull moment. As you watch scene after scene, you too, will be compelled to watch the movie all the way through. Ben is on a mission and he is not allowing anyone to get in the way of him completing all that he has set out to accomplish. Not even the love he finds in Emily (Rosario Dawson). Will Smith plays a very powerful role in this movie and will definitely have you hanging on emotionally as if you were on a roller coaster. The lighting in the film is perfect for every emotion of every scene; from the natural lighting surrounding the calm, relaxing, Solis of the ocean scene in the early morning - to the low-key lighting of the scene shot in Emily's hospital room. There was quite a bit of high-contrast scenes in this film that made the images more dramatic and powerful. This film is very unpredictable, heart-wrenching; and when you finally figure out what his purpose is for such an ultimate sacrifice, it will be one of the most bitter/sweet moments you have ever experienced. It's a movie you won't soon forget; one that will leave you soul searching and re-evaluating how you truly feel about your life as well as the well being of others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven PoundsSeven pounds is a drama about Tim, who is played by Will Smith, set out to find seven recipients to give seven pounds of his body to, he don't want to give them to just anyone but those in need, whom he feels deserve such gifts. So he steals his brother's identity and begins his search as Ben an IRS agent. This is not just a good deed Ben is doing, but a way of redemption. Years before while driving and texting, Ben caused a fatal accident killing seven people including his fiancé. Ben never expect to find love on his search, however, he found in Emily, played by Rosario Dawson. Seven Pounds has it's suspense as well, when Ben appears to begin to harassed Ezra a blind man played by Woody Harrelson, later to find out he wants to donate his eyes to Ezra. Ben's love interest Emily puts up a guard, Though she is dying from heart failure, she tries to resist Ben's offer of his heart. The use of close up camera angles gave the feel of being present, when Emily was in the hospital the camera zoomed in giving the impression of someone entering the room. Also, when Tim's brother Ben, was looking at the collage he had paper clippings and photo's of the accident and recipients of the seven pounds, the objective point of view, camera angles and panning of the camera gave the audience the feeling of actually view these items, adding the heartfelt emotions Ben was experiencing. The use of quick cutting in the scene where Tim is talking to Ezra, allow the audience to see into the facial emotions of both parties, The use of sound also contribute to the film, the music score use during this scene also contribute to the movie giving it a sad feel and the ambiance sounds such as the birds chirping when Emily comes out to find been feeding the dog, gave it a believable sense. The lighting for this film was great, the dimming of the lights in the scenes such as the hospital scene and the scene when he is out in the rain adds to the film.Will Smith did a great job in this film his emotional scenes were very convincing. Rosario did a great job as well, and the use of makeup for her in this film was well done, it gave her the look of someone his was ill. The point of self redemption depicted in this film was extreme, often you hear of people killing themselves to escape the guilt, but to think on the lines of giving life as repay is not heard of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Seven Pounds is a tragic, somewhat romantic, drama which focuses on ideas, and the struggle for human dignity. Ben, played by Will Smith, seeks to rectify a terrible tragedy that he caused, by providing miracles to other people. After taking the lives of 7 people in an automobile accident, Ben faces his internal conflict, and makes it his life's mission to better the lives of 7 other people.While on the road to self redemption, Ben meets Emily Posa, a dying heart patient, played by Rosario Dawson, and Ezra, a blind customer service representative, played by Woody Harrelson. Overcome by guilt, Ben gives away his money, his home, and ultimately his life, in order to try to provide justice for those who died by his hand.There were some other plot points that were noticeable in this film as well. There were issues of moral judgment involved with the film, not only of Ben, regarding his chosen path to redemption, but also of the viewer, when left thinking about the end of the movie. This film also shows the complexity of human relationships, represented by Ben's relationship with Emily, as well as his changed attitude toward Ezra and his blindness.After watching this film it made me think about another movie with the same type of feeling about redemption. In the movie Waking Ned Divine we see how redemption can come in the form of death, and how many people can benefit from the loss of one person. Although these two movies are very different, there are some thematic similarities.Seven Pounds is a realistic and interesting movie; there were a variety of techniques used to enhance the viewers' emotional responses to this film. Although it was hard to fully understand this movie until about half way through, the lighting used in certain scenes enhanced the dramatic effect of the film. Even when I was still unsure of what was happening in the movie; I knew when I saw those dark scenes of Ben's flashbacks, that the car accident was a huge connection to the theme of the story. Whenever Ben had flashbacks of the car accident the scenes were extremely dark, this symbolized the despair and guilt that Ben felt about what had happened.Another scene that stood out to me was the final scene, when Emily and Ezra met. The angles used to create this scene were great. The angle that was used to first show Ezra highlighted his new brown eyes, but not necessarily the fact that he was no longer blind. Because of the angle that was used, we only see those dark brown eyes, and we know exactly whose sacrifice they came from.This is an emotionally powerful film. The fact that it took so long to understand only made it more memorable to me. The devastation that Ben felt, and his determination to make amends in his own drastic ways, proves that during one's struggle for human dignity, many self realizations will be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I say hidden as after watching the film I read that the producers and directors managed to successfully hide the meaning of seven pounds from most (including me). I was aware of the film when it came out but although it looked like it may be OK, it took me until now to watch it. Firstly, the acting. Really good as far as I am concerned. I am learning never to worry when Will Smith is in a movie as whether it be a happy or sad character her always manages to pull it off. The other characters were believable as well. The storyline for me was a major positive in the films favour. I am not going to say anymore for risk of spoilers. Needless to say, by the end of the film any loose ends were very, very, very neatly tied up down to smallest details which you may have been wondering why through the film. Finally, I found it to be a tear jerker and to be honest I am not normally an emotional person. I would say this is definitely a 7 - 8 rated film and I have gone for the higher of these.

		<fullReview>It's not always easy to accept Will Smith in a dramatic role, considering his output. He does fairly well playing a man with a secret here. Posing as an IRS agent, he works his way into the lives of several strangers, and helps them with their problems. Why he does so takes awhile to figure out, although frequent flashbacks to a car accident provide a hint or two. One of the people he benefits (Rosario Dawson) becomes more than a passing acquaintance. Woody Harrelson as a blind musician is among those Smith's character seeks to help. By the time we get to the big finale, its is apparent where this is going. A meeting between Dawson and Harrelson at the very end is beautifully played and managed to wring a tear or two from these jaded old eyes. Pretty decent for what amounts to a chick flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>yeah it made me cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happen to watch this movie few days ago and i wasn't aware that it will turn out to be my favorite. i usually don't comment or bother to read any reviews but i couldn't stop myself for this one, i was so touched and moved that i finally broke into tears, i mean i don't recall myself crying over any movies, The character (Ben Thomas) is such a mystery through-out the end that i was eagerly waiting to find out what is he up-to, why he's going on helping those people? why he is living in misery? what promise his childhood friend made to him? and the chemistry between him and Emily Posa is so emotional that you can't get your eyes off from them.I reckon the character(Ben Thomas)has mainly been highlighted and the fact that he planned everything ahead and he didn't have a choice rather he was destined for what he did. i assure everyone who have a good class of sensitivity will love this character all the way. lastly i would like to say that YOU MUST SEE it to find out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't even really know where to begin. I was extremely skeptical the first time I got ready to watch this movie because I wasn't really a fan of emotionally touching and emotionally involving movies, but when the movie ended and I had tears streaming down my cheeks I knew I had to watch it again immediately. This is hands down one of the most touching movies I have ever seen and is Will Smith at his finest. This story was compelling and as the movie neared it's later stages I was just in awe of how emotionally touched I was. This is a great movie to watch with a loved one, and I wouldn't hesitate even a second to recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart wrenching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came highly recommended to me, so at first I was a little skeptical when I was mostly confused. The story was intriguing but fragmentized and it was rather hard to follow. No time was wasted though, and patience rewarded. The story explains itself as it goes along and in the end the different parts are tied together. In fact, in the end it was quite refreshing to have a story that wasn't shallow and transparent at first sight, but made full sense in the end.And such a story it was. Well acted, Smith has shown before that he masters roles such as this as well and well supported by Dawson, Harrelson, Ealy and Pepper. It had an dramatic edge at first that turned just heart wrenching in the end. It is not often a movie really touches me, but this is impossible to avoid. In the end, the tears were close. And perhaps that is the best grade I can give.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other side of Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not thirty minutes into the movie and I heard myself asking "why doesn't someone give this man an Oscar?" We all know Will Smith can do action and comedy, but of late Smith seems to be virtually under the skin of real life characters he has portrayed. Having received Oscar nominations for his portrayal of real life legends like life Muhammad Ali and lately Chris Gardner in "The Pursuit of Happiness", its only a matter of time before he walks out of the Kodak theatre with a golden figurine in his hands.In this film, he plays Ben Thomas, a mysterious IRS agent with a dark past. Although a fictional story, the way it plays out does appear quite convincing. Everyone hates the tax collector, right from the days of the Bible to present day recession (at the time of release), but Ben Thomas sets about a chain of events that would alter the lives of seven random strangers; from a blind musician (Woody Harrelson) to a woman with terminal heart disease. Emily Posa, played by the lovely Rosario Dawson, has unpaid tax running well into the thousands, but this is the least of her problems when given just weeks to live due to a weak heart, complicated by an even rare blood type. Initially the bearer of financially bad news, Ben slowly gets emotionally attached to Emily wanting to help her in any way possible. The protagonists eventually become romantically involved in a relationship apparently doomed from the moment their eyes meet.While the plot pans out rather slowly in the first half, the script is well written from beginning to end. Don't be confused by Ben's tormenting flash backs, and odd behavior. Who is Ben Thomas? Where did he come from? What happened in his past? What is his mission now? These are some questions the viewer will ask right till the end. For when the astounding answers do come, be prepared to be hit by a wave of overwhelming grief. The passion exhibited by Smith is mirrored only by the reaction of the audience, and I must say, there were quite a few teary eyes at the end. Have you ever seen Will Smith depict emotions of anger, guilt, love, fear, pain and sorrow all in one movie? Once again, someone please give this man an Oscar, not forgetting director Gabriele Muccino who also gave us the feel good "Pursuit of Happiness". Released in late 2008, Smith has not starred in a leading role since. Although his "Men in Black 3" is set for a 2012 release, Smith considers his Ben Thomas as one of the best and bravest characters he has ever played. Ultimately, this is Will Smith in his first ever bittersweet role as he embodies the purest form of love and sacrifice. On the other hand, Rosario Dawson reciprocates as the opposite lead. I have never taken Dawson for a passionate actor until her offering here. Although the film makers marketed this film as a drama, I strongly feel there are powerful elements of romance and selfless love. It Maybe a little mushy for some, but the result is poignant stuff from Smith and Dawson.Those with a big heart will comprehend the very powerful message soon after the tears dry up. In this world where everyone wants a large slice of the pie, or at least take what they can get; there are individuals walking among us whose sole purpose is to just give whole-heartedly.

Will smith shows again hes a great actor, and Rosario Dawnson and Will pull this off very well. It has a little of everything, action, humor, drama, suspense. The story is believable, there's no crazy effects or anything to lure you in, its just a good story, with good acting. Your sitting there watching it, thinking "I wonder what will smith is going to do next?"The ending was a shocker, I was surprised at what I was seeing.

		<fullReview>I am in absolute agreement with rstone. This is truly a masterpiece of the modern era. Smith's portrayal is perfect. It is by far his best and most emotionally wrenching performance to date. I never thought I would see anything of this caliber whilst enjoying the Fresh Prince of Bel-air in my childhood. I watched this film knowing nothing about it. Picked it up at the video store just to kill some time and found myself completely engrossed in the unusual actions of Ben(Smith). I spent the rest of the movie trying in vain to understand his motivation until the last 20 minutes or so, when everything came together like a tragically beautiful puzzle, which left me sobbing like a child who lost his puppy. To sum up: It is an amazing picture that EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE. It may be a difficult ending for some but the feeling you are left with is amazing and beautiful.

		<fullReview>Who knew the Fresh Prince of Bel Air could act? He was great in Ali, and in Pursuit of Happiness but for me this was his best performance. Playing the saddest man around who's suddenly given a chance at hope you can see just by his facial expression, his eyes, the inner turmoil. How he feels guilty just having the chance at happiness.Unlike my other reviews, I'm not going to delve into spoiler territory. This is definitely a movie worth watching. But this film deals with guilt, redemption, hope, and sacrifice in a very mature and even handed way. Don't be deterred by some of the negative reviews here. I'm sure those folks were pacified by re-watching Transformers 2.The film making is superb. Great locations and scenery. The script is quite minimal and realistic. There's no great soliloquies or speeches. It is a realistic depiction of people going through extra-ordinary struggles.Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson also figure in as important characters and both perform admirably. Dawson in particular had me spellbound by more than just her beauty. She can really act too.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar filler with the great Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben (Will Smith) was a successful rocket scientist with a perfect life and a perfect wife. However a cruel twist of fate causes his life to irrevocably change, when a car crash he enacted causes seven people to die, including his wife. This leads the grief-stricken self-loathing Ben sacrifice his life in to attempt to somehow right the wrongs.Any further delving into the story would be giving away too much, even though the movie offers no shocks or surprises. Essentially it is so straightforward that the attempts made by the director to 'hide' what Ben is up to are really very laughable. Thankfully the further we go into the movie the more he drops this false pretence and slowly but surely the movie unfolds. A movie definitely made with the Oscars in mind it has a very predictable Hollywood structure and drama, so as such it offers no lingering praise.Nonetheless the acting of one Will Smith is brilliant and with each passing movie his cements his place as the best black actors of his generation (if not 'one of the best actors of his generation). The depth of emotion and acting range of Smith is absolutely fantastic. Basically the main reason why this movie is worth watching.Additionally the movie may be predictable and very formulaic, but it is still a very emotional and touching experience with one highlight, when Ben no longer wants to sacrifice himself, but realises that there is no other solution. This causes his sacrifice to no longer be egoistical self-redemption, but an true selfless offering.Definitely a decent watch with a couple of beautiful scenes (also cinematographically). If you like Will Smith a definite watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great bit about story telling is that, it should make the silliest of ideas to seem true. This movie does that.Like any of Will Smith's movies it has depth to its performances.Usually I like humor, mostly nonsensical kind, with a large dose of action. But there are this rare moments of intellectual awakening in me, it is at these moments that I crave for movies that address my longing for a class of movies that have a wonderful story, plays with the emotions, and for a moment at least, makes you get lost in the movie. This movie does that with a flow which is gentle yet smooth and continuous.Watch it when you are alone and are at peace, preferably at night. If that fits your plan tonight, then definitely watch it. It will be worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was incredible. I was very happy to see the director (Gabriele Muccino) make a film that made me think, it treated the me (the audience) as if i was intelligent, we weren't just spoon-fed all the junk that the majority of Hollywood films tend to do.The story had great depth and emotion; it had great concepts and brilliant characters that every actor could portray flawlessly.I would say without a doubt that Will Smith has shown that he is one of the greats in Hollywood with his performance in this movie. He started to show us his true acting ability in The Pursuit of Hapyness and I for one am very glad that he has started to take more serious roles as he's matured. He is a very capable dramatic actor.I was also pleased to see that the casting director had put a lot effort into getting good actors to work along side Will Smith. Rosario Dawson who did a great job playing Emily Posa, an ill woman who finds someone to comfort her, Woody Harrelson who played Ezra Turner, a blind salesman, Harrelson did a brilliant job and should probably be a more recognised actor in my opinion as some of his moments in the film were very touching and there was Barry Pepper who played Dan, Ben Thomas' (Will Smith's) best friend who has been forced to keep a very dark secret, yet again another flawless performance, although he was not seen in the film a lot he played a significant role. These are just some of the standout actors for me personally, the rest are also very capable.The cinematography was very well done, there is a scene in the film where will smith and Rosario Dawson are sitting outside in a field with a tree behind them. this scene has some of the nicest cinematography I've seen in a long time with a very shallow depth of field and beautiful lighting. The statement here is obvious and very poignant, two people in a field full of life.its hard to comment on the story without giving away too much so all I'll say in respect to the story is that its well written, the dialogue flows well and it doesn't seem written, everything seems very realistic and natural. It is both unique and beautiful Although Gabriele Muccino did an outstanding job of bringing emotion to the screen through the camera, the music and the great performances, There was one thing that got on my nerves a little bit. Some of the music that was added at times just didn't fit, for example when Will Smith is on the beach reminiscing about his sad life, there is a song playing that seems quite happy and it should be a sad moment, having said this, the original score was great and was certainly more than capable of portraying the emotions that the audience should feel, it was just this one moment that felt a little odd to me personally.Summing up, this film was brilliant, it had excellent story elements, excellent cinematography, excellent acting and excellent music (at times) and I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a very sad, emotionally charged drama film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was charmed and moved by this film. I am really amazed at the depth of Will Smith's performance. It is nicely structured and has a message that hits like a lightning bolt. All through the film there is that element of tension. Who is this guy? Why is he doing this? Is he even sane? Is he a bipolar mess or what. Of course, eventually we are given the answer which I'm not about to spill. With all that there is something that didn't quite work for me. Once again it's the reality of the thing. Could someone get away with all of this? Could someone plan and pull off all of these deals? That's where I had to step back. I finally said to myself, "This is a great character with a dream that is marvelous. Let it go." At that point I was able to enjoy it, but on terms I use with silly romantic comedies. When you get to the end, ask yourself if even that is possible. I'm not so sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another movie that plays with sequencing and timing, overall I enjoyed Seven Pounds for good individual scenes and serviceable acting, however perhaps more traditional plot and story devices would've been better. Will Smith has great comic and personal presence in many of his movies and roles he chooses, however, sometimes he seems catatonic in this movie. It may be what's on order, but this seems sort of forced and contrived - almost like he's going against his own grain. (Spoiler) For all it's plot subterfuge and confusion, perhaps the filmmakers should've stuck to the actual centerpiece of the story - his present relationship - instead of compartmentalizing it, and morph the story into something more traditional. Anyway, a decent movie considering.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Will Smith gives you his heart, he REALLY gives you his heart...A love story that will disturb you. Now that's more like it! But more than a love story. An emotional puzzle that won't let you stop thinking about its implications long after viewing.To say SEVEN POUNDS is powerful and moving is like saying a roller-coaster ride is mildly undulating. It's Shakespearean, it's Biblical; it's a story that rivals the most tragic star-crossed lovers' tales of the ages and makes the grandest Hollywood romances look downright HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL.Not just a chick-flicky romance; a profound exploration of sacrifice and the quality of life, of one man's single-minded beneficence to seven total strangers, to absolve himself of the deaths of seven others.Smith is Ben Thomas, an IRS collections man, whom we meet as he audits people, not just going through the motions but assessing whether they are "good people," deserving of extensions or having the tax hammer brought down on them.Interspersed with Ben's duties are intriguing scenes, as he cusses out a blind customer service rep, Ezra (Woody Harrelson), berates a hospital administrator (Tim Kelleher) for mistreating an elderly woman, and practically stalks a heart patient, Emily (Rosario Dawson). All the while with a puss on his face that makes his sour mugs in I, ROBOT and HANCOCK look like Jerry Lewis as THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. There is something deeply troubling this man.The trailers for SEVEN POUNDS give away nothing, which is bittersweet, because though I hate trailers that give away too much, for the longest time I didn't regard SEVEN POUNDS as worth watching. Yet there is no way to discuss this movie's depth without revealing its premise. So for those who like their movies mysterioso, stop reading here.Just go out and rent the DVD if you haven't already...We discover what troubles Ben through intermittent flashbacks, the type that start as a few seconds and then grow longer as the movie progresses - seven people were killed (including his loving wife) in a gruesome accident that Ben blames on himself. To atone, he has made a life choice - which may be almost as gruesome as the event that triggered it - in an allusion to Shylock's "pound of flesh" in Shakespeare's MERCHANT OF VENICE, Ben is compelled to give "seven pounds" for the seven dead.Gabriele Muccino directs (as he did for Smith in THE PURSUIT OF Happiness), Grant Nieporte writes (such an original take on lovers who find each other only to lose each other immediately) and Angelo Milli composes (music so inspiring, in aching choral sweeps, evoking doomed love and dissonant portent).Dan (Barry Pepper) is Ben's close friend who must carry out the horrible task of ensuring Ben's wishes are met.And the climax with the box jellyfish - harboring the deadliest poison on Earth - will leave you stunned. (There is the issue that the jellyfish poison will contaminate Ben's organs, making them unsuitable for transplant... well, they tried to get around this by making him lie in ice and be "retrieved" almost immediately, so...).A Jesus analogy, when Ben finds true love awakened in him, and he doubts he can go through with his plan. If he chooses to live, the one he loves will die. Yet he seeks to have the cup taken from him - but discovers that is not an option. And this healthy, virile male (gaze upon that glazed ebony, ladies!) does the unthinkable...Not only do Ben's "gifts" make us wince physically (a lung to his brother, part of his kidney to a lady, marrow to a young boy, etc.) we are disturbed psychologically too, because Ben's state of mind is unnatural to the human condition. We cannot self-inflict pain unless it is to our benefit (like a needle to counter sickness - or to get high, I guess), so cannot comprehend the pathologically insane notion of giving body parts to strangers while we are in perfect health.With such a delicately morbid theme, Will Smith's compelling acting sells Ben's state of mind outright; we surmise Ben is edifying himself psychologically in some way - or that he is in too much emotional pain over the seven deaths to care.In mind and body and heart: Ouch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotive but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>o say that Seven Pounds had garnered mixed reviews would be something of an understatement. Amongst even the most reputable reviewers, there seems to be no general consensus, something that I, as a less than reputable reviewer benefit greatly from. With most movies it is almost impossible to avoid the opinions of the wider public, and often hard to prevent this from clouding your views on a film. Now, my usual strategy is to simply avoid all reviews until I have viewed the film for myself, but as I didn't get chance to see Seven Pounds until a few months after release this simply wasn't a viable option. Luckily for me then, the entire spectrum of love and hate had been thrown at me by somebody. Now I have established my clean slate, let's get on with the review.The basic plot revolves around Ben Thomas, a traumatized IRS agent who takes it upon himself to change the lives of seven people. The film charts Bens journey trying to find seven people he deems to be worthy of his help, and slowly pieces together his motives. Smith, although not his usual charming and relaxed self, immerses himself into the role and finally proves to me he is a versatile and convincing actor. Personally I found Smiths performance to be the real standout component of Seven Pounds, taking the film from very average mindfuck, to really quite decent mindfuck.Seven Pounds is a film which fits into the "we'll get there in the end" category. The first hour is a confused mess of over exposed dreary flashbacks and a mysterious patchwork of scenes which really don't pull together to make a comfortable quilt. Films of this type are at their best when pieces of the puzzle are steadily drip fed to the viewer for the maximum suspense, but more importantly, to make the ending give that much more of a conclusive feel. It is fair to say that the first point here is completely missed. There is so little coherent information in the opening half of the film there is little to draw you in. I found myself mystified to such an extent; it was tough to stay focused. On the second point however, Muccino is not so wide of the mark.Once Smith's character befriends one of the prospective recipients of his charity, Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) a printer with a heart defect, we really see Ben begin to progress and grow as a character. The frantic character we witness in the initial few scenes slowly turns into a thought provoking and deep person. It is as this change occurs that the film begins to improve. It spends less time throwing incoherent plot points at you and more time developing the characters and plot in a more conventional but altogether more satisfying way.As the film comes to its conclusion it is these characters which will hit you with the emotional hammer. One scene in particular involving a box jellyfish and a tub of ice is truly heart wrenching, and the last scene in particular goes some way to piecing together the events of the first hour. No ending could completely make up for the schizophrenic beginning but Muccino is not unsuccessful in creating a satisfying end. When all is said and done the film smacks of a missed opportunity. It has a great soundtrack and the casting seems perfect, with Woody Harrelson popping up as a surprisingly convincing blind meat salesman, but it is the failures which really stand out. Certain pieces of dialogue seem inconsistent and break the immersion slightly and as already mentioned the over exposed flashback shots do begin to grate slightly. It is a shame that the number of small gripes all pull together to overshadow some good performances, and leave the viewer with an unconvincing film experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember there being quite a bit of hype around this during it's cinematic release. However it wasn't at the top of my to see list at the time , so i sort of dismissed it for the time being only to eventually get round to renting it two nights ago.I was really looking forward to seeing it and wasn't disappointed with it.Will Smith has really grown as an actor over time and after winning over most people with his performance in "The Pursuit Of Happiness" i was wondering what was next for this guy. Again as in TPOH he gives a very good performance in this film as do Woody Harrelson and Rosario Dawson. Who knew that Dawson could pull off a role like this she really stood out in the film in my opinion amazing performance all round.What the film does so well is grips you. It's never quite clear until the very end but it keeps you putting pieces together for yourself all the way through and without a doubt keeps you entertained. There's no fancy effects or camera tricks in this one it's all shot as you'd see it!. It's gritty and realistic and this plays a big part in the effect the film has on the viewer.The story (which i won't go into don't want to spoil it for people!). Is as with most films what makes or breaks a film and this film is made by it's story it's not clear until all the pieces are put together and the full picture is made but it's an experience you will find hard to get out of your head.It's a beautiful film that anyone who loves a good film and good performances will find very easy to appreciate.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I was a little hesitant to watch this movie. While it certainly isn't Will's usual summer-action-flick style, it's nice to see him in a dramatic role. But there's that wonder--is this really good or just a lot of 'talking scenes' with no real purpose. You will be pleasantly surprised. Ben is a troubled man who meets strangers and has an impact on every one of them. As the movie goes on, the questions mound: what happened to this guy? What's with him and his brother? What happened to his wife? What's with the 911 scene? At one point it almost gets so frustrating that I nearly shut it off. But don't worry, the explanations do come...stick with it. This is a touching story and yes, you will need Kleenex. You can identify with every character and feel their story. It's a little like 'Pay It Forward' but with a lot more true feeling and less forced emotion. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good. But could have been great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pretty good movie. It's not great but it't certainly not bad. It didn't need all the exposition at the end, and even during the film there was too much explained. Would have been great if the filmmakers would have had a little more confidence in the intelligence of their audience and let us fill in the blanks instead of laying it all out for us.Could have been around 15min shorter.Sidenote : The music too at one point has a piano and one single note is played sour - I thought this at first a nice touch, considering the theme of the film, but after a while it was very distracting, because the theme just repeated over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully unexpected; a definite must watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I wasn't really looking forward to watching this movie because of its boring title and lackluster trailer. I reluctantly watched it just because the family wanted to. But hey, what did mommy say about not judging a book by its cover? Seven Pounds surprises you with the classic "expect the unexpected" knickknack. To you disbelievers out there, let me tell you; this movie's trailer does not do the movie any justice whatsoever. Seven Pounds is a poignant story where the lives of 7 strangers intertwine in a very special way because of one individual. I admit that Seven Pounds is a tad slow in the beginning, but as I watched on, I found myself being so entranced by the exquisite beauty of the movie that I forgot to breathe. Okay, fine, that was a bit exaggerated, but yeah, you get my point. The beautifully illustrated masterpiece further enchants with the movie's heartrending soundtrack. Really, the music itself can make you choke up. And Will Smith's (and all the other fantastic actors here) amazing performance(s) further elevates the movie's charm. However, a word of warning though: even to the toughest of toughies out there, don't be surprised if you find yourself tearing up through the movie. It is an awesome idea to prepare some tissues for the movie : ) Verdict: Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. And unexpected. A must watch. I bawled, but it made my day. It was beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average film that gives away its premise in the first scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith teams up with his Pursuit of Happiness director and delivers a similar type of movie. Smith is an unusual actor whereby he has successfully thrown off his glib Fresh Prince persona but yet can flick between the likes of Hancock/MIB to more serious fare like Ali or this one.Whatever you say about him though - he is a good actor.I started to read the review of this film in Total Film magazine a while back but the first paragraph of the review went something like this: "The best way to see a film like Seven Pounds is to go into it with as little knowledge about it as possible. The makers have asked all reviewers / cinema-goers etc. to not give away the ending. If you are planning on seeing this film - stop reading now." So I did....and went in blind...Did the tactic work? Yes and no.The very first scene involved a distressed-looking Smith making a 911 call reporting his own suicide. From then it transgressed a little into a confusing mish-mash of certain scenes/situations....but nothing you don't figure out within 20 minutes... I ain't the greatest at figuring out things but I figured out the ending after 20 minutes and then started to think there must be a twist at the finale - which the magazine review alluded to...I watched the whole film trying desperately in my head to figure out a way to "twist" this...but I could not.... I get to the end of the movie and guess what? - yep - no twist. Nothing. It was obvious from the very first scene what was going to happen. Boy was I disappointed.I won't go into the details here just in case you are thinking of seeing this movie - but if I copped it early - I'm sure you will too. Now don't get me wrong here - I still enjoyed the film but I had built it up so much inside my own head that I ultimately felt left down.As for the film itself - Smith plays a strange character - but plays him well. He is very watchable and does the best he can with what he's got. The script makes his character out to be a good guy in the end so it is hard not to like the guy and that certainly helps. But Smith is big and good enough these days to handle all that.However, the film is not without its clichés - Smith is a big, successful business man who has it all and then manages to lose it all ...HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN THAT SCENARIO???? Throw in the doomed love affair, sick kids, blind man, slow-mo car crashes, flashbacks etc. and you get the idea. Not that I can knock this too much - after all the director has to tell the story so he needs tools....but I felt some of it could have been moved along a bit (it is extremely slow in parts) and others done in a fresher way.It is not a bad film by any means.....but could it have been better? Probably. It reminded me so much of 21 Grams....that type of disparate, seemingly non-connected events but all leading to an uplifting finale - of sorts.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, a different kind of love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Merchant of Venice" by William Shakespeare, Antonio's debt to Shylock is eventually paid with a pound of flesh, literally. In this movie, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) has taken a great debt upon himself, and the story in the movie is his "repaying" of that debt, to seven people, thus the title, "Seven Pounds." Ben Thomas is a very flawed character, after a particular tragedy, but in his heart he wants to do good for others. As the movie begins we see him calling to report a suicide, his own, and to send an ambulance. We then find out how Ben got to this point.One of the people is Rosario Dawson as Emily Posa, whose heart is defective, and her days are numbered. Ben tries to get her higher on the transplant priority list. In the process, he begins to fall in love with her.I will not say any more that might give away the story, but it is worth a viewing. This is one of Will Smith's best performances.SPOILERS: Ben was driving and his fiancée' was his passenger. Unwisely he became distracted sending a text message and wrecked with another car, his fiancée' died, plus 6 others. Devastated and depressed, his solution was to sacrifice his own life, and donate his body parts to others. Eyes to Woody Harrelson as blind salesman and pianist Ezra Turner. His heart to Emily. He recruited his friend Dan to see that all this was done according to his wishes. Ben used a very toxic Box Jellyfish in the ice water bathtub to kill himself. The tragedy was that Emily showed him that he could love again, but he knew that to save her he would have to die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(26%) One of those movies that had its posters all over the place, mainly because of the Will Smith factor, then it quickly vanished from cinemas meaning several hundred percent more people knew of this movie than had actually seen it. That fact though isn't such a bad thing as this is quite the oddball misfire. The opening half hour is a confusing, poorly constructed mess as Smith comes across as cold, unlikeable weirdo coupled with the fact that he's a tax gatherer making for a lead character that's both hard relate to and even harder to care about. It's also one of those movies that has only one real trick up its sleeve, and it knows it, so it works so hard to shield it from the audience meaning that there's no room for the movie to properly develop early on, pretty much hindering it from the very start. Once it gets going things eventually start to resemble an actual plot, but if anything Smith is just as odd, with his pet jellyfish, serial killer likened creepy mannerisms, and wild swings of generosity. By the end it wants to tie itself into a neat little package, but it's too forced and grim for that to happen leaving both an overly sweet and quite bitter after-taste. So despite Will Smith offering a solid performance and Rosario Dawson being perfectly fine in support, there's no saving a movie with a script that's as broken as this flop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to wait an 1h45 to emerge from your lethargy and see the final outcome, the only interesting moment of this story, which lasts 10 minutes on a 2 hour movie.The rest is composed of a rather insipid, very, very long and uninteresting script. Even if the beginning is decent, the story gradually gets bogged down in a very corny love story that takes up a lot of space and that is most importantly boring to death. The narrative structure and the editing are a lot too heavy and lack clarity with many flashbacks that don't fit with the logic of the story, so much so that you don't always understand very well the unfolding of the plot nor where you are on the timeline.As for the characters, they are not endearing because the script only glances over them, except Emily and Ben who are not convincing anyway. Will Smith, by the way, delivers a very weak performance, with the same expression throughout the movie, that constant hangdog look, eyes full of tears, that only makes you want to slap him.</fullReview>

Oh Will, I had no idea he was such an emotional actor. To be honest, I never would've guessed he could've pulled off a project like this. And gosh, it was filled with precious but devastating moments that just left everyone bawling. Oddly, the ending was in a way satisfying, not what you'd expect, but it was beautiful and sad. Such an inspirational movie. If you're thinking about seeing it, please do. I promise, it can give you an entirely different view of life.

This is definitely a movie to go see if you like watching touching dramas. Will smith and Rosario Dawson do a great job in the movie. The acting is very well done.

		<fullReview>The line separating kitsch and drama is so thin here that it's so easily trespassed or forgotten. There is mystery, there is a good plot, there is great acting, there is raw emotion in some moments, still... the shortcomings are too distracting, for some viewers at least. And I'm not addressing the medical flaws (whole eye transplant, Ben's heart conveniently compatible with Emily's body), but the almost annoying overall feeling of "over the top" about this film. It's like Shakespeare for the soap-operas public. I mean, it's so obviously touching, how could you not cry? And that's exactly its major flaw: it's too much. It's predictable from a not late enough moment, and at some stage it escapes the decent dose of realism and plausible needed by any story. P. S. - What was really Ben's motivation? If he loved Emily, why did he take the enormous risk of them both dying, if his heart would have been incompatible? And if he meant to be absolved for the (obviously unintentional) car accident, based on some religious belief, didn't he know that many religions are blaming suicide?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NO other film has made me cry this much!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Seven Pounds and am feeling shell-shocked. What a beautiful, poignant, tragic way to tell a love story. You might not see this as a good thing, but this film made me cry more than any other i have ever seen (including Schindler's list, Sophie's Choice, Titanic, Green Mile and all the rest).I'm not normally good with films that reveal their plots slowly. I am an impatient soul and need to know NOW, (or preferably sooner). But Seven Pounds unfurled with such subtlety and gentleness that it was a pleasure to be along for the ride. And yes, it did leave me literally bawling at the end (i really fell apart when Emily goes to Ezra's concert so she can look in Ben's eyes one last time), but ultimately it left me with a sense of completeness, morality and humanity that is pretty rare for a film that has at least one foot dangling in the mainstream, even as it draws pretty pictures of Arthouses.That sounds disparaging and isn't meant to be so. What i mean to say is that this film should appeal to everybody, from film snobs to those who just love a great story. And can someone please tell me when Will Smith went from goofy funny man who relies on one-liners and boyish charm to serious actor with full and convincing range of emotions? Was there a rift in the space-time continuum!? LOVE this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One reviewer said the movie was about self sacrifice and giving. That's is so far from the truth. His lack of redemption and self forgiveness froze him to do what he did. It shows the power of film. It is able to make even suicide look and feel beautiful; even worthwhile. I loved the movie for its own value. Staying and supporting his girlfriend would have taken courage. The action he chose (not forced but chose) was cowardly.The ends does not always justify the means. His means was a weak response to the tragedy he never faced and reconciled in his life. The film reminded me of "Paying It Forward." However, in that film, the giving was freely done with no strings attached. The man has strings attached to all of his actions. He was looking for personal redemption. He concluded there was no new life after his tragedy. The tragedy in the film is that he was wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith is teamed up once more with director Gabrielle Muccino (who brought us The Pursuit Of Happiness) and the result is a very mixed bag, to say the least.Smith plays a man with some mysterious agenda, out to help those he decides are worthy of being helped. But exactly why he's acting this way and how his plan will come to fruition is something we have to wait and learn about as the movie heads slowly towards it's big finale.I've seen the rave reviews for this and heard from fans of the movie who found it to be heartwarming and brilliant but I just don't get it. Smith is as good as he usually is (in fact, I would even say that it's one of his best performances) and the supporting cast includes the likes of Rosario Dawson, Barry Pepper and Woody Harrelson so that's all for the better, too. But the script, plotting and direction are as flat as a pancake.Muccino seems to think the ending will justify everything in the movie, will leave us gasping and impressed. I was pretty bored, to tell the truth. Nothing I learned was actually that impressive nor did it make me reevaluate my opinions of the characters and their actions.If you're going to invest two hours of your time in a movie that's trying to be cryptic and meaningful until a finale that clarifies things while still being meaningful then that movie should be a good one. This is not, it's average at best.See this if you like: The Pursuit Of Happiness, Pay It Forward, My Sister's Keeper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this trailer,a while ago,and it never appealed to me at all.However,i took the chance to watch one evening,and i have to say i was pleasantly surprised.I don't call myself an emotional person,as such when it comes to films.I'm rarely moved by them,but on this occasion i have to go round that,as it for me it was so much more. For people reading the reviews and not bothering to watch.STOP! and watch it,it wont be a regret.If you watch this film,and feel nothing,then as someone else quoted your not human :) not literally,but if you understand this film enough to get the message,you should be overwhelmed,i know i was.Understandable this film may not be for everyone,it is sad,but its heart felt,and so generous.So even if it's not your usual genre of movie,give it a try.The acting i must say in this film is pretty amazing,i'm not a massive fan of will smith but i do like most of his films.But this changed that,most films in which he stars in are action/comedy etc.He has the odd one like this,but this film for me was on a whole other level.It's touching,it gives people a sense of hope,and without giving to much away,yes it is a confusing film,with flashbacks,and he never gives much a away about himself,or why it is he's taking his time,and even more than that,as you'll see,to help this people in need.The film is a big story,and for only just under two hours,was amazing to put it all in this film.When it's over i hope you feel the same way as i did,when it was.Happy,Touched,Sad. There three emotions not usually in the same scene of film,but for this,it does.A truly spectacular watch,for pretty much any audience,with a message that really should mean more these days. Take the time and watch yourself,you'll understand :)</fullReview>

While I loved the acting and the storyline, either the director, writer or editor screwed up. There are way too many holes in this story. Too many things aren't explained. Even the moment that drives the lead character to act as he does is merely touched upon. That is a mistake. Why does the character take so long to react as he does, over a year after the climactic moment of his life? That is never explained. How does he get the names of people he seeks out and know so much about them? Also not explained. That is just a couple of the holes in this movie.

So I suppose that I will just edit and post it here.This movie is awfully long, almost 2 hours, that is plain boring. and after an hour, I still wasn't sure what to expect, what he was trying to do. Good suspense movies have the opposite effect, they make you think while watching at the same time. I just skipped to the end after an hour and half of watching, and watched the ending, I still didn't feel that I missed anything important.And if it was not Will Smith, could this movie still get a high rating? I can summarize this whole movie in just one sentence. when that is the case, two hours is definitely too long. After all, it is not about a real person or real life event or some things which happened which changed the world forever. It is just a fiction.He is not an IRS agent, and that is called fraud. He could be arrested long time ago.If he wants to save life, he can just kill himself and put his name on the donor's list or he could have just put an ad in the newspaper or on the internet, and he can decide that at home. After all, there are are many more good people who don't live in his city who need his organs.so in conclusion, this is a stupid movie.</fullReview>

A woman who is in an abusive relationship who finally decides that she needs help. Will Smith's character committing suicide so he can give his eyes and organs to others.

		<fullReview>It's a mysterious title and the less you know about the story the better. The review is spoiler-free but if you don't want to take any chances... I really liked it, you should watch it (and read the review after ;-) It's tough to reveal too much about the plot without ruining it. I thought it was great and something I hadn't seen before. I can't write about the strong themes explored for fear of spoiling things but those are themes that should speak to most of us. For at least half the movie, you'll probably wonder what's going on, who is really Will Smith's character and what are his motivations. It might annoy and confuse some viewers who like it spelled out from the start, but I love to figure out that kind of mystery. Don't get me wrong, it's not a thriller and I suspect that past the halfway point, you'll probably deduce what's going on but you're not going to be totally sure and you might even become more emotionally involved because of that insight. Not to mention that you still don't know how it ends. It's a very emotional movie and sometimes quite touching. I dare you not to be moved by the scene at the start when Will talks to the old lady and that's just one of the first dramatic highlights.I was impressed by the dramatic range of Will Smith and the ensemble cast was pretty terrific too. Some might think the pace is a bit slow. For me, the editing felt right leaving time for the scenes to breathe. I sometimes felt entranced or absorbed by the film, a rare quality achieved only by my favorites. Some might feel it's too melodramatic sometimes. I would argue that the creators restrained themselves and it could have been much more so. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with melodrama as long as it's done right and it must be not so bad here since I admit to becoming a bit teary-eyed. Of particular note is the music soundtrack that I found beautiful and evocative except for a main piano theme near the end with a weird somewhat off-key note that perhaps was there to signify not everything was quite all right. I would have liked more time spent on the other people besides the sick woman with the great Dane. They sometimes felt forgotten and I wanted to check in on them. The past of Will's character did not particularly touch me although one part of it was very spectacular. If you want a soulful original drama that will keep you guessing, this is for you, so just go rent or buy it now. As an added bonus, I would say that if you watch it again, you would catch quite a few clues and hints you didn't get the first time, a bit like the Sixth Sense (no, that's not a spoiler).Rating: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

So credible, so moving, so real, so sweet. Muccino is the continuity of Italy's great movie directors. And the script is perfect, although I am against some of the morals shown in the movie. Generally speaking, I don't like slow and emotional stories like Love Story or the like. But this one is different, it goes deep into human values, yet avoiding any religious accents. In spite of this it is extremely spiritual and material at the same time. Muccino and the writer manage to walk on this razor edge throughout the movie. Tremendous! A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enigmatic drama bets it all on the payoff ... and Mr. Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When promotions first started appearing for "Seven Pounds," nobody had a clue what this movie would be about. They saw Will Smith being intense and some trailer editing suggesting a mystery/thriller and figured exactly what the studio wanted them to think: "if that dude's in it, it's good enough." With Smith being Hollywood's most bankable star, the hope was that audiences, after sitting through what they thought would be an intense Will Smith movie, would enjoy one of the best payoffs recently written for the screen. Well, it's a good payoff, and Smith's good, but the end doesn't justify a whole movie of guessing what Smith's character is doing every time he gives us one of those emotional wrinkly faces. There's just not a lot of interesting conflict or drama to excite us for the whole two hours.Though it'll be a failed exercise to increase understanding, I will attempt to explain the movie's premise. Smith is Ben Thomas, an IRS auditor who for reasons we can only guess are related to a car accident and something happening to his wife/girlfriend, is attempting to do something good for seven strangers in need of medical help. One of them is Rosario Dawson and there's a lot of chemistry.The trouble with "Seven Pounds" is that the things motivating its main character are completely unknown to us, which jeopardizes us caring about the success of his mysterious mission to do good things for good people. Understandably, if we know what he's doing, the payoff isn't as good in the end, but good movies do both. Smith and Dawson create good chemistry, but Smith is acting purely based on what we don't know and we can't empathize with the fact that every time we feel their romance brewing, he emotionally backs away and deprives us of the conflict we're craving the whole film. Dawson really outshines Smith in the film. Her character is in need of a heart transplant and sees him as a chance to live a happy life despite staring death in the face every day. The broad-smiled actress really helps sucker us into the romantic subplot with her cute ways.Gabriele Muccino, who worked with Smith in "Pusuit of Happiness" provides great direction and milks the script for all the visual drama he possibly can, but there's only so much he can do with all juicy parts at the end of the script.Still, "Seven Pounds" does indeed have a great ending that beautifully adds meaning to the film and its prior events. Problem is it's all of the film's meaning and all at once. This is probably a movie that rates 8/10 stars after watching the second time (or for all the romantic drama softies on the first time). For his first screenplay, you have to give Grant Nieporte a lot of credit. He'll get it next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost unbearably moving dark drama with an ingeniously constructed script and a masterful performance by Will Smith, who is well underway to Academy Award worthiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid-solo, "Seven Pounds" races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a flick which I also loved. Remember Gabriele Muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high-profile. Too bad I figured out Will Smith's scheme early on, I put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when Rosario Dawson's character is introduced as having an incurable heart-disease.However, I still think the writer/director made the right choice putting the bookends (bookends are the first and the last scene) in that way, it's the source of urgency and tension in the movie, finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith's and Dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two.One of my friends with whom I saw the movie thought Smith's character could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones, yet at other times he could be harsh and scary, and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely. It's quite a versatile performance.Lastly I can't forget to mention the crash scene re-enactment, which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music. Put this on your list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First half of this movie is totally enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie without knowing if it was a comedy, a science-fiction or whatever. It started out really strong. Will Smiths' performance is great and his role somewhat untypical. For the first half of the movie it is mysterious what his character is up to, which produces a very enjoyable tension. He could be the good guy, but he is probably a villain. Then, when about 50% of the movie is over, the good idea is sadly given away to a mediocre, boring love story and the resolution is wasted way too cheap.I rate the first half of the movie 7, the second half 3, so the average is 5. I would subtract one star because of the terrible balance. Then again I add one star since the original idea of the plot is really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I did like this film. It was well acted by all.However, I don't understand comments I hear from people about a surprise ending. I knew nothing about this movie going in except a few "gotta-see" recommendations, but I knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes. (I won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others.) Still, despite it seeming obvious, I kept watching. It was nice to see how everything played out, filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes.I don't hate it when I guess the ending early in a film. I only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery.Will Smith's screen persona is just likable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. He's energetic and believable in everything that I've seen him do. Seven Pounds is another fine performance.Rosario Dawson is a solid performer, portraying a quirky, rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you don't find her gorgeous, you should think about replacing your eyes.It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. Woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. Excellent.A cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot.Overall, I have to recommend this film not for the plotting, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not at all a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Usually I don't like dramas. I am not a Will Smith super fan even thinking that he is a very good actor......but this movie ! It is such a great movie with a such original script and so good direction and so well acting...wow...it is stunning. This movie captured my attention minute by minute and I even did not like "The pursuit of happiness" (maybe also because i did not like the acting of Will's son who is a very bad actor while children usually seems all natural born actors, I saw him also last night in "The day the earth stood still" and I confirmed my sensation that Jaden can't act). I don't want to write spoilers and so i don't talk about the story but what I can say is that this movie talks about Love, Death and other feelings which i don't like to watch in movies....but THIS MOVIE is such a super great movie. If you have a minimum of heart you'll don't regret watching it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first scene you are given clues as to what may be going on here. It becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls on. The acting is excellent throughout and these actors touch your soul. Even though I knew what was going to happen I was extremely puzzled by the motive. I'm still puzzled as to why Ben did what he did. We could see in his face "second thoughts", but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings. It was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused. Maybe that was the point of the film. I did like the film and Wil Smith can wrack up another good film choice.

		<fullReview>When its DVD was released i came to market and bought it. And i think my money was on right way as i expected before buying it. Awesome movie what else i can say for Will Smith, He's been an awesome actor like always whether in actions movies or serious. Always he gives a record braking performance. I think this is the movie after August Rush which makes a person cry while watching it. The way the director described the story was really awesome. His previous life and his new life in movie was correctly elaborated to the audience. Even i could not find any fault in the story or the way they shoot it. I think its DVD should be a household because this will be really a nice thing for your collection. It is not the movie which needs pop-corns for enjoyment, this is the movie which let the audience learn a lesson. now what is the lesson you can see that while watching. And i advise those people who are movie critics please watch this if you could find any criticism about this movie then please talk to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving, but not moving enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film - it clearly wasn't a reference to British currency, so it had to be Shakespearian and about pounds of flesh - taking them, or giving them. Will Smith's a feelgood actor, so serial killers were out. It could only be about a man giving them, so must be about guilt somehow. I spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched, as the beauty of the build-up is the way parts of the main character's background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doing.Guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because it's deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a roller-coaster ride - you know its going to be unpleasant. I wouldn't say the movie glorifies suicide; it delves into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom.It's also brimming with symbolism everywhere, which is a surefire tell-tale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature. The most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - what a 2nd act complication. Absolutely masterful.Yes it is very slow-paced, but i'm undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe. I didn't feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have, but maybe that's just me having ruined it for myself beforehand. Saying all that though, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds = Eight Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has an ulterior motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax payments. Thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his, quite frankly, unforgivable crime.The story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the ending of Titanic was more surprising when compared to Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening.Normally I only like Will Smith when is in full Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when sporting a gun, driving a Ford GT and saying "Aw Hell Nah" as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an Oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I wasn't looking forward to the movie, although here he is very understated. There are flashes of comedy but they are subtle, in fact it was the most understated Will Smith performance I have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award.The supporting cast were all grand too - Rosario Dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were fine as where all the other bit players.Overall it is a weepy - but it isn't throwing all the usual clichés and sentimental violins to give you no other choice but to cry. There were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke. You will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more real.I would give it 8/10. The Will Smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of The Pursuit of Happiness and comes of all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at ALL what i expected but a decent movie to say the least.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into see Seven Pounds i wasn't clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about. So within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot, have no idea what is going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All of this comes to an end when the "twist",so to speak, is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie. Basically Tim (will smith) was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives. By this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to.The acting of this film is great, as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, to me, this is one of her better movies, aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to. She has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film. Other actors, such as woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character. Although the casting of the film was still good.This movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped. The movie, however, was still pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place. Up until then it just seems like a pointless love story. Final thought seven pounds=seven Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A depressingly interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day. The story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle. The story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on. Eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office.There are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey it takes you on is interesting enough, if not overwhelming.A good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a really great flick about something that affects us all. I know I've personally run into this many times. Thank goodness Will Smith has jumped onto the societal issue of text messaging while driving. People, don't do it. An hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause. Personally, I wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie. I was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty bags of popcorn. I decided to disable all text messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, make them watch this vital Public Service Announcement on text messaging while driving or they could kill seven people. Thanks for showing us the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to right his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts!!! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian Director Gabriele Muccino come together and created a masterpiece that I highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching/feeling this film!!! I have the Highest Respects for Will Smith as he is not only a brilliant Actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) he played in this film. You will find yourself feeling his pain and anger, the frustrations over his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who by the way was Fantastic as usual. I found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love. Woody Harrelson also stars in this Top Notch film. I find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points...All I can say is, Watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to interrupt you, take the phone off the hook, sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of IRS Agent Ben Thomas...I thank you Will Smith for another Great Film!!!</fullReview>

I really felt this movie and I wont lie, I couldn't stop crying for the last half hour; this movie should get every AWARD there is... and Will Smith, you redeemed your self with this movie. If there were more people that were really unselfish and did things, not to be seen by others nor to build up "PR", and just did the things that they did because it's in their power to do so??? This world wouldn't be as it is now full of hateful, power thirsty and selfish people, all blinded by their narrow existence, thinking of every person as an individual, when we are all one here together. Lets all open our hearts and give what we can and DO WHAT IS IN OUR POWER TO HELP MAKE A CHANGE... LOVED THE MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, yes - but in part overdone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I'd second most of the reviews being posted here. It's emotionally dense, it's intense, it's serious - with a short chuckle here and there to alleviate the emotional stress being put upon the spectator - and all in all it is a thought worth pondering: To find redemption through personal sacrifice that feels grave enough to make up for loss caused to others.The one big problem I tend to have with Hollywood productions in general is that there comes a point, where you get the feeling: "Enough already!" The same happened here: Will Smith's character goes to comparable extremes in redeeming the harm he has caused, but does he really need to become a Santa Claus impersonation in order to be authentic? What I'm referring to - hopefully without giving too much away - is that part in the movie, where he goes about fixing that sophisticated machine (I won't say more, those of you, who have already watched it, will know what I'm talking about). I mean, c'mon - did we really need *that* in order to get the picture about him going out of his way to help others? I don't think so and had I been in a different mood that day, this one particular shot would have rendered the movie totally useless and implausible to me.I still come up with a high rating, mostly for the fiercely convincing performance of the actors, where I'd have to name Will Smith before all others: He is being 100% credible, though I don't mean to disregard Rosario Dawson's performance or any of the other more prominent characters.My conclusion: Still a good flick, yes. But Hollywood: Please stop taking us for fools! Not all of us need to get things rubbed in our faces in order to get the picture, o.k.? Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven pounds is a film that is not easily boiled down to a synopsis. Any attempt by me to explain the premise would in some way spoil the journey for you, so I will just say this is a film built on the premise of giving to others.Ben Thomas, played by Will Smith, is a haunted person. He is on a mission, it is one that is filled with nightmares. For someone who seemingly is out to do good, he is absolutely grieved by the state of humanity. Will Smith delivers another spot on, serious, performance. He is by far the one actor making films today that can be in an action film one minute and the next, in a serious drama and be believable and watchable in any genre. His Ben Thomas, is on a crusade of sorts. It is a righteous crusade, looking for persons of quality to help. There is a lot of mystery to Ben and Smith makes sure not to reveal his hand too much, but slowly. The crux of the film centers on a romantic relationship between Smith's "Ben" and Rosario Dawson as "Emily". She puts in a warm and powerful performance. It is the best character I have seen her take on in many films. She is an absolute joy to watch. It is this relationship through which we learn the most about Ben. Smith and Dawson have a great chemistry. This is a film that you must turn off the questions in your mind at the beginning and allow it to play out. It answers all questions that the premise poses. The best way to enjoy it is to sit back and let the story unfold. It will surprise, engage and move you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds is depressing but very good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I finally got around to watching Seven Pounds and I have to start by saying that most of the critics are wrong to diss this movie although it's quite understandable. Seven Pounds is a challenging movie. It challenges you intellectually and emotionally but you won't easily forget the plot or the characters long after you watch it.The plot centers around Ben Thomas(Will Smith), an IRS agent who is trying to help 7 people who desperately need help. Why he wants to help these people is gradually revealed as the story progresses. One of the people he seeks to help is Emily Posa, played by Rosario Dawson. One of the pleasant surprises of Seven Pounds is how Dawson steals the movie. Smith's performance is one of his best ever but Dawson gives an Oscar worthy performance to her character.The on screen chemistry of Smith and Dawson is electric and saves the movie from getting too emotionally depressing or boring. The weirdness of the plot and Smith's character is all tied together at the emotional end. I don't usually get teary-eyed watching movies but this one got me to that point emotionally and my girlfriend was bawling next to me.As most of the reviews of Seven Pounds have stated, this film IS emotionally manipulative but in this case, it's done well. As long as it's not obvious and doesn't spoon-feed viewers on how they're supposed to feel, it's done well.</fullReview>

I decided to register with IMDb simply to help raise its rating and give it another good review, which this movie fully deserves. There are emotional movies out there, but this one touches you in such a deep way! It is very serious, but not without its happier moments. To get the full experience of this movie you need to allow yourself to become immersed in the story, which is a hard story to follow toward the beginning, but I believe it is very easy to find yourself almost falling into the movie without realizing it, and it begins to come together very neatly in the second half. Will Smith's character is so intriguing you'll just want to know more about him and what his plans are. I'm not usually a tear factory for films, but with this one I had to look over at my friend to make sure she was crying more than I was or else lose some respect for my own manliness! I strongly encourage anyone to see this one! Ten out of ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical Hollywood movie and perhaps best movie of this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I am not a fan of Will Smith because I did not like any of his other movies or acting this decade. But in this movie he is brilliant and easily gives the best performance of his career. I will not give away anything about the plot because you will enjoy this movie more without knowing anything about it in advance. All I will say is that this movie plays out as a tragedy and indicates the value of human life in a way that is heartbreaking but at the same time radiates a lot of hope. I have seen a lot of movies this year including Slumdog Millionaire and Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Slumdog Millionaire and Curious Case of Benjamin Button try to make you feel good but because they are so unrealistic, manipulative and cheesy that at the end of the movie you end up feeling crappy which is the opposite of what the filmmakers wanted. Seven Pounds avoids this common Hollywood mistake by giving us a realistic and tragic view of life but it ultimately finds light at the end of the day. Lastly I would like to say that everything about this movie is perfect, the acting, script, directing, musical score, editing, cinematography. Everything like the way people talk and act feels close to reality unlike all the other Hollywood movies and all the emotion is not manipulative but is authentic and comes naturally. It should be in top 10 movies of all time instead of Dark Knight. 10 years from now it is this gem of a movie that will be on your mind instead of all other movies this year. Seven Pounds is a true timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the touchiest sentimental humanitarian movie I've ever seen in a long run. The movie touches all the right chords of your heart. If you admire Will Smith for his great act in 'The Pursuit of Happiness' directed by the same director, believe me he is extraordinary here. Watch this film &amp; you will agree that what a fine actor he is. As this is not an easy role to maintain a character like this &amp; its always a refined actor that can do justice &amp; Will has done impressive act here. Now you need a lot of patience to absorb film like this. It's neither didactic nor shout but a whisper to the soul. Although the movie is heart tugging, it also has a secret which revealed in the end but you can guess easily if you are smart viewer.It's story of a friendly neighborhood tax collector Ben Thomas. He is an Angel in the form of human but he has his reasons too. Why he is helping people who are really needy? Ben has no perfect plan for himself or for them &amp; so lot of questions remains unanswered in the 1st half. The 2nd half is attempted to answer all of them with appropriate timings. Watch the candle light dinner scene &amp; I can't stop my heart dance to the emotions which is directly elated to my already wet eyes. The background score is the essential ingredient of every sentimental film &amp; I must say it really create a mood &amp; tone of the film in this case. Apart of class act of Will, Rosario Dawson has also gave instinctive best to flourish her character to gain the empathy of the audience. The director- Gabrielle Muccino has strongly balanced the film with keeping its emotional appeal underlined without letting you feel manipulative. The team of director-actor once again proved their power to touch viewers' hearts after their acclaimed 'The pursuit of happiness'. I'm looking forward for their team work in future also.Highly recommended.Ratings- 9/10</fullReview>

This movie was a deeply emotional, heavy, heavy movie to watch.

EVERYONE in our theatre had tears in their eyes by the end, including myself. The great thing about Seven Pounds is its appeal to everyone. It is a tear-jerker, so it will appeal to those into the dramas, but it is also a mystery with trying to figure out who the seven people are and why he has chosen them.

		<fullReview>this is a typical movie where the director creates false sense of emotionalism. many things shown in the movie are impossible and cant be done in real life. there is plenty of high drama and cryings which are totally out of place. this movie misguides people about organ transplantation procedures even to the very basic level. i have seen many such films where many stories are intertwined to finally end in all stories coming together. many such films hv been really good (crash) but this just doesn't do it. but one thing that a good point is this couldn't hv been made better. the flaw is not in making but the story itself. its definitely highly overrated. i hv gone with a generous 2 out of 10 for this .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty excited for this movie after reading the reviews and seeing the 7.6 rating. I'm not sure how this 7.6 happened. My wife and I debated between a 2 and a 3. People cite the mystery, the guessing, and the various twists/plot lines. Yes, it has mystery, though you can guess most of it fairly early on. Usual Suspects is an example of using mystery/jumping time-line effectively (Pulp Fiction another one), this movie did an incredibly poor job of it.That the last 10-15 minutes were good and provoking only disappointed me more. The whole movie could have and should have been to that level.Great concept, very poorly executed.Probably the lowest rating i've given a movie in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redeeming the lives of others as a personal catharsis...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playing a tax-collector with the Internal Revenue Service, auditing (among others) a childhood friend and a beautiful young woman in need of a new heart, Will Smith works very hard to show us he's capable of being a serious actor. All the textbook signs of a strenuously 'serious' performance are here: Smith breaks up furniture to show his anger, crinkles his brow to show his confusion, cocks his head to one side and smiles to show off his boyishness, and purses his lips against his clasped fingers in a display of contrition. Since there's very little in the way of narrative in "Seven Pounds", we in the audience have a great deal of time to study Will Smith as an Actor (which, most likely, was at least partly intentional--Smith is one of the film's producers, after all). Smith's auditor is revealed to have a philanthropic side, which is meant to be part of his mystery (his character has a secret, which is telegraphed to us in the proverbial nightmare insert). Director Gabriele Muccino, working from Grant Nieporte's shameless screenplay, never misses a trick: there's rain on the window when the two lonely souls head to the bedroom, the abused woman runs on the beach with her angelic children, the blind man (who longs for love) plays piano at a children's recital. The whole movie is overly-prepared to squeeze out tears from the impressionable, while Smith frets and pouts and worries like a knight in tarnished armor. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astoundingly Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply one of the worst movies I've seen in recent months (and I watch a lot of movies). Being a huge fan of Will Smith, I wanted to like this but it was a huge let-down. This movie feels like it was written not out of inspiration or a good idea for a script, but as a thrown-together Will Smith vehicle (I happen to feel the same way about I Am Legend, so if you liked that, you may like this). This movie also plays on every possible draw-emotion-out-of-the-audience cliché until it becomes grating. The sappy soundtrack, the close-ups of characters' faces as they become teary-eyed, it's all here. Over all, very unimaginative and surely not worth seeing (if you're looking for a true "life-affirming" movie, see The Reader).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had recently been told that Seven Pounds was this "amazing" and "heartfelt" movie..."one of Will Smith's best"....I found this to the BE EXACT OPPOSITE of what i found the film to be. The movie is about 2 hours and 5 min. long....let me sum up the movie for you....one hour and 50 min. of COMPLETE BOREDOM and about 15 of the saddest and most disturbing that I've seen in a movie. My sister and I sat down to watch it and although I was completely bored and had to force her to not walk away, I wanted to watch it till the end because I wanted to know what all the buzz was about with this movie and if something would eventually happen...it didn't. The whole getting in ice and killing myself with a jellyfish was not only ridiculous but also disturbing, what was this crazy man thinking? I was really disappointed and am not one with high expectations...but this movie was just plain awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith stars as Ben Thomas,a weary man who is trying to seek redemption for a horrible thing he has committed. Assuming the guise of a government agent, he intercedes in the lives of seven strangers he never met before,and attempts to make things right for them (and himself,in the long run). The cast is rounded out with some fine support from the likes of Woody Harrelson,as a blind man,just trying to make a living selling meat through a phone order service (when his calling in life is a musician),as well as a young woman who suffers from a congenital heart problem. The rest of the cast is rounded out with some fairly unknown faces (but still manage to pull off fine performances). This film is presented as an abstract jig saw puzzle (of sorts)that can tax the patients of the audience,but is well worth sticking it out until the end. Rated PG-13 by the MPAA,this film contains some disturbing subject matter,including a tasteful sexual encounter,as well as a bit of rough language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds tells the tale of...well we don't really know until about 1 1/2 hours into the movie.Let me try to explain this choppy plot to the best of my ability (I'm sure I can probably do a better job than the writers of this movie)...Seven Pounds was destined for disaster from the very beginning. The opening scene involves Will Smith harassing a blind man during a telemarketing call. The audience sympathetically sides with the blind man, leaving everyone resentful towards Will Smith for his actions. No one knows anything about Will Smith's character at this point, and no one really finds out until 1 1/2 hours later. His character is mysterious and leaves us guessing what his motives are. When we finally found out towards the end of the movie - NO ONE CARES. The director must have been sleeping in film school when they taught him that the key ingredient in a movie is character development. In order for us to care about what is happening, we need to care about the character, which we hadn't done for the entirety of the movie.When the movie finally came together, I said to myself "so what?" There was not enough shock value that made the twisted story line necessary. There was a lot missing in this movie overall. I felt empty.This movie was not believable whatsoever. Do you believe that a man pretending to work for the IRS would give his life by committing suicide with a jellyfish in a bathtub just to donate his liver, heart, and eyeballs to those in need? It seems a little far-fetched to me. I don't even think Mother Theresa would do those things.The creators of this movie were clearly inspired by 21 Grams. Seven Pounds also had twisted story lines, an organ donor, and what was meant to be shock value when the story finally came together (big emphasis on the word meant). The main difference here is that 21 Grams was masterful and Seven Pounds was poorly executed and very amateur.Trust me, the creators of Seven Pounds thought they had a masterpiece when they released this movie. This movie was not marketed for box office sales, it was not meant to be pure entertainment, rather it was supposed to be artistic (big emphasis on the word supposed). I can assure you that they really thought they had a legitimate shot at getting nominated. It is no coincidence that they were overlooked.Either there is corruption by critics in Hollywood or IMDb users are just too easy to please. I can not believe people say they were "blown away" by this movie. For those whom I just quoted, your opinion is officially null and void. IMDb should ban you from persuading people to waste their time, ultimately setting them up for an inevitable let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds - **Director: Gabriele Muccino Certificate: 12A Duration: 123 minutes Starring: Will Smith, Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson Seven Pounds is the second film that you'd of heard of by Gabriele Muccino, the other being The Pursuit of Happiness which is on my to see list. Am pretty sure he goes for some sort life changing film, a film with a message, but I just don't understand what the message is suppose to be for this film.The film stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas who begins the film reporting his own suicide, but forget about that. Then the film actually starts, which is Ben Thomas Trying to help seven different people who he thinks deserve it. One of which is Ezra Turner played by Woody Harrelson who is a blind, vegetarian, meat seller. Who I found as a very interesting character but you don't see much of him, you do see a lot of Emily Posa played by Rosario Dawson who is a lonely heart problem sufferer who is having trouble coping with life. So along comes Ben to save the day by trying making her life a little better, by getting somewhat 'involved' with her. I can't really say much more without revealing too much, about half way through you guess the unsatisfying ending. You may be thinking as I was where are the other of the seven people he was supposed to be saving, well if you watch carefully and connect the dots you probably find that there where seven but I found it annoying that its mostly just about Emily.Most films like this normally have a message that they tell you to live your life by, but this films has none of which I can find which are good and could actually do any good, live you life devoting your life to help 7 people who have stuff wrong with there bodies.The acting was top notch with Will Smith proving that he can act in almost any role. Rosario Dawson was great but nothing spectacular. Woody Harrelson does great in the little bits he has, but I think if he had more screen time his performance could have been something special.So I left cinema thinking 'what the hell was the point of that?'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is a movie about Ben Thomas (Will Smith), an IRS agent with a fateful secret, embarks on an extraordinary journey of redemption by forever changing the lives of seven strangers. It is a movie with a lot of dramatic quality, so touching and heart-breaking. The movie presents how people, in this case Smith's character, manages his life and the consequences it carries no matter how good or bad they are. The movie has a very good story, the plot is well developed and convincing and it is full of unexpected twists that makes it even more interesting. The film starts slow but as it moves along it takes a very good rhythm until the end. The cast is formed by very good actors. Will Smith is constantly evolving as an actor, his performance in Seven Pounds is powerful and full of drama. Rosario Dawson was great, you can really feel her suffering and Woody Harrelson was so convincing in his role as Ezra Turner. In conclusion, Seven Pounds is heart breaking and tear dropping movie that you will enjoy. highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Will Smith Film Yet........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best Will Smith Film Will Smith has always been an interesting actor for me. I watch everything he does I must admit that the idea of him playing another heartbroken, distanced from the world individual (Hancock, I am Legend) made me a little annoyed, but this one was a home run. The character Ben Thomas is such a mystery that you want to know what he plans to do; for others, for himself, etc. As the story unfolds, so does his intentions and not in a really simplistic way. He's a complex person, but not so much that he aggravates me. He's intriguing.Great frigging film.Let me put that more eloquently.....frigging fantastic.I was really moved by this work.It was touching on so many levels.and the acting and performances were nuanced, layered and authentic.from all players.really, really great work that brought tears to my eyes...more than once.I won't go into the plot of the film. Just see it. The less you know the better.Will Smith's best work to date. The man has so truly grown and CONTINUES to grow as an artist (and human being) - that's the part that really amazes me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith's messiah complex...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Seven Names. Seven Strangers. One Secret." is the mysterious teaser of Seven Pounds. The latest Will Smith vehicle teams him up again with director Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happiness), and that dual branding is enough to get people in the theaters, even without knowing anything about the story.All we are allowed to know is that Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is a secretive, self-flagellating IRS agent who gets flashbacks from what appears to be his past life. He seems bent on a goal of screening seven worthy recipients of a purported gift he is able to give. Among the people he helps are Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson), a blind vegan pianist, and Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a young woman with congenital heart failure and the inadvertent object of Ben's affection.Based on an original script by Grant Nieporte, the poetic allusion to Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is marvelously clever. However, the major twist in the story unfolds in excruciating slow-mo that the revelation sadly becomes anti-climactic, with its dramatic scenes drawn out too long. Seven Pounds could have been executed so much better. It meant well, but the pacing was off. Too much time was left open to anticipate what was happening, so I was unable to feel for the characters and their situations at the right time. As an aside, it is interesting to note Will Smith's messiah complex in all the roles he chooses. :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters stuck in a sea of dramatic sludge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half hour of this drama is intriguing. Will Smith, who appears to be working for the IRS, is visiting people who owe the government money and deciding whether he'll give them a break. Why is he doing this? We don't know yet. His brother is calling him all the time and he doesn't want to deal with him. Something odd is afoot. When Smith meets Rosario Dawson, a woman with a heart condition, he decides to anoint her with kindness -- and give her a tax break, of course. At the one hour mark, the film becomes sludge. Its promise fades and it starts birthing clichés and stock romantic situations. We learn why Smith is doing what he's doing, even though it was telegraphed long ago. It's no fun to watch something that had potential crumble. Director Gabriele Muccino shoots everything with long lenses and pulls in and out of focus at every opportunity. His style is plodding and obvious. Everything is so overlit and overproduced that it feels like the characters are operating in a sea of mud. There's no blue sky, not literally or figuratively. Smith is solid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me first 40 minutes to understand what was going on - the plot, I mean; the next 40 minutes to correct myself when i thought i had really understood the movie and wanted to watch the end because it was getting too exciting, but the last 40 were spent trying to cope with the feeling of pressing the "forward" button on my remote.All in all, it is a very strong performance by Will, he has done a tremendous job by playing the protagonist, he looses his family and happens to kill Seven other people in a car crash owing to his negligence of working while driving. Rightly so he is unhappy and wants to make the world a better place for some seven people who he thinks are worthy enough. How does he find these seven people? He audits them by impersonating an IRS (Internal Revenue Services) agent.Amazingly, people do doubt him being a IRS guy but none really bothers to do a check upon him. He helps most of them out either by giving them money, home, bone-marrow or other body organs. So, I assume none is really bothered till the help is coming for free (health related in America, quite understandable). :-)Will lands up falling in love with one of the Seven and find himself in doubt that whether he should go ahead as planned or just live with her happily ever after. His mind does play a lot of games but these games a little to long to bear in the movie. I mean common I am talking about 2 hours!!! Anyway, in the end, the movie has a punch to it and then we have Will; just that had it been a little crisp it would have been much better off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Attempt - But Never Quite Reaches It's Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ahh Will Smith, it seems you come here often, and your latest film 'Seven Pounds' somewhat gives me the impression that you are now only doing films to prove to me that you really can act, am i correct? Do you honestly think that my view of you is that you're still 'chillin in bel air with Jazzy Jeff?' ". Will Smith's latest flick is more about the man himself than the movie's protagonist, Ben Thomas. Maybe, as stated earlier, this really is the attempt that Smith is taking to prove to the public that he really should be an Academy Award winning, prestigious and highly acclaimed actor known across the globe. Well I would like you to know Mr. Smith; you have achieved near enough everything on that list, although sadly, this film will win you no Oscar. This is by no means a poorly casted film, especially with the likes of Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson supporting Smith, there is certainly no lack of talent. The only issue is that the talent is wasted. Dawson plays a large part in the flick, taking up around a third of the entire movie, yet throughout she is let down by a largely contrasted character to her usual roles. Her general demeanour is that she is a strong woman, almost an Angelina Jolie persona, subject to playing strong female roles, apparent in 'Deathproof' and 'Eagle Eye', these being her most recent and successful appearances. Harrelson however presents himself superbly as the blind pianist with a heart of gold, and responds brilliantly with the other actors surrounding him. Yet, Harrelson is rarely to be seen, and I often found myself waiting for the next time that he would be seen in the movie, mainly due to his mystical and often intriguing character. The cinematography within the movie is nothing short of stunning. From the opening sequences to the closing stages you are constantly left with the image of nature, which you should notice is a huge factor within the film, and is portrayed in such a vast variety of ways that you often lose track of dialogue through the brilliance in which the production is shot. Gabriele Muccino, whom shot into stardom with the 2006 hit 'The Pursuit of Happiness', really does seem to have gone to great lengths in order to do what he can to win Will Smith an Oscar. The film itself is written to an immensely high standard, and often it is baffling how such a well written, beautifully directed and superbly performed piece can aspire to be something which overall seemed like an idea which did not reach its potential. The reasons I have for the disappointment that the film laid out for me when i left the cinema, are as follows; 1) Will Smith's acting skills are put on show above the films plot. 2) Too many story lines are attempted to be merged together to create one 'super plot' 3) The soundtrack was ridiculous. Will Smith fixing a printing press to Muse's 'Feeling Good' :( 4) Too much crying, and often the crying seems pointless and irrelevant. Smith even cries whilst having it off with Rosario Dawson. To some people, that could be seen as a criminal offence.So overall, 'Seven Pounds' is an above average film; although some may argue that it is more of a stepping stone than an actual worthwhile production. Will Smith, and I hate to go on about him, needs to do whatever film he wants to do. Rosario Dawson needs a few more tries at emotional roles before I believe she will crack it. Woody Harrelson needs to find himself a bigger role, because 'No Country For Old Men' may have been a one off, and if he does more films playing a rarely seen or poorly written character, for example 'Seven Pounds' or 'Semi-Pro', then he may never have the chance to be a top actor. The film then, whilst being emotional and thought provoking, with a brilliantly constructed twist and extremely well presented finale, fails to meet the expectations of a film which could have been so much more. It gets a bonus half a point for bringing a tear to my eye. 7.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Seven Pounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years ago, director Gabriele Muccino collaborated with Will Smith successfully in their year end offering of The Pursuit of Happiness, which while based on the struggles of real life struggler made good Chris Gardner, had a saccharine sweet and triumphant ending befitting of the end of year mood of putting the last year behind you, and looking forward to a better tomorrow. This time round however, the Muccino-Smith partnership has brought about a sustained doom, gloom and heaviness throughout the film that perhaps accurately mirrors current sentiments of the downturn that doesn't look to go anywhere upwards next year as well.There's nary a light-hearted moment in the film, and it begins in what would be uncharacteristic of Smith to be barraging down on a visually handicapped person (Woody Harrelson in a very subdued, supporting role), insulting him and calling him names. In fact, you're more than likely to feel kind of angry with Smith's Ben Thomas, an IRS tax man who continues his verbal assault over the telephone on a stranger whom he doesn't know, yet.You see, it's all a test of character. Ben Thomas is a man on a mission, and while the filmmakers would like you to think that his ultimate aim was something still kept under wraps, it doesn't take long before you decipher just what he's up to, given a clue right from the start of the film that he intends to take his own life, and little hints dropped every now and then. Ben wants to help seven people before his demise, and just how he's going about doing so, is the subject of almost two hours in the film.The plot brews rather slowly, and curiously, doesn't bore even as it doesn't keep you guessing for long. It holds out the real reason and verbatim rationale why he's doing what he's doing, though cynics in us might deem it as an extreme case of seeking redemption. But thankfully, we got Will Smith's acting ability to keep our attention arrested, because he has shown that he's as adept to big budgeted action blockbusters, as he is with strong drama dealing with human emotions. While you may question Ben's technique, you cannot deny that here's a man that's set in his ways that even best friend Dan (Barry Pepper) could do nothing to change his course, and only to respect his wishes to carry everything through when the time calls for it.And central to this story, is the relationship between Ben and Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a woman who's dished out a death sentence that could happen at any time because of an impending heart failure. It is this story-arc that takes up the bulk of the screen time, and the other benefactors from Ben's magnanimous benevolence only became side shows, with 2 of them just lip service, which was a disappointment because they were relegated to copping out (or the lack of screen opportunities). But it is this love story that could and yet couldn't be, that was achingly heart-wrenching to watch.At first I had dismissed this as yet another star-crossed lovers type of story that Fate had a hand in, but this relationship grows on you, and while it looked like an eventual 21 Grams, the chemistry between Dawson and Smith brought out the best in what could have become some really bad melodrama. I guess I always enjoy stories about sacrifices, and what more about the sacrifice that has to happen, as portrayed in the story, that makes it heartbreaking to bear witness to.Seven Pounds might turn away those looking for some fantastical, escapist storyline to take their minds off temporarily from current troubles, but for Will Smith fans, and those looking for something that doesn't choose to wince away from what it had set out to do, then this might be the film for you this New Year period. It might not have plenty to offer, but for powerful performances, then look no further than this piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Just Another Chick Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't been so disappointed by a movie in a long, long time. I like Will Smith. I was looking forward to a poignant drama about interpersonal relationships. I had such high hopes. Instead I got a series of disjointed vignettes that lethargically drag from one clichéd scene to another. Arrrggghhhhh! It reminds me of the self-glorifying pap that Kevin Costner started cranking out after Dances With Wolves.Cliché #1: Will Smith's character is a charismatic aerospace engineer who has it all?making big bucks as a captain of industry, sports car, beach house, beautiful girlfriend, but his work consumes all of his time. Cliché #2: He is tormented by the tragic death of his girlfriend in a spectacular slow-motion car crash. Cliché #3: Sporadic flashbacks that give you glimpses of his past. Cliché #4: Rosario Dawson's character is an alluring yet fragile single girl plagued by a life threatening illness. Cliché #6: Even though she has no visible means of support, she lives quite comfortably in a charmingly decorated, cutesy L.A. cottage. Cliché #7: Her illness prevents her from pursuing her creative passion as a graphic designer. Cliché #8: She has a dog. Cliché #9: Will Smith rescues her. Cliché #10: They fall in love. Cliché #11: Their love is doomed.So for almost two hours Will Smith mopes from cliché to cliché, and his reflective looks of anguish become increasingly annoying. Okay, okay, he's haunted by his girlfriend's death. I get the picture, let's move along or at least find some other way to express it besides an another lingering shot of Smith's pained and brooding mug.Dawson's character is slowly dying, but in a wistful and romantic sort of way. With mounting bills and no income she apparently lives at ease with a ginormous Great Dane that would eat any normal family out of house and home within a week or two. What little spare cash she has at her disposal is spent on candles and flowers and her illness flares and fades according to the convenience of the script.Other cast members pop-up intermittently in vague reference to Smith's character, but you never get any real feeling of who they are. Some are benefactors of Smith's good will, including a Hispanic woman with two kids stuck in an abusive relationship. Her salvation comes when Smith signs over his beach house to her and sends her on her way behind the wheel of an old minivan. Never mind the fact that she has probably never driven a car before and like Dawson's character has no job or source of income. How on earth will she ever pay the property tax bill on a beachfront home in Malibu? And so it goes. The situations are improbable and the characters unbelievable. As a result you never make any emotional connection with the film. It's not that the movie's premise is ill conceived or the acting is bad. It just could have been so much better, so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Megalomaniac is back...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smiths messianic complex continues with his new film Seven Pounds. Smith plays a kind soul out to save lives in order to atone for killing seven people in a car wreck. He donates his organs to people that need them, eventually giving his heart (weighing seven pounds) to Rosario Dawson and dieing. There is also a scene where he cries while having sex with Dawson.Smiths involvement in Scientology has made him into The Black Tom Cruise, a Scien-zombie fake laughing his way through TV appearance after TV appearance while unknowingly being mocked by the world for his ego-maniacal disposition and his insulated from reality world view. He has been throwing a lot of money at the organized crime scam that is the Church of Scientology. Mostly through some of their cover groups- the New York Rescue Relief Workers Fund and ABLE. And, of course, the Scientology private school he started- New Village Academy.Back to Seven Pounds. It was directed by the same guy who did Smiths other heroic heart string manipulator, The Pursuit of Happiness. I guess the only good thing I can say about Seven Pounds is his annoying kid isn't in this one. I'm not the only one who can't stand Smith and his movies. Check out this little review from the trade paper Variety: "Nor can it be said that Smith, whose most recent box office barn-burners, 'I Am Legend' and 'Hancock,' seemed consciously designed to set the star apart from the rest of humanity, shies away from the saintlike status conferred upon his character. Indeed, he embraces it in a way so convincing that it proves disturbing as an indication of how highly this or any momentarily anointed superstar may regard himself." Or allow me to quote the reputable New York Times film critic A. O. Scott. Seven Pounds is "what may be among the most transcendently, eye- popping, call- your- friend- ranting- in- the- middle- of- the- night- just- to-go- over- it- one- more- time crazily awful motion pictures ever made." Wow! Full disclosure- I didn't see Seven Pounds. Any one who does should be shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The take away from this movie is: 1. Don't use your mobile while driving. It is Bad. 2. Sign up for an organ donor programme. It is Good. 3. If you cause someone's death, you will feel Bad. You will be hearing lots of sad music played out of tune. 4. Soap operas at least come divided into merciful portions of 40 minutes/episode. This pretentious full-of-itself cinematographic torture went on regurgitating 3 worn out clichés for 2 hours. Felt like 10 times that. 5. Will Smith and Rosario Dawson rock. What a waste of talent and brilliant acting.Watching paint dry would be a less irritating use of time. Arranging for the director to be re-assigned into writing Wal Mart in-store entertainment programmes would have made a very satisfying 1 of the 7 pounds in this movie instead of the Good Acts that the all-so-suffering Will Smith performed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I'm absolutely serious. I thankfully didn't read about Seven Pounds at all before watching it so I was totally caught off-guard about the way events unfold. I have to say, I've never been touched and wrecked harder emotionally than after this film. I literally could barely speak for hours, and I found it hard to get back in my life for days. I won't give concrete spoilers out, but I have to say, if you're emotionally unstable, don't watch this movie until you're feeling better. It really affects you and it might affect you in a bad way. That being said... it's probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and is definitely on my Top 10 list of movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good: - Decent enough acting from all the leads. Will Smith doesn't surprise but doesn't embarrass himself or the audience either - Decent enough photography - Decent enough score, with a clever, purposeful 'out of tune' note during the main theme - Interesting overall premiseThe bad: - Plot holes everywhere. Someone please tell the writer that an interesting premise with dramatic overtones doesn't compensate for evident impossibilities in the script - Movie's ending is revealed in the first 60 seconds, but somehow the whole piece is setup as a 'plot twist' regardless. Mmm.So what we have here is a better than average movie with a solid concept that gets its pencils crossed pretty early on and never quite recover. A missed opportunity, but still very watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overwrought, slow. The idea may be a good one but in practice it was over-directed--I'm assuming the overacting wasn't completely Will's fault. Woody Harrelson was good as always. Maybe he should have been the lead. I spent the first hour wondering why Will Smith looked constipated half the time and I spent the second hour wondering why it was taking another hour to get to the conclusion. I knew halfway through the movie exactly how the Will-Rosario connection was going to play out and I don't imagine I'm the only one. To the film's credit, I did tear up, but that's because Rosario actually rocked her roll and they were playing that awful heart string plucking stuff at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smith makes this pull at the heart strings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was released many compared it to the previous film starring Smith and directed by Muccino, The Pursuit Of Happiness. I can tell you it is not like that film at all. Yes it is a bit of a tear jerker and yes Smith perhaps does play the same kind of role, but the themes and issues of Seven Pounds are completely different. This film is about guilt and how one man shows his way of erasing the guilt that is eating away at him from the inside, and how he must alter himself when obstacles get in the way of his plan.The film centres around the life of Ben Thomas (Smith), an IRS agent who is with holding a secret. A secret that is slowly unravelling as Ben meets seven complete strangers throughout the beginning of the film. With erratic behaviour, he seems to test each character into seeing if they are a genuine good person. Once he is convinced they are the wheels of his plan are set into motion, until he begins to spend more time with one of the strangers, Emily Poza (Dawson), a woman suffering a heart condition. He begins to fall for her and the questions arise as of whether or not he continues with his plan for the sake of this woman.The big reveal is good. Some people will guess the secret and the plan before it is revealed but that doesn't make it have less of an impact. It is very emotional. It is a good reveal at the same time as being sad and a very good way to bring the intertwining relationships, characters and secrets together. It will probably bring a tear to your eye. Not saying I cried but some people will. I swear I didn't cry!Smith is very good in the lead role. He manages to bring a range of emotions to his character and you utterly believe him when he cries, screams or just remains totally silent. He plays the character awkwardly and it makes you feel awkward to watch but it keeps you away from his secrets and makes you want to know more about him. His performance does pull at the heart strings but it is his relationship with Dawson that really is a tear jerker. As they slowly fall for each other the stakes raise, with her closer to death and him re-considering his perfect plan. The chemistry between the two seems real and their performances really bring the sadness out in this film.However this area of the plot is where the film really slows down. We start seeing Thomas tracking down his targets and treating them with little respect, even smashing ones head into a window, but when he meets Emily we seem to sidetrack and spend a lot of the time focusing on them two developing into a relationship. I began to forget the entire beginning of the film and that he was actually on some kind of secret mission. I suppose he is feeling like this within himself and that is why we are left to feel like this as well, I just didn't think it worked and found myself wanting the plot to go back to the same pace it had at the beginning. The film is just over two hours and perhaps they could have cut twenty minutes of this part from the film. Despite slowly beginning to fade out of the movie the ending drew me straight back in. The final act is sad and threads the entire plan together nicely and we are brought back to the same tone as we were experiencing at the beginning of the film. I was back to thoroughly enjoying it again. Smith really is great in this film and I was drawn into character well. His relationship with Dawson is believable and develops nicely. The overall plot and narrative of the film is intriguing, especially with the slow unravel of Smith's secret mission. Other than a mid second act lull this is a good film that I recommend to all.3.5 / 5TolliFollow my blog and more reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By viewing the trailer, I was expected to see something along the lines of The Pursuit of Happiness. In fact they both have Will Smith and the same director Muccino. Instead, I was treated to a few hours of boredom. This film has a good premise but I never felt so bored in a movie before.This film is about some IRS agent who plans to help seven people in the world. These people begins to touch his heart as he gets to know them more.The acting is probably the only thing making this movie watchable. Will Smith and Rosario Dawson were great. I even liked the performance by Woody Harrelson.This film really got interesting in the final twenty minutes. But I didn't like they way how Ben Thomas died. I thought that was lame but it was still sad.Overall, this movie is okay. If you want a snooze, this movie is for you. There are some good things and bad things but I was disappointed. I rate this film 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not just talking about the film - some of the comments and reviews are pretty extraordinary. Reality it seems, has flown right out of the window on this one. Don't get me wrong, Will Smith is a great actor and this movie is worth seeing, but it is way over the top and the plot has more holes in it than a string vest. In the first place Ben Thomas is a de facto criminal. Starting with Man.2/Reckless Endangerment (or whatever charge is appropriate), he moves on to several Federal offences (anyone who has seen the movie will know what I mean)and not satisfied with that, is guilty of stalking (men, women and children), breaking and entering and sundry other offences. However, no one is in the least bit bothered by his distinctly weird behaviour (including hanging around a hospital looking at and talking to women and children); no law enforcement officials investigate him and, most unbelievable of all, no one calls the police at any time. Why not? Because Ben Thomas is played by an 'A' List movie star with the looks to match. Does anyone seriously believe this film story could work if Ben Thomas looked like Mr 'T' or Quentin Tarantino? Come on people, get real. If Ben hadn't been so good looking his behaviour would have had him reported to the cops and arrested in double quick time - especially in these paranoid times. As for the holes in the plot, where do I start? How about this:if Ben had done what his brother says he has done, his body would be covered with scars - yet Emily Posa doesn't notice any or ask about them and we certainly don't see any. What about the chosen means of death? You can't just walk into a pet shop and get one of those creatures, so where the hell did he get it? Also there is no indication that Ben left a warning for the emergency services, so quite possibly further charges of Man.2/Reckless endangerment might be in order. One other example - the beach-side house: no way would Ben still have that after what he had done. He would have had the ass sued off him and lost everything he owned. For that matter, how is Connie Tepos going to pay for the upkeep of a beach-side house when she no longer has a job and probably dare not apply for state help for fear of being traced by her 'ex'. OK, as I say, it's a film worth watching, the cast are all very good and yes, it is a moving even wonderful concept, but ten stars and buckets of tears, I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith is one of those few great actors who can make u laugh and cry in the same movie with his breathtaking performances. In this movie Will sticks to making us cry by his performance. I watched this movie with very less expectations as it came just after Hancock( Will's worst movie) .The Story is of an IRS agent who sets on a journey of redemption to change the lives of 7 strangers. The screenplay of this movie is a huge drawback as it tends to get boring at many moments. The initial scenes between 'Ben' and 'Emily' are really lame and pointless. The character development of Emily (who's counting her days) was not so perfect. The performances of all characters are pretty outstanding especially Will Smith and Woody Harrelson . The plot has a very sensitive touch and emotional thing about it but the director fails to impress us at many situations.The movie could have been much more if more thought was put into it. There are few plot holes along the way and the chemistry between the lead pair is not great. All said and done Will Smith has given a stunning performance as Ben Thomas and shines above all in this not so great movie.The other technical aspects were just average but the background score was pretty heart warming. This is a movie to watch for all Will Smith fans but for others u can avoid this flick !!!Rating 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr Smith puts himself about a bit, or bits of himself about..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly large numbers of writers express their amazement at the fact that Mr Will Smith can actually act - what did they think he was doing in all his other movies,playing himself? In "Seven Pounds" he may be acting against type - but that is entirely a different matter.The Studios have decided to market him as a cool,wisecrackin'dood and he has happily gone along with it.When he is neither cool nor wisecrackin'it doesn't necessarily follow that he deserves an Oscar(T.M.).That,I think,is rather patronising,like Dame Kiri te Kanawa singing a Rodgers and Hart song as an encore piece and being greeted with whoops of joy for being down with whatever the operatic equivalent of kids might be He cries a lot in "Seven Pounds",something which apparently ladies nowadays favour in their men.To be fair to him he's pretty good at it,but to me it does get a bit tedious after a bit.We get the message, he's upset,you don't have to hit us over the head with it. *Spoilers Ahead* Having killed seven people in a car crash he sets out to change seven lives for the better by the rather extreme expedient of having the appropriate number of body parts transplanted into recipients of his choice.He falls in love with the lady to whom he will - literally - give his heart and despite their various ailments and a distinct lack of full body parts in his case,they manage to have sex before he goes off and kills himself.One would hope, for the lady's self - confidence, that these events are not related. I hope I am not being unduly cynical when I say that only the unlikelihood of "Seven Pounds Part two - the return of the heartless,eyeless,kidneyless man" coming to our screens in the immediate future has allowed me to award this movie 4 stars out of ten. These were shared between Mr Smith and Mr Harrelson who was also playing against type,but not many people seemed to have noticed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by Grant Nieporte &amp; Directed by Gabriele Muccino 'Seven Pounds' is innovative, but depressing nonetheless.Muccino who made the mind-blowing biopic 'The Pursuit of Happiness', returns with the same hero Will Smith in a film that surely disappoints. Agreed, it dares to be different, agreed, it's emotional.... but no-one can deny that this film leaves you depressed, which doesn't work on its advantage. 'Seven Pounds' has noble intentions, but not sharp.'Seven Pounds' starts off in a dull note, and ends the very same. But Will Smith makes the dullest moments slightly lively due to his strong portrayal. The Superstar is in from, yet again. Coming to other performances, Rosario Dawson is terrific. She's in character in each &amp; every shot, which truly proves her immense talent. Woody Harrelson deserved more footage, nevertheless, he's excellent as a blind meat salesman who plays the piano. Michael Ealy is passable. Barry Pepper is restricted to a few expressions here &amp; there. Elpidia Carrillo does not deliver. Mainly, because she has a half-baked character.On the whole 'Seven Pounds' deserves a watch, for it's innovative idea &amp; first-rate performances by Will Smith &amp; Rosario Dawson. But get ready to be depressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Sounds...of boredom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie epitomizes what Will Smith has slowly become- A transgressor of good themes. Just like in I am Legend and Hancock, a theme with amazing potential is dealt with in such a highhanded, absurdly depressing fashion that it leaves you wondering about Smith's psyche. Compare him to someone like DiCaprio, a lot of whose movies also end with his death but they sync with the script! Whereas with Smith, it's just his personal, arrogant tryst with "acting".Seven Pounds has no body of logic, pun intended. Ben's method of choosing deserving recipients is idiotic. He chooses Ezra because he is slow to anger? WTF. What he really wanted was a jelly willed person who'd swallow a loadful of insults with a smile. Does that make a person good? Was Ezra not retaliating because he had a inferiority complex and fear of being hounded by a lunatic, or because he truly didn't mind the vilification? And apart from Dawson, there is no time given to show Ben's interaction with the rest of his beneficiaries. It's not clearly shown how Ben's brother receives his lung, and who gets the liver, bone marrow and kidney. I had to read the FAQ section on IMDb to get it straight. And he chose the Hispanic women because she was too proud to ask for help? My impression was that she was just scared out of her wits. The only creditable part of the whole slow-motion pseudo film-noire montage was the chemistry between Smith and Dawson. She was convincing in her portrayal of a sub-urban, lonely woman with a weak heart.Ben however, came across as a very irritated, egoistical man who'd find it really tough to garner any sympathy from the audience. His was of redeeming himself for accidentally killing seven persons is a laughable short cut to get rid of his guilt. Being a fairly healthy, young man, he could have donated his body organs at the end of his natural life and still saved quite a few people. What you'd expect him to do is to do something for the unprivileged people throughout his life, thus really making atoning for his carelessness while driving. Especially since he was a MIT engineer with a bright career and money, there were a thousand ways he could have done so much more, like sponsoring/adopting needy children or setting up schools in sub-Saharan Africa and so forth. However, what he does do is donate his seaside mansion to an abused wife and her two kids; a place that could have catered to fifty kids if turned into an orphanage. Even if he was hell-bent on helping the Hispanic, could he not just have disposed her junky boyfriend? He was anyway going to suicide, so why not take a few bad guys with him? And making out with Dawson when she had a weak heart was akin to a homicide. Maybe the self-loathing chap wanted a last hurrah before going out. And where did he get a poisonous jellyfish? Besides, the poison would have made his heart useless anyway. Not to mention the danger posed to paramedics who'd have hauled him out of the iced water tub. His warning note wouldn't be of much help as any medic would first attend to a body rather than read notes.And worst of all, the poor Dawson has to live the guilt all her life because he made double sure everyone knew what he had done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Names. Seven Strangers. One Secret.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Thomas is a man at a crossroads searching for a way to redeem his heavy conscience. He discovers he has the power to change the circumstances of seven strangers who deserve a second chance. But when one of them captures his heart, he must decide if he should reveal his secret, even if it means giving up on his plan.SEVEN POUNDS is one of those movies where you see the trailer and you're intrigued by the movie. By the time you're halfway through the film, you knew you made a mistake watching it. SEVEN POUNDS has a good concept, but I'm afraid I cannot reveal it because it's not revealed until the last few minutes of the film. This is one problem of the movie. In order to know Thomas' secret, we are put through some of the most depressed and dull people on screen with dialogue reeking pretentiousness.It's not a pleasant movie to sit through. Knowing the secret beforehand doesn't help either. You'll still be put through the pretentiousness either way. Another reason the film does not work is because of Will Smith's character. He is an a-hole and you see Will Smith putting a sad expression on the verge of tears in literally every freaking scene! You want to go up there and slap him in the face. His character truly frustrates me. Every cast member tries to do their best, especially the lovely Rosario Dawson, but the material just does not work.The movie tries to be thought provoking and profound but it all comes off as pretentious. By the end of the film, it leaves a bad aftertaste and it's one of Will Smith's worst roles. I just could not feel sorry for him because he acts entirely mean to everyone and depressed 95% of the time. SEVEN POUNDS has a great concept but it's confuses and frustrates its viewers by the time the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who does he think he is? The character of Ben is basically playing God. After being such a dickhead to cause the accident in the first place, including killing his partner who is sitting next to him without a seat belt on, he gets to choose who lives or dies. I thought at the time the movie was moving, but the more I think about it the less I like it. If he had killed 7 people through his own thoughtlessness he should at least be in prison for manslaughter, but no, he's out there choosing people to try to atone for his mistakes. All wrong. I love Will Smith as an actor, but the entire premise of this film stinks. If you want to donate parts of you to others when you die, you don't get to choose who they go to. Who are you to judge who is good and who is not? In my opinion, don't bother with this film. I've just watched "Out of the Blue" a Kiwi movie about a true story, the contrast is incredible. Hollywood, take note and get back to the drawing board.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and schmaltzy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After their previous collaboration in "The pursuit of happiness" director Gabrielle Muccino and Will Smith have teamed up again to bring another heart-wrenching story of a man with a haunting secret inexplicably trying to change the lives of seven strangers. Why "Seven Pounds"? No doubt this is a reference to Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice", but, even not knowing this will not take long to piece together the jigsaw puzzle pieces thrown at you to figure out ending of this emotionally manipulative film."Seven Pounds is heavily influenced by "21 Grams" using flashbacks to deliver vital parts of a dramatic story, however, unlike its predecessor, it is not nearly as weighty or has strong characters for it to be interesting. It is not really the fault of Will Smith that the film struggles to gain pace but rather the hammy dialogue and story changes, which do little to explain anything and often leave you questioning "did I miss something?" A lot can be said for Rosario Dawson, however, who gifted as being both naturally beautiful and a terrific performer. Much like a stale M. Night Shyamalan film 'Seven Pounds' is an overdrawn one tone film relying on an ending that will be either predictable or logically absurd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When will the sanctification of Will Smith be complete?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith is now evidently embarked on making himself a Serious Guy; he's been in a string of movies (I Legend; Hancock; Happiness) where he's not asking us to laugh at him, or to like him, but to see him as a guy who has Issues. Seven Pounds continues this streak in a film that only has a contrived way of leaving out most of his motivation or any connective tissue for the whole first hour, making us have faith that it will come together at the end, which, to our dismay, it does. ---- Spoiler Alert ----There is a good movie to be made about a guy who, through magic or a special supernatural power, has the ability to fix the lives of, say, seven deserving people. There is not that movie, although for awhile one might think it is. There is also a good movie to be made about the subject of organ transplants in general and some sort of metaphysical meaning that can be associated with that; this is not that movie either, but if you want to see that movie, go rent "21 grams".There is another good movie to be made about a guy who, consumed by guilt and regret for causing the death of his wife (? girlfriend ?) along with six others, decides to commit suicide and, in doing so, donate his organs and tissues to people he has deemed worthy of his sacrifice. This is not that movie either; Seven Pounds is, by the end, almost staggeringly clumsy in the way it tells its story, sentimental in an ugly way, and, as soon as you start to really think about its premise, thoroughly unpleasant in retrospect. Ben Thomas (the character we think is played by Smith) is not good or subtle with the people he meets as prospective recipients of his body parts. He judges them based in a hurry (well, I guess he kind of has to) based on pretty arbitrary criteria: are they patient, are they kind, are the charitable? and if you're going by a quick reading of Corinthians I guess that's okay, but the idea of interviewing people you might be giving your life for in order to see if they make a "good person" cut is, I don't know, just kind of creepy for me. Plus! what the hell is up with any medical professional who would collude with him on a plan like this?I like Will Smith, but in this movie he has the Julia Roberts problem: like her character in My Best Friend's Wedding, his character can really do some pretty despicable things and, because of who he is, the audience is supposed to find them just fine, if not even admirable. Consider that he steals his brother's ID to misrepresent himself dozens of times in the movie, lies to Rosario Dawson's character, browbeats the poor blind guy verbally over the phone, and in general, is a fraud. If this role were played by an actor without his likability (or an ugly or fat one), we wouldn't be tempted to give him a pass. But, wait, there's more! ... even though he knows that Rosario's character will be one of the recipients, he won't leave her alone, doing everything he (that is, the screenwriter) can to make her fall in love for him. In spite of all of this, everything is just rosy at the end. At one point she accuses him of stalking her; he doesn't exactly deny it, but we're supposed to say "No! CAN'T YOU SEE? IT ISN'T STALKING WHEN WILL SMITH DOES IT!!". But ... she's right, he is stalking her, supposedly to make sure that she's Worthy, but mainly... well, as she says "I used to be hot". Will Smith, come back! We miss you. MIB3, Pleeeeze?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven out of ten pounds...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was just sick of the incessant pre-release advertising for movies. Most publicity budgets these days are well over the amount most of the classics cost to make. It's the relentless assault of images from the films at a level that throws every scene at you. Trailers come hard and often at such a fast clip that the mind records, analyzes and digests them entirely. The drive for weekend dominance. Rapid-fire box office profit. Look, it's a Will Smith/Rosario Dawson movie. And I was determined to see it based on that alone.Will Smith is a fine actor who has definitely evolved. His fame and fortune were had on the strength of his ability to entertain. Initially with music, then television and finally film. There are two people on the planet that can immediately lighten a mood under any circumstances. One is named Will, the other Williams. Both do exceedingly well when asked to turn it around in an intense drama. Smith has earned respect through hard work and consistency. It is fitting then that the Fresh Prince has elevated to the throne of the reigning King of Hollywood.Seven Pounds is a movie that finds Ben (Smith) in the midst of plotting a course for the future. The details of which are slowly revealed. But it would be a mistake to think of these happenings as the focal point. That is reserved for Ben and his drive for what we all desire - to have meaning associated with his existence. And it's the journey to this end that brings the movie its strength. This is not a comedy and the buffoonery and cuteness Smith can muster up is nowhere to be seen. It was a wise choice to play this one straight and thus provide an unadulterated view a great actor plying his trade.Rosario Dawson (Emily) is a great actor in her own right. I remember seeing her in a movie some years ago that she electrified with her presence, but the role was limited. Here, we get the opportunity to see Rosario delve deeply into a character that is entirely as intricate as that of Ben. Her treatment of the multi-dimensional Emily plays well against Smith's complicated task of pulling just the right strings in his emotional turn as Ben.Woody Harrelson plays against character in a supporting role as well. His diminished minutes here have no correlation to the caliber of his performance. His subtle expressions as Ezra are a visible reminder of Harrelson's mastery of the mask. Another seasoned veteran, Barry Pepper, is cast as Ben's childhood buddy turned attorney. I have been formulating a theory for some time that Hollywood indirectly chooses replacements to fill the gaps left when a particular actor disappoints, grows old or simply cannot turn on the magic any longer. Barry Pepper was the chosen one who stepped in and filled the shoes of one Gary Busey. He was a potent addition to any cast before the years of abuse, accidents and age left him ravaged. Pepper is a measured, perhaps tempered hint of the Busey hi-life days. Whereas Busey did not have the controlled humility to play an updated version of 'Sergeant York', Pepper would be the odds on favorite.So, I enjoyed the film. I watched it on a 40", Samsung 1080P/40,000:1, 630 series LCD. It is much preferred to the experience of a tiny-sectioned movie 'viewing room' they call theaters these days. Had I the opportunity to see it, say, in a 'Music Box' type, true majestic theater (in Chicago), I would have jumped on it. But those days are gone, and the reasons for operating such magnificent establishments have evaporated with them. Lucky for us then, that art like 'Seven Pounds' is still being cranked out somewhere in the hearts and minds of a city that is so often accused of having neither.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is impossible to describe this movie without giving away some of the plot details.Within the first 15 minutes, you will be asking yourself three questions: Who is this man, what is he doing, and why is he doing it?The acting is phenomenal (although I'm not a big Smith fan), especially the actress who plays the part of the Hispanic mother.This is a very smart movie--makes you think as you're given pieces of the who and why but can't quite put it all together. By the end, it all makes sense.I would have given it 10 stars, except it gets a little slow about 2/3 of the way through.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds. It was the most intriguing and frightening of stories. There was definitely no Cinderella ending. However, that is not to say that it ended without some beautiful and moving inspirations. In fact, I suppose there could be no nobler reason to commit suicide then to give life to another. It made me stop and think about what it means to sacrifice for someone you love or just some deserving human being. Will Smith is a brilliant performer and played admirably in Seven Pounds - it may even have been his best so far. Dawson proved herself and I do believe that she will go far. She was very convincing as the brave dying woman that penetrated a dying mans heart. Seven Pounds can be disturbing and is not for everyone. Children and even teens should not watch this film. This is not an 'enjoy' movie but it is a beautiful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven pounds is a fantastic movie. It touches your heart gravely and makes you think of how life can just change in a jiffy.I saw pursuit of happiness ft. Will Smith of course, and was very impressed by the movie and the Italian director Gabriele Muccino. I was looking forward to Seven Pounds but wasn't expecting another gem from him. While watching the movie I kind of had the feeling that I was right about the movie, it doesn't have to offer you much the first 60 minutes, it rather leaves you confused and curious to find out what the main protagonist is up to. Then the last 20 minutes of the movie arrive and blows you away completely. Everything becomes clear, Ben's purpose, Ben's problem, explanation for his weird behaviour, even the movie title makes sense. I have always believed Will Smith is one incredible actor, people just don't know how to use his fantastic talent, except for this Italian sir who has done it twice. I hope Gabrieles third Hollywood movie is also with Will. They make a wonderful combo. The performances of everyone in this movie leaves you speechless.If you have a heart and enough patience to finish watching a slow movie. Then you will love Seven Pounds. Will Smith delivers an Oscar worthy performance, as well as Rosario Dawson. This movie has definitely entered my top 10 ever!100 thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little slow but packs an emotional punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that the film began a bit confusingly and seemed a little disjointed to begin with. The very beginning of the film didn't seem to be heading in any particular direction and I was left questioning what was going on. But around the 30 minute mark I reached the realisation of what Ben was actually doing and from then on it all made sense. What followed was an emotional and moving story that stayed with me long after the credits. Will Smith gives one of his best performances to date as the lead character Ben. He is a very interesting character who is carrying an enormous emotional burden. The rest of the cast also give strong performances and the romance between Will Smith and Rosario Dawson is very believable. The film could probably have done with being 20 minutes or so shorter as the pacing is fairly slow, but even so the film is never dull. The ending is both beautiful and shocking and does a good job of tying together all of the loose strands from the rest of the film. I would definitely recommend watching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not know what this was movie was about before I viewed it. With Will Smith, I expected some type of action film or maybe a cheesy romance/comedy. An hour into the movie, I could have stopped watching and felt entertained "enough". But, entertainment is not the right word. Could you describe Mozart's "Requiem" as entertainment? This movie was just such a mix of overwhelming emotions.How far does someone have to go to make up for the accidents they made in life? You have to watch this film. It should be rated much much higher. It would be a shame if people can't see past the suicide. If you couldn't handle "Million Dollar Baby", then this film is not for you. But, if you are tired of rehashes of the same old story line, or you are tired of cookie cutter Hollywood films, then you have to give this film a view.This movie is about a good person who made a simple mistake that drastically changed his life, and how he chooses to deal with that mistake and the losses that it incurred. It's a tragedy. It's one of the best movies I have see in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Got this out Friday night for our weekly DVD night. I'd heard mixed reviews and was unsure if Tara would like, but knew she'd like it more than "the Wrestler", so gave it a go. Here,s my review."Seven Pounds" is a the story of Ben Thomas (Will Smith, in his best work since "Hitch"), an IRS agent who seems to be on a mission he help radically alter the lives of a bunch of strangers. Gradually his story unravels that brought him to this point- in a nutshell he killed seven people in a car accident and seems to be trying to make up for it. His wife also died in the accident which really set him off.Ben stays reasonably detached from the people, until he meets Emily (Roasario Dawson, in her best work since "Josie and the Pussycats"), a lovely lady who needs a heat transplant bad. Ben starts getting very close to her, so close in fact he expresses his love physically with her. Ben must decide if he'll let her know his secret and if he'll go through with his plan. Will Ben go through with his plan or will he give it all up for Emily, who may die anyway if no donor comes forward? See it to find out.***************SPOILER ALERT******************** I'd heard mixed reports and some about the unusual ending, although I gotta say it played out pretty much as expected. Something different, but nothing to write home about. Another semi arty-farty movie by Will Smith that doesn't cut the mustard.</fullReview>

Still the movie felt a bit like a rehabilitation, when I watched it. Will Smiths performance is really great and if you haven't read about what this movie is about, you will get to see a great drama unbiased.This movie for me is a great example, why it makes sense not to read anything (or as little as possible). Other friends of mine, didn't enjoy the movie as much as I did, because they just knew what was going to happen. And it is very critical here, because most reviews more or less give away almost the end of the movie. Which is bad, because the element of surprise that builds up, if you don't know exactly what's happening or about to happen or even happened, well is vanished/non-existent. So if you like a slow build up drama, with a few surprises, watch this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith Proves He Can Act In A Serious Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This drama has twists and turns throughout the movie that are distinctly unique for a Will Smith feature. This is without a doubt the best script that Smith has gotten and the best produced film he has done. Will Smith got an award here for Best Actor in 2009 and he deserves it all the way.Smiths acting with Rosario Dawson in this movie is excellent too. She does a fine job in a role that challenges her talents. I hope she get some more roles as a result of this picture because she definitely has talent. This is not the typical simple drama coming out of Hollywood, this is more of a thinking viewers movie. It provides clues through flashbacks through out the film and doesn't get the viewer totally lost as some other recent films using the technique have. As the clues come together you get the feeling that there is something special about what Smith is doing from the beginning of the film. The pieces fall into place slowly and at a little over 2 hours the film is at the right pace to make the viewer ponder what is happening and why.The tragedy of Smith's main character is shown in Smith's strong performance. It is a well constructed film which actually looks better a second time around. Smith is called on to carry this film besides co-producing it and he accomplishes both. He is not really an IRS agent. This film has a difficult message for many to swallow.Intelligent theme of this film- you choose how you plan &amp; live your life, and your death.This is more of a film for the person who likes serious drama, but if you like Will Smith, you will find him in top form in this film too. Just be prepared with the hankies because there are tragic events here and that is what serious drama is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main problem I had viewing this film was the initial slow pace. i was eager to watch it but thoroughly disappointed that nothing was happening. I understood the premise but had little identification with the lead character or felt little toward him.Will Smith appears to be the same, dull drama acting action hero who acts all on one level and although the lead girl performance was strong, the story lines were flawed, un-convincing and a little tedious. whenever I see films like this and crash i am surprised by the high praise they receive. the plot lines are essentially good but they appear (to me anyway) pretentious and a one sided view of the world and how we should view it.The seven individual people needing his 'help' were not all focused on in enough detail, dis-allowing any identification with them and Will smith's character Ben (spoiler) (Tim) made me feel no sadness in his plight. in fact it felt overall that he was only doing his deeds for his own guilty mind and all his motives were for selfish and own gain.I thought overall the film looked good, cinematography, directing etc and the sequence of events occurring in an unusual order were thought provoking however, it took so long to get to a valid point that i nearly fell asleep.I wanted this to be so much more dramatic and touching but it felt like it was un-realistic and very un-dramatic. every time i see Will smith now I just get the image of him patrolling the streets in I am legend and forget what film he is in (Same to me) Average and wish (For it's strong idea) that it could have made an impact, unfortunately it didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith has been dazzling us with his various roles. He as played comic characters, action heroes &amp; now in a tender love story. In every role he has created a memorable character.Ben (his name in film) may look happy &amp; sound happy, He is not really happy,he wants others to be. He was involved in a tragic accident some years ago, he may have been at fault. He is going to make amends for this. I will not say how,you will find out when you see this fine movie.As usual Will Smith proves he can do a dramatic role with the same gusto as he tackles comedy or action hero roles.His Co-star Rosario Dawson has always given top draw performances.here she she gives another superb one.Both gave performances that should have at least been nominated for a Golden Globe or Oscar awards, they both are that great.Equally impressive is Woody Harrelson as a blind pianist.Micheal Ealy and Barry Pepper as Ben's brother &amp; friend.The ensemble acting should have been considered for awards as well.This movie was written by Grant Nieportw, this is his first screenplay &amp; directed by Gabrelle Murrino, he helmed Will in 'The Pursuit of Happiness', &amp; we all remember what a fine sensitive comic drama that was. Seven Pounds is a wee bit more dramatic, but just as sensitive,The sex scene between Will &amp; Rosario is what all such scenes be like, they are sexy but not raunchy.The film is 123 minutes long,but it does not drag.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 10) IMDb 9 (out of 10)NOTE: this type of film rarely if ever gets a 4 star rating.</fullReview>

The movie itself is quite predictable and you'll figure out whats going to happen before it does but nevertheless the movie leaves you anticipating how exactly it will happen....However, the movie's central issue is suicide and even if it gives the message of redemption, that message is wrong...It will make committing suicide justifiable to many which in itself is greatly flawed... Just because to an extent, the greater good is served does not approve the notion of suicide which is what the movie portrays...

		<shortDescription>Good movie, Touching but looks a bit made up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had many emotional moments but near the end they all seemed too made up. Will smith is not disappointing. But the character he portrays is a bit limited shall we say. The girl Does pretty good. If you think about everything yes it could happen like that.But would it. (disregarding the jellyfish affecting heart etc I'm talking about rationalizing human actions of the roles here). In short the movie was good, entertaining and emotional but seemed a bit made up(not very unrealistic but you could see that this scene was made to make you cry that one was there to show how nice a guy will smith was etc) Will Smith should try a bit less obviously to get an Oscar. :-)spoilers belowAs per my knowledge it is wrong (utterly) for the receiver of the heart to know of the donor. It is even wrong for Will smith to determine the fate of the girl. What if she didn't like the blind guy for some funny reason.I really enjoyed the movie and the emotion but what was left at the end was A bit like Carson Clay's movie in Mr Beans Holiday. It looked too much like it was targeting an Oscar (Like an overambitious kid putting his hand up at every opportunity to answer a question). Will Smith should seriously consider playing human roles again (as opposed to his god roles here and in I'm legend etc ) He has too much talent to be wasted in situations like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Will Smith proves his A-list status with a captivating performance. It is hard to write too much without spoiling the movie. Great story, great cast, fantastic direction. It is rare that an original movie with such a high quality comes out of Hollywood. Too bad it did not get the praise it deserved.The only negative parts areIt is somewhat predictable.I wanted to see more of the supporting cast at times, in particular Woody H.More flashbacks would have been niceStill, I give it a 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know that feeling you get in your throat when your so mad or your feelings get hurt??? Well this is one of those movies that will do it to you! For a while I thought Tim had mental issues with all the facial expressions he would do but I guess it was due from the characters inner pain and holding it all in. Will did an excellent job with this character. A++One thing I didn't like/understand is the Jelly fish, Being a Reef Tank Hobbyist I know that you simply cant transfer marine life to a new location then fill the tank up with tap water from a water hose and expect any animals to survive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith... Enough Said...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I do not think that anyone has just reason to ever say that Will Smith is not one of the most talented actors of all time. He has proved in my book, to be better than legendary African-American actor Denzel Washington. His versatility has no bounds, I love that he can be in a hilarious action/comedy then go straight to an extremely serious drama that puts things in a whole new light. Seven Pounds was by far one of the best movies I have seen lately. I always take more away from a movie when I am challenged to keep my attention to know what is going on. This movie does that and more! Will Smith plays Tim Thomas, a man that had everything going for him until "7 seconds" changed everything. He decided to take on his brother's identity and find people that he felt needed help in one way or another. I'm not going to give away any major details but he helps 7 people in ways that no one would even think of. This movie is a great representation of just how far generosity can go... even if it is to the EXTREMES... All in all... I don't care WHO you are... WATCH... THIS... MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven names. Seven strangers. One secret. A story beginning with the phrase extracted from the Bible « God created the world in seven days », being told by the main character, Ben (Will Smith), could be a religious story, but if we see the movie we will discover the only way Ben found to "pay" for his mistakes and to square up with life. It all begins with one man's desire to help some people he didn't knew, but getting to know them, they proved to be willing to live, to raise their children in a family without argues and violence, to know for sure that the ocean is blue and not only by being told by the others. Ben manages to get to know Emily (Rosario Dawson), the women he falls in love with later, with the help of a identity card belonging to his brother (Michael Ealy), a IRS agent. He gives "the sight" to Ezra (Woody Harrelson), a blind sales agent, who knew the ocean's color only from what the others told him, the color blue, like his eyes. He manages to get in touch with a woman being beaten by her husband, through a old friend who kept her social work agent job with the help of the liver transplant given by Ben. The house in which he, with his wife and daughter, spent the most beautiful moments is given to the woman's children helping them to get read of the poverty in which they were living, but also from their father's violence behavior. The storyline progresses gradually, being presented five destinies which will change with the help of the hero. The main character reaches the point of giving away his life to those seven people for him to escape from the pangs of conscience which grounds him since he caused an accident because of his inattention. He gives away his life to seven people for seven lives that ended because of him.The supreme sacrifice seems to be the red wire that keeps him alive, but neither his brother who was the beneficiary of a lung transplant, neither the love story that evolves between him and Emily, the one who stole his heart, cannot convince him to change his mind about escaping from the suffering he was living in. It could be seen as a SF story because not many people could do what Ben did, but surely the moment in which Emily looks into Ezra's black eyes, that had a special heat known only by her, makes us forget about certain dissatisfactions appearing through out the movie, maybe because of the mixed up story line, and to think if we could do at least a small part of the things he did. « In seven days God created the world, in seven second I shattered mine ? » (Ben)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a piece of art actually. I never leave comments and have never wanted other people to watch a movie enough to encourage them to watch it but Seven Pounds is an exception.The movie is kind of long, simple, and somewhat predictable but you still will want to see it play out simply because you know what's going to happen is so remarkable. The movie does have a few twists that keep the movie interesting and keep you guessing, to a certain degree. Overall I would strongly recommend this movie and would definitely go out and rent it (that's if I hadn't already seen it). Also buy the DVD, its one of those movies you probably would like to watch more than once to catch all of the little details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant ... impressive ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just went out of the cinema, and I am so much touched by this movie! It it one of the best film I've ever seen in my life! Deep, remarkable, strong, there is so much in it! The main hero is amazing, sometimes he has eyes of Buddah, and sometimes he gives an impression to be totally insane.You see a man who has lost everything and does not have anything to loose anymore. And what is left for him - it's only to give. Which he does. It's amazing how strong is his personality and it's amazing how far you see a human being can go, beyond death and life... There is nothing about religion, but you also see how spiritual can be people without any word about God and that in the end it's not about one God, but it's about generosity of a human being.And about love... In the biggest and the broadest meaning of this word. About love to life. And about loving this world. And about feeling so strong that you actually CAN change things.The film is the best example of the idea that if you want to change the world, be the example of you dream.I am amazed, impressed, overwhelmed by its deepness.GREAT thanks to all the team who made this outstanding movie, especially to the director Gabriele Muccino, brilliant leading actors Will Smith and Rosario Dawson, whose play was a masterpiece, and to the screenplay writer Grant Nieporte. Bravo. And thank you from all my heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-meaning, but manipulative and aggravating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a terrific concept underlying this film. Unfortunately, a concept alone is not enough. Moreover, when mis-handled, the strongest concept becomes overbearing and infuriating... and that's exactly what happens here. Having guessed the outcome of the film within the first half-hour (not difficult), I found the remainder to be almost unbearably heavy-handed and tedious. Yes, I got the message, and yes, it's a great one... but I didn't enjoy being bludgeoned with it for a couple of hours. There's simply not enough meat on the bones to properly engage my sympathies. Drama is about character undergoing change... but no one here does that. Everything is as static and predestined as if it were running on rails. Knowing from the start that the central romance was little more than a red herring, I resented being asked to become emotionally involved.On the plus side, Will Smith is as brilliant as ever, and does a truly marvelous job presenting the pent-up emotions that drive his character. And the film certainly does look great. But given that the love story never really pays off (CAN'T pay off), and that there are no significant detours in the totally linear storyline, there's very little to grasp hold of. (Smith does actually doubt himself just once, near the end. If the creators hadn't been so busy trying to bamboozle me, they'd have realized that this episode *should* have been the meat of the film! Instead, it's wasted as a quick throwaway.)I really wanted to like this film, because its heart is clearly in the right place. But the way it played out, using flashbacks and other cheap tricks to conceal the lack of narrative movement, left me feeling I was being conned rather than brought along for the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was well intended. It was about a guy (will smith) trying to help others. The problem was it resulted from a self guilt that was formed after causing seven people to die in a car accident. The movie was very touching and emotional but it is a very misleading movie. It is not up to us to take our own lives even if in the process we are actually helping others. This movie may mislead people who are not emotionally strong. It may lead people with problems in lives to kill themselves. They might just sign up as an organ donor and kill themselves. In a nutshell it brings negative effects to people and it may bring down viewers self esteem. Teens especially with a lot of problems in their lives may opt for the path that was chosen by will smith in this movie. The acting and the message trying to be presented (helping people) was good but this kinda ways of life should not be followed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional jellyfish strike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS I went to a movie theatre to see this movie with no information about it whatsoever. I just knew two things - Will Smith and drama. And from the very first minutes I was caught in a mystery surrounding Smith's character and his intentions. I loved how his true reasons of sacrifice were revealed through quick sporadic flashbacks, without narrating or thrusting anything. I fell for the love story between two tragic individuals with each one of them desiring it to blossom and be possible, but at the same time knowing that it has no future. And how Will Smith brilliantly portrayed a depressed, restrained and suffering soul, striving for and so concentrated on his redemption, running towards it with no intention to stop. I loved the dog being a strain witch suffers form heart problems just like his master, the repair of a damaged printing machine, the determining that the blind guy was a kind soul and even banana peels!What about the beautiful climax? The part when he ran through the rain to the hospital to find out if there was any reasonable chance of his love interest surviving and getting a new heart without his help. Tim had that little hope of a possible future, of a new marriage, new family and kids that he revealed in bed earlier, but his hopes were shattered. He no longer could torment the woman with his love and was pushed to act. I probably don't have to mention the bath and jellyfish scene, it's so powerful! His pure childhood love and beauty taking the burden away from him... Will's suffering expressions kind of reminded me of the scene in "Pursuit of Happiness" where his character was trying to sleep in a bathroom with his son while some people banged on the door violently, another remarkable exposure of human emotions on film. In the end, the scene the film begins with and the way it ends connects and the full story is understood. There was only one thing witch I felt wasn't necessary - the very final scene between the blind guy and the heart-woman.After reading the negative critic response, I was shocked, this might be the very first time I don't contend with them so greatly. To sum up, I think, after losing "seven pounds", Will Smith redeemed himself as one of the best modern actors and erased the stain of a stupid misunderstanding called "Hancock".9,55/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are the critics heartless?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not listen to the critics. This is an excellent movie, rich with terrific performances, a brilliant screenplay and beautiful, striking imagery within. One of the most important movies today, I might add.Will Smith plays an IRS agent who decides to change the lives of seven random people. I think that this is one of Smith's most important and heart-wrenching performances of the year. Why he did not get nominated for another Oscar, let alone a Golden Globe, is a mystery.The other supporting actors adds greatness to the movie. Rosario Dawson as a heart-transplant patient. Woody Harrelson as a blind man. Barry Pepper as a lawyer. And (surprise!) Predator's Eplida Carrilo as a single mother. All of these actors are perfectly cast in their roles, not one actor hamming it up.The direction by Gabriele Muccino is crisp, slow-paced, and absorbing, allowing us to examine more detail in a perfect pace. There are some scenes inter-cut with absolutely beautiful cinematography, which gives the show more credibility and adds mysticism to the overall film.I think the critics were seeing a different film. Sure, the film has its flaws, but 28% on RottenTomatoes.com? That's just wrong. I urge you all to ignore the critics and see one of the truly inspiring films of 2008.Overall: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds is a very interesting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On many aspects,Seven Pounds reminded me to the movies directed by Alejandro González I?árritu.But that is not saying too much because I do not like the depressing films I?árritu directs too much ,because I find them too simple and hollow when they pretend to be deep and complex.As all the movies by that Mexican director,Seven Pounds tells its story on a non-linear style,which immediately creates suspense for slowly revealing its chain of causes and consequences; and it also rounds on a tragic event which affects various lives.But what makes Seven Pounds way superior to any of the I?árritu's movies is that the story,when it is finally decoded,is much richer and it generates a bigger emotional impact than I?árritu's forced films.Seven Pounds is a very interesting film which offers many positive elements.The best element from this film is that the slow deployment of information,emotions and relationships automatically holds the attention on the spectator and it made me wonder what was going to happen next.The performances from Seven Pounds are not bad,although they all have the aura of "I am acting" which affects so many dramas of similar style.I mean,the actors do not make a bad work on constructing their characters,but they do not feel natural or spontaneous.Maybe,the reason of that is that the drama is so intense and tortuous that very few actors could represent this kind of characters without having suffered similar situations.They say acting is 90% imagination but it is easy to speculate that talented actors (like the ones from this movie) could have difficulties in representing scenes which are completely outside of their human experience.In order,some people could plead that the performances were not completely solid...by my point of view,the actors did their best effort in adapting to the extreme material,and I appreciate their professionalism,although the final result was not 100% credible.As a good point of comparison to evaluate Seven Pounds,I can mention the film The Pursuit of Happiness,the previous collaboration between director Gabriele Muccino and actor Will Smith.Both movies deal with painful personal issues and they manipulate the emotions from the spectator a little bit,but both have a touch of honesty which made me excuse that easy trick and,as a final result,I could enjoy them pretty much.The fails I found on this movie are two.For one sight,some moments do not properly "connect" with the spectator while some attitude changes on the supporting characters are a bit sudden.However,those fails are compensated until a certain point,because a few seconds later,we will discover another surprise,another mystery or another character which makes richer the main enigma from this movie.Seven Pounds is not a great movie,but I cannot deny it kept me very entertained and interested,not to mention it provoked an emotional impact on me.I can recommend this movie with confidence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, actually I paid 14 AUD which at the time of the economic crisis, was around 7 British Pounds, but's that irrelevant, I just wanted to try and catch peoples attention with the catch line.Anyhow, it still goes without saying that this movie is well worth seeing.I didn't know what it was about, or even had a clue of what was going to happen. If anything I thought it might be a disappointment or overrated.However, my doubts were settled at least two minutes into it, as the powerful opening 'phone conversation' scene between Will Smith and Woody Harreslon had me gripped.I enjoyed the acting, especially from Smith, who is a favourite of mine, I enjoyed the mystery of the plot, the emotion and the interaction between the characters.This certainly is a modern day Shakespearian tragedy. I very rarely cry watching movies, especially at the movies with my wife. However, the few (manly) tears fell during the movies heart wrenching, climatic finish.I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone by accidentally leaking out anymore key scenes or actions, so I'll stop there.I'd like to end on this note by thanking whoever has read this and hopefully you will be encouraged to watch this movie.Regards Andrew</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could this get overlooked?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film received not one Oscar nomination. None. That is absolutely ridiculous. Not only was Will Smith terrific in the movie, but the film had a unique and rare ability to elicit an authentic emotional response and thoroughly involve the viewer. Perhaps more importantly, the film derives its intensity not so much from plot elements (although they are quite engaging) as from performances that are refreshingly human. WIll Smith and Rosario Dawson are wonderful, and Barry Pepper gives a more powerful performance than I've ever seen in a role that provides a character with such little screen time. In a prolific industry and art form in which one of the most critical aims is to emotionally involve the viewer, it is amazing how many movies fail to do so. Thanks to characters with depth and fine actors to bring them to life, Seven Pounds succeeds in this regard in a way that only great films do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very slow paced with a stunning conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds certainly isn't a movie for everyone's taste. If you're not a fan of character development and a confusing storyline, you should definitely not even think of touching this movie. However, if you're a very patient observer, a fan of twisting conclusions at the end or just a Will Smith fanatic, it will be worthwhile.At first, you feel like it's kicking off hardcore and you'll now be taken on a quick ride full of conclusions, but you'll quickly learn that after the initial shock, the movie slows down immensely and take its time introducing the characters. In fact, you might get the feeling that after the first 10 minutes and 15 minutes before the end of the movie, next to nothing is happening. Brief flashbacks are the main reason keeping you on the hook and make you look more and more forward to the end of the movie, hoping for a stunning conclusion.And then exactly that happens. And wouldn't it have been done so brilliantly, you would feel like you wasted quite some time of your life. Will Smith does a good job as always, showing once more that he can in fact play a different character than himself. The supporting cast also does an excellent job where it's allowed to, but it's Smith who carries this movie almost on his own.It should be mentioned that if you're able to figure out the catch before it is actually shown, you might get bored sitting there and waiting for the movie to reveal itself. This and the general very, very slow pace are my reasons for giving it 7 out of 10. The average movie-goer will just not be patient enough to sit there for an hour when next to nothing's happening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why was this film ever made? I love films so much and love emotionally driven movies such as the Pursuit of Happiness. You can see that Seven Pounds was trying to be this kind of film but in all honesty, and I don't like to say this about movies, this film was awful. The story was ridiculously over the top and I simply could not connect with Will Smith's character, despite the fact he was meant to be clouded with mystery. Hancock was poor but this was worse. Ideas of self sacrifice and redemption are often recipes for fantastic and moving films, but this approach took it into the pile of films which pass out of memory. Poor story, awkward pacing and characters which simply are not interesting enough. I do not recommend this movie, which is a shame because Will Smith is a brilliant movie star and has proved to be a gifted actor over the years.</fullReview>

The movie is a bit slow but that makes the movie even more special. Ben Thomas or Tim Thomas which was his real name is a character that will surely inspire a lot who see this movie. And it also sends out a message to the world that there are a lot of people in this world to whose life you can bring a change by donating your body parts after your death. A movie and a story that i will not forget for a long time. My rating 9/10. You can also watch "Persuit of Happiness" if u liked this title. Its another superb title from the same director. I hope he keeps making such movies because these are the movies that can bring about a change in people's lives and in their way of thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds -- Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this film doesn't get nominated for an Oscar/Academy Award, then the jury is bad.Let me start by saying I didn't care much to see this movie. Although the trailer left much to the imagination it looked quite boring. But Will Smith is determined to swing both ways, in terms of artistic exploration. If, on the one hand he wants to give his viewers an adrenalin high with films like Men in Black, I Legend and Hancock, he also wants them to remember him as a high performer with soul-stirring acts like The Pursuit of Happiness and now, Seven PoundsBen Thomas (Will Smith) is the most unusual tax man in town. Unlike the sharks in the IRS, this sad man with soulful eyes goes looking for deserving people who should be given a tax break. Some tax man! Living all by himself in a fleabag motel, with a jelly fish for company, he hunts all day for suitable men and women who deserve a favour. And finds them in the usual places: in hospitals, bars and broken homes, where the almost dead and the hopeless wait for sordid ends. Forlorn Ben not only befriends them, he even finds a solution to their problems and ends up like the friendly neighbourhood Spiderman, albeit without the web and the flying fetish. The acting is simply breathtaking. Will Smith brings on a performance that shatters every preconceived notion you had about him. He is so very earnest, on the ball and completely involved in his characterization as Ben that you believe in him totally. Roisario Dawson as Emily Posa, the woman with the defective heart perfects the vulnerable act, Woody Harrelson is also quietly effective as the blind man. 'Seven Pounds ' really wouldn't have been so poignantly appealing without their brilliant contributions!The majority of the movie is mysterious, slightly confusing and will have you guessing a lot. It's almost hard to believe so many loose ends could be tied up as it nears its ending, but it does, and it does so beautifully. Everything culminates in this magnificent ending that will make you want to tell everyone you meet to go see this movie now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Will Smith keep getting better with each movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say only this: I am a 6 foot 300 pound 37 year old man with 3 kids 8 pets a mortgage and a very hard job that requires almost daily injury to do it. I have tattoo's a pierced nipple and have had multiple bone breaks and more than a few stitches without a numbing agent. Never once have I shed a tear over these things... but during this movie I wept, not teared up, not sniffled, but wept openly and sobbed more than a little. Almost to the point of embarrassing my Wife of 11 years, on Valentine's day which is also our anniversary. So rarely in my life has something like this touched me so profoundly and passionately, so many things were at work with me here... the story subject, the guilt and anxiety it brought, the brilliant film making that required one to stay on their toes to keep in with it, the writing which delivered more than a handful of memorable lines. One thing, however, stood out, Will Smith's brilliant acting. His facial expressions gave you the visible, palpable tenseness of the mind behind his soulful eyes, every close up made you fell Smith had really found his place in this role, that he really lived the character. Can Will continue to be truly this good for the rest of his career, if so, he will be remembered as one of our most predominate actors in decades, on the caliber of James Stweart, Marlon Brandoe, and so many of our most entertaining leading men.I would like to thank the cast, director, producer and writers for helping me to find that part of myself this movie finds so easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a Will Smith fan, although even I have to admit that he has made some bad decisions. Like turning down the lead in The Matrix for Wild Wild West. But Smith is no longer looking for the easy money he was ten years ago, and that means he is picking better and better films.From the director of The Pursuit of Happiness, Seven Pounds is just as emotional and arguably shows Smiths best performance to date. Smiths character is shown as neither the hero nor the villain, as the audience follows his actions, and makes up their own mind on his choices.Even if you are rarely affected emotionally by a film, you may want to get some tissues ready for this one, as there are emotionally intense scenes from the very start.Smith is the best part of this movie. He is so convincing, you can almost start to believe this is a documentary, and he is not an actor.The trailers for this film have given little away, and I have to say that this was a very good decision by the distributors. The mystery and slow revelations are what make this film so intense and so emotional.If you are going to see one film this year. Make it Seven Pounds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not just a movie! It has real life in it and true feelings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My thought prior to seeing this movie was to see whatever is related to IRS before taxes time. I never expected what was coming...Everything is so well connected, it's not the type of rushed movie that you see in the last decade where each second needs to have action in order to feel efficient. This movie takes its time to develop the feelings of the characters and projects them to the viewers in the theater. I felt part of the scene and blended my feelings with those of the actors. UNBELIEVABLE script, acting, music, backgrounds, all to the details that one thinks might not matter.If you want to learn something and feel how lucky you are, this movie is perfect for a true intrinsic analysis of your life. Your money will be worthing every penny. Love exposed here is above all and truthfully, it's a good healing tool of appreciation for couples who need a closer look at their own relationship.This is top movie for the last years in my opinion and I commend the main characters, the staff beyond the scenes and all those who tied this together to do such an amazing job. Still, I rate this movie after "La vita e bella" and "Pay it forward". Amazing job, Will Smith! My hat is off to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this movie worth (rushing) to see? Firstly the solid and credible performances of ALL the leads. The mature delivery makes for engrossing viewing. Well done Mr Smith, you were due another great performance at some point, and you did not disappoint.Secondly the well paced and creative screenplay. It just carries one leaving us helpless in it's wake. The depth of vision of the director is astounding.Finally it's just the way this film makes you think of whatever is deepest and most important in your life. It's like having 120 minutes of open-soul surgery.We live in a democracy, well I do anyway, but I cannot believe, nay understand, why anyone would give this movie low marks.This is a classic and time will prove it to be so.Go watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie left me absolutely speechless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts from a very confused, point of view. The scenes you'll see, gives absolutely no meaning at all. A example of a scene which gives you nothing to go with, is performed by character "Ben Thomas" (Will Smith). He is walking around in his house looking very upset, mentioning a random list of names too the audience. But as you keep on watching this movie you will collect every confusing fragments, from the introduction scenes. I know that almost every movie in this genre does it that way. But the big difference between those and this motion picture, is the excellence of a well, performed, directed and scripted movie in a absolute magnificently manner. Watch this movie and tell your friends and family that they have to see this. So that they can be reminded in every exceptional way, what people got each other for. Which is that you have to take care of the the person next to you. Anyway you don't know them at all. Its something people forgets these days. Homeless people, poor people, old people, diseased people. These people needs help because they are bedridden. Everyone knows this! But only a small part does anything about it. I give my deepest respect for this kind of people. Bless you all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review for any film. This film really touched my heart to the deepest. One of the best films I've seen in my life. Fantastic performance from everyone. This shows the value of life and love at the best. No one is realized about the value of our life until we are about to lose it. We are worried about us only. If we take a look at others who are struggling to live, may be we change our attitude about the world. Hats off to the director and writer for presenting such a nice matter in a brilliant way. Will smith is the best and only option for the lead role. Heroine is also brilliant. If someone is commenting against this movie then this movie is meant for them only. Those who don't give a s**t for others life only will comment against this. Its a must watch and must collection. Go for it. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>man there's only one word to describe this film. Intense. i mean, every single part of the film is so intense. the fact that its around two hours really stretches that intensity out which makes for a excruciating film which sort of overwhelms you. so why am i giving it a 9? well to be honest, if a film has that kind of effect on me, i gotta say, i can't help but be impressed. and i loved every moment of it. will smith has given the best performance of his life and is backed by equally good acting from the rest of the cast. the script is good, but its the story which i think was amazing. obviously good direction made that story come to life and kudos to him too.in conclusion, this is a film you've gotta see. its slow paced, very emotional and you could probably figure out whats going to happen early on. however, this doesn't make this any less of a quality film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never write reviews, but i had to for this, it's rubbish! yet everyones saying it's amazing! Thankfully i didn't have to pay money to see this movie, i won tickets to a screener so me and a few friends went to see this movie. For all the ads on TV and posters everywhere i was expecting this movie to be good as would anyone right? There were a few reviews on the net saying it was good so i expected big things. Will Smith's acting along with almost all other actors in this movie did a great job. But great acting does not save a boring movie. The ad's showed all the good bits in this movie (Yes there are good parts but not nearly enough!)At the beginning i was interested, after gathering the basic plot from the ad's. The First 10- 20 minutes were alright not very interesting but not that bad, then the next hour was complete crap! so boring! i actually wished i had brung my phone or something just to do something! then the last 30 minutes of the movie were great action filled and very interesting, but it just felt like it was far to dragged out, they should of put the first half of the ending at the beginning so it'd make more sense and keep you interested to find out how it ends, but they didn't which was frustrating. The last 5 minutes were satisfying and left a decent impression but the hour and a half in between was so incredibly uninteresting it wasn't worth for a decent ending.5 out of 10. I've liked all of Will Smith's movies, but not this one. (Note i haven't seen the pursuit of happiness, not sure if i want to either considering it's the same director) Disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith has never disappointed me in any movie that he has done - but he has outdone himself in this movie. I didn't think that his acting could get any better, but he made me feel the crushing sadness that overwhelmed him in this movie. I have not cried that much in a movie *ever*.... I kept having people ask me (that had not seen the movie) why the movie was called "seven pounds" and I won't tell them. Just tell them to go see the movie. I was astonished that the movie did not make more the opening weekend but I think that it was because no one wanted to take a chance on a movie that they knew so little about. I love movies that are surrounded in mystery. That's part of the theater experience - going to the theater to be amazed. To fall in love with the characters or to hate the characters, whichever you are meant to do. Rosario Dawson deserves praise as well -- I felt her pain and her love for Smith's character. Kudos to you both and this movie deserves MANY MANY awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been a lot of negative critiques concerning this title, and I really don't understand why. First, this movie is is NOT in the genre of mystery! I did work out the premise of the plot line within the first 20 minutes, but it is important to remember that a lot of the storyline was given away in the trailer, indicating that the director was more concerned with the emotional depth of the picture and not with surprising the audience with dramatic and unexpected plot twists.The emotional side of this title will appeal to anyone who has an ounce of sensitivity. Will Smith's acting is not perfect, but he is a very dynamic actor - he does seem a little wooden in this movie but it reflects the reserved and distraught persona of his character! The director and the cast really make you feel the main character's plight and they draw you in with accessible dialogue. I totally agree with a lot of comments, if you do not feel genuinely touched and thoughtful after seeing this movie, then you should not be watching films in this genre.Some may complain about the disjointed nature of the storytelling, but that really enhances the distraught nature of Ben Thomas. He has suffered a lot and is at extreme odds with himself, his choices and actions are an accumulation rather than a linear process. Instead of nitpicking and arguing about plot-holes, people should be paying attention to the subtle ways the story builds up to the dramatic and emotional twist. You need to observe the power behind the story rather and being concerned with things the writers and director may have missed.I really think that people should not miss out on this movie simply because they have read a bad review of seen a negative rating. This is a moving title that appeals to lots of people in different ways, it will reach out to you if you give it the chance. Just go and see it and decide for yourself whether or not you like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Starts out well but becomes predictable quickly. Parts of the plot are drawn out much longer than they should be, while other parts weren't developed nearly enough. Its hard to care for any of the characters in this film, there is a lack of character development in crucial parts of their emotional spectrum. At the end you are left with mixed emotions for the characters, and not the emotions that the film seemed to be trying to get you to feel. I didn't go into the film with much of an expectation and its a good thing, because the film didn't really provide much, except some pretty people talking at each other.Maybe good for a rental, don't bother seeing it in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unarguably The Best Movie Of 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is by far one of the best movies I have seen. Besides The Dark Knight, it was the best movie of 2008. This movie has it all: it's got drama, it's got humor, it's got romance, it's got great music to suit the scenes, it's got great actors, and it is simply touching, bottom line. This movie is just so beautiful in every way, with the good deeds that are done throughout the movie.Will Smith is a truly outstanding actor who can take any role and make it sensational. You may question certain parts of the movie at first, but they come together. Besides Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, who plays the love-interest, is just darling. She makes me so happy in this movie, not only because she was in Rent, but because she plays a tender character who is so loving, so caring, so unique. This romantic duo is for sure a hit.I recommend seeing this movie knowing as little about it as possible, that way there is surprise and it is not spoiled for you. The cinematography is excellent, the editing, the production, there was nothing wrong with this movie on the technical side. Go out and see this movie, whether in the theaters or wait for it to be on DVD, but it is one to be seen for its beauty and awe-inspiring motives.10 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an excellent movie. Will Smith has a habit of choosing good movies and living up to the role he is playing. All the actors did a wonderful job in this movie! I marked one point off just because of the chaos in the first part of the movie as there really wasn't any direction at the beginning.Basically, the movie presents you with pieces like a puzzle for the core plot and then by the time the 2nd half roles around it starts putting them together, so the plot comes in full view.The other reason why I also gave it one star less and maybe this is not valid. Is the subject matter.While I understand that sharing the core ending or premise of this film would ruin the person's experience of the film.I also know that I had a recent experience in my life with my brother this past year. And I would have liked to have been prepared for the overall synopsis they wrote before seeing the movie.Because I don't want to give it away, I will say that be prepared for an emotional ride with this film. My hubby said it is the saddest film he ever saw. I say it is the 2nd saddest film I ever saw.I was bawling my eyes out...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie begins well enough with the lead actor performing unusual tasks to make you wonder what's going on. But then it evolves into a dark and deep and yes, boring movie that made me lose interest. Instead of continuing to watch the movie, the TV became background noise while I focused on other things around the house. On the plus side...I was able to get things done at home, rather than forcing myself to waste time (or fall asleep) watching the rest of this movie. Even the music in the movie was pitifully dull.The fact that people think this is Academy Award-worthy (though all award shows are more about politics and popularity than actual talent these days), is more entertaining than the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven pounds is reminiscent of "The Five people you meet in heaven" starring Jon Voight. The "Five..." film faces life after death. Seven Pounds faces understanding of death during life. The end of S P's does not surprise me. Others who have seen this film say they are surprised by the ending. I am not. The writer has a full understanding of life from the perspective of a dying person.When good people die or when they know they are going to die, they change their life vocations or enhance them by changing time to help others. Seven Pounds is a film all should watch, whether or not they can relate to it, because eventually they will hopefully understand it and become a part of it.If we could all become so lucky.</fullReview>

Are the laws very much relaxed in US? Secondly,transplants are only done from brain dead patients whose heart are still pumping and keeping the organs fresh. This is surely not the case where because the ambulance will find Smith quite dead in the bath tub and the ice will do the organs no good.Thirdly, I doubt in a place like US, people can pinpoint cadaveric organ donation to a particular person, who may be jumping the public queue at that moment. Can anyone advise me on this? Apart from this , the film is a bit boring for those who already know the plot(probably 90%) and even for those who don't.

		<fullReview>I would have given it an 8 just for the script, but Will Smith does a fantastic role in this one. If it weren't a little slow, I would have gone for 10 out of 10.This aside, let's get to the kitchen and start cooking. Take 6 parts Leaving Las Vegas, mix in 4 parts Pay It Forward and sprinkle it with a bit of Seven, for seasoning. I am using the kitchen metaphor because I can't tell you much about the movie without spoiling it. Even if I got the idea of it somewhere in the middle, it is still a good feeling to have the realization for yourself. Therefore I highly recommend NOT reading any reviews and certainly no spoilers. Just watch it, it will be good.As for the audience, I would have to say this is a profoundly male theme, although women will probably feel a lot of things, too. I just don't think many women would understand the main character, that's all.Bottom line: take the time to watch it when you're at home, calm, ready for anything. It will give you a lot to think about. What if? Kudos to Will Smith.</fullReview>

I don't know if he reads this but great job Will. I enjoyed it very much and was very involved in it. Made me appreciate what I have and remember to be a good person and look out for others. Although it was sad, it was very well done. I really felt for him and was shaking my head at his decision, although I guess he felt he had to do that for his new found love. I don't think God wants us to punish ourselves for what really is an accident. He made a bad decision and it led to his girl's death, but that is a hard lesson to learn and must be dealt with differently. I know it must be hard to forgive yourself for something so terrible, but it can turn out for good... just my thoughts to encourage people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Will Smith made you emotional in "The Pursuit of Happiness", "Seven Pounds" reaches there by manipulating your emotions. At first, you would feel lost, but still connected with Ben Thomas (Will Smith) plays an IRS Agent. You would get some random images of life of Ben Thomas, his past and then back to his present, once you give up on what exactly story is all about, that is when it starts to unfold.Due to some guilt (of course wont advisable to tell you what it was) Agent Ben Thomas wants to help seven strangers with all he has got. Second line up of story will be the movie unfolds with every character and the how Ben past is making him realize how to make his stay on this planet more meaningful and the same time painful. But eventually, there is a tender love story between Ben and Emily (who is suffering from a congenital heart defect) that is really touchy.Like the intensity in the movie that is portrayed Will Smith, Rasario Dawson as well as Woody Harrelson and both Ben's brother Michael Ealy and best friend Dan played by Barry Pepper. It definitely left my eyes a little dampen!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoilt by the ending being given away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i heard that the producers and director of the fantastic film " The Pursuit of Happiness " were teaming up again to make another movie i was really excited. "The Pursuit of Happiness" remains one of my all time favourites so it's a bit of a disappointment that Seven pounds struggled to live up to my high expectations , yet it is still a pretty good movie .Seven Pounds is the tale of a man with a haunting secret who sets out to redeem himself by drastically changing the lives of seven total strangers. Once his plan is set in motion, nothing can alter it. Or so he thinks. But what Ben Thomas never expects is that he will fall in love with one of the strangers ? and that it is she who will start to change him.Seven Pounds asks provocative questions about life and death, regret and forgiveness, strangers and friendship, love and redemption ? and pursues the connections that tie human fates together in surprising ways.The biggest problem i have with Seven Pounds is what happens in the first five minutes. We see Ben make a phone call to the emergency services and he says to the woman on the line " I want to report a suicide" "Who's?" she asks "Mine" replies Ben. Although quite a dramatic and exciting scene it basically give away the film before it starts.I have no idea why director Gabriele Muccino decided he needed to treat the audience like a child and virtually give away the plot at the beginning but because he did , Seven pounds is just a good film when it had the potential to be great one.Will Smith is superb as usual ( although he looks a little gaunt) as is Rosario Dawson and Michael Ealy . Woody Harrelson also has a small part but you can help be distracted by the awful wig he wears, In fact wigs don't suit Woody Harrelson at all.This is quite a dark and emotional movie , some would say a little depressing at times but even though you can see the ending coming a mile away it still manages to have a good old tug at the heart strings.Despite Seven Pounds being no "The Pursuit of Happiness" its still an OK film but i wish directors would treat movie goers with a little more respect and stop showing the end of the movie at the beginning because it's annoying as hell.7 out of 10</fullReview>

If you think you can take a serious film and can risk a few tears then I highly recommend this. A lot of people have said that Will Smith is really growing as an actor and that is definitely true. It's one of his best films. Its not just him though, it's everyone in it and you care what is going to happen to each of the characters. The only thing I will say against it is that it's a bit slow and you have to wait for it to pick itself up but it comes through at the end and it all ties itself together.

		<shortDescription>Smith and Dawson make this movie work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What follows are all spoilers, but again it may be not that bad. But don't say you've not been warned. But anyone who happens to have stumbled across this report would probably have seen the movie anyway.The fact of the matter is, this movie cannot really have a spoiler because right at the beginning, you know that Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is going to kill himself. This is one of those often-used setups of starting at the end of the story, then go back to tell it. What remains to be seen is why, and what else is in the bargain. Other than occasional subliminally fast flashbacks, this is simple, linear storytelling.Nor are there a lot of subtle hints, wicked twists as well as confusion as some critics may have you believe. The rhyme and reason unfold quite nicely as we go along, and it doesn't take a genius to grasp what's going on. An observant or seasoned moviegoer may get there sooner but by the middle of the movie, most in the audience would have the essence: a successful man got into a careless accident that killed 7 people including his beloved, and sets out to repay his debts by an elaborated plan to kill himself, but not before making arrangements for some "worthy" people to be recipients of his donated organs. Despite huge logical gaps, there is a decent and diligent job is tying up all the clues, details and loose ends throughout the movie.With the best-laid plan that seems to be going well, Thomas fails to anticipate one unforeseeable development: falling in love with one of his potential organ recipients, one Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a woman who may die any time from a heart failure and yet for some reason cannot get into the top priority waiting list for a transplant. When she has another near-fatal heart attack, he finds out that because of her rare blood type, the chance of her getting a compatible heart is less than 5 per cent (his, of course, will fit as he had checked things out before approaching each of these potential beneficiaries). Here lies the ultimate dilemma (and dramatic climax): to proceed with his plan and let her receive his heart or to wait for the small chance to live together happily ever after with her.This is almost like two movies, the guilt-stricken man's scheme for the final absolution and the love story. If this movie works, it's because of the love story. Smith serves notice again that he is not just a movie star but a real actor. With this emotional powerhouse of a plot, he avoids all the pitfalls of overacting, coming through convincingly. But it's the scene between Smith and Dawson that really touches the heart (no pun intended). Compared with Smith's there is less to make of her role. Yet, she flawlessly brings out every nuance of this woman who, with one foot in the grave and has all but buried her heart, gradually gets her passion re-awakened by this loving, kind man. Smith and Dawson together make this movie work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cross between "John Q" and "Henry Poole is Here." The idea of a man willing to give his own heart to save someone he loves has been done before. Denzel Washington did in John Q. A man who's motives/way of life is unknown to the audience and to the other characters has been done before. Luke Wilson played a very similar role in Henry Poole is Here. The mystery surrounding the main character is very similar in both movies. Still, it is a very interesting and different approach to a movie. I don't want to be a downer here, because it is a very good story. Excellent acting, as well. But it lacks in originality. It is something that I thought should not be overlooked. This movie deserves a lot of credit. But so do the ones with the original ideas, that took part in making this movie what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gabriele Muccino strikes again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gabriele Muccino already astonished many of us with the pursuit of happiness, and here is another amazing movie to add to it.Let's get started with Will Smith, I have always considered him as a good actor, nothing more really. As many might say, Will tend to play the same genres of movies. But since The pursuit of Happiness and 7 pounds, you see another side of Will Smith. He plays both roles remarkably well.In fact I was not very interested in watching this movie at all, but seeing it was the same director than the pursuit of happiness I gave it a try, and believe me it was a good 118 minutes spent.Brilliant and touching story. This deserves a few Oscars. Gabriele Muccino is an amazing director, I can't wait to see his next movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took my daughter to see this movie, we were so moved by it that we couldn't speak when we left the cinema. It is a beautiful, moving, tragic story of a man and the circumstances he finds himself in. Will Smith is for me one of the best actors around, and this movie is a masterpiece. The characters are convincing, and you feel engaged with their lives and their troubles. Set in and around LA, with shots of the ocean rolling in on the Pacific Coast, the movie is beautifully crafted. Don't ask anyone what the movie is about, just go and watch it, let the movie unfold, immerse yourself in the lives of the characters and be confident that all will make sense by the end of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you think about the meaning of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has to be said - Hollywood has been producing recently more and more brainless movies bringing people time-killing entertainment. That is why classics which really touch your heart or make you stop and think about the present are more and more popular. However, every year there is an ambitious film which strikes everyone so hard and so unexpectedly that people cannot get up from their seats. I believe that first of them was "Crash" in 2005, then there came time for "Pursuit for happiness" where Will Smith had a main role. A year later we can see him once again on the big screen in an ambitious and extremely well directed film.There is no point writing that Smith is a remarkable actor - he has already proved it. Still, the character he created is full of mystery, shady past and hasty temper. Although it is possible to foresee the history of the main character and reasons for his actions, the viewer wants to make sure that he guessed right. and it is worth it.Great actors surrounding Smith entered their characters perfectly - I especially enjoyed the first scene with Woody Harrelson which glued me to my seat and made me fall into the movie.Still, I must say that I expected something different, especially after the trailer - maybe more action. However, it is a bit of a thriller for me, and the tension is so well divided that you cannot stop watching.Maybe only one alternation could be done - a bit longer story about his "patients". But that was directors decision that he left a lot for viewers imagination, and it has to be respected.Summing up, this is going to be another film that will touch peoples harts or maybe even influence some of lifes... Lets just hope that more and more directors will produce such movies and that wisdom present in their works will be acknowledged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is the tale of Ben Thomas, an IRS agent with an unwavering desire to help people. Not since 'Titanic' have I been so inescapably moved after coming out of the movies, having witnessed a tale surrounded by mystery, hope, and redemption. A tale wonderfully rounded off by an Actor-Director combination that has proved itself as brilliant. Some members of the audience may feel themselves growing impatient with the seemingly ambiguous storyline. Take my advice - see it through, you won't regret it. Another piece of advice - don't search for clarification here, lest a spoiler pops up. Get out of your chair and go see 'Seven Pounds'. You'll thank me later.7/10. No pun intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just came back from "Seven pounds". I expected a one out of the dozen drama. Luckily for me it wasn't so. For a Hollywood movie it has a quite engaging storytelling structure. The public has to guess until the last minute what exactly the aim was of the main character. Maybe a little bit slow at the beginning, but when you see the bigger picture you only can admit it was a great movie. After more action packed movies like I'am Legend and Hancock Will Smith proves he can also play in more serious work like this one. He is terrific as main character in this movie. He carries the whole movie and is encouraged by a team of character-actors. The year has just begun and we got already a small masterpiece from TInseltown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film. I saw it with mates so when the lights came up I quickly gathered myself and commented on how fit Rosario Dawson was. They gratefully followed suit. We could never have looked each other in the eye if that moment had gone any differently! I thought it was stunning, psychologically addictive film-making. The torture of guilt found it's way into the pit of my stomach, conveyed by a fantastic (although at times OTT facial expressions) Will Smith. This deep self loathing makes Ben Thomas uncomfortable to watch at times but given his circumstances its appropriate and i imagine realistic. It is because he is fundamentally such a good man that makes him suffer so much and forces him to devote his life to righting his wrong. The catalyst for his mission became clear to me early on so the 'twist' so many reviewers refer to as disappointing wasn't an issue for me, it allowed me to truly appreciate what Ben Thomas was going through. And I really like how he battled to stay disciplined when his relationship with Emily developed, finally letting out some humanity.And Emily, what a performance by Rosario Dawson. Incredibly touching. She was the stand-out for me. Every expression poured out feeling. It helps that she is strikingly beautiful of course.The characters on the periphery were great too. Woody Harrelson is always a hit with me! Although Barry Pepper did well I thought his part was neglected, as if there was one more of his scenes omitted that may have given his role in the story a bit more weight.I've read a lot of 'pro-suicide' complaints about the movie. Although everyone gets something different from a movie I really think this misses the point. For Ben, his life is over. But instead of simply killing himself I believe he wants to leave the world having made it a little better rather than a little worse and is in a position to make that happen. I don't even think he sees it as that much of a sacrifice, not until he falls in love, then it stops being so pragmatic. The unforeseen chance at a new life makes carrying out his plan so heartbreaking.Despite the tragedy of Ben's case, the film celebrates the good in people. The good that no one sees unless you are searching for it. It's nice to think that maybe someone is noticing.Utterly moving, thought provoking, a beautiful film that I will probably tell mates is 'OK, not enough machine guns.'</fullReview>

I take messages to heart in well made, deserved movies like Seven Pounds.Acting is strong across the board, plot is top notch. If you watch the first 10 minutes, you will be pulled in by this great flick. Couples will enjoy this especially on date night.Clear your busy schedule, and make the time to see this 2008 Will Smith movie. Get ready to pay attention, the story line winds back and forth, and rewards the attentive. I watched with my wife, she was distracted and did not take away as much as I did from it. Try to view it in one sitting or two at most, and not half asleep. ;-)Cinematic gems like this don't come around to often. Intense message but rewarding nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tour de force by Mr. Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have seen him as the wisecracking Mike Lowry in Bad Boys, the flamboyant Steven Hiller in Independence Day, but he reinvents himself time and again. The pursuit of happiness was a revelation. And now, in Seven Pounds, Will Smith excels himself once again. His portrayal of the troubled man, looking to atone for his mistake is heart rending. He brings such an intensity to the role that holds you spellbound. I almost wished I could do something like that in my life. Call it slow, but there's no denying the build-up, the chemistry with Emily, his compassion for Holly, for Ezra, and for Connie. This ranks very high on my list of all time favorite films, and i would unhesitatingly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good cinema. It's poignant, it's depressing, it's uplifting, all at the same time. Not many movies make me cry. This one made me cry unabashedly. And that, for me, is a lot. Do not miss this movie - it's a perfect ten.</fullReview>

Although I do encourage everyone to see it. The movie is sad but it's also very happy. It reminds us how valuable life is, and allows us to appreciate what we have even more because, well, sometimes we forget. Too many people nowadays are spoiled. Also, don't let anyone spoil it for you and you will be entertained too. Will Smith and others did some great acting. I certainly walked away feeling good about my life and even felt my worries alleviated, because I realized they were quite small.Now whether you will feel the romance in the movie or not, I don't know, but that's not what the movie is all about, so don't worry about it. You may even be bored at some point, but it's well worth it. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I came up with this idea for a book 5 years ago :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So gutted!! I came up with this idea, but never finished writing it. In my version, The main character is a Dr who discovers he has a incurable and fatal disease. So decides to kill him self before his organs fail so that he can save others with his death. He looks up compatible donors to him on the donor list and then interviews them in his medical capacity to decide if they deserve his gift of life. They of course have no idea what he doing until he dies. I added a whole section where the government tries to ignore the main chars wishes and use the body parts as it see's fit. The concept was to define who owns your body parts when you die? After a bit of legal battle his wishes are respected and a new legal precedent is created.Not exactly the same but so so similar! God why didn't I write this! So annoying!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To sum it up, the end of the movie was very touching and moving. The secret though was early dismissed by showing his phone-call to the emergency center. The movie would have been much better, if the short glimpses of his past had been cut out totally and the whole story of his past had been shown in the end instead. The script was a bit weird, because Dawson's character wasn't freaked out by the actions of Smith's character - like entering her hospital room as a total stranger to her in the night. I enjoyed the acting though - especially the heartwarming natural way of Rosario Dawson and the solemn determination of Will Smith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoyingly Suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I was really annoyed that I didn't understand what was going on. The film opens with an ambiguous 911 suicide phone call. Ben is first seen as an asshole, giving crap to a blind vegan. He later talks with a random guy on a golf course about a "plan" that is supposed to be followed. Now how annoying is that? Only later do we realize that everything in the beginning falls into place. You can get the feeling that Ben's tortured by something that he did. And showing the flashbacks of the car accident and his former lover suggest that he caused the accident and that she died.Ben falls in love with Emily Rosa, a pale, almost zombie-like complexioned woman. I don't know how I really feel about Ben giving his heart to Emily. I guess Director Muccino avoided the simpleness of a man in love actually giving his heart to his lover. Muccino was able to do it by developing Ben as a tormented man. It's not that Ben's situation is relatable, but never being able to get past something, having it constantly on your mind, driving you nuts... that's something I think most people have experienced before. Will Smith does a good job of conveying Ben's tortured soul. You can see it in Smith's eyes. The rest of his face also shows Ben's pain.It's interesting to see Woody Harrelson in such a kind-person role. He's usually the asshole, so this is quite the turn around. I was again turned to favoring this movie because of the soundtrack. Especially the minimalist piano music. That always catches me. The D Major melody (played as D,E,F+F#,A) contains perfect dissonance by the F natural . Overall, not as good as Smith's performance in Pursuit of Happiness but a movie worthy of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the rather serious flaws in this film I still feel inclined to give this film a strong rating. In fact this is testament to the acting which is quite superb. Will Smith is fantastic as the Christ like saviour with the dark secret and has incredible chemistry with Rosario Dawson. Woody Harrelson is as usual excellent. Most importantly the performances are what grip the viewer and make this a quite riveting drama from start to finish.Unfortunately the film ends with many questions left unanswered. Firstly we realise that Ben Thomas is not an IRS agent at all but if he is not then what is he? And if he is not an IRS agent how has he got hold of such personal information regarding the people he helps in the film? Furthermore it is impossible to avoid the question of organ donation to all of these people. As we learn in the film the chances of being compatible with each random person that you pass in the street is remote at best. Indeed we learn that the chances of Emily Rosa finding a match from anywhere is 3-5%. For him to be a match for her as well as all these people is just simply not eminently plausible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout this movie I was haunted by the sense that I should have been enjoying it, that it should have been an outstanding film...but it just wasn't. I wanted to like this film so badly, but I just didn't.I am all for a story that keeps you guessing and I don't object to final-15-minute revelations, but there were not enough clues dropped along the way to keep me engaged. The funny thing is, I made a guess about 45 minutes into the story that actually turned out to be fairly correct and I STILL was confused and kind of irritated actually. You don't get to see a story unfold, the last flashback you see pretty much matches the rest of the flashbacks, each new character tells you the same clues as the last one. There's no growth, no development. You could have watched the first 15 minutes and the last 20 and and gotten the exact same story but it would have lagged a lot less.And did I miss the part where the story explains the significance of "Pounds?" A VERY short scene, heck even a voice over, where Will Smith relates some ancient practice would have explained the title AND given the viewer SOMETHING to keep them on the leash.On the up-side, Will Smith and Rosario Dawson gave superb performances, the story was just too convoluted and slow to be redeemed. Seven Pounds had every reason to be a good film but, again, it just wasn't.But, hey, plenty of other people loved this film. Maybe I'm just being difficult to please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The likelihood you going to enjoy this movie probably depends on two main factors... your very sentimental and emotional... and you think you are an artistic sort of person and are into artistic movies when in reality you aren't that artistic and don't know true art when you see it... oh, and no offence intended, but people who aren't cluey will probably enjoy it more too (it is somewhat predictable). On the upside cinematography (it had a subtle way of creating a pessimism which tied in nicely with the background of Ben Thomas) and acting are great. Character development probably deserved credit but for some reason i don't really want to give it, didn't really have much of an impact on me. The music, although nice, is integrated poorly (exception being the mall scene when Ezra is playing the piano). Its main let down is the slow plot that accumulates to a surreal, extravagant and over-the-top conclusion. It's one of those movies that tries to make itself more artistic and deep then it really is and therefore cannot be enjoyed purely as a form of entertainment but does not develop a connection or depth to be appreciated as something artistic. I know this all sounds pompously critical (which it probably is to some degree, and i may be being a little harsh). Yet, i can guarantee that it's less pompous than any review that will praise this film as something mesmerising and artistic.</fullReview>

Seven Pounds is Will Smith's second project with this director and they have produced another brilliantly made film. No one can say that Will Smith cannot act and Muccino's work is impeccable. Unfortunately, now comes the negative. Really good stories should always be given the chance to be told visually and this story deserved that chance. The story, the visuals, the performances are extremely powerful. The problem with this movie is that it is the saddest movie I have seen in my life up to now. It is not boring by any means. You are engaged all the way through. It is just so extremely sad, but also so very well made. Do not watch this movie alone. Again, do not watch this movie alone.

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds: All Shock, No Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I planned on walking into Seven Pounds and seeing pretty much the same type of formula that I saw in "The Pursuit of Happiness" and... I pretty much got JUST that. Will Smith plays the same damaged type man who needs to make a change. This time, he plays Ben Thomas, an IRS agent who suddenly has the urge to help people. We find out why in fast glimpses from his past. For the first act, we find ourselves honestly curious as to the life of Ben Thomas, even ignoring the jumbled up to ridiculousness chronology of the spectacle. The second act is a terribly slow moving uninteresting tale of Ben Thomas falling in love with a heart patient, all the time cluing us into Ben Thomas' ultimate plan. By the time the third act crawls by and we find out what that plan is, we don't care. I think most people's positive reaction comes from the shock of the third act, which would not be as surprising if the second act wasn't as dull. Thematically speaking, the payoff is a personal redemption for Ben Thomas, which I've heard from a lot of people is considered "beautiful." I think it's pretty absurd. It's not that the movie was entirely dull, it's just that I haven't come to expect much more from Will Smith. Gladly Seven Pounds has taught me two things, avoid jellyfish and Will Smith films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say this is a good little film that had fine performances, sensitive and realistic writing/dialogue, a great score and gorgeous cinematography.Will Smith further flexed his range and really surprised with the subtlety through which he portrayed his multi faceted character. The beautiful Rosario Dawson signalled her entrance to the 'big league' of cinema in her oh so endearing fashion, this time adapting to the delicate pace of the film.The one aspect of this film that I was very disappointed with, and partially spoilt it for me, was the direction/editing. Now in some ways both where exemplary and helped weave the characters together....however, without spoiling the film, all I can say is that the director/editor have grossly underestimated the intelligence of their audience. It is clear almost within the first ten minutes where the film is going and how it will end. I think done in a different fashion it could have been a beautiful masterpiece that built doubt leaving you guessing until the final scenes, something that in my humble opinion that would have been more striking and emotionally charging.Regardless of it's failings you will struggle not to take something from this moving story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We truly live in a sad world, if a movie about a guy doing good deeds around ONLY to gratify his own sense of guilt is perceived as poetic or modern Shakespeare. Up until the climax when the heart goes to see the eyes I didn't feel the need to comment on this, but as soon as I felt the intended tearjerker moment, I realized that we are presented this as modern kindness with a little religious repentance shoved inside to supposedly open our eyes, when in fact the sad little truth about the story lies hidden in plain view: the so called saint here didn't have the decency to do all his good doing from the hiding; no, he felt the need to introduce himself, even to hurt one of the recipients of his so great gift in order to gratify his selfish need to be recognized. It's like donating a candy to the African relief fund just to be mentioned in the paper th next day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before you plan to watch this movie, just ask yourself a question - Why do you want to do this to yourself? All the tales are not happy tales and all the movies don't end happy... but rare are the movies that shove u in complete 2 hour of misery and sorrow. This is easily one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen.That said seven pounds is a pretty linear story of a mistake and redemption told in a non linear fashion - old curry in a new bowl. You will recognize Will Smith immediately from Pursuit of happiness and I am legend. Same sad face, eyes and pout. And yeah you may or may not be enjoying the movie, but you will be involved in all 2 hours of it - probably asking yourself Why?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer to the movie and wondered what the movie was about. All I got from the trailer was the movie starred Will Smith and he was on some mission. I wondered why they couldn't just give us a quick synopsis of the movie, but once I watched Seven Pounds, I understood. No words can ever describe the message of this story. Well, let me try without giving away any spoilers: Will Smith once had everything. A life with money, an expensive car, a great job and a wife. He had a big home and dreams. This was until he suffered a great tragedy which turned his life to the worst. He lost everything that meant something to him. As a retaliation he decided to use himself, the one thing he had left to turn the lives of seven special people around for the better.Will Smith, along with Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson showed their great acting talents once again as all kind hearted people who had something missing from their lives. I though wish we did see more of Woody Harrelson as he played in very few, but necessary and important scenes.This movie is very much like Will Smith's 2006, The Pursuit of Happiness film. Although I wasn't aware of The Pursuit of Happiness's director, I was sure that Seven Pounds was directed by the same person as I was watching it. The director Gabriele Muccino directed both movies as a slow paced meaningful movie. Although one might get bored at times during the film, ultimately you feel like you gained something from watching it.If you liked The Pursuit of Happiness, then you will like Seven Pounds. I was lucky enough to love and appreciate The Pursuit of Happiness, so my outlook of Seven Pounds is very positive.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally A Decent Will Smith Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right, I saw this movie today and I thought I want to write a review for this, it hasn't had much hype and it deserves it. I will put it simply... it deserves to be up there with the godfather and shawshank redemption its one for the greatest movies ever made. I'm very sceptical of Will Smith movies because he keeps churning out crap like Hancock &amp; I am Legend, I'm not saying hes a bad actors hes probably one of the best out there at the moment but his previous movies have been boring and unrealistic story lines. So I was expecting some American patriotic movie about how will smith saves the world. What I got was quite the opposite. At first you are left guessing, you get mixed emotions about the character that is played by will smith and you start to wonder what the hell is actually going on. However instead of it annoying the crap out of you it actually keeps you interested in your guessing games and the way it is all put together. I did notice the director likes to get a song in every so often to break it all up and slow its fast paced attitude down, it works because you don't feel rushed like you do in films such as The Dark Knight. Towards the end everything starts to make perfect sense from what you thought would never be realistic and actually turns the movie from being an excellent 8/9 out of 10 into a 10/10. Its the kind of ending that makes everyone want to cry, in a good way. It makes you take a look at your own life, it makes you want to watch the movie over and over and celebrate how fantastic this movie is and tell everyone to watch it so they can share the emotional experience you got from the movie. Don't get me wrong. 7 Pounds is probably the movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent performance by Will Smith with a fantastic message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first start off by saying that I once doubted Will Smith as an actor. When I saw previews for "I am Legend" I thought it would be some sci-fi action drama, and had no interest whatsoever. Same for "Hancock". However, when I actually saw both films they immediately went to the top of my list. It amazed me how Will Smith can carry his roles. So it's safe to say I was excited to see him coming out with the drama "Seven Pounds". Now prior to seeing this movie the only thing I knew was that he was some IRS guy who was trying to help people. The movie, I think, started off very confusing, jumping around a lot and giving you a lot of storyline at one time. After the first twenty minutes, things started to slow down and the plot developed. Will Smith, or Ben Thomas, in the movie, begins spending time with Emily, played by Rosario Dawson. To be perfectly honest, I think the storyline relied too much on this relationship. There were some scenes that I thought were just fillers, and could have been emitted. I loved Woody Harrelson in the film. I thought he was so sweet and I just wanted to give him a big hug. Flashbacks build up the storyline, and the climax of the movie is one of a kind. Very emotional and very touching. I would give this movie an 8 out of 10. I thought Will Smith was impeccable, but I think there was too much extra fluff with his relationship with Rosario Dawson in the film. The ending made it all worth it though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noble or a tragic tale?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Ben Thomas's story a tale of redemption or tragedy? The film has its opinion and I my own. Seven Pounds gets it wrong.Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is an IRS agent investigating those who owe back taxes. He appears to be very unstable, assaulting unscrupulous nursing home proprietors, abusing telemarketers, and stalking hospital patients. Is there a method to his madness? The film wants to tell the story of a man steadfast in his quest, but it is actually the story of a man in desperate need of help.Had director Muccino, who also helmed the taut "Pursuit of Happiness", taken a less sentimental tone in the film's denouement, the audience might be left with an interesting moral question with which to wrestle. Instead Thomas's quest is ultimately viewed as noble and life affirming. It's a disturbing message passed along too haphazardly. Somewhere in this morally confused morass there are interesting questions about utilitarianism and the value of life, but the movie is myopic when it needs to be panoramic.The film also has some more mundane problems such as sluggish pacing. As we wait for Ben's quest to be made more clear, he moves from one seemingly disconnected encounter to the next. There is mystery in these encounters and the attentive viewer will begin to put all the pieces together, but you may also find yourself getting antsy as you wait for a pattern to emerge. The film sacrifices some needed dramatic urgency in order to preserve its mystery.And in the end you may find yourself compelled to tears and desire to reflect on the nobility of Ben Thomas. This is as the filmmaker intended. But when you step further away from the theater, you may also find yourself deeply disturbed. I know I was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very touching movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, they did it again. Will Smith and Gabrielle Muccino's partnership is one of the best of movie history. After the awesome "In Search of Happiness", they hit the goal again, making a pretty touching movie. Forget what people are saying that it's a disposable movie, a movie only made to make people cry a river, forget it all. "Seven Pounds" is a movie that makes you think about your life, if you're just living or if you're REALLY enjoying your life. A viewer said in a comment that you will need a box of tissues to watch it. I must agree, cause it made all the theater cry a lot, including me. Kudos for Will Smith. He has proved that he's a great actor, that deserves an Oscar. After "In Search...", he shows again in this movie he can great movies, not only craps like "Bad Boys" and "Hancock". I also have to congratulate Gabrielle Muccino. If he continues doing high quality movies like this one, I'm sure he is going to become, in a near future, one of the greatest directors of all times. If you haven't watched this movie, see it as soon as possible. I can guarantee you that you won't regret it.</fullReview>

I knew there was some connection with the number seven, but I didn't know what.Will Smith does his Hancock thing, playing a rough dude with a big secret. Rosario Dawson does a great job of cultivating her relationship with Will, something that you can tell will develop from the first time you see her on-screen. The movie, although a little slow, redeems itself in the small clues you pick up on the way. The Smith/Dawson element also keeps you going.The ending is worth the journey... enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not many movies that move you the way this did, it made me sit quietly for sometime after it ended, the after-effect had a lasting impact. Beautifully conceived, its arguably one of the best flicks of 2008.I have been a Will Smith fan since the 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' days, with films like 'Ali' Smith showed a steady growth as an actor and on the way he captivated his audiences through various stellar performances but for me Hancok was a low-point and as a fan I felt let down but he made it up and how well he did with 'Seven Pounds'. What a performance! A guilt-ridden guy trying to change seven lives and in the process redeeming himself from his seven second nightmare. Will Smith showed with his acting skills that finally, he's right up there and winning an Oscar is just a matter of time. The movie was intense and kept the mystery well and in the end, the connecting links were woven fabulously.All the actors did justice to their roles and acting was good and story well-executed. Will-Rosario chemistry worked well and set the tone for this great movie. I think Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper have done good little cameos but the kind of actors they are they should have given more space. Over all a very good, moving movie, easily recommendable to anyone.</fullReview>

This is evidently shown by how some critics labeled this movie as something that is slow, "rotten" and simply "emotionally devastating for some viewers". Obviously people are not sympathetic to the events that were mentioned in the movie even though they actually occur in real life. I mean why would you want to watch something that possess the power of changing your perspective on life when you can go and watch napoleon dynamite?Sure Will Smith gives a performance so real that you will join in with tears and yes, even though his chemistry with Rosario Dawson is so vibrant that it makes your heart tingle inside, it's still just not pleasing enough to some people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaving Las Vegas meets Memento</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--Read only after you have seen the movie-- Basically - how I see it -the movie is about the pureness of the soul and what happens when a perfectionist gets a stain so deep into his soul that he simple cant clean it. The protagonist is a MIT graduate, decent boy who has lived a good life in every sense you can define Good to be.Now suddenly the boy finds himself from a situation where he has "accidently" committed such wrong deeds that he simply cant correct things go right. Result - obsessive compulsive disorder for trying to clean up his soul from which he gets momentarily satisfaction. Its like Will Smith meets Guy Pearce in Memento where both of these characters are totally and completely insane and lost. It certainly seems that Will Smith is "never really there". It seems that he has no passion - and that you cant feel compassion to him in screen. He is like a modern world robot - hardwired to do good things, but he is not doing it because of the goodness of his heart. He is literally doing good for the simple psychological reason: To get his balanced and perfect life back. This is why you cant connect with him. Smith literally donates his body parts to people to clean his soul from the stain. Its like watching Nicholas Cage in Leaving las Vegas being on the course to a well planned suicide.This movie made me think about society, morality, sociology and psychology in a philosophical sense which definitely gave it a intellectual sense. The movie turns out good. Put in black and white - it could almost be a noir.</fullReview>

Loads of people go "why is an IRS guy being so nice?"...he's not an IRS guy; this is clearly shown when his brother says impersonation=illegal etc etc. His name isn't even Ben, he's Tim (like the guy in the cheesy story of his) as his brother refers to him at the end. I thought this was a great film, and think the predictable aspects that lead to the climax of the film are not bad things. But I think they should've expanded a huge amount more on Ezra (Woody H.) to make it more moving. Woody H. is a great actor and did what little scenes he was in very well, but he could've been milked a little more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that if you don't cry or come close to it after seeing the conclusion of this movie you can't fully grasp the meaning of the movie. Will Smith plays Ben Thomas, an IRS agent who is passing judgment on people to see if they are worthy of a great gift (and trust me, the gift is amazing). While the actual act that gives to these people calls into question my personal beliefs, I cannot help but admit that this tale is beautiful. Well acted on all parts, strongly written, and well directed this movie begins with vague questions about this man and his life and ends with an answer. And like all great movies, the answer isn't necessarily what you'd expect, but it is perfect nonetheless. If you enjoy introspective movies and like a good story with strong characters, see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My very first review!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a few reviews and some of them are very negative. I personally think the movie is excellent and I enjoyed it, even from thinking about it afterward.I believe the movie/story was intended to show how much Tim (Will Smith) went through after the accident, where he ultimately came to the decision of helping seven people by donation. The mixed feelings of self-blaming (being the cause of the tragedy and the only one survived), bearing the loss of the loved one, living the lonely and hopeless life, are all being imposed to Tim after seven seconds.Seven seconds ago he was living a "perfect life" (graduated from MIT; had a good job, drove a sportscar and used a blackberry, bought a big diamond ring and all). Traumatic events are real in lives around us. And only those who have experienced it personally could really FEEL the "greatness" of this other side of life.The movie was well done that it never showed what Tim went through before he made the decision. He was calm and he had a plan. This leaves a lot of imagination for the viewers. And how deep one could imagine depends on the viewers. On the other hand, I could not understand why he was frustrated after the phonecall in the beginning and smashed the chair, and why he would let himself fall in love with Emily. For someone who has this state of mind, emotions should barely exist! Anyways, I love this movie and appreciate the good work done from all who have participated the making of this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the most anticipated winter film of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a curious film indeed. It's got an intriguing and completely absorbing story, as well as my favorite director, David Fincher, on the top of his game. With "Button", Fincher cements his place as one of the best directors alive, as his film is nothing short of magical, mesmerizing, riveting, ground breaking, and ultimately, timeless. Despite a long runtime, the film never drags. If I had to point out one thing I would've liked to have seen a little more of, it would've been more of Benjamin as a little kid, as I felt that was rushed (for those who don't know what I mean, I mean the last parts of the film when he's old, but his body is young). This doesn't hurt the film in any way, as it's just my wishful thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally Manipulative Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is a disappointment. It tries too hard to be emotionally poignant and it just feels manipulative. The film is centered around Ben Thomas (Will Smith) who seemingly has it all. A great career, a beautiful wife, and a lovely beach house. However, tragedy strikes in the form of a horrific car accident that he caused (a good lesson in not to text and drive) that takes the life of 7 people, including his wife and leaves him a shell of his former self. So, he seeks to atone for his sins and doesn't feel he deserves to live. He goes to quite the extremes to make amends by becoming a samaritan to only deserving people who truly need his help. The climax is ludicrous. I totally didn't believe that even Mr. Smith (who is becoming an exceptional actor) even believed the plausibility of his character. He looked like he was trying too hard. It takes a while to get going and it is incoherent at times. I am glad I didn't waste $10 on this film. I did think Rosario Dawson who plays does a decent job as a woman with congenital heart disease who desperately tries to connect with her samaritan. But even her story line felt contrived and the love interest forced. Gabriele Muccino is responsible for this mess, which is a shame because he did such a wonderful job with Will in Pursuit of Happiness. However, this time, he created a farce that wants to be much more than it truly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have nothing against slow movies. I like some of them, I really do. But I don't like slow and stupid. And that's exactly what 'Seven Pounds' is. This Will Smith starrer had me reaching under my skin and pulling my organs out! During the first half of the movie, you feel like you're being set up for something - a wild twist or at least an interesting ending, but by the end of the movie you just feel plain set up.The movie follows an IRS agent Ben Thomas who goes around meeting people to make judgments about whether they are basically good or bad people. That very notion makes the movie a little immature as against something like 'Crash' which showed different sides of human personalities so beautifully. While he is doing all this, you basically have no idea why it's happening (or at least that's what the script assumes you think), but you don't need any exceptional prescience to feel a crappy revelation coming on; and this is what the the fate of the movie rests on - a mushy, boring and contrived 'twist'.As it plays out, the ending scores high on the cheesometer (a couple of notches below Hancock maybe, but that's still quite high) and some bizarre structuring fails to pick it up. After a few flashbacks and hints questions like "What happened in his past life?" and "What does this lead to?" start giving way to "Why are they tormenting me so?" and "Where should I have dinner after this?" The characters are poorly developed with the judgmental protagonist being the most ordinary of them all. Will Smith has acted well, so too have most of the actors, but there's only so much lipstick you can put on a pig. Gabriele Muccino's direction fails to come even close to the magic of 'Happy-ness' and the movie's meandering dialog and uni-dimensional plot fail to engross you at any point . The teary-eyed characters are a constant reminder to your own emotional pain while watching the movie.One-line review: Slow, boring and entirely missable.

		<shortDescription>*Too sentimental*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there something I'm not seeing here that everyone else is? This was the most sentimental pile of poo with the most predictable storyline I've ever seen. I guessed the ending within minutes of the movie starting.I can't fault Will Smith's performance as a man haunted by his past (he was excellent) but I found the film too slow and predictable. Don't get me wrong I loved The Pursuit of Happiness and I'm all for powerful, thought provoking films, but this film got lost in it's own mushy sentimentality. It's a shame because in essence it could have been a real Oscar winner if it didn't wallow in it's own emotional pool.I won't be rushing out and buying it when it hits the DVD shelves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart-wrenching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that, while delivering ample emotional engagement during key scenes within the story, fail to deliver on such well crafted moments throughout the entirety of its runtime. Seven Pounds which takes "live life abundantly" as one of its key themes, echoes this sentiment not only through its story but through its construction. Clocking in at just over two hours in length, the movie which brings Will Smith and director Gabriele Muccino together just a year after their last feature together, is every bit as heartfelt and uplifting as the aforementioned outing. What is lacking this time around however is a coherent and focused screenplay; penned by first time writer Grant Nieporte, Seven Pounds' script is formidable in its ability to craft characters and structure an engaging story, yet the whole of the offering nevertheless feels bloated. What results is a heart-wrenching tale that builds and builds over two long hours into a climax that will be sure to put a lump in your throat but at the expense of having to sit through needlessly abundant drama.Thankfully however, I can without doubt use the term "drama" and not "melodrama". While Nieporte's script does contain a bare minimum of such, Muccino does give in every now and again and portrays events in a more Hollywood style, but it isn't detracting or insidious in any way. Instead, the director more often than not sticks to Nieporte's somewhat grim, down to earth tone; measuring out touching character drama with profound statements on the better sides of our human natures. Taking the forefront of this message is central character Ben Thomas (Will Smith) who spends much of the movie getting to know seven people with different ailments to their livelihood in hope of somewhere along the line, helping them. His reasoning is unknown; his past only briefly unravelled with every act; yet all becomes clear in the final ten minutes. This imbalance between adequate pacing of plot and slow moving characterisation is key to Seven Pounds' greatest and less inspiring moments. At times Nieporte's willingness to hide plot details from us seems warranted and natural yet at others it doesn't. To his advantage, the story saves all details until the climax of the movie- and the ending is better off as a result- yet it does so whilst only furthering the sense of imbalance and wasted time before such a revelation.One cannot detail the pros and cons of Seven Pounds without mentioning the performance of its lead star, who, undeniably comes off as the most coherent and compelling factor within the production. Smith, who has been making a habit of late of starring in big budget summer movies during the same year as winter-time dramas, shows why he remains as one of Hollywood's finest big name actors. Here, Will takes on a much more human character than ever before and he delivers; indeed it's hard to think of a performance from the actor more demanding than the one placed in front of him here and yet it pays off into being perhaps his finest portrayal to date. In a role that is arguably just as important as Smith's, Rosario Dawson plays Emily Posa- a woman with terminal heart problems and heaps of government debt. Being one of the seven which Ben seeks out to get to know, and in turn deem "worthy" of whatever help he may be able to give, Emily provides the movie with its biggest source of heart, taking the form of a love interest which in turn fleshes out Ben fittingly. Dawson too plays her role comfortably, bringing plenty of warmth and grounded humanity to the story; with movies such as Seven Pounds, there is cause for concern that any sweeping statements or philosophies on life may overbear the characters within its world, yet both Smith and Dawson do well under the guidance of Muccino to prevent this from happening.As stated previously however, Seven Pounds isn't perfect. Aside from pacing issues, the story at times lacks a much needed sense of introspection to its lead character as a result of the plot's unwavering need to keep details at bay. Again, this seeps into the movie's main issue of pacing, resulting in an experience that jitters in its ability to engage. Audiences should be able to connect to those on screen thanks to some terrific development of character and just as ample chemistry between Smith and Dawson, yet it can get a little overbearing throughout the feature's abundant runtime. At the end of the day however, Seven Pounds provides the heart-warming moments, the emotional tidal waves and resonant themes upon life and death that one would hope to get from such a feature. Also, with career-altering performances from the lead performers, a sentimental yet not overly melodramatic tale of love and life in all its ups and downs, Seven Pounds is for the most part an enjoyable and memorable experience to be had despite there being major faults within the piping of the story as a whole.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally don't write a comment on a movie! I do a lot of looking at other peoples thoughts instead. However, I thought that this film definitely deserved a note. I'm 19 and saw it with one of my younger best friends. We both didn't know anything about the film, story line, etc. As the trailer does not give you much information. However we were both drawn toward it, and we felt somewhat of a guarantee that it would be interesting because of Will Smith's great talent. All I'm going to say is that at the end of the film we were both very moved by the film, music and messages. It's not very often that I have felt that, I don't know what it was, but I do think that this is a great movie. This is prob. the worst comment ever, so read other ones if you want to know what it's about!! but if you like a deep drama, and a film that actually makes you think at the end. I would definitely recommend this.&lt;&lt;&lt; Every ones Dies; But not Everyone Lives &gt;&gt; Unknown</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven pounds of absurdities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just can't believe how much this movie has been praised by moviegoers. While aiming at tickling people good sentiments it turns out to be a pursuit of sentimentality by the cheapest means. Apparently most moviegoers don't care a bit for lot of absurdities they are requested to swallow: a man going in and out or even sleeping in an intensive care hospital room as it pleases him; organ donation protocols and procedures put aside at a single man's will; a box jellyfish capable of living in a tank filled with faucet water; transplant of organs which would be totally unfit; to say just a few. Also, moviegoers seem to be totally unaffected by the ambiguous morality, to say the least, that comes out of the main character behavior. I can't be more explicit to avoid spoilers, but try to think about it at the end of the movie. True, actors are at times extremely good as well as photograph and many film technicalities. But that's exactly what leaves one with a feeling of huge resources having been wasted for nothing valuable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not perfect but a nice change of pace for Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's comparatively easy to make evil interesting on screen; making goodness dramatically compelling is a much trickier proposition altogether. The risk, of course, is that such a portrayal will dissolve into sugariness and sentimentality, losing the hard edge that comes with taking on the more unsavory elements of the world.In "Seven Pounds," Will Smith plays Ben Thomas, an I.R.S. agent who, for reasons revealed to us only at the end, has decided to bestow blessings of various kinds on certain handpicked hard luck cases whom he deems worthy of compassion. His main focus is on Emily Posa, played by Rosario Dawson, a young woman suffering from a potentially fatal heart condition. Throughout the course of the story, the two of them grow closer as Ben works to bring his plan to fruition.Written by Grant Nieport and directed by Gabriele Mussion, "Seven Pounds" does a nice job holding its cards close to its vest, allowing the viewers to exist in a state of ambiguity and uncertainty for a lot longer than they are generally called upon to do in mainstream American movie-making. Indeed, Smith's character remains an enigma for so long that many in the audience many feel like bailing out long before any real answers to the puzzle are finally revealed. That would be a shame for they would have missed out on what is a sweet and compelling love story, touchingly and sensitively played by two fine actors in their primes. While the movie may slip into implausibility and an attitude of self-importance from time to time, the stars always manage to keep it life-sized and personal. That's especially fortuitous since the other characters - played by Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper, among others - tend to get lost in the narrative shuffle.This is definitely not the typical rock 'em, sock 'em action vehicle one naturally associates with Smith, but "Seven Pounds" makes for a nice little change-of-pace for the undisputed box office champ in the world today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best of films then.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not really that fond of feel-good movies and, in essence, that is all that this movie is. It was a bit like watching Forrest Gump but without the saving grace of humour. Really, Will Smith made his name with humour and he should never allow himself to be involved in a project where he has no humorous lines at all.As for the title of the movie. I am rather surprised that nobody seems to have worked it out and some people even thought it might be the weight of the average human heart. Not hardly folks as the heart weighs considerably less than a pound. The title, I surmised, is a literary allusion to The Merchant of Venice where Shylock demands a pound of flesh in payment from the hapless Antonio. Only in this case, of course, the character forces himself to pay recompense of seven pounds of flesh. So far as I can tell, he donated, while still living, his kidney, one of his lungs, bone marrow, his house and all possessions and his sense of humour. On his death he gave away his eyes and his heart.I read in some of the reviews the claim, 'Wait until the ending, it will surprise and shock you....blah blah.'. Er, well no actually. I worked out what was going to happen as soon as I saw him taking the jellyfish into his motel room. Will Smith played the most miserable character I have ever seen portrayed in film, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He even put his best friend through a living hell just to satisfy his desire to 'make amends'. Anybody who would help his best friend to go through with an act such as that without stopping him should seek help. That is the single glaringly most obvious thing wrong with the whole scenario. There is absolutely no way that any sane person would get themselves involved in something like this. I also think that the police would take a dim view of this.I give this film a 6, because all in all it was well acted. But the script was utter rubbish and the writer should never be allowed to script another film as long as they live. Ridiculous.I think I even preferred Hancock.</fullReview>

Has he tries to get through such inner torment of pain while helping.This was a great film, I hope will not be missed by the Oscars. Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson are also great too.

		<fullReview>I honestly couldn't think of one reason why I shouldn't give this movie a ten out of ten. I thought it was beautiful, and I have never been so moved by a movie. I went back the next day and saw it again, and I think I may have even cried a little bit more. I also thought that the love scene in this movie was one of the most tastefully filmed love scenes I have seen in a while, I have never cried like that during a love scene. Another great thing that came out of this movie was being able to look around at everyone else's faces in the theater. The movie theater was completely still, and the majority of the people had tears streaming down their faces. Even some men! I also loved the music in this film, especially the love scene. The piano played the same thing over and over again, but sometimes it sounded like a little mistake was made, but that made me love it even more.Overall, I was completely surprised by the direction that the movie took. I was also completely blown away by W.Smith's and R.Dawson's character's chemistry. It was so real. And even with everything that took place in this movie was sad, it was very uplifting, and I was very inspired from it. The second time I went to go see this film, I brought my friend. And after a lot of crying on his part, he turned to me and said, "I really want to go and volunteer at a homeless shelter or something right now." I loved it, because thats exactly the kind of mindset I was in walking out of that theater.</fullReview>

I am a fan of Gabriele Muccino and Will Smith, their last work Pursuit Happniess was one of my all time favorates, left me in tears for many times. Seven Pounds inherited the emotional and uplifting strength from Pursuit Happiness, and telling a very different, or maybe even a bit unrealistic story about love and relationships. Even though to be honest I still prefer the Pursuit Happiness (it gave me stronger emotional feeling than this new one), Seven Pounds is definitely a great lovable film worth watching. the story editing, the acting are all undisputably excellent, im truly happy Gabriele and Will and all the other great actors made it happen again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Passion is never missing in this movie, it is so tear jerker that could be easily defined as manipulative. Will Smith's and Gabriele Muccino's new movie Seven Pounds is too melodramatic, manipulative as I said, but not ridiculous, and puts in tears several times. As usual when the emotional power of a story is very strong it's uneasy to have an objective opinion since the judgment is affected by the tears.. Nevertheless every scene is constructed and filmed very well, and Will Smith is excellent as always. To sum up I would say that, in spite of the very negative opinions of almost every reviewers, it works in addition to making cry, very improbable but really strong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed Opportunity (Spoiler Alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An 8 vote because of the missed opportunity --- the Producers (Will Smith and others) missed a perfect opportunity to educate and inform the public about eye, tissue and organ donation - especially here in the U.S. The premise is fairly far fetched that the lead character could ultimately be a blood and tissue match and donate bone marrow, a lobe of a lung, a part of his liver, a kidney and his heart to people he picks as worthy but it is a compelling premise. Here in the U.S. over 100,000 men, women and children await organ donations. Many more people benefit every year from eye and tissue donation. But there is a huge disparity in the number of registered organ donors - 305 Million people live in the U.S. but only a small percentage are registered donors. In my state of California over 20,000 people are waiting for organs yet only 4 Million (just 17%) of the estimated 23 Million licensed drivers are registered at the non-profit website www.donateLIFEcalifornia.org as eye,tissue and/or organ donors. Mr. Smith stated in an interview that making this movie changed his life - if only he would act as a spokesperson for organ donation he could change lives for those on the waiting lists by encouraging people to consider organ donation, discuss it with their families and loved ones and ultimately register as donors. Me? I parallel Mr. Smith's character - I am a bone marrow donor (the young recipient unfortunately passed away from an infection), one of my sons was killed in an auto accident - I donated his tissues that helped better the lives of 21 others, another of my sons received a heart transplant and survived for 4 1/2 years. In those sons honor and remembrance I serve as a Lead Ambassador for Donate Life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the nod to Mememto by using that same motel. At least it looked exactly like it from my recollection. There is a similar flavor and theme to the film as Memento, though the story is obviously way more predictable here and did not have as much depth.This is a redemption story of self sacrifice to help others and dying to self in order to truly live, and that is the greatest story of all, in my opinion. They navigated the tension well of how he demonstrated extraordinary love and at the same time executed the most selfish act that can be done by a human. While it is unimaginable pain he had to endure from the memory of the devastation his mistake caused, it was another mistake he made by not being able to forgive himself. To me it raises the question of will power (pardon the pun) considering that he had the strength to do what he did, but was too weak to forgive himself...It's hard to put my finger on what was missing to make this great for me. Maybe it was just a little too predictable. It didn't start out predictable but somewhere at about half way, especially with the jellyfish, that was the too predictable turning point for me..</fullReview>

The story was interesting, but the movie, to me, was extremely predictable and utterly anti-climactic.I watched the Oprah episode where Will &amp; Rosario were promoting the movie, and they were very keen to "not give away the plot", but I can't imagine how you'd avoid seeing the whole thing coming after the first half hour or so. Sure, there are a few things that popped up where you didn't know how it'd go, but I was expecting something really special, and felt let down.I really like Peter Berg, the director. Almost always enjoy Smith. Dawson is stunningly beautiful &amp; quite talented. The dog was awesome. Love Great Danes. Movie was incredibly shot, and there were a few surprisingly sweet moments in the film. Take away the big names, &amp; this could've easily been a Lifetime network movie.

		<shortDescription>Well Acted - Bad Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review that contains spoilers. Please note before reading further...I'm giving this movie some credit because the acting was fine. The execution was decent, but there were certainly some areas where you had to suspend belief (i.e. the jellyfish issue with organs being okay afterword).As far as evoking emotions, it does that - I was definitely touched by it, but that happens fairly easily to me. I'm not normally critical of movies that accomplish what they set out to do (beyond, of course bringing in boatload of cash). But I was also disturbed with the premise.Will Smith plays the main character who is haunted by a past mistake - a mistake that cost several their lives. The entire movie is based one thing: atonement for that mistake. This is where the movie goes haywire. I found myself realizing that Smith's character was not doing the things he was doing because of selflessness or even love of those he was helping. He was doing them for *himself*, which made it all the worse. Not only that, but in helping one particular character, he had to "be sure he was a good man" before following through, basically playing the role of God. True sacrifice has nothing to do with that and everything to do with the other person/people.Can't bring myself to call this a good movie, despite the fact that it touched me personally and I actually liked the characters in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean after watching Will Smith throughout my whole life since he was even in Fresh Prince of Bel Air and now seeing him in films like this its a truly great feeling to know that an actor I loved since I was a kid is the one I love even more now when I am an adult. When watching this film it just underlines that fact and knowing that Will himself was a producer in it as well as the lead actor just adds more to it. I don't even think words can describe this movie nor experiences or anything for that matter its just one of a kind and its fallen into a genre of films that we watch that make us appreciate our lives and the lives of others. I just hope that after watching this film that I can be at least a small part of what he was and I wont need anything to trigger it. In conclusion I just wanna say that if u need a touching film or an inspiring one then look no further SEVEN POUNDS is the perfect choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a philosopher, but the first thing that came to my mind while watching this movie is how much glory could one man possibly want. it would seem like they tried to make people think a lot...to a certain point it did, but if you took a closer look from a philosophical perspective, the hero's character is actually a really poor one.the is the most selfish, self loathing, guilt driven character, not to mention sadomasochistic. "fake-selflessness", "pretentious" were accurate phrases used by other critics.Someone as smart (MIT) or as rich as him, could do such noble things that could have a more profound effect on more people's lives...like aid some biological programs for tissue/organ regeneration or start at least one organization for the needy people around the world. OK, not everyone knows the best way to redemption, but the fact that you are hogging recognition for your deeds and enjoying in bed (with the weak hearted) right after your wife's death, is definitely not a good message. OK, he took out is bone marrow without anesthesia to purposely suffer, but how does that help anyone but make himself feel good.philosophy aside, it was long drag (maybe for dramatic effect) for at least the first half and then there was some build up. a movie that spins on like this most likely just means it is trying to take time because of the lack of content, but make it look like it is trying to stamp an emotional effect which i thought was way overdone. Will Smith is my favorite actor, but script-wise i think this movie will be one of the few forgotten ones. After a certain point I saved my eyes and just listened to the conversation. This let me listen to the background music which was out of tune as well (i see that other people here have noticed that too.)Finally... I would have liked this movie even if the hero helped those 7 peoples lives but as long as he didn't take any credit for it..i.e. by not getting noticed at all..ever heard of "anonymous donation" ?The only positive message i see from this movie is for those who think the only solution to a hard life is to give up on it....at least by signing up as a donor, they could help someone who appreciates life.</fullReview>

I haven't even seen the trailer before I watched it.I'm not a huge Will Smith fan, he's a great actor, but I don't watch a movie just because Will Smith is in it. But his performance was amazing, one of his best for sure. And that goes for the other actors as well, amazing performances.To end this, I'll say that it was a mysterious film, but you have to fully understand it, connect the missing links, think about the movie after you saw it.

		<fullReview>I heard an interview with Will Smith on Kiss FM a few weeks ago when he was doing the promotion rounds and he told the audience that he didn't just do the normal press junkets but that he really wanted to promote this movie to everyone everywhere. And now that I have seen this movie I understand exactly why he had such a vested interest. Now I feel like I need to tell everyone everywhere to go see this movie.This movie makes you want to go out and do something good, something beautiful, something life affirming. Sure, the premise of the story is guilt, but at the end there is an overwhelming sense of justice. And if you get through the end without feeling gloriously happy you have no heart for compassion.And I am glad this is not the typical Hollywood film where everything gets explained at the end: a picture paints more than a 1,000 words. I am also glad this movie does not have the (stereo) typical Hollywood feel-good ending: this movie ends how it is supposed to end.The acting throughout is splendid by the entire cast and Will Smith shows that he has more to offer than just be the silly Fresh Prince. He already showed his range in I Am Legend and The Pursuit of Happiness, but here he shows how well he is versed in drama by having his true nature come out to the surface. Rosario Dawson portrays her character with great quality (then again, I think she can do no wrong, no matter how hard she tries). Woody Harrelson is wonderfully introvert in ways you'd find hard to accept from him, but he pulls it off as if he was born to be that way. But to me Barry Pepper is the one who brought this cinematographic wonder to life; his acting, much like in The 25th Hour, is just spot on, emotionally.My respect to the cast and crew of Seven Pounds, they made a timeless piece of cinema that will only increase in value over time. My vote: 10 out of 10 My advise: go see this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has it all! Suspense, excellent drama, humor, and a melt your heart ending. I loved every bit of it. It is not for those looking for a happy ending love story. Stay at home if you're not ready for a good dose of reality. Life isn't always pretty and the portrayal of real life issues, decisions, and consequences is jolting, but somewhat comforting.Will Smith's portrayal of a depressed but motivated man is the most riveting I've seen in a long time. He's a big character that has secrets and those secrets are unraveled slowly and methodically. It's sheer magic.I recommend this movie to anyone who want to see real life portrayed in a real way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...tries to pull at every heart-string, but in the process insultingly treats us like puppets.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is manipulative and contrived, but finds some level of emotional satisfaction thanks to the chemistry between Will Smith and Rosario Dawson. Director Gabriele Muccino (who directed Smith in the uplifting The Pursuit of Happiness) turns the film's already far-fetched story into a complete mess by jumping back and forth through time. If we were told why Ben Thomas (Will Smith) had a disgusted look on his face the entire movie, we would emotionally connect and care about his crusade. In a film of this nature, character connectivity is crucial, and we don't get much of it with Seven Pounds.Smith plays an IRS Agent who is on a spiritual quest to "drastically change" the lives of seven strangers. These strangers include Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) and Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson). Harrelson gives Ezra a soft, likable quality that would've benefited from more screen time. Even more captivating is Rosario Dawson. This is her best work that I've seen, and she really holds down a storyline that is borderline ridiculous.We are left guessing (sort-of) as to why Ben Thomas would help these people until the very end. Even then, the origin of Ben's guilt is rather unsatisfying. Will Smith plays the dramatic climaxes beautifully, and he's so likable that his suffering almost automatically moves us. The only problem is that the character of Ben Thomas is rather unlikable, because he is underdeveloped (due to the non-linear narrative) and pouts his way through the picture.The scenes between Smith and Dawson are another film entirely. They are real. These moments are enticing and heartfelt, which makes the movie all the more depressing. If Seven Pounds had focused on these intimate scenes instead of producing a massive "twist" (which wasn't surprising), we would be looking at one of the best pictures of the year. I feel bad for the actors involved; they deserve a better film.Gabriele Muccino is disturbingly inconsistent here, mixing beautiful decisions with brainless ones. The decision to include Ennio Morricone's "The Crisis" during the last portion of the film was beautiful, yet the earlier inclusion of Muse's "Feelin' Good" was horribly distracting. Muccino directs the hell out of this film (in a bad way). He tries to pull at every heart-string, but in the process insultingly treats us like puppets. If Seven Pounds was simplified into a linear, character driven drama, the performances would be allowed to expand and hide the painful flaws of the premise.I really wanted to like Seven Pounds. I had been looking forward to it for a long time. I can mildly recommend the film because the performances really are strong. Dawson should be nominated for her supporting performance (she won't be). Will Smith will get his Oscar, not for this particular film, but someday he will. As the credits rolled, the resonance of nose blowing filled the air. If I had seen these characters fleshed out and explored more thoroughly (especially Ezra), I too would've allowed myself to be an emotional pawn. If you can somehow manage to numb your mind for two hours and focus on the engaging performances, you might just leave the theater "drastically changed".Read all of my other reviews at: http://www.filmgazing.com-CARTER</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK the spoilers won't happen until the end, they're for the people who hated this movie.This movie is downright amazing. I went into the movie not knowing what the hell it was about and I don't regret it. I saw the coming attractions for weeks and every time I wanted to see the movie that much more. And it pulled through. It starts off so unbelievably strong that people think the rest of the movie is slow, but it's not. It keeps you watching because they basically reveal next to nothing at a time. OK, we know he has a secret; we know he needs to choose 7 strangers; but why? It keeps you focused and wanting. The acting, the drama, and even some suspense that was thrown in was just incredible. Honestly, it was flawless.Here are the spoilers: Ben killing himself was not an act of a coward but an act of a hero. It's not that easy for someone who killed seven people to just help thousands more. Yes, there are people out there who do things for a great cause that as a whole, help people one way or another. But Ben's gift to those seven people is MUCH more than he could ever give to thousands as a whole. A woman and her two kids were able to start a new life; a man was able to see again; a little boy was able to live his life; and you know the rest .. this movie is good. Anybody who gives this movie less than a 7 is just downright ignorant. Ben Thomas was not a scared, cowardly man. He was a guilt-ridden man with the power to help seven people who need it. I think we call that person a hero in most stories!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is rare that a movie makes me cry. I am a grown man, and have seen my share of tear-breaking movies and sappy stories... But still, this movie surprised me. The drama is up scaled, and played so well that you never feel like it's forced or overdone. It all flows naturally and manages to crawl under your skin.The acting itself is done spectacularly. Once again Will Smith does an amazing job, proving he can do a lot more then comedy and action movies. The script itself, while good overall, does kind give away too little at the beginning and too much at the end, cheapening the moment before the end a bit. Still, it's very solid and well done thou it could have been improved upon just a bit. The dialogue is better, and the odd moments of silence actually makes it pay a lot more then extra lines.Overall i have to say, that the movie was really good and very well done. Even the musical underscore that came at the end, with that one broken note, made an impact more then the "correct" one would have. I'd recommend this to anyone that thinks they are truly unaffected by movies.</fullReview>

How can a horrible movie such as Gran Torino get a better score than this. The acting in that movie was completely horrible, the plot was predictable (even though the plot in Seven Pounds was predictable, it was still not as bad as Gran Torino). The acting in this movie is flawless. The plot is predictable but does not tarnish this movie. This horror needs ti stop. People need to actually start watching these movies for their originality as well. I don't mean to rip on Gran Torino but its just a perfect example of a scoring gone wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I have seen two of the greatest movies of my life in the past two weeks. First it was Slumdog Millionaire, and now it is 7 Pounds. I'm not the type to get all wrapped up in acting ability or story lines. I just want a good story with a good message and well delivered. In this season I can't imagine a better movie to deliver everything I want in a movie. During the movie I often found myself confused as to what was playing out. Usually this annoys me, but in this movie it captivated me. The ending was amazing. One of the best endings ever, and not the typical go happy feel good ending. A rare ending that moves you.You will be forced to question who you are and what humanity is all about. I cried. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, i just saw this movie last night. I feel like I have that feeling when you just see a movie and you think its the greatest thing ever, but I feel like this movie actually deserves it.I wasn't sure how I was going to like this movie from seeing the commercials. I was mainly put off because I really had no clue what was going on. Much to my surprise the movie was the same way. I could not figure out what was going on. The only relating factor I could find was that all these people were terminally ill and that there was a car wreck that killed seven people.You sit through 2 hrs of all these questions just going through your head trying to put the pieces together, just waiting for something to happen to answer the questions. Finally, in the last 4 or 5 minutes, your patience is rewarded with none other then where the movie started off.To sum everything up it was an extremely enjoyable movie. Very well done and great acting from Will Smith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ambivalent. That best sums up how I felt when I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie. I didn't know whether I thought it was one of the most brilliant movies ever or just one of the weirdest. In the end, after reading a lot of high praise for it, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Maybe not one of the best movies of all time--like the person said who I went to the movies with--but one of the most courageous."Seven Pounds" sets the bar VERY high. I don't think it quite reached its intended goal, as someone else wrote, it's pretty uneven and the storyline moves in a unique but maybe too-awkward fashion. The acting is pretty good, but I think Will Smith may have missed the mark by "overacting" at some points (if you see it, notice his facial expressions, wow). But his chemistry with Rosario Dawson was a delight. And in the large scheme of things, he owns this role, which means you can't really picture anyone else playing it better. Woody Harrelson was miscast and his character was among quite a few of poorly-developed parts of the story. But the unevenness is not so much that you can't be moved emotionally. (This mostly due to the fact that the part of the story most focused on, the relationship between Rosario's and Will's characters, works and is enough to keep your attention off the fact that you're not getting important parts from the rest of the plot.) So I give it an A for effort, and maybe a B- for execution. It's one of those movies you'll either love or hate. There are degrees of each, like I think I love it, mostly because it's stuck with me after seeing it (which I think is a basic criteria for a good movie), but I still see areas that could have been improved. Other people's opinion did sway me I must admit, and though I wanted to give it a 6.5, I decided to go for the 7 because I figured if it touched people this much, it must have done something right.So, see the movie. This is not one you can just hear about and get the full breadth of what it seeks to be. You have to see it and experience it and come away with your own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, is it just me or does anyone else agree that Will Smith's brooding look somehow made him look like he was suffering from severe constipation? His acting overall was good though, just his constant brooding expression needed to go.Rosario Dawson was very good in terms of acting, although she was deglam in this role so not as much eye-candy as usual. The movie was overall bleak and the pace was s..l..o..w, somehow in all the wrong places.I also noticed some goofs: How does Will Smith get to the ICU when she calls him when it's clearly not "visiting hours"? The other typo (when he goes to see Holly): "Sevices" instead of "Services" and some other goofs.What really bothered me was that there was zero character development for any of the characters, so there was a lot of context missing. As a result, the film did not completely engage me at many points in the narrative. There was one exception though - The scene where Rosario tells Will about all the things she wishes she could do (backpack, run etc): That was a super-weepie. I had half the women in my row weeping into their sleeves or their date's sleeve on that one.Just a below-average film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only credit I give to this movie is that it does make you think. But the thing I thought was: emotional manipulation, glorified suicide, and WHY! I did not see his acts as sacrificial acts. Instead, I viewed them as clearly selfish acts. Instead of LIVING his life, he was consumed by his guilt and could only think about how to end it in a way to make himself feel better.It's easy to think that when sacrificing your life for someone is always good. But I don't think so. Sometimes, such sacrifice is unnecessary. Sometimes you have to live. And here, he did not live at all; he tried to keep from living and he succeeded in the end.</fullReview>

This movie starts off on one idea and appears to go off on a tangent onto another idea. This film never set down one single storyline until the end of the film when everything became clear, but by that time it was too late.This film was very dull and boring in the middle as there was an incredibly slow build up in the relationship Will Smith gets into and by the time the film finally reaches it's peak i just didn't care as i had lost interest.

		<fullReview>I rarely pay any attention at all to what film critics have to say. They almost always tend to be whiny and harsh and don't really care what the general population of movie goers have to say. Still the absolutely horrid reviews that came down about 7 Pounds actually had me convinced it was going to be terrible. I am pleased to say that the film exceeded my expectations given what the critics said about it. 7 Pounds will leave a mark on you and that means there has to be something powerful about it somewhere. It has been over an hour since I saw the film and my mind is still reeling thinking about it. It might even be one of those rare films that I realize was better than I thought hours, or days after seeing it. Essentially the only problem I had with the film was it did drag. The middle of the film felt like it was purposely dragging it's feet to drag it out over two hours. There were numerous scenes where I was thinking "Come on, get on with it" and that just isn't a good sign. But part of that is because I really wanted this mystery to unravel. I mean ultimately it isn't that much of a mystery really if you stop to think about it.I love Will Smith, I think he is one of the most gifted actors in Hollywood but he has had his slip ups like any other. I believe his rather disappointing Hancock this summer was one of them but as far as I am concerned he redeemed himself performance wise in this film. Smith as obviously disturbed, guilt ridden, brooding 'Ben Thomas' does a really terrific job. I'm not sure it's his best performance but he certainly takes the role and nails it home and as he almost always does. He makes what could have been a rather drab film into something very watchable. Rosario Dawson is excellent as his new found friend that gives his life some sort of meaning again inadvertently. I haven't seen Dawson in a lot of films but she really impressed me in this role. I think this was really something of a leap for her and Smith brought out the best opposite her. Smith and her don't exactly have really terrific chemistry but certainly they do a good job. Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper are excellent but to suggest they deserve much accolade is ludicrous considering how small their roles are. They are amazing supporting actors and have some very emotional moments but far from leading roles.Director Gabriele Muccino, who also directed Smith in the critically heralded The Pursuit of Happiness which I thought felt very much the same as 7 Pounds in a way. It takes itself to the brink of greatness, it really tries to be outstanding but just falls short somehow. Muccino has a solid story, a terrific lead actor but just can't seem to nail it home although some would disagree when it comes to The Pursuit of Happiness. 7 Pounds is also in danger of being too complicated to follow and it really does drag out the story but it does give you enough to really keep you hooked. So ignore the really horrid reviews and check it out because it won't disappoint you. It just isn't as good as it could have been. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a cradle-Catholic, i.e., one who was raised in a strict Irish Roman Catholic tradition, and a product of Catholic schools, I can relate to guilt exceptionally well. Too, being an anthropologist specializing in myth and folklore, I can appreciate the mythic underpinnings of this rather disconnected tale, told in flashbacks sprinkled with tidbits of hints as to what is going on. So, without dipping into sermonizing or moralizing on the good or bad of self-sacrifice in the face of one having to redeem oneself, which concept I personally rationally reject, I can state that as a mythic premise for a story, this film works for the most part. Will Smith is a fine actor who refuses to steep himself in typecast roles and seems willing to try anything from being a cop, to a superhero. Rosario Dawson adds flavor as the feminine interest, as do Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper, both excellent actors. The plot proceeds a little jerky at time with the bits of flashback to give the plot away and at times, the film moves rather slowly. However, the overall effect is favorable and most of the people in the theater seemed to leave emotionally touched by the dramatic ending, embracing the theme of redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was stunning. I didn't particularly want to see seven pounds as i knew it would be sad...thought provoking and maybe life changing and you know what, sometimes you just are not in the mood for something heavy. Never the less i was sucked into going to see it and while it proved to live up to all the things i had hoped it would not be, i am SO happy i went to see it and i plan to own it when it comes out.It is one of those movies that you don't know what is happening till the last ten-fifteen minutes if your smart and if your not the most attentive the last 5 min will be a shocker. While that can be tedious while watching a movie patience really really pays off as the ending will touch your heart and stay in your mind for days.The story is captivating, keeps you enthralled and will leave you sad but very satisfied. Will Smith was fantastic, Rosario Dawson as always was a stunner and Woody Harlson's small role was just the sweetest cherry on top and was the performance that left the most of an impression on me.AMAZING MOVIE do yourself a favor by going to see it on the big screen and joining the sobs at the end of almost everyone there. If you end up just renting it, watch it in the dark with a snuggly blanket and a loved one.Happy watching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hands down...seven pounds is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life.This is the type of movie where the story is incredibly confusing from the start, and it makes absolutely no sense, until the last five or ten minutes of the movie. You won't understand the movie unless you see the first half and tie it with the second half, and visa versa. The story just really all comes together at the end. All the loose ends are slowly tied up, and you find yourself thinking back to earlier parts of the movie saying..."Oh...that's what he was doing it for." Will Smith is...well incredible. He has my vote for the best actor come March for the academy awards. He just creates this character that, at times you hate, but when you walk out of the theater, you realize you've fallen in love with the character, and that deep down Ben Thomas is a really good person. Rosario Dawson gives a good performance as a woman suffering from congestive heart failure, that Smith's character befriends.This movie gives you a very strong message, that can be misinterpreted. You might assume that committing suicide to donate organs is a bad message, but the message isn't about donating organs. It is about how one person's actions can positively impact the lives of others.Now I'm not one to cry in movies, but at the end this movie I turned to my friend seated next to me, and we both saw single drops of tears in each others' eyes, and we said to each other..."Wow...that was a really great movie." I would highly recommend this movie to just about anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Addicted to Cinderella</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are Cinderella addicts. Why is that? The answer is simple. As humans, we want someone to discover who it is we are, what we do and to give us the credit that is due us. That is, we want to be valued for our true selves, and we want the rewards that come with that.At the core of the Cinderella story is that simple concept. A person who is wonderful, struggling along under circumstances she cannot control, is just trying to eke out an existence when suddenly, someone gives her an opportunity. And this is the other addicting element of the story.It isn't as if the fairy godmother came along and gave her the prince and the castle and all of the elements she had hoped would be hers. Cinderella had to earn them. So even though her fairy godmother provided some makeup and wardrobe including some very nice footwear, Cindy was still the one to make the impression on the Prince and win his affections with her own personal style. And that brings us to the latest version of the Cinderella tale: Will Smith in Seven Pounds.Smith plays the fairy godfather to seven people he selects, entering their lives in mysterious ways, not explaining who he really is or what he is all about or why he is doing any of the things he is doing for them. We understand that there is a terrible reason motivating his actions, but that isn't completely revealed until the film's final twenty minutes, which I found problematic. As the audience, we can't really relate to what Smith's character is all about or even what's going on because of this secret and that makes the film seem more distant, less connected. So, when something emotional is happening, as an audience, we might respond to it, but we don't understand the meaning of it and that only makes it seem superficial.Of course, Smith really isn't "changing" people's lives, but he is giving them the opportunity to make their lives better, which is that second element that makes us love the Cinderella story. The people he encounters get to have a fresh start, thanks to him, but it is still up to them to use it for themselves, so that part of the equation is in place.But what makes this tale problematic is the message of the film, which struck me as self-hating and worse, masochistic. This fairy godfather is motivated by guilt and is acting purely to assuage those elements in his own life. This is not a selfless or kind person intent on giving to those who need his help. He's just trying to atone for his previous actions.Not to bash the film too much. The pacing was very good, some of the scenes were very well played (though others were equally as bad as the good ones were great) but generally, I found the relationships that Smith formed along the way to have a stilted and artificial feel, and that was true even with his romantic interest, Rosario Dawson. Their relationship was the heart of the story and for me, it hits a wrong note.So, yes, it's got some Cinderella elements to it, and if you really need to see that now, Seven Pounds will give you a taste of that. It'll just be a little more sour flavored than usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds starring Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught an advance screening of the new Will Smith film Seven Pounds in Hollywood, CA. A Q&amp;A featuring director Gabriele Muccino (pursuit of happiness) followed the screening."In seven days God created the world. In seven days I shattered mine." ? Ben Thomas, Seven PoundsSeven Pounds follows the story of Ben Thomas, an IRS agent on a mission to redeem himself from a haunting secret. We follow him on his mission to seek out seven strangers in desperate need of help. Ben's plans are complicated when he meets and falls in love with Emily (Rosario Dawson), a young woman with a terminal heart condition. Italian director Gabriele Muccino brilliantly pieces together a tragic modern day Shakespearian love story, weaving between the present day and glimpses into the dark past. Seven Pounds is not a kick back and zone out film, you have to work as an audience member to put all the pieces together. The more you allow your mind to work in this film, the more you will get out of it.I never considered Will Smith to be a dramatic actor; he was OK in Pursuit of Happiness but I didn't feel like he was digging deep to relate and portray that character. Seven Pounds is a whole new arena! There is absolutely nothing Will Smith has in common with his character Ben Thomas. Smith had to really flex his acting muscles with this role, and he delivered an outstanding dramatic performance. Gabriele Muccino mentioned during the Q&amp;A session that he spent a lot of time with Will to figure out his character and really nail him down on screen. Trust between the director and actor was what found Ben Thomas lurking inside of Will Smith. Another interesting note; Muccino (director) did not speak a lick of English while directing Pursuit of Happiness, he only recently learned English right before filming Seven Pounds. That was amazing considering the performance he was able to pull out of Will Smith.Ben Thomas was not a character I liked at the beginning of this movie, in fact, I hated him. Woody Harrelson appears in this film as a blind man named Ezra who is treated very poorly by Smith's character. Why Ben Thomas treats Ezra this way will become crystal clear at the end of the film. Why Ben Thomas keeps a fish in his hotel room becomes crystal clear at the end of this film. By the end of the film I both loved and hated Will's character.I would have been disappointed if I paid $15.00 to see Pursuit of Happiness in the Theatre. I would not have been disappointed if I paid $15.00 to see Seven Pounds in the theatre.SOME TIPS FOR WATCHING THIS MOVIE DO: Drink plenty of water before you go see Seven Pounds, because you will leave dehydrated from tear shed if you don't. DON'T: Leave for a popcorn refill during the movie or you will miss some key points. DON'T: See this film if you have an attention span of a gnat. DO: See this film if you want to try your brain at the Shakespearean love story told through brilliant film editing and flash back sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls a few pounds short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Seven Pounds" is another of Will Smith's attempts at turning to serious acting and again the guy is deserving of praise. He gives another brave performance where he sheds the lovable and charismatic appeal to be more painful and shocking. Unfortunately his choice in the movie may be the reason why he's shut out of major awards buzz again this year though. "Seven Pounds" offers up a great role for him but the movie, despite being fascinating for its first hour or so, also gets frustratingly less worthy of it's high caliber plot and soon just dissolves into heavy-handed sentimentality.Smith plays Ben Thomas, an IRS agent who begins the film by saying "It took God seven days to create the world, and it only took me seven seconds to shatter mine." Flashbacks of a car accident or him enjoying his beach house with his wife are spliced throughout the film. He is a more broken man now but also more determined to make life a little easier for 7 people down on their luck. One is Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a woman with a congenital heart defect that he promises in some way to get on the hospital donors list. Just the more he gets closer to her, the more in love he becomes. During all this Ben has also moved out of the beach house and into a crappy little apartment.Who is Ben Thomas other than a man with a tragic past? He's an asshole when we first see him talking on the phone with another prospect (Woody Harrelson), yet he seems to be a hospital guardian angel as well, forcing the staff to give an old woman a bath, giving people blood transfusions and bone morrow, and even giving a poor family his beach house. What eats away at him so much that he is willing to test and give people things? The mystery is solid as well as heartbreaking and director Gabriele Muccino, who also directed Smith in "Pursuit of Happiness", gives the plot its soul and tension.Just as we move deeper into Ben's plan and to its conclusion, the movie gets a little murkier and questions should be raised that never really do. Did Ben try other avenues before arriving at his conclusion? How did he convince his friend (Barry Pepper) to assist him in it? Why does he decide to get so close to Emily and not to the 6 other people? How does he think they'll feel after his conclusion? It presents Ben's dilemma as if he has no other choice but to really convey that to an audience, I feel more explanation is required. "Seven Pounds" wants to be taken as self-important seriousness but instead its meaning gets lost along the way and it feels like just another mindless tear-jerker at the end. The worst part is its self-importance cause there really is nothing worse than watching an empty movie that thinks its great. It's like the film-equivalent of being an asshole.Smith really keeps this movie afloat though, showing he isn't afraid to move into even darker territory. He still has his nice smile but he also portrays a bruised sadness, a brooding anger, and moments of real uneasiness around people. His work with Rosario Dawson is near perfect, as is she. The romance becomes a big set-piece of the second half and even though I wish the film spread its focus around a little more, I treasured the time between Smith and Dawson and thought the two showed fantastic chemistry together. She's vulnerable, honest, and heartbreaking in this movie and proves to be a fantastic romantic match. If only more of the plot was allowed to breathe as well as the romance does, "Seven Pounds" would have been among the truly great films of this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live life abundantly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a marketing push that has kept much of 'Seven Pounds' shrouded in mystery, one must walk into this fascinating project with no expectations or preconceived notions. What does culminate in Will Smith's latest vehicle is something much more shocking and emotional than few could have ever expected.Gabriele Muccino, who directed Will Smith in 'The Pursuit of Happiness', sends us all for a loop in 'Seven Pounds'. A carefully crafted and shamelessly manipulative loop. Here is such an intricately woven film that little by little allows its audience a small glimpse into the heart of the story. It revolves around a deeply wounded man selflessly dedicating himself to changing the lives of strangers. But for what? To be sure, 'Seven Pounds' lays it all before us in the beginning seconds of this journey. But the reasons behind Smith's actions, or the eventual outcome, will keep your attention glued to the screen as each piece of the puzzle gradually come together.I have to confess that I'm not Smith's biggest fan. But I like him in these roles. He can flex his action muscles anytime he wants to, but to dive into a much more challenging role is something much more impressive than any alien or zombie attack. Smith digs deep to bring a human touch to Ben Thomas, a man we like more than he probably wants us to. It's a roller-coaster performance wrought with human emotion, and it's the motives behind Smith's eyes that keep 'Seven Pounds' a continually compelling affair. Even Smith's on-screen partner Rosario Dawson has never looked more beautiful, and a heart-wrenching performance adds such a powerful layer to this mystery.'Seven Pounds' works hard to guard its secrets. It doesn't have to explain anything. It shows you. Gabriele Muccino goes for the heart, and when that spark between Smith and Dawson is lit, 'Seven Pounds' finds its soul and becomes one of this season's most touching pictures. I can't possibly go any further without spoiling it for those who have yet to experience it for themselves, but it is one man's profound journey to find spiritual redemption and salvation. That life is valuable, something to cherish. Is it sugary and sappy? Yes, yes it is. But it's a story with its heart in the right place, however convoluted it may appear to be. One man's painful journey becomes a memorable and powerful tale for the holiday season.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Carefully Crafted Story About Humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This possibly somewhat predictable drama bares the human soul and redemption of perhaps unnecessary guilt. The clues are numerous, the storyline mostly straight forward, if not, clearly demarcated for the general audience. The slow, meandering scenes build with almost realistic human qualities of life. These snapshots often reflect what real people experience every day, not the American theatrical movie penchant to have the answers all plastered on the screen for easy consumption. This is a feeling, expressive movie that requires rapt attention to detail, the ability to absorb the moment in order to affect the greatest understanding and complexity of the human nature that is on display in the movie. This movie is a fabulous twist on a well tried movie plot. It has some nice discordant strains of music, and further mysterious haunting tones reminiscent of bars of notes from "Solaris" (2002) and "Enemy at the Gates" (2001). Wil presents ordinarily a disturbing character at the beginning, but really a much more penetrating complexity of thoughts, feelings, and behavior borne of a past that will require further relational conflict and internal agonizing decisions. In all, there is a truly beautiful sweep of humanity wrapped in a dizzling breath of expression borne by Wil Smith's intense performance. Except for a loose end plot omission and a technical oversight regarding a bruise, the movie shines like a gem to be admired not rapidly glossed over in hopes of immediate pay off. Oddly enough, the director or script writer's need to keep the mystery of the storyline a murky secret may be its actual strongest weakness. Eight out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is incomplete and uneven, but the acting performances are worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Academy Award® nominee Will Smith reunites with the directors and producers of The Pursuit of Happiness for the new drama Seven Pounds. Smith stars as Ben Thomas, an IRS agent with a fateful secret who embarks on a personal journey of redemption by forever changing the lives of seven strangers. Rosario Dawson also stars. Michael Ealy, Barry Pepper and Woody Harrelson are too-sparingly featured.The problem with this film is that it starts out slowly and, mid-way through the story, the viewer gets a chance to see what's going on. From the beginning, there is mystery and suspense, but the director fails to build the tension necessary to hold the viewer on the edge of his or her seat. There are seven strangers--but, with the exception of Rosario Dawson (who, like Will Smith, gives a riveting performance), the viewer never really gets to to know them. Because the script is not fully developed, the viewer never gets to know seven very impressive characters. Instead, the director incorrectly assumes that the viewer is going to be able to easily figure out the story line. But, in fact, the characters and the story are very complex.Woody Harrelson, an incredibly versatile actor, plays an empowering and inspiring blind man. He's winning. He's someone the viewer wants to know. Woody takes the blind man to new and exciting heights. He does not play a dull, stereotypical blind person. And, he plays the blind person as an individual who is able to do extraordinary things. And, in the real world, there are such gifted individuals. Unfortunately, Woody and the other strangers (with the exception of Rosario Dawson) are relegated to cameo roles. This is sad because each of the seven characters have so much potential that they can make individual sequels of the original story.The viewer gets a chance to know Will Smith's character, by putting all of the puzzle pieces together--but the film has, what I consider to be, an extremely disappointing ending. The finale is not logical, and does not live up to the character's potential, or what he is all about. The mystery and suspense completely unravels, and the viewer is left with absolutely nothing. The viewer is only left with the question why??? Because Will, Rosario and Woody work extremely hard to hold the whole thing together--in spite of a poorly-edited film and only a partially-developed script--I rank this film a 7 out of 10. With Alfred Hitchcock as the director, and an editor specializing in mystery and suspense, the film could have easily ranked a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about Seven Pounds...well I watched on a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and as that flight was long and boring the movie definitely didn't help. Will Smith's character Ben Thomas is almost completely unlikable even with his redemption in the end. The movie's two hour plus run time wastes most of the screen time with random garbage that just strings the plot along as slow as possible. In the movies defense Rosario Dawson's character adds a little life to the film although not much. I don't understand how anyone could actually cry during this film when all I wanted to do was turn it off. Also Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish at the ended proving that killing yourself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to this movie with pretty high expectations after all of the great reviews and was subsequently disappointed. The movie was very predictable and slow paced, even for a dramatic film. I could have told the story with the same impact in under ten minutes. Also, there were too many inaccuracies in the movie that made it almost seem absurd. (cell phone in the ICU? person that faints after walking a dog having sex without problem? gifting a beach house without tax implications. suicide by box jellyfish not destroying the organs that are to be donated. complete eye transplant including eye color? etc.) On top of all that the acting was notably sub par. (i.e. the outdoor dinner scene seemed like they were okay with the first take when they had never seen their lines before) After his magnificent work in the pursuit of happiness Will Smith should be ashamed. My only saving grace was that i saw it at the Alamo Drafthouse so i had a frosty brew to go with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is one of Will Smith's finest performances, he shows he is a very good actor who can suck you into a movie. After I watched it it left me with some mixed emotions, I felt bad for Will Smith's character and even the Posa girl but at the same time it left me wondering if I should applaud what Ben (Tim) Thomas did or just be appalled by it. Of course the intention of the film was to show that he is a person dedicated to helping people after he lost the love of his life by donating organs and his house. My view of it was that Ben Thomas is a coward, choosing an easy way out and playing God in the meantime. Is it really up to a single person to decide who deserves to live and who deserves to die. All in all an okay movie with okay acting and an okay score, that tries to be a moral guideline but in my opinion fails miserably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A depressing yet impressive film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds- Directed by Gabriel Muccino. Written by Grant Nieporte. Starring Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, Michael Ealy, Barry Pepper. Music by Angelo Milli, Cinematography by Philippe Le Sourd. Edited by Hughes Winborne Will Smith and Gabriel Muccino's debut as a director/lead actor pair was nothing short of spectacular, The Pursuit of Happiness managed to capture everything a good drama should, with good performances, a solid script and an overall successful production that conveyed a heartfelt message, while not being overly sappy or typical. With their follow-up Seven Pounds, they take on a much more serious subject matter, which is a lot more controversial as well. I would first like to say that this is a good movie in my eyes.Now is it for everyone, probably not. I thought Will Smith's acting was at times outstanding, but during parts of the film I felt him fading away and having the same look on his face, but he still gave an all-in-all good performance, and this film also has a more complex and cleverly written screenplay. I think a film like this is a lot tougher to make than Pursuit of Happiness, thus it is less enjoyable, is it any less great, hard to tell. I can say I enjoyed their first film more, but value the pair's work just as much with Seven Pounds. This is worth a watch, though the subject matter is one that can definitely move you and sadden you. 9/10 #254 on my list of all time favorite movies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Thomas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The character Will Smith played in the movie was Tim Thomas, not Ben. He took on his brother's name Ben in order to play his IRS role. I think the fact that nearly everyone tends to refer to him as Ben shows how successful Will was in playing a character within a character, so much so that everyone forgets, once in a while, that he is Tim and refers to him as Ben. I think it only underscores how Tim was already, in his own eyes, no longer alive and practically living dead by the time we first see him in the show.I also think Rosario Dawson's character was trying to listen to his heart when she put her ears under water in the bathtub (keeping her face above water).

Will Smith is still good but the incredulous plot, the snail-pace unraveling of the "oh-so-that's-why" ending that's not really enlightening at all is just too much... and at 2 hours,.. you have in your presence a soporific movie extraordinaire..I don't know if it's just me, but this movie just didn't do it for me..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overt Manipulation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title Seven Pounds clearly refers to Shakespeare's Merchant Of Venice and Shylock's demand for a pound of flesh from Antonio.The movie begins in a purposely disjointed narrative style and this quickly becomes irritating as simply a directorial gimmick. Also the Will Smith character is very poorly written. At time he appears mentally challenged in the Forest Gump mold and then he appears eloquent, despicable and emotional.There are few laughs here and Will Smith gives an overly earnest and intense performance, which seems to be screaming 'oscar!' I believe that tragedy and comedy have a lot in common. To deny the latter because of the label 'serious drama' is a mistake. Life however tragic can be humorous as Shakespeare proves.The script is the weakest aspect of this picture. It seems more interested in narrative gimmicks rather than believing in a well told story and well-written characters.The acting is good generally and Woody Harrelson again delivers an excellent performance with very limited screen time. Rosario Dawson give a very affecting performance.The lasting impression of this Movie is one of overt manipulation. Nothing profound or insightful is left to ponder upon.</fullReview>

You actually have a cardiac arrest and the toxin spreads throughout your whole body. How then would Will Smith's character been able to have his organs removed and then donated to the chosen few. His heart for instance would have been damaged etc.. Also there is the tiny matter of actually dying in a hospital so you can have your vital organs retrieved. Not dying in a motel room. Not enough time. The makers of this movie should have gotten their facts right before even contemplating having this sort of ending. This could only happen in the good old USA!!

		<fullReview>I found the movie a little too slow moving. The ending was completely predictable (which ruined it for me).I would have liked to have seen more of a connection between the characters in terms of how they were chosen by Will Smith's character. It appears that he picked them randomly. May have made more sense if they were somehow logically chosen based on his past.In addition, too much spent time was spent in developing his relationship with the heart patient. I would have preferred if they had used that time to explain why he felt the need to do what he did instead (which was not achieved by him just sitting around his house moping and staring into nothingness).In summary, good idea for a movie but execution was average and painfully slow. Measured too high on the predictability scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bitter black satire ** SPOILER **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not bad. I as well as others in the cinema's audience chuckled or even screamed with laughter each time one of the exaggerated moments came along that was oozing with black satire. This movie is to contemporary drama like the movie Starship Troopers was to science fiction: bitter black satire.The stereotype of the male academic engineer that is unable to grieve the tragic and huge loss he caused and instead uses a very violent non-Christian principle (EYE FOR EYE, TOOTH FOR TOOTH) and a very violent manner of death (SUICIDE) in a 2008 American Hollywood movie all the while the USA is still down in Iraq and fearing Muslim terrorists - that is entirely grotesque as a premise. That is exaggerated by Will Smiths facial contortions that want to tell us "I am tormented by trying to play a man that appears to be tormented". The audience was pissing themselves, what a hoot. And ... Christian forgiveness, anyone? The movie then oozes with naivety. The thought that a maybe delusional old woman in a retirement home is believed without any further discussion is symptomatic for the whole film. We are now waiting on the sequel on "How to do full eye transplants 101".All clues are easy to spot, the plot has no serious surprises. Ezra at the end stares at Emily's face. Does not know who she is. Then his eyes bounce back and forth between her openly worn chest scar (everyone else would cover theirs up...) and her face and then, with a slow corroded grinding squeak, the coin drops in slooow stop motion, and he concludes "you must be Emily". The movie is littered with such unbearably foreseeable sequences - an absurd amounts of Hollywood stereotypes is served up.But there is fun. When Will Smith smirks or tries to crumple his forehead - very funny. When the guys talk about their pact about how to go about girls - that scene is so relentlessly overdone: very funny. The janitor or front desk person of the motel is very entertaining. And the priceless cheesiness of it all ends up very enjoyably.At the end I would have wished for the main character to not be as disturbed and obviously mentally instable, but more responsible and aware of the fact that he could try to save or improve far more lives as (mentally healed) engineer with the right technical focus than this moralistic and naive trip into the world of transplantation medicine.In Hancock and here, Will Smith was involuntarily comical. Maybe Hollywood is trying to become its own screaming satire? We all laughed and even screamed, at times loud.</fullReview>

Moreover, the theme of personal redemption is only told at almost the end, giving the viewers time to wonder and to ponder.

And to tell you the truth, people voting this movie below 5, may not be taking seriously.Within the last two years, I have only seen a few movies, which may be considered "great movies". The Great Debators and Seven Pounds are definitely one of those films.I do not want to spoil any of the content, but please just keep in mind, to watch the entire movie. You have probably read many statements so far, that just in the second half, the movie fits together all the pieces. It is true and it is worth waiting. It is a master piece.Let me give you one advice. If you have the chance of watching the movie outside the movie theater, skip the first 2 Minutes, you want miss it in the plot, but a little spoiler is within the first 2 minutes.I hope you will enjoy the movie as much as I did and don't watch it while you are in a sad mood, it might make things worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can one man really make a difference? That is the question in this compelling story of IRS agent Ben Thomas, a man with heavy emotional baggage who cares more about humanity than doing his job. His assignment is to audit seven people he's never met, but in order to find his soul he makes it his mission to help these same people in any way he can. The question is can he do it and if so, are they truly worthy of the reward? Reuniting director Muccino with his Oscar-nominated lead actor this compassionate tale of love, redemption, and sacrifice has all the ingredients it needs to make it soar, including Smith who's sincere in the lead, but it goes on longer than it needs to and as a result isn't quite as moving as it ought to be.

		<shortDescription>Heavy hearted but failing to really impress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man struggles with his life. The opening sequences of the game are obviously the ones that are taking place at the end of the film - the ending is given away within five minutes. What follows is the events that have taken place to get the man where he is at the end of the film. Films like this work out when the story they need to tell is interesting enough and this one does.It's just the way it does tell the story that doesn't completely work though - most of the dramatic events that make the main man struggle and take on a most difficult path are played out so heavily it is unable to look at them in any other way than acted drama, too bad to be real. It is easy enough to understand why the guy is who he is and why he wants to do what he is working on, and it's believable enough, but the events happening are just laid on a little too heavy.Some of the characters get a little too little screen time - too much of the action is based around two characters and while that choice can probably be defended pretty well I think one or two of the other characters did deserve some more screen time.All in all, it falls down heavily but fails to leave a real impression as it overdoes itself a bit.6 out of 10 heavy hearts</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your usual Hollywood rubbish, but very nearly!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would call this a love story and I would NOT recommend it to anyone. However, it was better than your usual Hollywood drivel, although two nagging questions annoyed me throughout the movie:- 1) Can box jellyfish actually kill you? I just thought you got stung. 2) Can you actually nominate who will be the recipient of your donated organs? Any marine biologists or surgeons out there?I found this a tedious, long-winded movie which could have been condensed by 25%. I also found Will Smith's smile very supercilious with no feeling behind his eyes. Originally I thought this a part of the plot, but soon realised it was his lack of acting ability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully written, Powerfully executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've often used IMDb but never registered to comment. I just saw Seven Pounds a few hours ago and felt compelled to comment after reading over many of the reviews over it.The movie received numerous negative reviews and was often dismissed as a nonsensical tear-jerker. Though I understand the necessity of plot, purpose, and coherent direction as ingredients for a great story, I strongly believe that Seven Pounds is one of those wonderful movies that transcends those boundaries. I feel the intent of the movie did not involve morales and morals, rights and wrongs. It was a powerful story of a tormented man's attempt to cope with a life-shattering tragedy. The sequence of the movie was a bit jumbled at times, but I felt its purpose remained taunt and unerring throughout; painting a rich picture of morality with the colors of our emotions. The story takes a stirring case of sacrifice and draws it along the deepest strings of our hearts.In short, Seven Pounds can be interpreted as a beautifully written poem; not always logical, not even necessarily coherent, but still putting the right pieces together to evoke the strongest emotions from far within us. It certainly takes its place as one of my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you like the FX show Damages? If so, you'll like this movie. The thing I love about Damages is that it makes you think. Most TV shows don't. This movie is very dense and forces you to pay attention, picking up little pieces here and there to put the puzzle together. If you don't like doing that, don't waste your time or money. If you don't mind being stimulated for under two hours, it's a must see. Everything has a purpose. There's really no filler here. Smith and Dawson are a nicely matched couple. The chemistry is evident from their initial encounter and the film is all the better for it. All movies have some type of love story and the one in this one is both engaging and heart-wrenching, especially when you realize when and what he must do because he loves her and think about what will happen after all is said and done. And as a guy I could barely make it out of the theater without crying. I couldn't do that in front of a bunch of strangers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith's face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time we saw Will, he was saving a superhero movie from a sub-par script. Before that, he was saving a remake filled with horrible computer animation and mediocre writing. This time however, we see Smith re-teaming with Pursuit of Happiness director to tackle yet again, another heavy dramatic role that begs the question: where do we go from here? For all its heavy handness and what have you, Seven Pounds isn't as bad as most critics would like you to believe. In fact, it isn't bad at all. There are worse movies out there, and Seven Pounds is far from being one of them. I was amazed that the critics hated it, I mean, it IS Will Smith after all. Maybe they're just tired of seeing him pull of the same expressions or something; or maybe they're just tired of seeing Will pull of the same expressions in a serious role.In case you haven't been up to date in regards to the plot, here's a brief reminder- Will Smith is an IRS agent with a tragic, mysterious past and for some reason, he starts helping seven strangers with their problems.Seven Pounds is basically Pay It Forward with a twist- no Haley Joel Osment. Seriously now, the movie tries very, VERY hard to keep you guessing as to what the hell is going on; it fills you in with little tidbits in between scenes. You'll probably be shocked at end, or you'll probably figure it out before the end. It doesn't really matter. What matters are the performances, for you see, the script isn't anything that special. Besides the fascinating, symbolical use of a Jellyfish, the movie's main purpose is for you to cry... A LOT. Anyways, the performances. I have to admit that as fantastic as Will was, Rosario Dawson upstaged him. Yes, Rosario Dawson, the girl from Clerks 2 and the sex scene in Alexander (?). She was absolutely marvelous in this movie; a real, down to earth performance that was anything but showy. Will's performance is likely to get snubbed by the Academy, which is stupid because this will go down as the best performance of his career. It really is that good, and I think that it will be very hard for him to best it in the future. The supporting cast is very efficient. You have veterans like Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper doing their stuff, while Elpidia Carrillo (Anna from Predator) and Michael Early providing impressive performances. The Cinematography and musical score is noteworthy and thus, helps the movie along the way. Gabriele Muccino has given Will the starting tools, but Will needs to expand if he ever wants to prove to these pompous critics that he is better than they think he is. And by expanding, I mean more choices that could be considered career suicide. As for Rosario Dawson, I see bright things for her if she continues doing something different from her usual repertoire of comedy and Action movies.Seven Pounds is a good movie that knows its audience very well. Sadly, it isn't the masterpiece it thinks it is. 7.0/10</fullReview>

This is one of Will Smith's best roles. Unless someone has been in a situation like Will Smith portrays in the movie, they do not know how they would react or deal with their pain. This movie gives a scenario in which a person deals with their pain by helping others, even to the point of death.

The story left the viewers perplexed and bewildered about the psyche of the character. Sometimes I thought that Mr. Smit was a Thug, other times I considered him as an empathetic IRS personal.Wonderfully written, beautifully directed, and nicely presented on screen.

The previous user's comment was spot on, this is one of the best I've seen this year along with TDK and Slumdog.For most of the movie you are left wondering how all this could possibly tie up and what exactly does the director want to convey? At some point, I thought the movie slowed down quite a bit. But in the end, almost unbelievably everything makes absolute sense and perfectly ties up. I cannot think of any loose ends.Will Smith probably deserves an Oscar this time &amp; excellent screenplay/direction by Gabriele Muccino. If you thought POH was good, this is brilliant.

Dawson is proving to be a well rounded actress herself. I remember watching her in the movie KIDS back when i was 16. Probably the only actor in the film that made it. Anyway back to the movie Im sure from the hundreds of reviews you all know the plot of the film by now. So I'm going to skip that part and just tell you what makes this movie one to remember.This is not a fast paced film by any means. So at times it did seem very hard to watch. By the end of the film you are wondering to yourself if its just glorified suicide or a righteous act of selflessness? Truth be told maybe a little bit a of both. If you enjoy the film, or not its going to stick with you for awhile. An any case it was a story worth telling. A lot of people will get the message of the movie confused I'm sure. The message i got out of the movie was. If you can give your life to save others would you have the strength to do so? This day in age we need heroes!

		<fullReview>I saw this film last night and when I started watching the film, I was a little confused as to what was going on and a little disappointed because I had been expecting much more from the film. But, then the second half was amazing everything made sense and this film really gripped me. Will Smith throughout the film is looking for seven individuals of whom he can drastically change the circumstances for the better, but he is also testing these individuals to see if they actually deserve the gifts which he wishes to give them. The way the story unfolds is just brilliant most will not guess the end of the film. Once again this is a terrific film from the director of pursuit of happiness, and once again will smith has given an awesome performance. I would recommend that everyone watches this film it is definitely worth the price of admission. This film greatly exceeded my expectations and was just an amazing film I will go to see this film again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The secrecy surrounding this movie, along with the fact that it stars Will Smith, an actor I can always count on to chose the most diverse and interesting roles, made me very curious to see this film. It's not often I got into a movie, knowing NOTHING about it, but, in this case, it serves the film well.Sadly, I'm afraid this movie will not be the massive hit it should be. It's far to intelligent for the average movie goer. I love popcorn flicks too, of course, but movies like this never tend to hit their mark. The film doesn't try to explain everything to the viewer up front, it lets the plot simply unfold in a way that will leave you confused, or at least incredibly curious, up until the very end. And, that is EXACTLY how this movie should be! Only negative, the out of tune piano score in two of the movies most emotional scenes. Clearly intentional, but to me, someone who always notices the score in a film (I'll buy soundtracks from films I hate, if the music is that good!), it was very jarring, and pulled me out of those moments.All in all, this movie is phenomenal. Will Smith deserves a Best Actor Oscar, Rosario Dawson (who just gets better and better in the most diverse yet amazing roles {Descent, Clerks II}). And, thus far, with the year about to end, my choice for Best Picture of the Year.</fullReview>

I often like seeing films I have no preconceived notions about...but this one was not one of them.This is one of those films that gives you the ending in the first scene and explains how we get there through the film and I was not compelled to find out. Will Smith's revved up "emoting" did not make the love story, or his relationship with the other characters convincing, nor did the disjointed edit job.An hour and a half into the movie, I restlessly leaned over to my cousin (who's on a full-ride scholarship to a prestigious law school in New York) to ask her if she knew what was going on, and she didn't even get it.Save your money, folks. I can't trust Will Smith's bank-ability for good product right now, and I am a person who Likes to LIKE films.Sadly, it was just short of 2 hours long, but SEVEN POUNDS felt like a difficult three...which I will never get back...although I did enjoy the Boxed Jellyfish shots...</fullReview>

However the pursuit of happiness was a story sort of Hollywood type, with a real story but not so believable some times.Now with seven pounds i saw how a director can grow up in their stories, in their seek of life and most of all in their heart, this is not simply a story is a guide to see what is life and that we should protect it as much as we can, and don't forget we can share what we are with people maybe we don't know, is not about playing as god is pursuing the path for a happy life. Im glad Hollywood still can makemovies like this, because in the last year i have been so depressed with the movies they have released, with this movie they really enter in people's hearts and they can also win money, but not winning money to fill their pockets, winning money giving people stories that really will touch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The super-star's burden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not clear what the title means. I won't be surprised if I've forgotten it altogether a few years from now. What is evident is that, despite its gloss, this is a manipulative, saccharine movie. I wound up less curious where the secretive plot was headed than what this project says about director Muccino and star Smith. They collaborated so successfully on the true-life Horatio Alger story 'The Pursuit of Happiness' in 2006. But although their talents are still evident this time, the screenplay (clearly the work of a lesser talent than 'Happiness' screenwriter Steven Conrad) was a poor choice. Why this misstep? Some argue that it means super-stardom is going to Will Smith's head. After all, his previous two roles were as the last man on earth and a superhero, and this time he's a saintly sufferer who seeks redemption through successively more generous deeds. As for Muccino, he made his name in Italy with movies that evoked his own generation and culture, and it could be he's just adrift in Hollywood, like many before him. Obviously he's got talent. But this is one more illustration of the importance of finding good material and good writing.It's always interesting to watch Smith. As IRS agent Ben Thomas, who goes around mysteriously looking for worthy people to help, Smith has his usual charismatic glow. Dressed nearly always in coat and tie as in 'Pursuit of Happiness' (with the occasional nude torso moment) he makes being clean-cut sexy. And the able DP Philippe Le Sourd makes him and his love interest look good enough to eat. But no matter how delectable or watchable, Smith can't save this story. His gamut of emotions don't fit together into a comprehensible personality even at the end when the explanation comes. There are plenty of gaps in the plot, and only the mystification of the structure keeps them from being so obvious you would give up half an hour in. The movie, which tweaks audience responses with helter-skerlter flashbacks and unrelated short scenes, begins with Ben calling 911 to announce his own suicide. While he flashes a charming smile when interviewing prospects, he also shows signs of torment. Something terrible happened in the past that he's seeking to atone for. What that something is, is withheld till the end. When it comes, it's awful, but also the hokey stuff of crudely plotted movies, and not enough to justify the measures taken.The 911-call opening piques our curiosity. But successive contacts between Ben and a blind frozen steak seller (Woody Harrelson), a life-long friend (Barry Pepper), a battered Latina mother (Elpidia Carrillo), an unscrupulous nursing home manager and several other patients, not to mention a brother (Michael Ealy) arouse little emotional response because we haven't been filled in on the context. Another flashback indicates Ben was once an aerospace engineer with a beautiful wife and a fast sports car. So what? Nothing fits together. Finally Ben's directed to Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a beautiful, soulful young woman who, alas, has a failing heart and a large debt to the IRS. Catnnip to our hero, who after stalking her at the cardiac ward of the hospital, promises her six months' grace on the $53,000 she owes the government, and leaves her his phone number in case she wants to get in touch. You bet she does, at first just to talk. She's needy and nice and has Duke, a handsome black and white Great Dane (they have heart problems too, get it?). He cannot resist. She is not just perfect for Ben's philanthropic needs--she's also adorable. He can't help getting close to her, though he keeps his secrets to himself with her as with everybody else, especially the audience.The movie just barely maintains watchability by at this point settling into a love story. Dawson remains irresistible, even for the opaque Ben. Till her heart made her too weak to work, she had a custom letterpress business. With his compulsive do-goodishness, he sneaks back one night and fixes her biggest and best antique press for her. Soon they are sharing a series of Kodak moments, dining by candlelight, picnicking in a Hallmark card field, making love, and lured into long kisses. Then she faints while walking Duke. Back at the hospital, her cardiologist finds her heart is so weak she has only days or weeks to live and puts her on the priority list for a transplant.And then it's time for the plot to kick in again.It does seem that only hubris could have led Will Smith into a role so noble and mysterious that despite requiring a range of emotion, it never resolves itself into a three-dimensional personality. Ben Thomas is only a more charismatic version of the character of Michael Anthony played by Marvin Miller in the Fifties TV series "The Millionaire," who was the factotum of a wealthy man who went around finding worthy people to give large sums of money to. This time the finale is disturbing when you think about it as well as preposterous. And since except for the sweetness of the brief love idyll of Will and Rosario nothing really makes sense or has emotional import till the end, the audience is asked to indulge by simply sitting around waiting for the climax to happen and the whole explanation to come. First-time screenwriter Grant Nieporte is successful at making the earlier scenes mysterious but lacks the ingenuity to make them involving. Hard core Will Smith fans will have to see this, but even them it will disappoint.</fullReview>

I have to say that I like Will Smith and I usually support his decisions, but this one is just dull &amp; weird &amp; plain old bad. It seems to me that "The Pursuit of Happiness" gave Will a Taste of Serious Recognition, and he liked it, which probably explains his decision to make "Seven Pounds". Not recommended at all, but if you must see it, wait for the cheap theaters or DVD. Will Smith is still likable, even in this completely unlikable movie, although you can practically see the "Acting Gears" in motion when you look at his face. Note to Will, you were great in TPOH &amp; Ali, unbelievably great in "Six Degrees..." You don't have to do any "Serious" or "Message" movies like this one to get recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds Movie Review from The Massie Twins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds employs a tactic of misdirection, surprise, and a little confusion, as the film jumps around in time and waits to provide an explanation until almost halfway through. The story and the direction it's headed can be guessed earlier on, though the film is careful not to ever succumb to over-predictability. Director Gabriele Muccino has again crafted an emotionally engaging work of love, guilt, sacrifice, and retribution, and Will Smith has delivered another triumphantly powerful performance. Mixing an intricate drama with delicate romance and a compelling plan for redemption, Seven Pounds could easily be the feel-good movie of the year if it wasn't so depressing in its approach to salvation.Tormented by his past, IRS agent Ben Thomas (Will Smith) sets out on a mission of redemption to drastically change the lives of seven strangers. But as his plans are slowly put into motion, he finds himself falling for the beautiful Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a young woman whose heart condition finds her prematurely facing the fragility of life, and in turn Ben must come to terms with his own mortality and his dire plan for retribution.Although the idea behind Seven Pounds has Shakespearean references (see The Merchant of Venice), seven is too high a number for a two hour film. It calls for more characters, few of which receive adequate screen time (or perhaps purposefully aids in the confusion) and lessens the realism of the plot. The secret behind the film is so important that the trailers, teasers, poster artwork and more are all shrouded with mystery - and as the film unravels, the audience is kept in the dark for as long as possible. It's a novel idea, but ultimately faces two possible routes to failure: the viewer will get irritated at being kept out of the loop for so long, or the conclusion (which suffers from absurdity under hindsight scrutiny) won't live up to the anticipation. What saves the whole thing is Will Smith, who remains just interesting enough that the mind-boggling narrative progression is forgivable.Rejoining director Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happiness) for another serious drama role is an appropriate choice for Smith; during the last few years he's tried his luck with almost every genre and has had great success, but his most impressive work comes from dramatic realism. The script isn't all that clever, but Smith is able to add enough wonderment to Ben that anticipation (and maybe impatience) builds. Rosario Dawson also delivers one of her finer performances, while the remaining supporting characters add little to the intensity of Smith's role. The majority of his films lie solely on his ability to carry the plot, and Seven Pounds more than any before it, requires that audiences enjoy Smith's on screen bravura.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is a drama and drama's really only work if you care for the characters. Will Smith certainly makes you care for his character. Seeing someone with that much charisma play a character that is as sympathetic as Ben Thomas is a great joy.Sometimes I felt the movie tried to push the feelings of the characters a bit to hard onto the viewer. Such as the music being a tad to strong at times. But then again, it's a drama, moving you is the intention. And if you're open to being moved, Seven Pounds does that extremely well!The story itself is small and personal. The tone the characters keep is upbeat, but most things that happen are definitely not. The result is something that's bittersweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Important Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat through this movie expecting a lot and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. Where does Will Smith keep getting these scripts from, the guy has an unusual way of pulling at your heart strings and i am a 35 year old man and by the end of this movies I was moved to tears.You will not regret watching this movie because the message is something we all need to feel from time to time and you will have to watch it to find out what that is.Acting was top notch and trying to decipher Smiths character was difficult but the ends do justify the means.With me its either a "0" or a "10" and this was a 10.A must see!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't bore you with the details of this film because i'm sure you've read about it already or decided to watch it because it stars will smith. And we all know Will Smith makes great films.It can get boring at times but if you go past those moments and watch it till the end, you will end up loving this movie. It is a real tear jerker. Im not normally a guy who cries, i mean i have never cried in a movie before but this without even realising it, it bought a tear to my eye. I couldn't control it. The story is quiet hard to understand but you get it at the end. Will Smith movies always have an unpredictable end and this is no different. His performance as always is 10/10 from me. Overall another great movie from Will Smith. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I read a review of it by a man who said that the writing was bad and that the acting was poor. I don't know if he is an actor himself (maybe Al Pacino???), but this movie is wonderful. Will Smith was quoted on Wikipedia as saying that he took the role because it's about someone that doesn't get what they want in life, and how people don't get what they want out of life. He said he's fascinated with the bittersweet. This movie is just like that. Its melancholy surrender is truly beautiful. This might not be an Oscar winning movie (who knows, those things are political), but it's a gripping story and an artfully done movie. It's probably easier for some dismissive arm-chair movie critic to point out the flaws, than to consider its beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow the movie starts with suicide and Will Smith has done his best to judge the character and I personally feel he is the correct person for this character and this is one of the best movie of this year and I wish &amp; expect Oscar for will smith in 2008.It actually takes a lot out of you to watch. In the theater I was in, most people were crying towards the end--even grown men. When you realize what Ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment.This film has a feel-good factor which is the main selling point if your wondering what film to see, I believe true drama fans will be greatly satisfied along with Will Smith fans, but overall it is a good film which I found deeply entertaining, although I would not pay to see this again, I do recommend spending your money to 'try it out'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to give this title a 10 and I have never done this before. I literally guessed (wrongly), the plot/ending/storyline, etc., five different times the first time I watched it. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised as the story wrapped up and I needed no more reel time to satisfy me.I watched it again immediately afterward to be only more in touch with all the details of the story of Ben Thomas, the character who Will Smith plays.Ben is a complex man with an agenda that we see as heartless at times and full of grace all others. This is a love story, a story of forgiving, a tragedy, and a blessing all wrapped up into a neat little package that all people will enjoy.The first hour-plus of storyline is character building in its finest and I am grateful it was there. At the time it seemed like the story would never start only to find out I was already living it.Go see this movie. Tell your friends. "Seven Pounds" will be one to have in your personal collection for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, to the simpletons who got all hung up on the jellyfish-attacking-the-heart thing, get a clue. Does it matter? The true point of the act is the sacrifice he made, not how he did it. Just imagine he blew his brains out then if that makes it better. Knock it down a star for that if you will, but to rag on the whole movie just because of that detail is simple-minded.Now, for the sanctimonious idiots who denounced the movie on moral grounds - save it for your bible studies. The guy caused seven deaths. You know what you self-righteous hypocrites would do? Absolutely nothing. You'd "feel bad" about it and selfishly live on without doing a damn thing to make up for it. But this guy. He went out and atoned for all of them. I don't give a crap what your religious belief is, not only is there nothing wrong with what he did, it's down right admirable. The world would be a better place if more people were like him.The movie was great. His character was great. I wish every worthless pile of crap that caused a fatality accident would kill themselves to save the same number of lives they cost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It got three stars simply because I like Will Smith. But the movie....? Let's see what did I learn? If you screw up badly and are consumed by remorse it's okay to kill yourself as long as you give a couple of body parts to some "good" persons. How about living, learning, overcoming your remorse/guilt, contributing positively to society and helping to improve it and help others not make the same mistake you did? Nah...that's for wimps and sissies. And since I didn't have a clue as to why the main character was acting the way he was and doing the things he did it wasn't long before I didn't care about him or why he was doing them. Before this thing was half over I wanted to get up and leave. The only problem was that I was already at home and had nowhere else to go. I don't understand the people that talk about how this movie left them feeling all warm and fuzzy. It left me cold, disgusted, and disinterested.</fullReview>

Thomas has his demons and is searching for redemption to help cleanse a harrowing secret. His conscience is heavy and his life presents a minor complication that puts the power of changing lives in his hands. He has the ability to turn around the circumstances of seven strangers...if he deems they actually deserve a second chance. Its an extraordinary journey for a man that usually deals out misery instead of mercy. The cast also features: Woody Harrelson, Rosario Dawson, Barry Pepper, Michael Ealy and Gina Hecht.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm growing pretty tired of 'Saintly Will'...Pursuit of Happiness - Will struggles hard and gets his reward.Seven Pounds - Will tries to help others because of his *dark secret*...... Even in "Hancock" they couldn't stick with the 'surly superhero' hook... Soon enough they had him develop a conscience and do everything he could to come to the rescue. Unlike some who will be disgruntled at his constant displays of 'purity', I'm not baying that he make a speedy return to comedy. Do dramas, do love stories... but please give us a dose of the common man again, instead of insisting upon being the 'inspiring moral beacon'...Will's last movie where his character didn't have the burden of trying to perform heroically and be better was I, Robot. It's been too long since then, and Lord knows even that ain't no masterpiece! To all those who might protest that "he's only showing his range!": No. Will is already known off-screen as a nice guy. Seeing him play a reprehensible scumbag on film would be what I call truly 'branching out'... but is that going to happen, anytime soon?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second film in a poor year from Mr. Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Will Smith. Honestly, he is one of my favorite actors, he has so much charisma and is able to show such emotion, and most impressive of all he does it in blockbuster films. He has always gotten my respect. Seven Pounds is a film that appeals to our emotions, in the most literal sense of the saying. As the trailers suggested, the film is set up as a romantic mystery as we follow the bizarre actions of Smith's lead character and try to guess what exactly he's up to. Along the way, he meets a single woman with heart troubles and a relationship blooms. But an unhappy ending is to come, and come it does. Smith's character is a depressed, troubled and, eventually, completely ununderstandable man. His actions are done with such purpose and precision, we are forced to believe he has a plan. When we discover the end result, though, the plan becomes dumb. One could even say a little bit sick. The whole film revolves around the "ultimate" plan the man has, yet when the final result comes about, it doesn't really make sense. It is true, the film will appeal to your emotions. Smith is not at his best, turning in a rather one-note performance that doesn't reverberate well, but Dawson is surprisingly wonderful in her role as the heartsick (literally) young woman who steals Smith's heart, and Woody Harrelson does well in a small supporting role. Despite it's emotional immediate impact, it's a movie that just doesn't hold up to further thought. In fact, it pretty much falls apart. The worst part is that it's pretty easy to understand what the film was going for, but somehow it got lost in execution. It's a pity, that Smith has to follow up his summer dud Hancock with this disappointing tear jerker. The movie had real potential, especially when you consider the basic premise, but it fell apart, a sad fate for a film. 5/10 stars...Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In The End - Very Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the end, "Seven Pounds" is a very touching movie. The problem with it is that it takes a while to get there. Will Smith is actually very good as Ben Thomas, an IRS agent who is seeking out good people to help. If that doesn't sound like much, it's actually mildly interesting, but the strength of the movie is Smith's performance and the obvious mystery behind Thomas. You spend the movie wondering who and what this guy really is. The mystery is important, because the pace of the story is a little bit slow. This is not a movie full of excitement. It catches a viewers' interest right away, as Thomas calls 911 to report his own suicide, and then we have the typical flashback style of movie to explain how he got to the point of committing suicide. His first depicted encounter - with a blind telephone agent (a somewhat limited role played by Woody Harrelson) - is somewhat shocking, and makes you wonder about his own sanity, but the movie clearly revolves around the relationship Thomas develops with Emily (Rosario Dawson) - a young woman dying of a heart condition in desperate need of a transplant. It's a confusing movie at times, which has enough mystery to keep you interested, but it's also one that lacks any real sustained excitement, although it has a final scene that is indeed very touching, to the point of being almost too perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollow tearjerker alert.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First id like to congratulate Will Smith for turning in such a fine performance. Then id like to state that this movie is a load of tosh. It has a interesting premise but doesn't show any concern for exploring any of the questions at hand. IT rather just "milks" them. Very hollow. The first part plays outs quite intriguing, flashbacks scattered across, then comes a overly cute but still somewhat nice love-story, then we have the heavy handed payoff. Its a waste of time but its mildly entertaining in parts, if you really cant sleep you are excused for turning to it. The ending is a bit like Titanic. The direction is very middle of the road. Its basically a chick-flick for chicks and romantic guys into martyrdom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Will, But He's Still Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor Will Smith suffers from a tragic Hollywood handicap. Like Robin Williams and Jim Carrey, his off-screen persona overshadows his craftsmanship when it comes to acting. This means that he has to work extra hard to achieve an authentic transformation into a character different from his persona.This affliction tends to predominate among comedians, and maybe that's the reason Jack Nicholson has been able to overcome this potentially debilitating condition. Or maybe he's just a brilliant actor.But "Seven Pounds" fails as a movie because it doesn't manage to counterbalance the powerful force that is "Big Willy Style", confirming once again that Smith is most clearly in his element in comedy or action settings.His valiant attempts at more dramatic roles are definitely workmanlike, and I can't help feel that eventually the right director will give him a context which amplifies his efforts. Sadly though, that doesn't happen here."Seven Pounds'' director, Gabriele Muccino previously helmed a superior attempt by Smith to transcend himself in "Pursuit of Happiness". He took on a more difficult challenge here when he decided to play the story as a suspense thriller, instead of a straight drama. It requires significant skill to arrange the various devices subtly enough to keep the viewer intrigued without losing them before the climax. Shyamalan's "Sixth Sense" and any of Hitchhock's famous works are fine examples of achievement in this respect.It's hard to summarise the plot without giving it away, so let's just say that Smith portrays a man who tries, in a unique way, to wrestle down the demons scared up in the aftermath of a terrible personal tragedy.The narrative is non-linear enough to indeed build some mystery. It provides sufficient clues along the way to keep the audience guessing and on your way home you'll have the added bonus of finally being able to work out what the enigmatic title refers to.But if you're not a die-hard Will Smith fan, willing to forgive most any trespasses by the great man, some of the dramatic interludes and intense staring will start to wear thin long before the end credits are rolling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How confusion can equal boring, dissatisfied, and more confusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't know what to expect of this film besides, the fact that once again the Fresh Prince was dipping out of sure blockbuster films and into (hopefully) sure Oscar bait. Ali, In the pursuit of happiness, both films where Will Smith took chances to not only expand and show his acting chops, but also to put him in the realm of great actors and hopefully on day claim the prize all thespians seek. But the direction the director and writer take really takes the steam out of the film. And while the direction of the film goes the direction of giving us flashbacks and asking us to take these along with the present in order to piece the film together is somewhat daunting, and demanding. While neither Will Smith's character or Barry Pepper's character allows us a wiff of a clue, the setup does seem to force the bait, instead of taking it. The movie drags and putts along and never attacks or focuses. The acting isn't what took me away from the film, but the direction. It never allows you to focus. It never permits focus, but the acting is solid is not excellent. Rosario Dawson embraces her beauty inside and out. She really makes the story into a romance and a focus on the relationship is what draws you in. Will Smith is engaging but once again he over approaches the style of acting suited for this role. The yelling and the facial jerks that he uses in similar fashion in his action films he always brings to his dramatic roles. A with the limited time and space given Elpidia Carrillo attacks the screen with pure emotion and control (maybe Will can take her lead). But Rosario really takes the film to another level by just being beautiful and soft, and with her character's sickness, showing true vulnerability, and openness by almost forcing a relationship. I think more editing and a better flow would result in a more solid and refined film. Maybe it should play backwards and have his seven pounds waking through the power of others, hint, hint...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the choices of great movies this week to see..we went to see 7 Pounds, because we LOVE Will Smith. Must admit we did ignore that fact that Hancock could have been a great movie that we were disappointed in.7 Pounds: Well, once I woke up, the last 10 minutes of the movie wasn't bad. I'd say the last 10 minutes of the movie was pretty good, but the rest was boring enough to put me to sleep. My friend and I have worked out a system, when we are bored, we poke each other in the arm. I'd say we gave this movie at least 20 pokes a piece.It was predictable, though it was supposed to be one of those movies that was unpredictable until the end, but obviously, the director felt the audience was stupid enough that we needed so many clues, that it became very predictable. The attempts at humor, like with the motel clerk in the movie were not funny, though because the attempts were so blatant that the audience felt obligated to chuckle. OK, so the woman can't cook..we get it...gulp.Smith was so depressed in the movie, that his hang-dogged look was unbelievable and then when something happened to make him happy he was WOW! Happy! but then back to Hannah Barbara's Droopy Dog impersonation.One of the lawyers in my office said they were going to see the movie and asked my opinion of it. I don't like to give friend's my opinion, because we sometimes see things so differently, so I merely said, "Drink coffee and try to stay awake." Can't wait for to hear what he thought of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is a must watch &amp; never forget kinda movie, I consider this as a great movie of our time. Will has portrayed such a character, which is innate to self in all of us.At times, it becomes very sensitive, but storyline deserves it most. As playing maths with life to have a justification within self is not a easy subject to be dealt in reality, so in a movie as well.Very well told, directed and lived by the characters, you get in between Will &amp; Rosario. End of the movie is splendid, Ben has been very successful in leaving a message that "Giving gives pleasure to the soul." Hats off to Will &amp; Team.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you will always remember. Will Smith has grown a lot as an actor over the last decade. Going from a actor mostly appearing in comedy, to an actor portraying serious characters. I loved him in The pursuit of happiness, in this movie he's even better.There is no need to mention the story, don't want to give anything away. The summary here at IMDb is enough. The movie will make sense to you, just as it did to me. Even if might be a bit slow at first, don't stop watching. You will regret it! 2008 has been an amazing year of movies. The great movies keep on coming!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, bleak and depressing. Save your money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film which will go down as a film I have no desire to EVER see again. It's not that it was awful, it's just that it was SO DEPRESSING and painfully BLEAK. And I very often enjoy very emotive, dramatic movies, loaded with great dialogue and brilliant acting. This film was simply just LOADED. Heavy on the sentimentality. Heavy on the bleakness. Heck, just heavy on heavy.I already figured out what the basic premise of the story was about fifteen or so minutes into it, which kinda killed the overall "mystery" and "shock factor", but oh well. Will Smith and Rosario Dawson were very good in their roles, particularly Rosario Dawson. But as much as I really like and admire Will, this role made him seem like he was "trying WAY TOO HARD" to pull at our ever-loving heartstrings. Mr. Smith winced and grimaced and flashed creepy grin after creepy grin SO MUCH in this morbid film, that I almost wanted to leave.The reason for his character Ben Thomas wanting to "give of himself" to only "worthy" individuals was understandable given his tragic circumstances, but at the same time, the whole thing bordered on the preposterous. He felt guilty for this horrific thing that he did, but isn't committing suicide just as horrific? And the manner in which he "offs" himself at the end is EXTREMELY disturbing to watch. Trust me.Don't get me wrong, this movie did have some very poignant moments, but the overall story was just far too morbid and creepy for my taste. (i.e., the final scene when Ezra (Woody Harrelson) "sees" Emily (Rosario Dawson) for the first time since Ben's death, is to me, too creepy and disturbing for words.)In conclusion, this is a movie specifically designed for people who like to indulge in syrupy cinema that is OVERLY evocative, pointlessly disturbing and seriously depressing. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into that movie i didn't think it would be as great as the previous Will Smith movies these past years, like this guy must have a flop or just one ordinary movie along the line.... I was WRONG!! One of the best dramas i've seen lately, you get so immersed in the events, so related to the characters that you can feel their pain and joy as if it's yours... The movie is a bit slow paced, and somewhat predictable but you just love it all the way through till the end... The surprise isn't in the ending because if you got the knack of predicting movie endings or even if you watch a fair share of movies you're gonna know what's gonna happen, the surprise is how intense the impact of this ending -that you might have already predicted- would be, that is the beauty of this movie and that's what makes it so special All that along with stellar performances from Will Smith, Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson, this movie would be remembered for a long time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first looked on IMDb for comments about this movie and was impressed with all the great reviews this movie got. Then I checked the websites that had reviews from "Professional" movie critics and it's like they saw a totally different movie. Is it a different movie if you get paid to review the movie versus having to pay to go watch the movie? Most of the critics trashed the movie whereas the fans, here at least, were raving about it. Myself personally, I very much enjoyed the movie for the storyline and the acting. Yes in my humble opinion, it was Will Smith's best serious acting role to date and as others here have already expressed, deserving of an Oscar nomination. Rosario Dawson, (leading or supporting role?) was also awesome and perfectly complimented Smith in the leading role of Ben Thomas. I liked the fact that the movie didn't just end after the scene in the operating room but went on with the brother explaining to Emily what his brother, "Ben" had done to help so many others besides herself. From Fresh Prince to Ben Thomas...Will Smith has come a long way and it doesn't look like he's going to stop here.</fullReview>

This movie made me want to tell everyone how great it was.Being a Will Smith fan since Fresh Prince, I've been looking forward to this movie with huge expectations since I first saw the trailers. I was actually worried that it wouldn't live up to those, but there wasn't ANY reason to. The movie is amazing and very touching. Great plot, great acting, great everything.I'm a 20 year old guy who hasn't cried in years - not that I'm not emotional, I just don't cry. Anyway, I was pretty much fighting off dry tears through half the movie.I just can't believe how many critics have given this low reviews.

		<shortDescription>Moving "Seven Pounds"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith is awesome in "Seven Pounds". His performance is so bold and emotionally naked. Smith leaves everything on the screen?with nothing left. I believe director Gabriele Muccino's "Seven Pounds" refers to seven pounds of flesh?a reference to Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice". Though this only becomes transparent in retrospect. Writer Grant Nieporte's story is about atonement and redemption. As seen through Smith's Ben, all the characters he helps are great and do their very best. In that sense "Seven Pounds" is amazingly moving and inspiring. Smith is like Diogenes, who searches the world for an honest man or woman. In a heart-felt scene George (solid Bill Smitrovich) asks Ben (Smith) why he is doing this? Ben replies simply, "Because you are a good man?" Nieporte's screenplay speaks eloquently and plainly. At a telling juncture in the story Ben reminds his childhood friend Dan (good Barry Pepper), "Do what you promised me!" Throughout Will Smith is fearless. He openly risks awkward and suffering, and ultimately is so noble and humane. "Seven Pounds" has been harshly sentenced by the critics for its uncompromising plot line, and I think this undercuts the vision of the movie and the amazing performance by Smith. Rosario Dawson is powerful, and deserves a Best Support Actress nod. Dawson breathes authenticity, and inspired light touch. In a whimsical scene with Smith, her Emily in describing herself says, "I was hot?" This is all possible because of Smith's performance."Seven Pounds" begins cryptically with a 911 call. After the first 15 minutes of "Seven Pounds" I figured out what the movie was about when Ben visits Emily Posa (Dawson) in the hospital. So now it becomes: What is Ben (Smith) atoning for? Here Muccino and Nieporte brilliantly weave the present along with glimpses into the past in this moving tale. Smith plays IRS Agent Ben Thomas, who is apparently going way out his away to help some people. We know that Ben has a brother (Michael Ealy), who is worried about him. Doing the movie math, things just don't add up regarding Ben. Ben has several people in his IRS files. Ben befriends blind Ezra (Woody Harrelson), who is a vegetarian working for a meat produce company. Harrelson gives his best performance here. In a touching scene in a diner shy Ezra chats with a pretty waitress. After watching from another booth, Ben quietly says to Ezra, "You should ask her out." The look on Harrelson face says everything.The focus of "Seven Pounds" is Ben's special relationship with Emily Posa (Dawson). Emily has a failing enlarged heart, and is deeply in debt. In a powerful scene, Ben questions Emily why she took her name off the transplant list because she said that her life was so undeserving. Their relationship grows and evolves. There is a heart breaking scene after Ben consoles ailing Emily, then he talks with her Doctor (Gina Hecht). And Smith and Dawson touch our soul, when Emily asks Ben, "What if I live?" The sheer humanity of "Seven Pounds" astounds and moves the soul. Smith's performance creates the space for greatness in the actors around him. That is the context of "Seven Pounds": Good people doing their very best. Woody Harrelson brings his absolute best as Ezra. Rosario is authentic and powerful as Emily. "Seven Pounds" is about atonement for a horrific act, and more touchingly about the act of forgiveness. Will Smith completely amazes in Gabriele Muccino's moving and inspired story of love and forgiveness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama of the Year by far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would be surprised if this movie DIDN'T nab Best Picture. From start to finish it's a mysterious, tear-jerking phenomena about human sacrifice and self-loathing. I'm usually not the kind of guy to cry so hard my face hurts but this film did exactly that. I think my favourite part was the symbolic use of the box jelly-fish. The Chironex fleckeri, the box jellyfish used in the film, is perhaps the most lethal animal in the world and it's poison attacks the skin, heart and central nervous system. It is also considered the most painful and excruciating experience one can go through. And for those of you who did not realise the connection between the title and the plot: a pound of flesh was considered the price you pay if you wronged someone years ago. Will Smith wronged seven people thus him giving away all of himself to seven "good" people. I personally think it should get as many awards as possible. I'm guessing Seven Pounds, Frost/Nixon and Milk will be the main contenders for Best Picture. I really do hope Seven Pounds gets it.10/10!</fullReview>

BUT, if you stick with it, it will AMAZE and SHOCK you! Will Smith's acting is literally top notch as usual. I still say he IS the best actor of the 21st century. Hands down. He really makes the movie a JOY to watch.The other cast were good too, they had their own key roles to play and played them well! The movie takes a few turns here and there and does some mysterious things at the start (in terms of story) BUT, at the end, everything falls into place and soothes your heart.This movie isn't about making money, it's about a mans journey to redemption.It's about Will Smith trying to balance the world in the only way he can. By sacrificing himself.10/10 All the way. Highly recommended for ANY movie lover and also highly recommended for top 10 IMDb EASILY!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike others here - I figured out the movie in the first 10 minutes or so - I knew what he was doing and why - but I stayed anyways, even tho I knew (from the reviews on here) that it was a tear-jerker, chik-flik. But I like Will Smith and the directing and acting on this one, with a few very small exceptions was quite good, which is a rarity in movies nowadays, IMO.I think one of the main reasons this movie worked is that it was not just a pull on the emotions, but it was logical, rational, it made sense from the standpoint of someone with very high intelligence, actually it made much MORE sense from someone who approached life as an engineer than it did from it's premise as an emotional film. I could see myself doing what the main character did - it was right, it was just, and it 'fit' the character and the point the writers and directors were trying to make. Great title too - which I helped me figure it out early - but I ain't telling you :) Go see it. Great acting, great directing, great script. Worth every dime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven Pounds and So Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story lets us view the journey of a man's life and the values he places on the lives of others. As I was watching the first few minutes, I wasn't sure whether I'd like this movie, but because I'm a Will Smith fan, I continued watching with an open mind to see where the story would lead. There were some parts in the beginning where I felt miffed because I had to assume what the writer's and/or director's intent was. But, in turn, I appreciated the fact that a few of my assumptions were completely misguided. The acting from the supporting cast was very decent and Will Smith's portrayal of the lead character is worthy of an Oscar. I enjoy the many diverse roles that he had the opportunity to portray, but when he portrays a dramatic role, his acting ability seems to exude with verve. Though there were a few (and I mean just a few) areas of the movie were just "so-so", I gladly gave it a "10" because it was so much better than a "9". I highly recommend this move to those who want to be filled appreciation that this great story has to offer -- and doesn't mind shedding a few tears in the process.</fullReview>

Smith, of course, it great, and is surrounded by a solid supporting cast, but the direction is too heavy-handed and the script too bumbling to carry the performances very far.like i said, this could have been a great movie with a different director and some major screenplay revisions. but, at the same time, it still is pretty interesting and Smith is great. but for a movie striving to do so much, it achieves little in the end.P.S. Hollywood, please stop putting pop songs as filler in movies. there are much better ways to make a scene interesting and let us know what the characters are thinking besides some crappy, over-sentimental lyrics set to guitar and piano.</fullReview>

Some critics questioned Will Smith's performance as robotic. I, having some firsthand knowledge (being a psychiatrist) would suggest that his portraying a clinical picture of Depression/Grief combination is very poignant and believable. Good picture. Might have been called "Undoing", but then it would be reducing the power of art to the example from the Psychology 101 textbook.By the way - in the list of cast Will Smith is designated as playing "Ben".

		<fullReview>One of the greatest things about this film is that it takes it's time. It was very deliberately paced and I thought that really helped since it tries to keep a secret through most of the film. Not that it's not predictable. There are points in the film when you think 'okay, I know where this is going', 'I know what's going to happen' but I realized that there isn't really anything wrong with knowing where a film is going. In this case the other characters don't, even if you do, so that's what's important.Will Smith does a great job here. It's one of his movies where he actually acts, which he rarely does unfortunately. I also love that he chose this movie in the first place. You don't see superstars in this kind of picture much nowadays. Rosario Dawson is slowly becoming the huge actress I always thought she would. It mainly centers on them, with supporting performances from Woody Harrelson, Bill Smitrovich, and Barry Pepper amongst others.I'm not going to tell spoilers but it's not necessarily the kind of movie Will Smith fans will go for. It's more of an Oscar season movie, something you need tissues for. But it's very well done. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes good cinema, but people looking to be "entertained" may want to look elsewhere. I'd hate to think this movie will get a bad reputation because it was marketed to the wrong people just to get good opening weekend numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional film about redemption and forgiveness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all starts with a suicide. Or is it a car crash? I guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. Director Gabriele Muccino has crafted a film that will leave you feeling exhausted by the end. This is a film about redemption, forgiveness and making sacrifices to help right a wrong. Perhaps I'm too susceptible to films like this but it hit me in all the right ways. If it wasn't for the sheer audacious brilliance of The Dark Knight this year, Seven Pounds would have my vote as best film of the year. This film works because it touches you and it devours you. You can feel the hurt that Will Smith's character is feeling. You can feel his burden. You're not sure what it is that is eating away at him, but slowly the clues let you piece it together. This film is a journey that you go on with Will Smith. You go on it with him to fulfill his quest. It will stay with you long after the credits roll.Seven Pounds had me with it from the beginning. Even though I didn't figure out the entire film until the end, I know some will, but that won't take away from the sheer power of this quest. His secret mission is one of selflessness, redemption and grief.Smith plays Ben Thomas, an IRS agent who has a list of seven names. It becomes clear to us that what he is doing with this list is trying to help them. Some of them with finances, some of them with health related issues. One woman is in an abusive relationship. One is having trouble meeting all her bills due to having something wrong with her heart. Another person he decides to help, by giving bone marrow, is a young boy that he has never even met, just seen from afar. Thomas' quest is not a normal one. And along the way, we are given subtle clues as to what his true purpose is and why he feels compelled to help the people that he is helping. We also meet his best friend from childhood, played by Barry Pepper, (who appeared with Smith in Enemy of the State). Thomas tells him to do as he promised and stay focused. Nothing is going to change his mind and now he is relying on those that he is close to. Nothing can go wrong.The mystery of the film is why it is up to Thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his "gift" is unknown at first, as is why this man, seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beach front home, is now living in a motel, driving a beat-up car, going door to door in order to audit for the IRS. As he says, though, "he kind of stumbled into the job".Smith's quest as Thomas is a long and painful one, tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion. As a man with the means to help, he takes his job seriously, crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree. If this means berating them over the phone or visiting them at their place of business, then he will do so. He will go to great lengths to be sure that those he chooses, deserve to be chosen. The rest of the cast is stellar across the board. Woody Harrelson as the blind salesman is quietly brilliant. He has a shy smile and a quiet way with words. Even when being berated on the phone when Smith is testing him, he shows his lust for life. Elpidia Carrillo (remember her from Predator) as the abused mother, is very effective as the living in fear mother of two. She has to range from tough and abrasive, to fearful and then finally a person overcome with joy and confusion when a complete stranger shows her an indelible and very out of character act of kindness. And Rosario Dawson shines as the "once hot" young woman, beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays, all but given up on living life to find love and happiness. It isn't until Ben comes into her life that she learns she can live again, even in the face of imminent death.Seven Pounds isn't for everyone. It is slow, takes it's time to make its point and the ending might be what some would call "syruppy". To those who feel that way, my response would be that I'm sorry you feel that way. This is an emotional film with a heavy subject and Smith and company pull it off beautifully.9.5/10</fullReview>

The movie flows greatly and is very smooth from scene to glorious scene. Ms. Dawson also brought the goods, she was amazing and I love her conviction.

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that will divide audiences as it relies on you buying into the emotive reasoning behind the story.Will Smith is an IRS investigator who visits various people purporting to be reviewing their financial affairs. It soon becomes clear that this isn't the real reason for his visits and that maybe he is trying to atone in some way for his previous actions.Performances in this movie are first class. Will Smith and Rosanna Dawson are both excellent and the supporting cast, which are used sparingly, include Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper are pitch perfect. The movie's style can be a bit slow at times and is deliberately misleading so as to prevent you from guessing what the eventual outcome from Will Smiths's activities will be. To some this will mean the movie is boring and predictable, to others a joyful and rewarding experience, with a romantic sub-plot that may have some reaching for the Kleenex. Personally I did not guess the eventual twist in the story but there are enough clues laid out for people to realise the ending from early on. It is crucial however that you believe in the main character and the motives for his actions.The movie reminded me of The Fountain in the sense that if you allow yourself to be immersed in the storyline you may be rewarded with a thoroughly enjoyable, interesting, and thought provoking experience. Personally my jury is still out on The Fountain. If you just don't buy it then your feelings will be the exact opposite. Professional reviewers, according to the Rotten Tomatoes statistics, have so far been pretty harsh on the movie, but some of the more notable journalists have really liked it.This movie I suspect will bomb at the box office although I encourage you to see it to make your own mind up. Not Oscar worthy by any means but an interesting take on the need for inner redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging, Well-Executed, but Perverse in Message *** Contains Spoilers ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Seven Pounds" chronicles the actions of Tim "Ben" Thomas, a troubled former aerospace engineer (Will Smith) racked by guilt after the death of seven people in an auto accident for which he blames himself.Through various methods, he gains contact with seven individuals, including Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a cardiac patient who owes thousands of dollars in back taxes, with the aim of 'drastically altering their circumstances'. Ben and Emily end up falling in love, and much of the plot revolves around their courtship.Conversely, while the film places heavy weight on Ben and Emily's romance, little time is spent developing Ben's efforts to "help people", and these remain primarily ancillary items in the context of the overall story.Will Smith and Rosario Dawson have great chemistry. Their courtship is both believable and refreshing, and manages to tug heart strings without straying into chick-flick sappiness, which is quite an accomplishment. The actual kissing scenes were a little flat given the passionate buildup, but could also be plausible in the context of the characters' apprehension about their various deficiencies.The other plot threads involve Ben attempting to help the seven individuals, as well as Ben's family and close friends, which grow increasingly concerned at his behavior. The concern of Ben's family and friends contrasts sharply with, and at times interrupts, Ben and Emily's touching, idyllic romantic arc, and leaves viewers wondering why Ben's family and friends are so concerned.When the "surprise twist" (not that surprising -- I guessed it in the first ten minutes, and normally I don't see these things coming) finally occurs, the only true surprise for me was the message of the film implied by the ending, which I found incredibly perverse on several levels.Revealing the message would also reveal the twist, so I won't mention specifics here, but suffice to say that despite my tolerance for nearly everything that regular people would normally find offensive or morally objectionable, the message of this film still managed to disgust me in a totally new way, and reach moral ground that could be considered questionable, even for Hollywood.To clarify, this isn't the kind of 'perverse' that would embarrass you in front of Grandma, this is just perverse. Some will see things differently, and maybe the reason to see this film is ultimately the moral questions it raises, but I hope people won't take the ending as what's now normal, acceptable behavior in our culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite what the critics are saying I went and saw this film. It was wonderful;however, I don't agree entirely with Ben(Will Smith)'s purpose. This movie is very moving. Lets just say this my husband cried. It is one of those movies that you have to think the whole way through because it doesn't clue you in on what is going on until close to the end. I love those kinds of movies though. It will leave you with some questions but that isn't really a bad thing. Will Smith is great in this movie (even thought it looks like he is about to cry the whole movie). I really loved the interesting ending. It was very original. This movie kind of reminds me of BiGFish. Not the plot really but the way you don't really get the movie until the end. Go SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this a 7/10 because for a tear-jerker, it is very well done. You are left in suspense/confusion for about half the movie while you are trying to figure out just what is going on. The story was engaging and emotionally gripping. This movie made my wife cry hard. Oh course I can't cry because I'm a man. :) Personally, I would never watch this a second time, but I have to admit that the direction was superb, Will Smith did a pretty good job, and Rosario Dawson was really really good. I think it's the first time she's really shown some acting talent. Nothing too deep or profound in this one, but if you want a good cry, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the only movie in 2008 that truly moved me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Thomas, a flawed human being, with gifts to change people's lives, for better or worse, had chosen 7 people to be the recipient of his gifts.He's not a saint, and he's far from perfect. He's not a messiah, he's not playing God, he's not here to teach anyone any lessons. Got over that, then you will stop criticizing this movie, and you will eventually get off your moral high horse and see this movie through the eyes of an ordinary human being, a very flawed one just like rest of us, going through some extraordinary circumstances. Ben Thomas got some hard decisions to make, and he has been struggling. This is where Will Smith truly shines. He has the capacity to go into some really really dark corners, which made some of the audience feel very uncomfortable judging by some of the criticisms here.Here, we witness a process that deal with life's most challenging subject, deep deep in the soul level. Hopefully, by seeing this process, we will be able to reflect upon our own life, our own soul and ask ourselves some really challenging questions as well. Maybe we are lucky enough that we don't ever have to deal with those questions. But if we are, would you expect yourself to make the perfect decisions that is approved by not only God, but also by all moral standards? I guess not.Truth be told, there are no perfect decisions and life is not perfect. It never will be perfect! If you can accept that, then why would you expect Will Smith's Ben Thomas to be perfect? He is just like you and me, trying to find the redeeming value in this harsh reality which we call "LIFE"! There's no ultimate right or wrong decisions, only the ones that make sense to yourself.This movie, through dramatic story telling, let us peer into a slice of life and force us to think about difficult issues concerning life and death by thrusting us into these extraordinary circumstances.It made me think deep and hard, and force me to come to terms that Ben Thomas, though probably one of the most sincere, charming and earnest human being you will ever meet in your life, is also deeply flawed and sad and unfortunately had to deal with some of the most difficult dilemma in life. He is probably just like you and me who is trying to do his best and make most out of what he consider himself to be capable of offering to the world. Under the same circumstances, you may make different decisions. You may very well live your life in a different way. That's exact what life is about, making the decisions that make the most sense to you.Fortunately, through Ben Thomas, I saw human quality shine through, which not only illuminated my inner world, but also makes me treasure life more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Convincing Tale of Redemption and the Love that Drives it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was mesmerizing. I have to say that it was one of the most powerful films I have ever seen, not because it has a particularly unique message, but because it is so heartfelt and genuine. The acting was to say the least superb, Rosario Dawson and Will Smith are so believably damaged. Their chemistry might at first seem forced but I believe that is only because they hold each other at a distance because of her condition and his past. The conclusion of the film makes all of that earlier distancing all the more eerie and impactful. One of the very genuine aspects of this movie is that it isn't a conventionally told redemption story. Smith's path to redemption is a commitment he made to himself to make up for the harm he caused, and what he lost, and he doesn't deviate from what he knows to be the end for himself. One of my friends said to me that there was no character development and that even though he felt the impact of the movie he didn't really see any reason to care about the character Ben Thomas. I thought about this for awhile and realized that there are two types of character development as I see it, and that we are rarely lucky enough as viewers to watch the impact of one of those forms on screen: In most films characters evolve as certain things change their life and force them to change the way they think about the world around them, and sometimes this type of development leads to some sort of epiphany or realization on the part of a secondary character that a change has occurred within the main character. In Seven Pounds we are blessed with the gift of seeing a character fully developed and on a mission, and only waver for an instant as his path for redemption brings him to another place he might finally be able to take solace, in a new found love. I truly believe that the most powerful way you can develop a character is to show the audience instead of telling them what he/she stands for in their actions. The brief hesitation Ben Thomas experiences with Emily Posa when they spend the night together makes this story all the more powerful because the audience is heartbroken by the realization that this broken man truly deserves another chance at a normal life, and that this woman is his only chance at that. It is ultimately this fact that makes the conclusion almost unbearably sad as Ben opts to take his original path and sacrifice himself for Emily. He dies so that she might live, just as his wife died so that he might. The circular motion of events and the limited time frame in which Ben has to accomplish what he needs to forced me to consider whether or not he ever had a chance to be with Emily at all, or if he was just living on borrowed time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. Will Smith looks constipated the whole movie. I guess this is supposed to show his pain. 2. Nothing is revealed until the end, which would work with a better script but in this case it's just annoying. 3. Because nothing is revealed until late, there is nothing to relate to in the story. 4. So much of what is hinted at makes no sense at the time, only at the end. Therefore, it's all wasted footage. 5. Not enough back story-it's almost like the director knew everything and assumed we did too. 6. The material left out until the last few scenes could easily have been include earlier, such as the issues with the brother, the reason why Holly will do anything for him, and the bone marrow transplant. 5. Killer jellyfish? Give me a break!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most maudlin and depressing films of the year (This comment has SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(I'm going to discus the "twist" so if you don't want to know skip this and move on) Will Smith gives an excellent performance in one of the most maudlin and WTF unnerving movies of the year.The film begins with Smith calling 911 and asking for an ambulance because some one has committed suicide. When the operator asks who it is, Smith says its himself. The movie then flashes back in a disjointed manner to tell the story of what happened to put him in the hotel bath tub filled with ice. The long and the short of it is that sometime before Smith had caused an accident while texting and driving that killed seven people. In order to make up for it Smith has decided to find seven deserving people and give them his organs.Yes this is a happy movie that makes you wonder what was Hollywood thinking. To be honest I'm not opposed to the basic plot line being used, I'm more opposed to the way the story is told. They jumble the story to keep the fact that Smith dies a "secret". They then show Smith as he tries to pick the people he will help and deals with his guilt-which isn't fully revealed until his final moments. Its bravo for Smith as its clear he's got great acting chops. As for the director and writer I have to ask what were you thinking? You've created a film that is almost completely depressing and terribly illogical. If nothing else why would anyone put up with the bullying and brow beating that Smith directs toward some people. I'd have told both him and his horse where to go. What really bothers me is that because of how the film is constructed the air of death hangs over the entire film. Its another sub genre of the death porn franchise. Weee!I could go on (I never mentioned the clichés yet) but I won't. Needless to say this is not a favorite film for me. I'm sure this is destined for Hollywood infamy as a film of some (ill)repute. (Hey as they say the best camp films are the ones that aren't made intentionally campy but end up playing that way.)Between three and four out of ten because of Will Smith's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must see. Unexpected story line. One of the best I've seen of all Will Smith's movies. Slow, but you have to be patient as the story doesn't scream, it whispers. "Seven Pounds" reminds of our own humanity and sends a thoughtful message. It will depend on your outlook as to whether this is an emotionally powerful film or sappy and manipulative. It is a long movie though. It clocks in at two hours and the whole point of the film is the mystery, the reveal and the denouement. The thing is if you have half a brain you'll figure out the "what he's doing" part of the mystery VERY early on - and from there it will seem like it's being dragged out for who the director must assume are the less bright members of the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7 pounds of sleeping aid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to start this off with, I wanted so badly to love this movie. Repeat, LOVE this movie. Sadly it left me feeling as unsatisfied as a frozen jellyfish in a cheap hotel bathtub. Will Smith the normally stellar actor appeared to be sleepwalking thru this entire role, or maybe they were trying to make this character the most bland thing in the universe. But either ways I was left with the feeling of melancholy thru the entire film. Not caring about the main characters, the supporting cast or even the person sitting next to me in the theater. The film felt quite a bit overbearing and over sentimental but if I could say it, in a Narcoleptic inducing way. Which brings me to the supporting cast. Rosario was the only bright shiny star of this whole movie. She played her meek, stare death in the face character with perfect clarity. Humble and full of life and a (sorry about this) Heart of gold. On the other hand Woody, Woody, Woody, Woody. odd role felt goofy and didn't quite feel right at all. Hard to say anything more than it was passable and for this level of a film passable just doesn't cut it. So over all, for a movie that I wanted and so dearly needed to love, I was left standing waiting for my car with a slight pang of regret and no need of any sleeping aids for the night to come. Mediocrity at it's finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a special screening of this movie last night and walked away disappointed. Since other comments have already fleshed out the plot, I'll just point out the good and the bad: Good: The premise of the story was intriguing; although redemption of guilt has been handled before, I don't remember ever seeing it portrayed quite so literally (eye for an eye, a pound of flesh, etc.). The way the story started out was also engrossing and drew you in, wanting to know more about what this man was all about, what he was trying to achieve, and why he was trying to achieve it in what at first seems like a cruel and heartless fashion. It certainly kept my interest for the first third of the movie.Rosario Dawson's performance was very good. Her character was neither self-pitying nor weak. She came across as a strong woman who's afraid of dying, but not afraid of taking chances.Woody Harrelson also did some justice to his character, although not on-screen for very long. In the scene when you first see Ezra on the phone at his job being insulted by Ben Thomas, his portrayal of different feelings that float across his face is compelling, nuanced, and genuine.Ben's brother has a worthy scene of confrontation which is intriguing and engaging.Cinematography was OK, not really all that creative; striking visual moments include Ben getting into the tub and a car accident.Bad: Will Smith portrays a one-note character. There is no depth to Ben Thomas beyond guilt. I suppose the expression on his face is best described as "haunted" but it's an expression that seems very practiced and EXTREMELY overused. You never really get a glimpse of any other dimension to this man except guilt and the pain of expiation of that guilt.The movie is S-L-O-W. I like dramas, and I am absolutely not afraid of heavy dialogue, but there were a lot of close-ups and focus on extended unnecessary silences and tortured expressions. I'm not exceptionally empathic, but even I can take the hint that someone is hurting after about what seems like a ten-second close-up of tears running down their face.The worst part is that the plot is so straightforward and free of any kind of human complexity that someone moderately observant can figure out how the entire REST OF THE MOVIE will be played out within the first THIRTY MINUTES. All the clues are given to you up front: the 911 call is shown first thing, so you know how the movie ENDS; the accident scene is shown shortly thereafter, so you know the MOTIVE behind Ben's actions; the commonalities behind all the strangers that Ben contacts tells you within the first three people WHAT he intends to do; the scene with Ben, his brother, and his father in front of the aquarium is out of place with the rest of the story as we know it, so you now know HOW Ben is going to take his final action, etc., etc. So basically, after you've figured out how the rest of the movie is going to proceed, almost step by step, you're then left waiting it out with your hands in your lap.The director has taken any and all steps possible to contrive situations that will tug at the heartstrings, but even as I was feeling moved, I resented being manipulated to feel moved by these situations that didn't ring true - the late night phone call from Emily to Ben, for example, or the coaxing of the truth from an elderly nursing home patient were prominent examples of dialogue and situations that rang so untrue that I for one felt played.So all in all, not a terrible movie: the concept itself was intriguing, but could have been handled in an hour, easily, and could have used a lot more depth and back story into each character's life. If I were to recommend it, I'd say wait until it comes out on DVD and then check it out of your local library for FREE. THAT's a noble cause...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a bad movie, but I found its pace so slow that I actually dozed off at one point. I consider myself a relatively intelligent movie-goer, and am generally as likely to watch the latest art-house film as I am the current blockbuster, but this film just seemed to crawl. As others have noted, the "twist" isn't really much of a twist, as it becomes pretty obvious what Will's character is doing very early on. Frankly, I think that was intended. If they really wanted you to wonder what Mr. Smith was up to, one particular scene at the beginning of the movie could have been left out. Morally, some will disagree with what they perceive to be the "message," but I don't think the movie was trying to make a statement at all. It was simply portraying the mindset of this one particular character based upon events in his past. As always, Will Smith was quite watchable, as was the supporting cast, but, while some tears did flow at the end, I found myself bored much of the time while watching this. And there is one particular scene toward the end where the music features a piano purposely being played out of tune. I found myself getting quite annoyed by that, to the point where I felt like screaming "enough already - we get the point." Perhaps that sums up my general feeling about this movie - "we get the point, now move on to something else."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well first off I can't believe how awesome this movie was; by the end i was crying. second i have to disagree with people who say this movie is glorifying suicide as a means of dealing with guilt. Ben/Tim (will smith) was guilty such as are many people who have dealt with his situation but ultimately he wanted forgiveness and thats where the movie comes in. Then in the end i almost thought that he wasn't going to go through with it because he and Emily were talking about what if and he was mentioning a future with her and then he she drifts to sleep and he hears her irregular heartbeat. thats when he kills himself to give her a heart. so its not all about suicide, its about kindness and forgiveness</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of Will Smith, but he truly deserves recognition on a job well done.Smith places any doubt about his acting prowess to rest in the opening sequence of this movie. His character is intense and powerful, and he plays it up well. Much like "Pursuit of Happiness", Smith manages to truly tap into the human emotion and really turn on the waterworks.Also a nod towards Rosario Dawson - this is probably the second time they've worked together? The first time in Men in Black II, if I'm not mistaken. She plays her role especially well here too, and it's clear that she's grown as an actress.Frankly all the actors are great. Everything about this movie is great. Maybe not a film classic, but definitely something worth watching.</fullReview>

For Readers - if you are looking for a serious movie with unexpected ending - go for this one..The plot opens up at the end when everything starts fitting nicely and your mouth opens up in wonder that even such a thing can really happen. An MIT grad, unhappy heart, guilt feeling emotions, and a conscious personality - all things performed very well by Will Smith.I think the role of Emily Poza could have been performed better. and perhaps they could have a chosen prettier girl.. it could have enabled people liking the girl's role more.. Anyways, the movie still keeps rocking.I fail to understand why is Ben so conscious of his happiness.. whyy didn't he want to start another life..Anyways.. a very good movie..

Everything was put together so perfectly and it will probably leave you guessing until the end. The story behind this is very heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. I would definitely recommend you all go watch this movie because it will really open up your eyes and your heart.I heard there were many negative reviews on this movie. Reason being, people thought that what Will Smith's character did was wrong, and some believe the story is just too devastating. I completely disagree because this movie is about a man who is trying to redeem himself and change other peoples lives forever. It is amazing what this man does in this movie and it will really touch your heart if you are open minded. Go see this movie asap it is absolutely amazing and you will never forget this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great concept for a film, but could have been done a lot better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great concept for a film, but could have been done a lot better. The viewer cannot identify with will smith's character until the end, so during the whole film the viewer is left sitting there confused as to why Will always looks like he's about to cry. Only one of the seven characters were really developed, and instead of doing it that way filmmakers could have brought out two or three characters to mix it up. The two conflicts between Will and his brother and Will and his friend should have been developed more as well. This could have brought out some interesting thoughts on self-sacrifice, the selfishness of not wanting to lose a friend, and a test of the limits of friendships (just how far would you go to meet a friend's wishes?). The driving force of this movie was the relationship between Will and Rosario Dawson, and that wasn't enough to keep it interesting. A great concept, but poor execution leaves the viewer uninterested. I found myself mostly interested because the director made it so the movie doesn't come together until the very end. The scenes I liked, I really liked; particularly the bathtub scene. This film had the pace of a Shymalahan film (slow), and the story was strong enough to do it this way; but the wrong parts of the story were developed -- leaving it as one of those movies that you remember merely due to a scene or an idea rather than as a whole project. I like all of the actors in this movie a LOT, but that alone isn't enough to make the film worth seeing. I would recommend watching it if you have nothing better to do; but if not, this film can definitely be missed. It's a shame though, I already wish that they would remake it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i watched this movie i was ready to be moved, and i wasn't. I was waiting the whole time for the movie to get better, and it didn't. Half way through the movie i was wondering where did the rest of the cast go? Why did they not show there story? I wanted to know there story. How did he find all those people, why these people? they only touched a little on this subject and to me that is a large potion of the story, something i was waiting for and it never really came.I love drama movies always been my favorite, and i think Will Smith is a amazing actor and if it wasn't for him i would have given this movie a lower rating. lets just say the screenplay was weak it was missing something. I would recommend to watch this movie just so you can form your own opinion i just wanted to tell mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, forgettable movie with lousy music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is a familiar plot: man seeks redemption for past deeds and its been done over and over again and a whole lot better than Seven Pounds. This movie is slow and boring with awful writing and a terrible music score. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Will Smith was too thin and too detached and too whiny for me. Rosario Dawson was good as was Woody Harrelson but their characters were cardboard cutouts at best. I wish they had spent more time on the life of Will Smith's character leading up to his tragedy then the movie might have been more interesting ie a transformational movie. Also that might have given us more information about his brother who was or could have been an interesting character. But alas all we get is forced sentimentality and an ending that's been done before. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Columbia Pictures and Relativity Media's clunky, overrated depiction of a guilty manslaughterer's struggle to compensate for his monstrous mistake is without a doubt skilfully written by Grant Nieporte. It's a real a shame that such a moving script was given to the less sure-footed Gabriele Muccino to direct the film from. Though of most of the other collaborators were quite clueless as well, he was still the only one with the power to put things back on track.The bountiful peace and joy in the life of respected IRS agent Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is instantly shattered after a horrific road accident of which he was responsible for death of seven innocent people. Among the victims was his darling wife, perhaps the only person on Earth who could have eased the terrible pain felt after such an ordeal. Devastated by what he had done and feeling his extraordinary survival is undeserved since the seven other lives were destroyed, he decides to devote the rest of the life he has fortunately kept to serve others (mostly by donating organs to hospital patients in dire need of them.) This is the basis of a disorientated twisting and turning story that for the most part doesn't appear to be heading in any direction whatsoever, but is nonetheless splendidly interesting.One of the major letdowns is Will Smith's one-dimensional take on the seriously troubled central character. Ben Thomas is in virtually every scene, so a lot of the film's success is heavily reliant on Smith's performance. But the popular forty-year-old superstar quite frankly doesn't seem to realise the enormous responsibility rested upon his shoulders and plays the part as though he has the safety of several other lead actors around him to keep it together if he should ever fall short, when really he is quite alone. On a more positive note, the strong supporting cast includes some fabulous cameos, but the miniscule amount of screen time put aside for them doesn't allow them to provide the enormous quantity of "support" that is needed to lift the film out of the dark. Though this is of course with the exception of the extraordinary Rosario Dawson as Ben's brave and beautiful girlfriend Emily. With her captivating interpretation of a woman diagnosed with a life-threatening heart disorder she easily steals the show from struggling Will and this indeed puts things a little out of whack as the audience begins to wish with all their heart that they were watching a film about her ? a genuine human that we feel such empathy for ? instead of one about a cold, rough, tyrannical alien. But just as dear Emily keeps on going even though ? for her ? death may very well be just around the corner, let us soldier on with her until the final scene however dismal or monotonous things might get along the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally a movie that justifies killing yourself! What a wonderful sentiment that instead of overcoming guilt and anguish, we now can feel good about committing suicide as long as it is done in a sacrificial manner.And I'm not even talking about the acting, I don't even think that these people know how to act badly. It's simply not possible with the likes of Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, and Woody Harrelson. These people do their jobs really quite well, and I haven't a bad thing to say about them.This movie however, has got to be the worst message Hollywood has put out in a long time.Sure we are used to the justification of almost every a-moral act that you can conceive of, but up until now I don't believe that suicide had made it yet.Which is not to say that this is on the same level as say euthanasia of a terminally ill, suffering patient who is being kept alive by a computer operated box.This is simply a tale of a man who royally screwed up (which is a nice way of saying it), and just can't seem to cope. So tortured is his soul that the only way that he can seem to make himself feel better is by not making himself feel anything at all.But of course there is to moral aspect of offing oneself. Certainly to kill yourself would be a grievous sin, which is not saying that there is any real type of church rhetoric present in this film, certainly not at all. Never the less, you don't need a church to tell you that ending your own life as common sense is normally enough to dictate that.So in order to make yourself feel just a little bit better about your decision, you decide that maybe by your planned untimely death you can in fact help someone.Naturally what better way to justify such a selfish act by doing it as selflessly as possible? And what better selfless act can you think of other then giving your organs away to people who really deserve them? I myself would think that if you were so intent at working to absolve your sins that you wouldn't stop at 7, but instead spent a lifetime touching as many people as possible. Obsessing over why you are doing what it is that you are doing.But nay, that is not found here.Instead the answer lies in what so many gullible and stupid people fall for everyday. That redemption is little more then a get rich quick scheme. Like the commercials that promise us riches with out any work, this movie preaches salvation in suicide.The other thing that makes this film so out of touch with reality is the complete selfishness of the people whom Will Smith touches. Sure, go ahead, kill yourself, I will be more then happy to harvest your body.How anyone could live with themselves knowing what their "gift" cost is beyond me.Of course, you could argue the "Messiah" complex argument, that in fact Mr. Smith was essentially a Messianic Character who made the ultimate sacrifice for his people so to speak, but you could do that with any film or story in existence. That doesn't justify the action.In conclusion you should really only watch this film if you in fact are planning to kill yourself. I can't think of a better film to put you in the mood or mindset that would make you feel better about it.............and be sure not to text while you are driving...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is this is a putridly cloying, saccharine, manipulative piece of weepy drivel (and I like a good heartwarming feel-good movie, but this isn't a good one), not only is the direction an unmotivated and incompetent mixture of slick, locked-down to the point of sterility and hand-held cinema verite, not only is Roasario Dawson in it, but the film actually presents suicide as a viable, and even possibly noble solution to certain problems.Will Smith has never been as bland as he is here, and the performances are uniformly shallow. Because I enjoyed the flawed but effective "The Prusuit of Happiness", form the same director and star, I tried desperately up until the end of this film, to like it. But it's boneheaded attempt to present masochistic self-destruction as an idealistic redemption is not only moronic, not only twisted and sick, it's genuinely dangerous. This "inspiring movie" has infinitely more potential to do harm than any ten nudie flicks or slasher movies combined. It is one of the worst, most shameful pieces of garbage Hollywood has ever had the disgrace of producing, and the world is a lesser place because it exists.And I'm being nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Acting...very depressing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't spoil the plot but we wanted to see this and looked like a "feel good" movie so we went to see for Christmas today. Heard it was like a "Pay it forward" idea and with a "tragic" spin, I would mildly agree.The acting was fantastic (always with Will Smith) and yet it was the story line itself that started off slow. Slow enough that I considered leaving in the first 15 minutes. It's Will Smith so we endured... assuming character development was going to occur and it did, eventually.I was lost a good 30 minutes in, frustrated as I still had no clue how to piece it together, and it was simply becoming depressing/dark. Since it was the director of Pursuit of Happiness, we figured it would turn around at some point and we walked down this sad path to see the redemptive quality of a "comedy" vs. "tragedy" plot line.If you've read/heard the story line, you will understand...otherwise, all I can give is that we walked out feeling depressed seeing the lack of hope, defeat, no will to overcome, with massive guilt destroying a person and an interesting twist with a "how to commit suicide" without being completely selfish. He tried to be a savior but ended up sacrificing what was truly important, himself.If you go to see this with a "Romeo &amp; Juliet" mindset...this will not be a disappointment to you. It is a very sad and tragic story with a a few people receiving a gift from such despair. Sorry, we are Will Smith fans but we don't recommend it at all, especially to those who are dealing with depression, loss of loved ones, suicidal, or just want to see a happy movie. Thanks for reading and hope this helps in advance.</fullReview>

Will Smith once again tries WAY too hard for an Oscar nomination and in doing so simply creates an uninteresting and annoying character. He seems to fail to realise that this is not the silent film era anymore and simply pulling a sad depressed face is not enough to get critical acclaim in this day and age. Rosario Dawson, funnily enough, puts in a great performance and Smith's blandness simply adds to her characters appeal, making her look rather good. The plot needs to be concentrated on and still makes no sense and nothing seems to happen. By the end of the film i was thinking both "that was painful" and "is that it?" If you've seen Pursuit of Happiness then there is no need to waste your precious time with this Smith mobile. Waste of money!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>F-. The idea of a guy giving away his organs to strangers to punish himself is morbid, sickening, absurd, sado-masochistic and the flat out worst premise I've ever seen in a movie. Including Roger Coreman's. The idea that a guy would fall in love with and sleep with the girl he's giving his heart to is actually immoral, and no sane human being has ever thought to or will think to do this. And the idea that you can commit manslaughter seven times over and not spend a day of your life in jail or even on trial is the worst misrepresentation of any legal system that has ever existed throughout human history.I hate this movie more with each passing second. Everything about it from the directing, music, acting, producing, etc. Final reason it should be stabbed with a stake for eternity: the idea that the will to live - the strongest human instinct, could be subverted through a desire to punish oneself while a sense of purpose (and a benevolent one at that) still exists is insanely ridiculous. It bears repeating: F-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been induced to be an IMDb comment but this movie is so terrible that it motivated me to sign and vent a little at how bad this movie is. At the same time I always say a person should see it and judge for themselves. For my part I think it of the most poorly thought through films you could spend your time on.I think its an idiotic premise, terribly executed. At one point I argued that the best actor in the movie was the Great Dane, because at least he knows how to be a dog. To be fair, Rosario Dawson seems to have done well with the crap script she got handed - I found her to be quite adorable and played being sick really well.Will Smiths character is all wrong. His people should have advised him against this whole thing. He showed himself to be a poor actor, I felt like I was watching ALI at times and Will puts on the worst faces.The story is pretty broken too. Seven people die because of Tim's negligent driving. If you kill seven people the way he did, don't you go to jail for manslaughter and for a long time? At the end Tim kills himself with a jellyfish; now not to be too particular but I HAD to look it up, you see I found out from an Australian Website that the primary cause of death in people stung by BoxJellyfish is understood to be cardiovascular collapse. The heart he apparently gives away would have been unusable.Generally, poor story, terrible message, awful acting. Watch this on DVD if you must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film critic, writer, enthusiast, what have you, I always find it somewhat tricky to write about a film that goes through such painstaking measures in its marketing campaign to keep its plot ambiguous. I can never figure out how to talk about the film while somehow not really talking about the film at all. This is because I hate giving things away and apparently, so does director, Gabriele Muccino. For the first half of the Italian director's latest Hollywood offering, SEVEN POUNDS, he drags his heels in the dirt, desperately concealing the plot in some failed attempt at being unconventional. For audiences who have been teased long enough with the trailer, being taunted once they've already paid for the answers will not go over well. There is a difference between natural intrigue and playing dramatic mind games with the viewer, intentional or not. When it comes to secrets, the important ones are kept without anyone knowing they even exist. Muccino almost seems to be having too much twisted fun dangling this seven pound carrot in my face. And by the time he gives you a bite, you're not hungry anymore.After successfully pairing with star, Will Smith, two years ago with THE PURSUIT OF Happiness, Muccino goes for a second round. Muccino works very well with Smith, pulling hard, internal emotions out of one of the most accessible stars in Hollywood history. Smith knows this and it was no surprise to hear they were reteaming. It would seem that Smith makes most of his film decisions these days by choosing characters that are challenging and complicated. I commend him for this and think that, for the most part, he is successful in his evndeavors. However, Smith cannot completely control how his performance ends up shaping the films he is in. In SEVEN POUNDS, Smith gives a range of emotions ? from angry and bitter to gracious and generous. He is always convincing but Muccino takes Smith's performance and breaks it into so many non-sequential pieces that the energy needed to piece them all together leaves no energy left over to appreciate the whole.SEVEN POUNDS does have one saving grace though and her name is Rosario Dawson. Dawson plays Emily Posa, a young woman with a heart condition and very little time left to live. She also owes an obscene amount of money to the American government. In steps Smith as Ben Thomas, an I.R.S. representative who seems more concerned with Emily's health issues than her back taxes. Inexplicably, they begin to spend significant time with each other. By the time this happens in the film, you can pretty much figure out what all the fuss is about but their interaction is so intriguing that it becomes a very welcome distraction. Their time together is oddly intriguing. They are drawn to each other and have a surprisingly simple ability to make each other laugh but you can tell that they are both dealing with very heavy struggles that limit their possibilities, both individually and together. It is a testament to healing capacity of the ever elusive emotion known as love.The fragile love shared between Smith and Dawson proves ultimately to be another disappointing element of SEVEN POUNDS. It is so endearing that you wish the film had spent more of its focus there. Instead, it tries to play with you right up until the very end. If I am to be toyed with for such an extended period of time, I expect a pretty big payoff when I get what I'm due. Only the big reveal in SEVEN POUNDS serves solely to expose how conventional it truly is and how it wants to be heavy but is essentially as light as its namesake.</fullReview>

At this rate, I am not sure I want to watch any more of his movies. Please, someone tell him we are tired of seeing him so depressed. This movie was not in any way enjoyable for me. It was extremely depressing. Icertainly hope it does not encourage people with mental health problems to go out and commit suicide! It certainly has that potential.I realize that I am just one person, and that many people will disagree with me, but this is not the sort of movies the world needs right now. So Will, if you are reading this comment, please stop making these depressing movies. As an actor, I think Will Smith has some great potential, but feel it is lost on these types of movies. I certainly hope that his personal life is a lot happier, or this could all end very badly for him and his family. Sorry, just being honest.</fullReview>

Holly Apelgren who was going to die anyways and just so happens to have the right rare blood type gives her organs away instead of the healthy Will Smith. She can save all the same people including Rosario Dawson. Now Will Smith and Rosario Dawson live happily ever after and Will Smith has seven children.What should of happened is he got together with Rosario Dawson and they have seven children and that makes up for the car crash. Instead this movie advocates pointless suicide. If you ever kill seven people in a car crash, have seven children to make up for it. Don't kill yourself.

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. One of the great things about seeing as many movies as I do is getting to hear about and read the multitude of opinions. Sometimes, as with this film, I am shocked at the difference between what I saw and what others did. Currently at a 7.5 IMDb rating, I struggled to get to a 5. I found the film pretentious, boring and predictable.Will Smith and director Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happiness) have joined forces again in an attempt to yank on our emotional heartstrings. There is, however, a big difference between a true story of persistence and a hokey, bleak fairy tale with poor execution. Trying to capture some of the mystique that M Night Shymalayan enjoys, the filmmakers encouraged critics to not give away the "twists". After seeing the film, I am perplexed as to what secret to keep. After 5 minutes, there was no doubt in my mind where this was heading.Mega star Will Smith can deliver the box office, so I am sure this will make money. Despite the efforts of Rosario Dawson and Woody Harrelson, and the circus trick of casting Conner Cruise (with no lines), this one is altogether empty and without soul. Not an easy thing to be with references to the great Minnie Ripperton and Herman's Hermits.</fullReview>

Unfortunately it was one of the worst films I've ever seen -- on par with the slow and schmaltzy Random Hearts which we walked out of. Although it is well acted, Seven Pounds is -extremely- slow, has a painfully obvious story with few plot points that is stretched out over two hours and has an overdose of syrup.The trailer also badly misrepresents it. It looks like it will be some sort of supernatural film with a lead character who has the power to heal a limited number of worthy people or something, but it's not that at all -- without giving too much away, it's basically a soppy love story.I'm sure we weren't alone in this view of the film -- many of the people in the cinema were talking during the film -- a sure sign that it wasn't holding their attention.My advice: give it a miss, or see it on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Pounds is by far the worst film of the year. Yes, technically films like Don't Mess With The Zohan, Love Guru, and The Happening are worse, but those weren't supposed to be good. This film is horrible. To all the people who said that "the film made you cry" then you are easy to manipulate. This film tried way too hard to manipulate emotion, instead of earning any emotion. Films like that sometimes at least do get too my emotions, like I Am Sam which is a bad movie but it does make me a little emotional. This film couldn't even do that. It's very rare to see a film that tries to manipulate emotions and doesn't make you feel a single bit of sadness, but this film did it because it was so damn idiotic and unoriginal. The Script is a ridiculously stupid mesh of hundreds of other good and bad scripts like 21 Grams &amp; John Q. The script writer had only written for t.v. shows like 8 simple rules and Sabrina The Teenage witch before this film and it shows. He tried to be like a whole bunch of other movies, instead of having an original voice. The Film is an exercise in Meandering. It's 2 hours long and feels like 3 1/2 hours. The opprotunities for the film to have original dialogue is never used. Like the dinner scene with Dawson and Smith is so corny, unrealistic, and stupid. The whole film is episodic and doesn't make involve any common sense or sense of reality. Will Smith is horrible and looks like an idiot. The only redeeming quality of the film is that Rosario Dawson is pretty good, as usual, and they do things to her to make her a kind of suburban dull person, but it makes her just stupid. These characters are not interesting at all, but the writer tries to make them interesting. Every one in the film is said to be smart, but there is no evidence of that in the dialogue or actions of the characters, other than words saying what they were and are.Look, I'm not a Will Smith hater, in fact, I like him a lot. He is great in action/comedy films and was really good in Pursuit of happiness, not great, but very good. He sucked as Ali, but that wasn't necessarily his fault. That was also a bad script and exercise in meandering and coldness, to add the fact that no one could play Ali. Horrible film and it's too bad for Smith, who really had a bad year with a very bad Hitchcock and this piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't peruse this movie comment if you really want to enjoy this movie. I thought "Seven Pounds" was the most lamentable that I have seen in a long time. I can forgive Will Smith for "Wild Wild West" and "I Am Legend," but "Seven Pounds" tips the scales at being terrible! "Seven Pounds" is his absolute rock bottom bad movie. If you're reading this, then it's your own fault.Will Smith should go on an extraordinary journey of redemption by refunding my ticket. This glossy soap operatic tearjerker of a fantasy is absolutely abysmal! Mind you, Smith gives a terrific performance and right up to the final quarter hour "Seven Pounds" (which presumably is the weight of everything that he donates to the strangers) is ten star masterpiece, until we learn what prompted his decision to "forever change the lives of seven strangers." Again, refrain from reading any farther if you want to see this maudlin melodrama.It seems that he was tooling along in his sports car and admiring his wife's new ring when he received a text message on his cell phone. The instant in time that it took him to glance at his text message led to a two car crash that claimed the lives of six other people, including his lovely wife. The filmmakers withhold this important information until the last minute. What could have been a beautiful, heart-warming movie about a selfless individual that gives his body parts and his home away to seven deserving folks turns into a disaster.The message of "Seven Pounds" is don't text message or read a text message while you are driving on a two-way highway without a median. Florists out there will appreciate the message that banana peels are good for plants. The movie boasts first-rate everything, except for that terrible moment when we learn about the text message. How can you sympathize with somebody who destroys lives because he felt compelled to read his text message. Had they deleted that moment "Seven Pounds" would have been a classic.As it is, "Seven Pounds" is too heavy-handed to handle. You have been warned. I'd have broke out my copy of the execrable "Wild Wild West" and watched it again with gratitude and glee had I known how reprehensible "Seven Pounds" would be. It couldn't have been worse had our hero been walking his dog without a leash and the animal blundered into traffic and created a 40 car pile-up because nobody wanted to hit the dumb dog and forty or more people died as a result of missing the dog and colliding with each other. On the other hand, if you can tolerate the stupid text message gimmick, you'll probably adore this shameless exercise in nice guy nonsense.Now, I wonder how many people will try to commit suicide in a motel by buying a poisonous jelly fish? Movies don't make people do things. Stupid people who go see movies about stupid things do stupid things!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SEVEN POUNDS (2008) *1/2 Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, Michael Ealy, Barry Pepper, Elpidia Carrillo, Bill Smitrovich. Nearly incomprehensible melodramatic vehicle with Smith as a do-gooding IRS agent whose unspeakable goals make the process maddening to the point of complete frustration in trying to figure out the character's intenions, and when the reason is finally given, makes it only more exhausting for its over-acted, underwhelming misplaced heart warming attempts. Dawson's chronically ill love interest undermines the six other strangers Smith forces himself upon is the least of this film's problems; to wit: a jellyfish! 'Nuff said.

		<fullReview>This is an interesting movie and struck close to home for me. Perhaps I can't be unbiased because of that. I strongly suggest you talk to a friend of yours who has seen this to tell you whether you should see it or not. If he tells you not to - trust him.The movie was well acted but I would not consider it a movie of redemption. It may be very disturbing for some people as well. Again, ask a friend.I wish I had.Personally, I thought this was more intellectual than realistic - somewhat M. Night Shyamalan y if you get what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say. This film dragged and was boring. Will Smith hasn't done a decent movie since I Robot. OK I didn't watch the one where his dog died, as someone told me the dog died and I just didn't fancy it. Please Will, smile , have some fun - be your usual chatty fun self. And to fall in love with a woman, or let her fall in love with you - oops spoilers, OK say no more. I don't know if he's got himself in to a contract with some depressive. Please just take some happy pills and make a good film I almost walked out I was so bored. Yuk Well, actually this had more than ten lines before someone squashed them all up together and made them into 4 lines. so Still Yuk This kind of piffle does not make me cry, it just irritates me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie, and what's was wrong w/ Will Smith's face?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the worst movie I have ever seen; GI Jane was a better movie than this. Will Smith's character was not the least bit likable. How could anyone believe that Rosario, or the dog would really like a depressed, boring, creepy, squint eyed IRS agent. What was that stupid expression he had throughout the movie? Was that his lame attempt to pull off tired and depressed. His look throughout the movie was equal to having a light shined in your face. How hard is that to pull off? I normally like Will Smith, but this movie made me realize how annoying he is. Anyone who thought this movie was good probably thinks Keanu Reeves should have received an Oscar for Bill &amp; Ted. This movie is going to ruin his career. This movie sucked! Will Smith is a horrible actor and is doing a disservice to his children's acting careers for putting them in the same movies as him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poor, 2 hours of film for 20 minutes of plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so Im 16, But this was the worst film I have seen in a long time. I can't understand why people are giving it 10*.The film really doesn't lead you into the plot whatsoever. I would say that the trailer gives away more detail than 1 hour 40 of the film. OK so there are the occasional feel-good moments about it. (The use of Muse's-Feeling Good) was probably the highlight for me, But it just doesn't go anywhere until the last 20 Min's.Also take into account the many errors, i.e The box jellyfish that affects the HEART. That he is donating! and the eye transplant that isn't actually possible. It just doesn't make any sense.So then there's the acting, Will Smiths performance is nothing compared his previous works, There is too little script for him. and most the time you really cannot understand how he is feeling. Rosario Dawsons on the other hand is excellent for such little script she did really well.If you really want to see it, wait for it to come out on DVD. At least then you'll save yourself 3 POUNDS.</fullReview>

How could anyone be taken in by this self-important rubbish? Still less puzzled? God help us! Hilariously, the distributors asked the press not to release the ending to the public. "ooohhh! it must be something really big and important!" Actually, movie reviewers, no need to release the ending, they'll figure it out easily enough anyway! Because it's perfectly transparent to anyone who isn't brain dead!!! It is a sad reflection on the Hollywood industry and its mindless domestic audience that crap like this gets taken seriously. "oh golly, what could all this strange, mysterious stuff mean? It's so confusing? Jelly fish, blind meat salesmen, IRS..? Gosh, it must be so deep and profound.

		<shortDescription>Very Much a One-Note Feel Good Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got a chance to see the screening as well. I liked it, but didn't love it (even though I really wanted to).1. Will Smith's performance was great, but not enough to overcome a weaker than expected script. It's a rare case when I don't fault him for basically conveying a one-note character. Aside from the incredible pain Ben carries, I don't think we really know much else about him. Nonetheless, solid performance by Will, but I'm not certain it's quite Oscar-worthy that many have implied.2. Very weak script. Really hinges on the "secret" factor that many in the audience figured out about 25 min into the film. Unfortunately, once you figure out the secret, rest of the film moves VERY SLOWLY. The "ah-hah!" type films are very difficult to pull off because it is really uni-dimensional.3. Love interest between him and Rosario Dawson just didn't seem to fit in the context of what Ben was trying to achieve. His actions also come across as being a little stalker-ish.4. Some supporting characters are VERY under-used. Michael Ealy, Woody Harrelson, and Barry Pepper are thoroughly wasted in what amounts to cameo appearances. We've all seen these guys do so much more than the protracted moping that they're relegated to here. Again, I return to the weakness of the script for under-developing their characters.I didn't hate the film, just thought it could have been better. For me, a solid 6/10, or a "Matinee." For an even better Will Smith performance, I suggest Six Degrees of Separation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Snoozzzzzzzzzze Fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think Will Smith could do anything slower than The Pursuit of Happiness, but Seven Pounds is hands down one of the most sluggish?okay I'll say it?boring movies I've seen. It tries to be Crash but simply doesn't have the hypnotic rhythm. Will Smith is just not convincing as the troubled soul with a secret. Jack Nicholson might be able to pull off this kind of stuff, but Will Smith? Brad Pitt pulled it off in Meet Joe Black, Billy Bob Thorton pulled it off in Monster Ball, but we're always going to think of Will Smith as Hancock or the guy fighting aliens in Independence Day, so it is much harder for us to suspend our disbelief in this tale of a brooding stalker who angrily tries to save people's lives by sacrificing his own. The plot is simply implausible and to be honest, morbid. When Will Smith hits the doctor on the neck and the doc's head goes crashing back, cracking a window, in real life there would be a battery charge filed, IRS agent or not. When Will Smith ignores the owner of the motel who tells him he can't have a dog in his room, in real life there would be an eviction notice slipped under the door. When Will Smith breaks and enters into the garage and repairs the printing press, we wonder how he managed to do that without ordering any parts; it's hard to believe that even an MIT graduate can repair a malfunctioning antique lickity split, and make it so shiny too. In the morning he donates bone marrow, in the afternoon he is nearly crippled from the operation and can barely get out of bed, but by evening he's in a suit and tie delivering a gift-wrapped present to the girl he plans to give his heart to (without so much as a limp). And as an organ donor myself, I doubt that anyone is considered for multiple live organ donation, but apparently this guy gave half a liver, a lung and his bone marrow before offing himself in order to give away his eyes and heart. In real life there is a strict procedure to all of this, and one of the things the medical community wants to make sure is that you aren't doing it because you are suicidal. I don't like the message this movie sends about organ donation; you don't have to be suicidal to make such a sacrifice.Seven Pounds starts out slow. We don't even know what is going on for the first half hour, and when it becomes apparent, everything after that is predictable and other than his brother popping up about two thirds through, there are no surprises. We can't really relate to Will Smith's character because he is being so selfish in orchestrating his good deeds. He walks around through the entire movie acting depressed and all that does is make us depressed. And what a horrible trick he plays on the poor girl when he suggests they get married and have kids and then goes to his motel room to kill himself. Sure, leave HER with the guilt. Maybe he should have had a little faith in God instead of playing God.Will Smith seems to get parts at extreme ends of the spectrum. He's either doing outrageous action films or sappy tearjerkers that take themselves way too seriously. Good drama contains elements of both, but too much of one or the other is simply overload. This is definitely in the class of sap overload.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does have its good parts. But overall, the plot is very undeveloped and hard to follow. A lot of the story does not make sense because of the flashbacks "Ben Thomas" has. The love story between Emily (Rosario Dawson) and Ben (Will Smith) is sweet but could have been much more developed. I really like Will Smith and Rosario Dawson but this movie did absolutely nothing for their careers. Will Smith doesn't come to mind when I think of sappy love movies. I understand that he was in a lot of pain from the past, but they should have developed that more in the movie. It was overall a very big disappointment of a movie. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have several hours because watching it once you will not understand a lot of what happens. Be prepared to scratch your head a lot.</fullReview>

The acting yes as usual from Will is superb however .... The film just does not deliver enough punch to warrant the length.Very boring to watch and totally let down.

		<shortDescription>Movie Glorifies Suicide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a perverted Bucket List without the solid acting. While many seem to have enjoyed this movie to me it glorified a bizarre religious notion that one can be absolved from sin by performing good deeds. What is most disturbing is that it glorifies suicide as an ultimate unselfish gift rather than treating it as mental illness. His long time friend obviously knows his guilt and mental state yet, on behalf of his "friendship" does nothing but encourage him further into his psychotic plan.The movie sends the wrong message. It uses a love story to disguise deep emotional guilt. To add insult to injury after he kills his wife in a car accident due to his negligence he has sex with the woman he gives his heart to. How off the wall is that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's cut to it: After giving his fiancée a monstrous diamond ring not even a millionaire could afford, Will Smith kills her in the next minute while fiddling with his Blackberry; he smashes into a van loaded with people.Miraculously, Will is thrown clear and is barely scratched even though he's shown taking the brunt of the accident as the car flips 404 times and down the side of a mountain. Fiancée is dead on the highway. Smith spends the rest of his life helping others by donating organs, helping them out of money/tax problems, and by being an angry hothead trying to show 'da white man' how to treat his relatives. In the end, Smith commits suicide by drowning in a bathtub of ice and donates the rest of his organs (and eyes to Woody Harrelson) to everyone else.It's utter pablum only matched by endless maudlin music. No academy awards, this should have been a Lifetime after school movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7 pounds of wasted film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised there are so many positive reviews for this movie. The plot is easy to figure out and the payoff at the end does not deliver the emotion one would think a topic such as this requires. Will Smith is a very talented actor, however the fact that he can cry and walk around dazed and bewildered does not make this performance a good one by any stretch. The character development is weak and I found it very hard to care who he was and why he was doing what he did. The pain within him is always on the surface in his character but it never really gets a chance to get out and at the end there is little redemption for what he has gone through. The movie relies on the cliché's of old, the new bride, the dying girl, the poor blind guy, the eventual running in the rain scene that tells us he is having a dramatic life change. Blaa Blaa Blaa. I'd like back the 7 hours the movie seemed to steal from me. In a nutshell if you're looking for a typical Hollywood cheap shot at your heart go see this movie, if you're looking for something fresh and new save your money.</fullReview>

The problem is that the suspense grows for the first part of the movie, but goes flat fast.

I love movies and have never gotten bored of one in the theater to the point of wanting to leave, but last night with this movie broke that record. There are much better movies in the theater now.

He is a complete sellout and all his movies are massive blockbusters where he is the lead. He shows he has absolutely no versatility as he plays the same character in every movie. he thinks that he can redeem himself for years of crap, by being in the occasional serious movie. but those movies end up being funnier than his others, but not in a good way. he's even worse because he takes himself seriously despite being a complete joke. don't see this movie, pray that it bombs and will smiths career can finally end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blasphemous, Bad, and Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Seven Pounds" is one of the worst big-budget, mainstream movies I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that has you sitting there in the theater, pounding your forehead, demanding, "How the heck does a movie this bad get made?" You wonder if everyone in Hollywood is ingesting the same mind-altering drug. The ending is so screamingly silly and bizarre you have to guess that the drug in question was a hallucinogen.The plot: Will Smith's character, whose name changes during the course of the film (so I'll just call him "Will"), accidentally does a very bad thing. He could have used this opportunity to learn about human failings, God's divine forgiveness, and the blessings of grace and redemption. He does not. He insists that because he is so important and perfect, his mistake is equally important and perfect. This is what Alcoholics Anonymous members have cleverly dubbed "Terminal grandiosity." Ego all the way.With his terminal grandiosity as his fixed North Star, he decides to play God. That's supposed to be heroic, rather than disastrous folly. Man is not God. At one point, Will says to one of the people he thinks he is helping, "Live your life abundantly." He's paraphrasing Jesus Christ. At another point, Will says, "God created the world in seven days. I destroyed it in seven seconds." This reference emphasizes Will's equation of his own status with God's.Will targets two recipients of his "help": Emily and Ezra. They are not allowed any voice in the procedure. He alone is active; they are passive. He has a voice; they are silent. He has knowledge; they are kept in the dark. He decides; they must sheepishly go along with the consequences of his decision.The movie depicts Will's action as a messiah-like gesture. I ask viewers who understood it that way: If Emily or Ezra knew what Will was doing, would they have agreed to his plan? No. If you admire Will's action, would you like to emulate it? No. Would you like your children to do what Will did? No. These simple questions reveal that what Will did was about ego run amuck, not virtue.All of this might have been forgivable if the movie had had any interest at all. It doesn't. It's one of the most mind numbingly boring movies ever made. There's one good scene ? Smith tries to goad a telephone customer service representative, Woody Harrelson, into saying something rude. That scene rang true. We've all been frustrated by customer service representatives, and many of us have had those kinds of jobs where someone seems to be goading us into behaving rudely. But one good scene cannot redeem the 97% of the movie that is flat, dull, lifeless, and soporific ? exactly because Will is the only character allowed any agency ? and the 2% of the movie that is more screamingly silly than *anything* ever put into a mainstream movie.Spare yourself. Really. You've been warned.</fullReview>

There is not even a one-in-a-billion chance in real life. So, the story is just too pretentious. Will Smith's lawyer friend, if he is really his friend since childhood, should ask Will to see counselling. What kind of life-long friend would help him arrange legal issues for the planned suicide? And then Will Smith plays the good guy and the sad guy at the same time. If someone is really sad and plagued by the trauma-some past, he would not have the focus to do everyday job. Yet Will did. In his nights he suffer post-trauma syndrome, and in his days he help people with the best judgement and most charming smile on his innocent face. How sick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smith saves it yet again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film centers around Smith, who has previously desperately tried to Smith from comedy to action, and he has pulled it off. But he has never been good at drama, until now. I was never a fan of "In the Pursuit of Happiness", mainly because of Smiths acting talent. But here his acting talent is purely the reason I liked it. The rest of the cast was poorly chosen and the script poorly wrote, but Will Smith still makes something of this dull plot and at times dull film, there is very little character development to what is expected to a film with such a plot. I did not expect much when I was invited to a private screening of the film but I was surprised, although the film has little interest in each scene Will Smith pulls it through. I told him what I though on the film and he took interest in my comments he said "his talent usually saves interest deprived films", although in a sarcastic tone of voice.This film has a feel-good factor which is the main selling point if your wondering what film to see, I believe true drama fans will be greatly satisfied along with Will Smith fans, but overall it is a good film which I found deeply entertaining, although I would not pay to see this again, I do recommend spending your money to 'try it out'.</fullReview>
