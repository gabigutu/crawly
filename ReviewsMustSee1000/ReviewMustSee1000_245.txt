		<shortDescription>A strong mood piece, but not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many good things about The Machinist that are well deserving of praise. The very atmospheric nature of the film is supported very strongly by excellent performances all around. Christian Bale takes things to the extreme in his embodiment of his character. It is hard to take seeing him in his near-starvation body mass, which elevates the tension of this piece even further. The storyline leaves a little to be desired. While it creates its mood excellently, it does tend to plod along a little too much.One thing that does stand out is how reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock this film plays. Almost everything about the film screams Hitchcock, from the editing of certain scenes (the driving sequences are very much in the style of Psycho) to the Bernard Herrmann-esquire score (lots of bass clarinet), the lack of fully-exploring/revealing some of the creepier points of the film (what is dripping from the fridge?), and the washed out, grainy photography. If you want to see what a film would look like if Hitchcock were alive to film it today, this is the closest thing you could probably come across. And if that was part of Brad Anderson's intention in directing this, I have to commend him on the execution because it is uncanny.Overall, I would recommend this film, but not to casual movie-goers. This is very much a movie-phile experience for those who appreciate character development and cinematography as much as plot points and a storyline that can be defined and followed from one action to the next. In that way it is closer to films like Magnolia or the Others, where the apex is the characters. If you are looking for a typical popcorn Hollywood thriller, this is not what you are looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at the Stockholm International Film Festival in November 2004. In the audience was director Brad Anderson, and i think he very much appreciated how the film was received by the rest of the audience. And this film was well worth the applause.This film is about a man (Christian Bale) working in a heavy industry. He suffers from insomnia and hasn't slept for a year. This condition is causing him to lose weight, and his perception of reality to become twisted. Soon he doesn't know what's real or not.I won't elaborate any more on the plot since it could really spoil the film for you. There are some twists and turns along the way that might not be all that obvious and you should be able to enjoy them without being told too much. What i can say though is that the story is in no way revolutionary. A couple of films have been made in the same vein as this one, the most famous perhaps being Memento and Fight Club. And "The Machinist" shares elements from both these films but still, i think, manages to create an identity of it's own.But aside from the story, Christian Bale really steals the show. Having seen him in his previous films it's hard to be prepared for what he looks like here. For this film he has turned himself into a walking skeleton, a run-down shadow of a man. And his performance is, throughout the movie, mesmerizing. I have ever since American Psycho been fully convinced of Bale's talents as an actor, and this further proves his talent and commitment. The rest of the cast also do a good job, strengthening the overall strange mood of the film.Although i thoroughly enjoyed this film i understand it's not for everyone. This is not the least proved by the fact that Brad Anderson (as he stated in the interview after the screening) could not get funding for it in America. Instead he had to go to Spain to make the film the way he wanted to. And i'm not surprised, this is not your standard Hollywood fare. But for those of us who enjoy films that go beyond the will to suit everyone (and make loads of money) this is a rewarding experience. I rate it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a common rule that people subconsciously decide within the first ten minutes whether they like a movie or not. It didn't even take me that long to know that I would be intrigued by "The Machinist".The set up is perfect. It's adorable how the movie constantly establishes new plot points without ever getting tedious. As the story goes on it gets hard to believe that the ending will be able to explain everything and you start pondering that there can only be one possible conclusion for all the weird events. It may be disappointing at first to learn that your predictions are probably dead-on and you might go: "Not that old twist again." The beautiful thing, however, is that there's an explanation to the twist that really adds a lot to the concept. Much later, when you've already left the theater and you rethink the whole thing, you'll find that the script is much cleverer than you had thought at first. To me the biggest achievement of the movie in retrospective is, that it's never creepy just for the sake of freaking the audience out (and hell, the carnival-sequence is so friggin creepy and well made, it's delightful). Every scene has its purpose and that is not often the case in horror and mystery movies.Although the whole cast did a fine job, Christian Bale's terrific performance must be mentioned. Usually I'm annoyed by stories about actors losing or gaining weight in preparation for a role, because mostly it's uncalled for anyway and not even worth a mention. What Bale did to prepare for "The Machinist", however, is nothing short of heroic. He lost 60 pounds and looks so unhealthy throughout the whole movie that it's hard to believe he turned into himself again after the director yelled "cut!".I can recommend "The Machinist" to anybody who's looking for a movie that keeps you intrigued longer than just during its running time. If after 10 minutes you like the movie, after days you'll find yourself still obsessed with it. I love it, when a movie does that to me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MACHINST (2004) ***1/2 Christian Bale, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, John Sharian, Michael Ironside, Reg E. Cathey.'Thinner' meets 'Memento' by way of 'Angel Heart' a la HitchcockThere are a few select actors who have gained or shed weight to make a true transformation on screen but the one that will probably remain imprinted for years to come is the truly shocking display by Christian Bale who lost a whopping 63 lbs. to a skeletal shell of 120 for his portrayal of dank creepy perfection.Bale stars as the afflicted Trevor Reznik, a shell of a man who works in a machine factory and apparently is nursing some horrible demon that has led to his astonishing appearance, ghostly pallor and paranoia soaked delusions that call to question his amazing confession: How can a man not sleep for an entire year and waste away to a shadow of his being and keep his sanity?The answer isn't so transparent as Reznik becomes submerged in some sort of dreamscape nightmare of conspiracy theories and the innate distrust of his own mind playing tricks on him one night when he encounters the perpetually grinning Ivan (Sharian sporting the sharkiest Cheshire Cat smile in recent film memory) an apparently new shift employee who distracts him to the point of a horrific accident that causes his employer and co-worker to mistrust him and suspect his deteriorating looks as something a tad more sinister.Reznik's only solace is in literally a mother-whore relationship he shares with a well-meaning lovely waitress (Sanchez-Gizon) at the airport diner he frequents as much as the hooker he lies with to express his thoughts and odd happenings (Leigh in her umpteenth whore role that must have filled her quota by now). After the accident Reznik is plagued with a series of Post-Its sporting a game of hangman that leads to a few clues to his rationale and ultimately to his fate of 'Who Am I?'Directed by Anderson who helmed the criminally underrated spooky horror flick 'Session 9' a few years back returns to a dark story of a man clearly unraveling and destroying himself in the process that echoes Stephen King's 'Thinner' by way of the identity crises of 'Memento' and the psychological thriller 'Angel Heart' yet invokes a sharply executed script by Scott Kosar (who penned the worthy remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' last year) that recalls David Fincher meets David Lynch paroxysms of fate and the build up to a discovery that is all too recognizable to the thriller genre in recent years of identity masked as phobic reality with its latter day Hitchcock everyman skewed nicely. Kudos to cinematographers Xavi Gimenez and Charlie Jiminez for its bleak, green/grey drudgery and the Herrmannesque score by Roque Banos mixes perfectly to the dread at hand displays.Bale went above and beyond the call of duty in his somewhat controversial display of Holocaust invoking demeanor yet it works shockingly well as it delves into the troubled soul of a man who is wasting away not only as a metaphor but as a penance for some hell to pay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dostoyevsky and The Machinist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. It reminded me of 21 Grams, Jacob's Ladder and Memento. Perhaps the finale left a few questions unanswered or felt a little anti-climactic but an amazing performance by Christian Bale. Haunted, brave, vulnerable, murderous but also very moving. A film which stays with you.Now, here's an eggheaded thing, but did anyone notice the constant stream of Dostoyevsky references in the movie? Not only did Resnick (remind anyone of Raskolnikov?) put down a copy of Dostoyevsky's The Idiot at one point but the whole movie owed a lot to Notes From The Underground, Crime And Punishment and The Double. Did anyone spot the sign in the Ghost Train sequence which read Crime And Punishment? Or that Sharian's character is called Ivan (cf The Brothers Karamazov - especially the chapter Ivan's Dream)? Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is very familiar from Dostoyevsky, as was the saintly Maria.Its a cracking film and none of these references are indispensable to enjoying it but I thought I would point it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>darkly atmospheric horror/mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trever Reznick is an industrial machine operator who hasn't slept in a year and feels as if he is going crazy. A horrible accident in the workplace causes him to fall further down the spiral. Is there a conspiracy against him or is he going insane? The lead character is played with discomforting perfection by a repulsively thin and unrecognizable Christian Bale. This is a very moody and atmospheric film that is reminiscent of Lynch (though, by the end, it is a much more spelled-out than Lynch would do for the viewer). Still, it is a very gripping and disturbing movie. "The Machinist" is one of the better horror films released this year. My Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark and Spooky Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Machinist" demonstrates that "Session 9" wasn't the only creepy thriller that Brad Anderson could do. While M. Night Shyamalan and commercial fare like "The Grudge" get the attention and the big bucks, Anderson is quietly mastering disturbing, psychologically scary shockers. While the previous movie took advantage of our imaginations leaping around a spooky environment, "The Machinist" makes our discomfort palpably visual in Christian Bale's painful to look at body, as his character is ravaged by insomnia and loss of appetite; by the end of the movie it's shocking to see his normally handsome face. But all the focus on his astounding weight loss takes away from the other elements in the almost black and white film that make it a scare fest. The movie establishes "The Twilight Zone" mood immediately with the soundtrack, which includes generous use of the theremin, as Hitchcock did in "Psycho." The production design is excellent at supporting the mood.The suspense builds and is sustained through to the satisfying conclusion as you genuinely get involved in Bale's efforts to solve the increasingly mysterious happenings around him. Even though you are pretty sure he could be hallucinating, you are intrigued to figure out the trigger. Despite looking like a caricature of a Holocaust victim, Bale creates a full character, from the jocular male camaraderie of the factory where he doesn't quite seem to fit in to responding one beat off to the warmth of the two women in his life, a waitress and a prostitute with the an open heart of gold (played, as usual by Jennifer Jason Leigh, but effectively languid).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this incredible movie tonight and all I can say is WOW!! This movie is one you should definitely see if you enjoy such quality films like Vertigo, Psycho and most recently Identity. Massive kudos to Christian Bale who turned himself into a skeleton for the role and the wonderfully articulate pace of the director! As you watched it, you knew that there were answers at the end and the journey was simply captivating! Also fine, fine work by Michael Ironside and the absolutely gorgeous Jennifer Jason-Leigh who to this day looks just as hot as she did in Fast Times! If you have a chance to see this film and an open mind, make the trip to the ciniplex! Fantastic film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strange story about freedom and guilty. Modern image of "Crime and Punishment". Our life like a shadow of the dreams and fear. Like a research a way of personal truth. No salvation, no cure. Only a refuge in a great lie. This movie is an important experience. Not like a theoretical experience,like a game without value, like a joke. "The Machinist " is a trip in your mind, in your memory, in the life's essence. "I am the other" said Rimbaud. But who? A ghost? A shadow? A body? A toy? The essence of movie is the relation with the world and the form of honesty. The presence of God in this movie is the way of resurrection. The car, the boy, the work accident, Maria, Ivan , Miller are the steps of a very special salvation. And Christian Bale, in his best character, a new Raskolnikov, know to give a great sense of truth to Trevor Reznik. A real master-piece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An urban nightmare with an incredible performance by Christian Bale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MACHINIST (Brad Anderson - Spain 2004).Christian Bale is Trevor Reznik, a machinist in an anonymous factory somewhere in America. He is obviously scarred by some past incident but what is it? He finds mysterious notes on his refrigerator, saying 'who are you?' He sees colleagues that don't exist. He seems to have lost it completely.A Spanish production, but with Brad Anderson at the helm as director and an almost exclusively American cast, this is basically an American film. I must admit, I kept shelving this one, due to reasons I cannot really recall now I've finally watched it, but it probably had something to do with Christian Bale's insane weight loss and all the surrounding publicity. I assumed the film was all about Bale's loss of weight and not much more. A method boy in a film solely hyped for an actor's dedication to play the part, but the film blew me away, as simple as that. Christian Bale gives a solo turn here almost unseen before. No matter how many pounds he lost, it's a remarkable performance. Director Brad Anderson succeeds brilliantly in conceiving an atmosphere that is so compelling, as one other user on the IMDb stated, 'You just HAVE to know what the hell is going on here.' I think that's the key factor in what makes this film so incredibly compelling. The whole setting is an anonymous industrial town somewhere in the US, that could be Pennsylvania, Michigan or upstate New York (actually, it was shot near Barcelona), but it doesn't really matter where the story is located. It's the atmosphere of estrangement that does it. And Christian Bale gives such an intense performance you really want to know his cause and background. Where on earth does he come from? We know he works in a greasy factory, but why is he skin-over-bone? Why hasn't he slept in over a year? Brad Anderson creates an atmosphere so broody and sleazy, it's like a netherworld, an urban nightmare. In a certain way it reminded me of the strange urban landscape in "Eraserhead" by David Lynch.Camera Obscura --- 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark and Somber Maze of Altered Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MACHINIST is a mesmerizing film, a journey through the interstices of a mind deprived of sleep, of nourishment, and a mind that struggles to untangle the chaos of a past of guilt and terror. And the journey is terrifying.When the film opens we meet Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) or at least the emaciated, tortured remains of a man who hasn't slept for a year. We don't know why this worker in a machine factory is in such condition: the story unwinds slowly so that by the end we accompany Reznik in his shock to his moment of discovery. It is the getting there that is the tough beauty of this amazingly rich film as written by Scott Kosar and directed by Brad Anderson.The setting is always dark as though the state of mind is a nightmare. Reznik's meager existence is challenged when he is involved in an industrial accident in which a fellow worker Miller (Michael Ironside) loses an arm. Shocked by the accident (for which Reznik feels responsible) the various few people in his life seem supportive: a hooker named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a waitress in an airport all night diner Marie (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón), and an ambiguous bald man Ivan (John Sharian) who appears to Reznik in strange ways.Reznik's mind slowly disintegrates into paranoid delusions, the only way he can hold his life together is by post-its reminding him first of his documented progressive weight loss, then of his needs, then of his secret mystery. To say more would be a great disservice to the extraordinary plot.Christian Bale delivers one of the most committed performances on film. He not only physically inhabits Reznik with his skeletal appearance, he also mentally nurtures all the nuances of fear, pain, pleasure and madness that build as his character's reason for a year of insomnia is revealed at the very end. We stand in suspense with him and his fall is as powerful as any Dante ever devised. The entire cast is superb but special kudos go to Jennifer Jason Leigh who finally has a role that allows her to demonstrate the spectrum of skill she possesses as an actress. Not an easy film, this, but a very important one. Highly recommended - but not to see alone! Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Machinist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a purpose in watching this movie, and that is to check out Christian Bales's acting chops before his Batman Begins opens in the summer.The narrative is confusing at first. There doesn't seem to be any clear direction on where the plot and its subplots lead to. All we know is Bale looks thin, for some reason, isn't getting enough sleep, and develops relationships with a widow, her kid, and a hooker.As always, most dark thrillers have a twist at the end, and if you can sit tight, you'll get it - not that it will be presented in a confusing manner, just that the pacing could be improved. Actually with shows like Fight Club and Memento around, this show might feel like a fusion between the two, and hence, you might have warranted a guess on the twist midway through the show.Christian Bale has sacrificed quite a bit to look the role. With the lingering full body shots of his anorexic body, which at times is painful to look at, one can imagine the kind of toil it must have took.Definite for fans of mysteries and thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The modern reincarnation of a Greek tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his chilling horror "Session 9" Brad Anderson continues his journey exploring the darkest depths of the human mind with "The Machinist". This review is not meant to just show the aesthetic and structural qualities Anderson's movie has, but also to distance it from the impression of being a "Fight Club rip-off". The review CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS on both The Machinist and Fight Club and should only be read by people who have already seen these two movies.Those who are familiar with Aristotle's view on art and specifically the mimesis and catharsis theories will find similarities here, or should I say an exact match to his idea for a "tragedy". "The Machinist" mimics the real world. It is not a supernatural or fantasy story, but something possible in the context of reality keeping to the "mimesis" theory (art should be something that imitates life, stays close to the rules on what is possible). The protagonist, a machinist, is plagued by insomnia and weight loss, the reason for this suffering isn't explained from the start, but later on. We sympathize with him, with the problems this man, Trevor Reznik, has. Why should an innocent, suffer like that, we ask. Why should he be punished if he hadn't committed a crime? The tragic catharsis, writes Aristotle, is the moment when the protagonist's sin is revealed, when we, the audience learn that the punishment he has received isn't unjust, when we know that innocence isn't subjectable to punishment, sin is. Scott Kosar wrote a Greek tragedy, Brad Anderson brought it to life.The atmosphere? A bleak, nearly colorless look, sadness and dread combined. The gloomy melancholy, jitters the mind. Christian Bale's dedication to his craft is outstanding he takes it to a whole new level. What he underwent for this role, the performance, a range of emotions ranging from fear, shock, paranoia, regret,sorrow. It was more than Oscar-worthy, it was unreal. Director Brad Anderson creates tension and unease at places you wouldn't think it was possible, he delivers surprise after surprise in what may seem more like a hellish roller-coaster ride, then a traditional thriller. A low key musical score, perfect choice, for the tone. Quite a catching opening tune."The Machinist", it seems, ends with questions unanswered. The main plot line has been completed but some mechanisms that lead towards the conclusion are a bit fogged out of perception. Nonetheless they are there. The movie is, of course, open for interpretation and the following is simply my take on some of the sub-plots and characters.On the opening scene. The opening scene is as we've learned, not a chronological first, but a sequence taken from the latter stage. Why? It exists as: ?a stylistic approach to create tension, to grab the audience's attention from the start. ?an early tip for the mystery the movie has (note Reznik's reaction, the shock in his eyes when dumping the body and when "someone" flashes him with a flashlight).On the insomnia, weight loss and Ivan. The insomnia and Ivan are the reasons for "The Machinist" being a "Fight Club" ripoff argument. There were movies that used such ideas before Fight Club, Lynch's Lost Highway for example, it's nothing all too original. What these elements represent that is what's important. In "The Machinist" they are the punishment Trevor's guilt inflicts on him. We've all experienced guilt at one point or the other, and we know it can have an effect. Here that effect is taken to the extreme. Fight Club on the other hand had the Narrator's insomnia and split personality, Tyler Dyrden, created from frustration, his inability in adapting to the status quo, he can't sleep because he cannot see a reason for his existence, he makes Tyler who gives him a reason. Ivan is not a split personality, he doesn't take control over the protagonist's body like Tyler, no one except Reznik has seen or heard of him, he is a manifestation like Nicholas or Marie, he is the projection of sin and Trevor in the past. The Trevor who caused the accident, he will repeat it again in order to guide Bale's character to the truth.On how Trevor Reznik lost his memory about the accident. During the sequence at the theme park where Trevor and Nicholas are walking through the dark tunnel, Trevor notes the similarities between his childhood and Nicholas's current life. Both lacked or lack a father-like figure in their life both are in a good relationship with their mothers. This is not an accident, since Nicholas is merely one of the manifestations in Reznik's subconscious mind there is little doubt that he is also a mirror image of Trevor as a young boy living with his mother. His subconscious guilt fills the gaps and fleshes out the two fictional characters using bits and pieces of his past life. This is done in order to make the two manifestations become believable to Trevor's now doubtlessly distorted perception. If Nicholas is in fact Trevor then what happened to Nicholas during the ride through "Route 666" is what actually happened to Trevor shortly after the accident. Epileptic shock as explained by Marie causes loss of memory "he will forget it ever happened". And indeed Trevor forgot, partially, in his subconscious the memory still existed.Complex but structurally sound "The Machinist" is the dark, modern reincarnation of a Greek tragedy. Twisted and disturbing, sad but liberating, Scott Kosar, Brad Anderson and Christian Bale create a work of high caliber. Not something that can be enjoyed the way a Hollywood Blockbuster can be enjoyed, it is exhausting, yet pleasing in its own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm Still Waiting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like The Machinist. As this film and his previous effort, Session 9, show, Brad Anderson is one of the best visual stylists working in film today, able to conjure up a dank, eerie, foreboding atmosphere from a budget that would not pay for David Fincher's lunch. He has a great compositional sense, is not afraid to be leisurely, and has a refreshingly uncluttered approach to mis-en-scene. Yet The Machinist, like Session 9, ultimately disappoints. I think there are two reasons for this.The first is that, absent the conceit of Christian Bale's astonishing transformation, there is very little reason for this film to exist. The Machinist is a character study of a character who has, yes, very little weight. Despite Bale's best efforts, Trevor Reznick is a blank, a cypher, unpleasant and uninteresting. Although the film abounds in Hitchcock references, Anderson, screenwriter Scott Kosar, and Bale fail to assimilate the master's most important lesson: that the film's weirdo should be its most sympathetic and likable character. Anthony Perkins was cast as Norman Bates because of his image as the sweet, sensitive boy next door; Christian Bale, a prodigiously talented, but chilly and distant actor was, most assuredly, not.As a character, Resnick lacks progression; because he is skeletal and bonkers from the beginning, there is no sense of horror as he is (quite literally) consumed by his own guilt. For this to work, some kind of contrast with normality is needed - the audience must witness a sensitive, precious soul slowly destroyed because of one small dreadful mistake. But Resnick is no Prince Myshkin. Rather, his guilt seems to be the only interesting thing in his otherwise dim, uncomprehending existence. The guilt gives his tedious life drama, meaning, and coherence. The film's final revelation should have been a shattering emotional climax; instead, it is the excuse for Resnick to take a much needed nap.The second reason for The Machinist's failure is that Anderson seems to have trouble abandoning himself to his chosen genre. His direction of The Machinist, and of Session 9 as well, is detached, clinical, unengaged. There is no sense of love, or of passion, in what he is doing. Anderson seems drawn to horror, tempted by the opportunity it offers him to show what he can do with a camera, but he seems afraid to commit, to give himself over. It's as if he is too good, too cultured, too intelligent, too rational, for this kind of film. Yet he keeps coming back, as his next assignment, a remake of George Romero's The Crazies, shows.There is no singular vision in Anderson's horror films, as there is in the work of Cronenberg, for example. There is no exuberant celebration of style, as there is in Argento's or DePalma's best works. Nor does there seem to be any political agenda, as there is in Romero's films. But despite the relative failure of Session 9 and The Machinist, I think there is something in Anderson, unformed and embryonic, waiting to burst forth, if only he can let go. He is a late talent, a grower not a shower. I don't think it will be seen in The Crazies, but I'm still waiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT-=- Ever since I moved to California (from NYC) and started driving, I've always had it in the back of my mind that I had to be extremely careful that I didn't hit anyone while I was in my 2000+ lb. machine, particularly a child. I've always felt that this would be one of the worst things that could possibly happen in someone's life ~ how it would be just unforgivable, and how it would cause unfathomable guilt. So this film had a profound effect on me, by the end of it, when we find out what's really at the bottom of Trevor's severely tormented state of mind.The film exists inside this mind; the entire film is experienced from this drastically tortured vantage point. Trevor no longer can perceive what is real and what isn't, and so we're not sure either. At first I was thinking the whole thing was a dream, but that didn't quite make sense, because from the way it's shot, with some of the scenes having a little color in them, and some nearly black and white, it felt more like hallucinations were occurring along with some flashes of reality. I think the filmmakers do an absolutely brilliant job in letting us into Trevor's head. Of course, Bale's 110% commitment to the project certainly doesn't hurt. Magnificently realized, The Machinist is a harrowing and monumentally sad cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the point of making this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start with the positive. The movie looks good with the faded color lending weight to our protagonist's jaded view of the world. The performances were also applaudable.However, what was the point of making this movie? (Here comes the spoiler, if you can even call it that!!) From the moment where Ivan first disappears from view and is not recognised by co-workers in the factory, I started to say to myself "Please, not another alter-ego/split-personality story. Fight Club's done this already and done it rather well!" Alas, my fears were eventually realised but I remained optimistic, hopeful that maybe something imaginative might be done after the denouement. Once again I was disappointed.This is a simplistic, boring story. It's a pity, as it's the best acting that I've seen Christian Bale do and the films palette is strangely appealing but if you want my advice, keep your money for something else!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a rip-off than a "homage"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I really like Christian Bale - he generally stars in very good movies. He was great (IMO) in American Psycho, Equilibrium, and Batman Begins. The reviews for The Machinist are way up there, which I suspect increased my expectations. Regardless of the reviews, I would have watched it merely for Bale's decision to be in it. But here all of the actor's talents go to waste, which is a shame as Mr. Bale possibly shortened his life by losing so much weight for the role.- Spoilers and rants ahead - The plot was unfortunately made incredibly obvious to me early on in the scene where the machine shop head honcho in the office said that no one with the mystery man's name worked there. OK, so the mystery man is a figment of the main character's imagination, no other explanation. Why do I need to watch the rest of the movie again? It was really a stupid move writing the scene that way, a little ambiguity here would have gone a long way.Outside of the plot itself being the tired, overdone, reveal the lame-and-only twist too early sort, the music was annoyingly Hitchcockian and obtrusive. Telegraphing scenes with buckets of Theremin-laden orchestration worked pretty good back in the day, but there are good reasons no one does it in supposedly well-crafted movies anymore.And the "gritty, depressing" blue filter thing has got to stop, and I mean now! A touch of blue is perhaps OK now and then, but nothing but shades of sickly blue just whacks you over the head and screams "look how arty we are!" Enough already. Drop the editing machine and back away from the blue filter, I just can't stand it anymore.This is the kind of movie you get when the writing and direction just aren't up to snuff. What a waste of everyone's time involved with it, including this viewer's. Rating = 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another biased rating. Mediocre film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an old IMDb user and commenter, I am starting to feel that lately -no matter what algorithm is used-, more and more films are starting to have a definitely biased rating. And this one is a perfect example. Here you've got a very elementary (and mediocre) scripted thriller, one of those in which the director necessarily has to insert junk filming in between start and end in order to "comply" to the 90 minute minimum. Comparing this film to Memento or Angel Heart (just to mention two REAL masterpieces) is plain blasphemy. There is no way Memento or Angel Heart could last 15 minutes for example. But this one could perfectly fit even in 10. I still have to underrate in order to try average real rating. For me, true real rating for this one is 5 out of ten, not a cent more. Only worth if free on TV or cable. And if you are in "visually dark" mood, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A factory worker called Trevor (Christian Bale) fatigued of insomnia receives estrange and indecipherable post-it notes that seem a bizarre riddle and going on odds events are happening . He hasn't slept for one year and suffers hallucinations , risking lives of industrial co-operators (Michael Ironside), causing injuries and amputations . Psychopathic , haunting visions by Trevor and his madness embroils two women , a prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and a mother (Aitana Sanchez Gijon) , increasingly , besides , with a co-worker (John Sharian) who nobody have ever seen . He tries to resolve which believes to be a scheme against him and a mysterious rout 666 leads to the final enigma .The film contains mystery , violence , suspense in dark atmosphere with imposing tension and intrigue . The thin (exclusively for the film) Christian Bale makes a top-notch performance similarly to supporting cast who is frankly good . The producers of the film claim that Christian Bale dropped from about 173 pounds in weight down to about 110 pounds in weight to make this film and he regained it for Batman . Bale plays magnificently psycho and gloomy characters (as in Shaft , American psycho and even Batman) . The film was well shot in Catalunia (Spain) though to be just like whatever American city . Xavi Gimenez cinematography is excellent , creating a frightening and scary atmosphere , he's expert on sombre photography (Fragile, Intact, Nameless) . Mesmerizing and intriguing music by Roque Ba?os (Crimen Ferfecto , 88 bullets). The motion picture was nicely directed by Brad Anderson (Session 9) , although with little movement and brief action. Rating : Good and above average , it's one the highest earning suspense picture of the last years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dark, thoughtful, and beautifully shot, this movie and particularly Bale's performance takes you down an alley, beats the hell out of you, and makes you want to come back for more. It's a nightmarish landscape on every level of the soul, with a message of redemption that stays with you for a long time. What Bale did to his body for this movie alone creeps under the audience's skin, and his crisis of guilt and self-loathing create a sub-reality that is inescapable. The terror is rarely on the surface, but always lurking in the sleepless shadows of Bale's mind.Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Ironside also turn in superior performances.Loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale is Trevor Reznik, he has not slept for a year and he is ravaged by exhaustion, his body is little more than bones and his weary mind is playing tricks on him. After a serious accident where his neglect sees a co-worker lose a arm, he becomes haunted by his guilt and he begins to find cryptic notes in his flat, while he is stalked by man, wherever he goes.Brad Anderson creates and sustains a very creepy and dark Ora throughout the film; filling it with haunting imagery and clever camera work. Christian Bale is simply mesmerising in this role, and he must have starved for months to capture the characters physical appearance. He is excellently supported by Jennifer Jason Leigh, a prostitute who seems to be the only one he can trust.The Machinist is truly compulsive viewing and despite similarities to the feel of Fight Club and the structure of Memento; this film does stand alone on it's own merits.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is amazing this movie didn't win an Academy Award. I have never seen any movie like it before, nor after. Christian Bale, although one of my favorite actors since American Psycho, clinched my top spot with this one. His physical transformation will never be matched, and his acting is flawless. Both thought provoking and horrifying at the same time, it is a movie centered around guilt, decisions, and revelation. Full of symbolism, every scene is worthy of deep analysis - leaving you wanting to watch it again and again (just not so soon, due to its depth). My hat is off to the director, actors, and accomplished crew for making a movie so worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nine Inch Nails meets Dostoyevsky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good, if not excellent, psychological thriller that may suffer a bit from a "too little, too late" syndrome as well as a slight emotional disconnect with the viewer.Christian Bale is Trevor Reznick (the name seems to be a pun on the man who is Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor). Reznick works as the titular machinist in a strange, unnamed town. When the film begins, Trevor looks beat up. We see him roll up a body in a rug and drive it in his pick up truck to eventually dump it in a body of water. He has trouble getting it down a concrete incline. Just as it's about to fall in--the viewer can't actually tell if the body will make it or get stuck on the bottom of the incline, someone approaches Trevor and questions him.Very quickly, director Brad Anderson cuts to another point in time. We learn some odd things about Trevor, who still looks awful even though he's no longer beat-up at this different time. Apparently he hasn't been able to sleep in a year. He is so thin he looks skeletal and extremely unhealthy (achieved by Bale incredibly almost abusing himself for the role--he lost 60 pounds, or a third of his weight). He's emotionally alienated from his blue-collar job. He spends his nights either with his prostitute girlfriend, Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) or at the airport diner, talking to Marie (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón). Even more oddly, he runs into a strange man named Ivan (John Sharian) in the parking lot at work. Ivan, who seems slightly prescient and dangerous, has just taken over the shift of the usual arc welder. After Ivan distracts Trevor to the point that he causes a serious accident, others claim that there is no such man working at the machine shop. Who is Ivan? Why are others denying knowledge of him? What was that opening scene all about? The Machinist is a slow, hallucinatory descent into a nightmare world for Trevor. Can he discover the truth and find his way out? The Machinist fits rather neatly into two relatively recent subgenres. It is both a "rubber reality" and "Hell handbasket" film. "Rubber reality" is coming into fairly common usage. For a description of "Hell handbasket", see my review of The Out-of-Towners (1970). As a rubber reality film, The Machinist bears resemblances to fare as diverse as Identity (2003), Mulholland Drive (2001), eXistenZ (1999)--also starring Leigh, by the way, Memento (2000) and The Sixth Sense (1999). Like another rubber reality film, The Matrix (1999), The Machinist takes a literary work as something of a subtextual compatriot. In the case of The Matrix, the subtextual pairing was with Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation. Here, Anderson invokes Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Early on, we see Trevor reading Dostoyevsky's The Idiot, and later, we see a reference to his novel Crime and Punishment. Both references comment on the underlying nature of The Machinist, one in parallel, the other more ironically, but we could also see both as parallels given a more phenomenological progression of events.That kind of "deeper" intellectualism is prominent in rubber reality films; the ontology tends to reflect similar ideas rooted in both philosophy--especially postmodernism, and the sciences--especially some of the conventional views about and implications of quantum mechanics. However, one of the slight problems with The Machinist, in my eyes, at least, was that as a rubber reality film, it might be just a bit _too_ straightforward and transparent. Part of that, though, is surely that by now, we've seen so many rubber reality films that these twists, turns and reinterpretations are almost predictable. The genre seems to have hinged at least a bit on its mindjob abilities, and predictability isn't exactly compatible with that.But Anderson mostly makes up for the film's simplicity and transparency with thick atmosphere. The atmosphere is aided by Roque Ba?os' Bernard Herrmannesque score, but it is especially conveyed by the tasty cinematography, which is extremely desaturated--almost approaching black and white at times. It suggests an appropriate desolation. This is also reflected in the locations and set designs. On the "making of" documentary included on the DVD, Anderson says that he was aiming for making Barcelona, Spain--where the film was shot--look like Los Angeles, where it was apparently set per the script. However, he did something better than that. He made Barcelona look otherworldly, eerie and desert-like in its architectural space.These visual attitudes of desolation and desertedness are paralleled with Bale's creepy, disturbing-looking thinness (somewhat suggestive of Thinner, 1996), which is subtextually correlated with Reznik's psychological state. In these respects, The Machinist is an ingenious artistic work.However, even though a kind of distancing or overall atmosphere of alienation is appropriate, and the cast masterfully achieves it, that disposition can prove to be a problem for a viewer trying to "get into" the film. For example, my wife didn't like The Machinist nearly as much as I did. For her, the film was a bit too slow and uneventful, without much provided to grab on to the characters. That criticism makes sense if you're not a fan of more deliberate, subtle films like this (and that describes my wife fairly well). But if you aren't primarily looking for something fast paced or action packed and you have a ken for thematic subtlety and complexity, The Machinist just might fit your bill for a relatively twisted and gloomy thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film was a let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into this film having been enticed by the interesting trailers. The film had an interesting premise, and the fact that the lead actor lost so much weight for the role must have said something about the significance of the film. Halfway through the film, however, all my hopes were dashed. I realized that I was entirely apathetic to the characters and the chiche plot. The film tried to be interesting, dynamic and unpredictable but failed in every way. It was entirely predictable and uninteresting. Cinematographically, the film was beautiful, but that's about the only thing it had going for it. That, and good acting from veteran actors. The script, which attempted to be thrilling, failed to evoke any emotion. I don't remember the last time I was so annoyed by a film. Me, and everyone I was with, felt as if we had wasted two hours of our life on a meaningless piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist gives us the story of a man who hasn't slept in over a year. He's losing weight, his health is declining, and there's the possibility he's losing his sanity.Christian Bale is excellent as the emaciated machinist, Trevor Reznik. The amount of weight he lost for this role is truly shocking. He lives in a dark, depressing world, in which he is (literally) slowly disappearing. Eventually he starts seeing strange things: A creepy coworker no one else can see. A waitress and her child who might not even exist. Cryptic notes are left on his refrigerator at home. Is he the victim of a conspiracy, or is he losing his mind?The film attempts to weave a complex plot that keeps us guessing by blurring fantasy and reality. The Machinist falls in the same genre as Fight Club, Donnie Darko and Mulholland Drive. However, while those excellent movies gave us complex characters and intricate plots, there's not much mysterious about The Machinist. Most seasoned movie-watchers will guess that Reznik is living in a fantasy world fairly quickly. There's no real shock or surprise at the conclusion. We've seen this done before in better films.I won't give an exact spoiler detailing what has caused Reznik's psychological break from reality. Rest assured, it's fairly trite and expected. This is essentially a morality tale about lingering guilt and eventually doing the right thing. For a film with an artistic, independent attitude, The Machinist is little more than a formulaic psychological thriller. Director Brad Anderson is clearly talented and this movie almost worked brilliantly. It just needed a little more complexity in character development and plot to truly engage (and surprise) the audience. After well over an hour of building suspense, one is left disappointed by the mundane conclusion.</fullReview>

After seeing it, I made the conclusion that I had been kind of "stunned" for 85% of the movie, due to that it was really hard to keep up with the story but I did percept that this was the movie's intention to do. The Machinist is a really original movie and if you thought that you liked schizophrenic movies like 'Fight Club', you'll love this one as well.This piece does easily score 8/10 for me, and I must admit that I was really mentally tired after seeing this. With this movie, it seems that even David Lynch gets a rough time beating this piece in level of weirdness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kamikaze Bale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist was made with Spanish money but had an undoubted international vocation (the cast, the perfect making). The movie it's all about the bad conscience as a weapon of massive destruction of our lives. Not only keeps us awake night over night but also absorbs our whole existence, it fattens up out of our suffering. The audience will be completely disconcerted for about 80 minutes, because the story, the "whys", the "hows" will show up at the very end of the film in only 2 or 3 minutes. Anyway, the images are powerful enough to get you stuck to your seat. So The Machinist is a nice thriller in the Lynch way (never as good as the Canadian genius)... but there's something in it that deserves to be underlined: Mr. Christian Bale. What an actor! He's a real kamikaze, just like Lon Chaney, just like De Niro used to be. Bale lost so much weight for the movie that he looks like a living-dead (I guess they didn't need any make-up). Someone who puts in risk his own physique just to build the perfect character can only receive our praises. The rest of the cast shrinks compared with Bale's work, but Jennifer Jason Leigh makes a good job (her typical "living on the edge" role), and Aitana Sánchez Gijón demonstrates she's as good acting in English as she is in Spanish. If you liked "Lost Highway" or "Memento" go and give "The machinist" a chance, you won't repent.*My rate: 7/10 (20/10 for Bale!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's 'Fight Club' meets 'Memento' in this daring episode of paranoia that will keep you thinking throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist, aka El Maquinista, is a brilliantly made film by Brad Anderson. Starring Christian Bale (The Prestige, Batman Begins) in a stunning and powerful performance, The Machinist is a real workout for your brain that will leave you feeling drained by the time the conclusion rolls around.Trevor Reznik (Bale) is not your every day man. For starters, he is emaciated beyond belief, weighing in at about 120 pounds. There's also the fact that he hasn't slept in a year. Insomnia to the fullest. After a horrible exchange with a co-worker (Michael Ironside), we see him begin to doubt everything from the loyalties of his friends to his own existence.The stand outs of the film are Christian Bale and Brad Anderson, the star and director. Anderson gives us a film that is dark, gritty, and extremely real. Anderson's direction is very similar to that of Alfred Hitchcock, and that's never a bad thing. It is also extremely intense, and the viewers who get lost in plots easily or can't take a lot of intense material may want to use caution or stay away from this movie. Christian Bale proves just how talented and dedicated an actor he is in this film by transforming his normally huge and muscular frame (see Batman Begins or Reign of Fire to understand it) into the beyond skinny man that is Trevor Reznik. Imagine Christian Bale at 120 pounds. Bale's performance is perfect as well, as he really knows how to get his feelings across without speaking, an ability that is crucial for this role. It is one of Bale's most prolific performances, by far. The Machinist contains many twists like the 2000 hit 'Memento', and has an ending that is as unexpected and impactful as 'Fight Club'. It is an excellent exercise in psychological horror that will keep you guessing during the entire movie. Another plus is that it is not that long (just over 100 minutes), so you stay interested the whole time. Due to brief graphic violence, language, some nudity, and extremely difficult plot details, I recommend 'The Machinist' to anyone over age 16. It really is a diamond in the rough that you can't afford to miss.9/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen, it could have worked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I think it's well established that this film is a failure of the "is it real?"" plot. People here are quick to cite the fact that this genre's recent popularity may have jaded them and made them aware of what was going to happen.But the problem is not the formula, the problem is the execution. Many reviewers have mentioned "Fight Club" and "Memento" or "Beautiful Mind" as examples of successes in this storyline. But the crucial difference between these films and The Machinist is that, in the more successful films, the events which are later to be explained as madness are at least remotely believable.In "Fight Club", we believe in the existence of Tyler Durden because he actually interacts with more people than just the main character. In "The Machinist", Ivan never interacts with anyone other than Trevor.Later, when the foreman told Trevor that there was no such person as Ivan, I didn't feel any surprise. Instead I felt insulted. "Did they expect to catch me off guard with that? Of course he's not real!", I thought to myself. The film does nothing to lend any believability to Ivan's existence.In the end, the film gives away the supposed twist with such obviousness, the only way they could possibly have surprised the audience would have been to reveal, at the end, that Trevor was in fact correct, that his boss, co-workers, escort, girlfriend, and Ivan were all actually conspiring against him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dread-ful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one can accuse Christian Bale of taking his profession lightly. While it's not uncommon to hear of established actors losing or gaining a few pounds for a role, Bale shocked viewers everywhere when he first appeared on screen in 2004's 'The Machinist' looking so emaciated he could squeeze through prison bars (with room to spare). His shocking 63-pound weight loss is said to be a record for any actor for a movie role. What's even more remarkable is how he quickly bulked up right afterwards to play the Caped Crusader in the following year's 'Batman Begins'. While such wild weight swinging is hardly recommendable, Bale makes the effort worthwhile by sinking his teeth so deep into his role as troubled insomniac Trevor Reznik that the mere sight of him on screen is enough to send shivers down your spine. Of course, in Brad Anderson's masterful suspense chiller, that's precisely the point. Playing the titular machinist who hasn't slept in a year, Bale's deep, hollow eye sockets and rail thin physique are the perfect foreground for Anderson's tension-filled tale of guilt, forgiveness, and ultimately, redemption. Under no circumstances a feel-good film, 'The Machinist' ratchets up the sense of dread with every passing moment. Showcasing a talented cast that also includes Jennifer Jason Leigh in her umpteenth prostitute role, the movie offers no respite for those looking for frothy entertainment. Moody set pieces and a tightly wound plot make this a successful exercise in high-concept storytelling. Don't be fooled into believing that the semi-predictable plot twist is what the film's about -- this is no Shyamalan venture. 'The Machinist' is coated with several layers of subtext that almost demands a second viewing. With a film this disturbing, that might just be too much to ask for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcockian psychological gut-wrencher - well done! AMBIGUOUS SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era where 'feel good' films seem to be the only stuff getting any attention (maybe because the state of global politics is forcing us all into deep states of denial), it should be no surprise that this spell-binding odyssey of psychological terror slipped by with little fanfare. The Machinist is disturbing from start to finish and executed with style. The pace is a bit plodding, but the excellent performances, and the highly compelling plot pay off very well.Christian Bale gives a strong performance in a very physically and emotionally demanding role. He plays a machinist, Trevor Reznick, who has not slept for a very long time and whose dream-world is beginning to impinge on his conscious mind. In short, he is losing his grip, and some very bad things are happening because of it. Bale's appearance alone is ghastly in this film - he is so thin that the frequent scenes depicting him without a shirt are instantly depressing. The film dances on a tightrope between reality and paranoid delusion consistently. Excellent supporting work by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Ironside help drive the story. Leigh plays a prostitute who has fallen for Reznick, and is offering him a future, and, possibly salvation from himself. But Reznick seems hell bent on casting aside any hope of salvation. The plot is full of secrets, cleverly woven together to compose a non-linear post-modern mosaic of images which represent events - part of a story we are not privy to until the very end of the film.My only complaints about this very well made film are minor. I felt that the soundtrack was somewhat uninspired and a little pretentious, and I felt that one of Bale's solo scenes was poorly executed (when he is leaving Ironside's house and spots Ivan's car parked at a nearby corner). How and why this film was passed up by so many awards is a puzzle almost as difficult to solve as the film's own plot.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Hitchcock fans and those who enjoy intelligent but plot-heavy disturbing films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hitchcockian thriller executed perfectly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A somewhat original idea, with an obvious twist, is heightened by a fantastic execution and a brilliant performance. While some may write it off as a rip-off of Fight Club or Memento, I found it to be different enough so that the similarities do not detract from the quality. The tone is quite dark and grim, but the style is exceptionally Hitchcockian, and very well done. The ending is quite easy to see coming, but the lead-up is much better. The slow reveal of the mystery is perfectly done. The only flaw I could see was that it's perhaps a bit slow at times, but that's just the type of movie it is. The story should be drawn out like this.Bale gives another outstanding performance here. It's amazing how versatile he is. Not only being able to lose 60 pounds for the role, but showing his character slowly dissolving into insanity as well - truly incredible. None of the supporting cast really stands out, but it's not their film. The only performance that matters is the lead one, and it's a great one. Superbly done.From a technical standpoint, the best part of the movie was the score. The music was truly haunting, and almost alien at times. It really fit well with the movie. The cinematography was also great, along with the editing and direction. They really made the atmosphere quite depressing. The production design is quite low-key, but, again, it fits. The movie has a definite style to it, and it works well.Overall, a decent story is aided by great execution to make an excellent film. The acting, directing, and music are all outstanding, and the atmosphere is dark, depressing, and effective. Despite obvious comparisons to other twisty movies, this one manages to maintain a sense of individuality, and doesn't become redundant. A movie worthy of Hitchcock himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy Psychodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is so difficult to craft a first-person narrative from the viewpoint of a psychotic. When someone does manage this feat, however, the results can be fantastic, easily trumping any other type of thriller.The Machinist is such a movie.First we have the protagonist, played remarkably by Christian Bale. The problem with first-person psychodramas of this type is keeping the audience's empathy with the creep. Yes, it will be revealed that the protagonist is actually less than savory, but the audience has to still relate to the character as if he was the protagonist. The writer and actor do this brilliantly with Trevor. You not only physically see his pain, but you find yourself caring about the guy and wondering "what in the world happened that led him to this awful fate?" We care about Trevor, yet we know that somehow he has done something horrible.Then we have the plot line. Psychodramas can overdo the plot, by overdoing the creep factor or make the person see obvious hallucinations. If it's too telegraphed you've demeaned the film by making it another teen shocker. But you can't underdo it, either, making it so boring the audience loses interest. The filmmakers here have kept a great balance. You're trying to figure out what's happening, what's real vs. what's imaginary, trying to see how the pieces fit. It's this puzzlement, with enough answers yet still enough questions, that keeps an audience involved. Too many questions and audiences give up, too many answers and the audience doesn't respect you.Finally, and most importantly, you have the climax. So many good psychothrillers resolve themselves in outlandish ways, or in mundane, pathetic ways. The Machinist ends so aptly, in a way that you can both despise and pity Trevor. So the whole build-up isn't wasted on silliness, nor is it lost in a sea of gore and action. The Machinist strikes a perfect balance.A few other things work in this film's favor: -- Supporting cast is very strong. Jennifer Jason Leigh is very believable as a sympathetic hooker, and the cast of the machine shop are spot-on (I've worked in machine shops and they got those guys down pat!). -- Cinematography. All throughout the film the lighting is just subtly off, and I mean that in a good way. It keeps you just slightly off balance, adding to the protagonist's unstable state.-- Set design. It's filmed in Spain, but dressed up as America. While I was watching this movie, I felt the surroundings were also a little bit off. I wasn't entirely sure why, until I learned it was filmed in Spain but dressed as America. This doesn't come off as cheesy at all, however. It actually adds to the "tweak" of visual psychosis. All the details are accurate, but the "feel" is wrong. It was probably a happy accident that this happened, but it does add to the feeling that Trevor simply isn't seeing things correctly.Overall, this is a well done psychodrama. 9 out of 10. For a bit of time it repeats itself, but other than that it's quite excellent.Barky</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Holocaust of the Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the camera angles and cinematography to the Bernard Hermann inspired score, this is clearly an ode to Hitchcock, and a damn good one at that. Christian Bale plays a lonely factory worker whose life is slowly unraveling due to lack of sleep. In his disoriented state of half waking/half sleep, nightmarish paranoia and a creepy mystery lead our protagonist careening down a highway to damnation...or perhaps salvation.There's lots of clever little nods to things both literary and Hollywood. Shades of "Memento," "Fight Club," and David Lynch abound, but what helps this film rise above a simple amalgamation of previous efforts in the genre is the go-for-broke performance from Bale. He literally made himself look like a Holocaust victim for the sake of the art. "If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist," people keep telling him. Physically, emotionally, and mentally, a man riddled by guilt has never before been more blazingly presented on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and gritty - a great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the middle of the mass of blockbusters, dumbed down horror movies and samey Indie dramas; it's nice to see that some filmmakers still feel the need to push the bar and deliver something different. The Machinist is a deeply dark and disturbing movie that sees Christian Bale as a worker in an industrial factory. If he were any skinnier, he wouldn't exist and he hasn't slept in a year; but still he manages to carry on his mundane existence. Things aren't quite rosy in his life either; strange things are happening to him without explanation and it isn't long before our protagonist doubts his own sanity. Christian Bale lost an amazing 63 pounds for this movie, and while it might have been a struggle for the actor; it certainly wasn't in vain! Bale's stick-like, ill appearance adds immensely to the film and if director Brad Anderson hadn't got himself such a dedicated performer in Christian Bale, The Machinist wouldn't have been half the film it is. Bale has impressed on numerous occasions, and it's about time he got praise he deserves.Christian Bale's main co-star is most definitely the atmosphere. Brad Anderson is keen to get down and dirty with this movie, and he's given it a truly downbeat, gritty style. This is absolutely great to look at, especially for fans of macabre movies. The claustrophobic camera angles add to this atmosphere and help to enforce the idea that the machinist is living in his own surreal environment. The plot works more from a premise than an actual story; but this is good as it allows the director to put the focus of the story squarely on the protagonist, and his decent into insanity provides an ample base for an intriguing movie. The Machinist is a very encouraging film, as it shows that there is still room for dark, macabre films in modern cinema. Brad Anderson's earlier feature 'Session 9' shows that the man has a real flair for atmosphere, and it will be interesting to see how his remake of George Romero's less than brilliant 'The Crazies' turns out. On the whole, this film is excellent. The atmosphere is beautifully done, the acting is superb and the film manages to keep your interest throughout. What more could you ask for?</fullReview>

But to get genuinely spooked from a film is a rare event these days. So, when it happens..one must cherish the moment. And that's what 'The Machinist' has done to me...spooked me to the core! I went into this film with little knowledge of the plot or characters, and i am glad for that. Every second of the film kept me glued to the screen, and i found myself dreading the haunting ending more than Trevor Reznik.

		<fullReview>Well, in his impressive and and literally exhausting film "The Mashinist", Brad Anderson certainly showed us what we DON'T ever want to become: insomniacs! Pitiful Trevor Reznik hasn't slept in a whole year, he's not much more than skin and bones and he has to write down memo notes on yellow post-its and stick them on the fridge, in order to remember them the next day. Trevor's condition goes from bad to even worse when he starts to spot imaginary colleagues and becomes a real danger for his fellow workers at the industrial factory. Gradually, Trevor's growing insanity leads to little clues and flashback-sequences that hint at a traumatizing event in the past and involving all the people in his surrounding. Wow, I can honestly say I was impressed by this movie! Unlike most horror fans, I didn't really care about Anderson's previous film "Session 9", despite it being dark and quite clever, but "The Machinist" is so much more involving and bitter. First and foremost, there's the masterful performance by Christian Bale and the jaw-dropping metamorphosis he went through, prior to filming. The amount of weight he lost, the impact on his own personal health... What Bale achieved here is a lot more than just preparing for a role, but it worked, since you stare at him with amazement every time he looks at his own exhausted body in the mirror. The story is really good as well, albeit nothing original and rather predictable at some points. Anderson patiently and professionally builds up a tense atmosphere and he devoted much time to selecting the absolute darkest and most depressing set pieces. The factory where Trevor works, for example, is a truly uncanny place filled with unfriendly people and dangerous machinery. Bale might be drawing most of the attention to him, but there still are some supportive roles that are definitely worth mentioning, like Jennifer Jason Leigh as the warm-hearted prostitute who comforts Trevor and Michael Ironside as his co-worker. The cinematography and narrative style of "The Machinist" are very sober, which of course suits the tone of the film best, but inevitably this also resulted in a totally unglamorous cinema release and an almost unnoticed DVD edition. That really is a shame and very unjust. This film may not be everybody's taste, but it's powerful horror/thriller film-making that can't be overlooked. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Machinist" is certainly one of the most intriguing and impressive movie I have ever seen. Impressive, because of this great actor Christian Bale that deserved a nomination to the Oscar for his excellent performance in the role of Trevor Reznik plus his effort to lose 63-pound weight to become the "walking skeleton" required by the screenplay. Intriguing, because of the mysterious and original story of a man that has not slept for one year and his insomnia drives him to loss of weight, insanity and delusion. The screenplay is slowly disclosed, following the style of "Twilight Zone" or "Jacob's Ladder". I liked this movie very much, and I was anxious until the last scene to find the motives for such bizarre behavior of Trevor. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Operário" ("The Worker")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bale at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many fine actors in cinema today, with many great performances in many great films, however when it comes to method acting,it doesn't seem to get much better than Christian Bale. For his role of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist, Bale dropped a whopping 63 pounds for his portrayal of the stick thin Insomniac. It is often common for actors and actresses to gain or lose a few pounds for an upcoming role, but to drop such an excessive amount of weight, I think its safe to say that no one can accuse Bale of taking his profession lightly. As a huge Bale fan before seeing The Machinist, one could say my opinion is quite biased, but regardless of my own opinion, Bale's performance in this film is absolutely incredible, and throughout the film I literally felt as though Bale had disappeared into another person. I found it nearly impossible not to gasp at Bale's transformation in this movie.Near the start of the film we're told that Reznik hasn't slept in a year, which, well, kind of looks obvious. This immediately left an enigma, hooking me in and making me want to know why hasn't this seemingly innocent, lonely Machinist slept in so long, and also why we are introduced to a man who looks like a walking skeleton.What I absolutely loved about this film is that director Brad Anderson and writer Scott Kosar really did hit the nail on the head of displaying themes of isolation, repression, loss and guilt in this film, as though the story is shown through Reznik's eyes, yet somehow a constant feeling of mistrust of him makes the film rather unsettling. The dark lighting that is constantly drained and ghostly adds to the idea of the themes and loss and guilt, which I found worked very well at creating quite a gloomy atmosphere full of tension and suspense in the film. The exceptionally clever camera work reflects upon the haunting imagery represented throughout different scenes, making the film particularly stand out for me especially because of how dark this film is.When I say dark, I don't mean black and white, or poor lighting, however every colour in this film seems to be faded and greying, adding to the protagonists weakened state, as though the world around Trevor is sinking as well as himself, which I found very creepy. For the duration of the film Reznik is plagued by an unpleasant character named Ivan, played very well by John Sharian, an apparently new employee where Trevor works who causes him to result in a horrific accident at their workplace which causes Trevor to become alone and mistrusted, endorsing the theme of isolation, making the film somehow darker than Trevor's eye sockets, which are a perfect reflection for his guilt and sin.There is easily recognisable suspense and mystery throughout the film which is wrapped up in the complex and well written plot, which was built up from great character development shown from Jennifer Jason Leigh's pleasurable portrayal of Reznik's 'friend in need' Stevie, as well as rather mysterious characters such as Ivan and Marie. I feel that some would find the climax of the film predictable and bleak, however I found that the twist was so dark and gripping I honestly felt as though Trevor has become part of my own life because of how much I ended up feeling sorry for this character, instead of it decaying my enjoyment of the film.For viewers who are just casual movie watchers as something to pass the time, or viewers who don't like anything more complicated and unsettling than Twilight or Transformers, I certainly don't recommend this film as it is disturbing, complex, and well written. However for those who appreciate a fantastic script and memorable cinematography, as well as a plot twist that will keep you on the edge of your seat, I recommend this, as it definitely engages with those points. I very much enjoyed the film, although I did find it quite unsettling at times, as it really does represent a man's horror and fragile state of mind. The Machinist is a film I will most certainly remember, which leads me to giving it a well earned 8/10.</fullReview>

Acceptance is essential for everything that is (present) and comes (future), otherwise it'll haunt you, until it gets your attention; or in cases like in the movie, where your pasts is a Trauma, inacceptance results in nightmare and false reality. You can't betray your own mind - it knows you best and also all your tricks. So happened in the movie: Just after realizing himself haunting him, he became aware or all the suppressed memories and accepted his past by confessing his murder. And right in this moment, after confessing and becoming peaceful with himself he finally found sleep again , after being awake for over a whole year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A darkly disturbing masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always thought of Christian Bale as being a bit of a mediocre actor until I saw this movie. Not only is his acting and portrayal of a paranoid insomniac superb but the amount of dedication he put into this movie never fails to amaze me. I didn't even recognise him in the flashback scenes near the end.The atmosphere in this movie is quite dark and is reminiscence somewhat of the film noir genre. The plot delves deep into the characters life and makes you feel sympathetic for this crazed character which is quite an achievement in script writing and also in the acting too.This has to be one of the best scripts I have seen made into a film. First of all, the plot is simple to follow (some people would compare The Machinist to Memento, which I found very confusing and therefore, I lost interest)and yet it is complex enough and deep enough to keep an audience captured for almost two hours. There were some parts to this movie such as the hangman games which gives the audience the chance to think they have the right answer, but then the protagonist takes you down a completely different road and makes you doubt yourself, only to come back to the same answer at the end. Killer.As it goes along it seems a very obvious plot, you think you know what will happen, and then it doesn't, only for it to happen at the end. This I found was a great take on turning a predictable film into an unpredictable one.One more thing which made this movie great was the cinematography. The filters and washed out colours used in the camera work, really helped to fit in with the feel of the movie, reminding me of the film Se7en which is another great movie IMO, and the score used in this was also great, bringing back music from older classic horror and thriller type movies.If you're a fan of Fight Club, Memento, Se7en or any type of film like these, I would suggest watching this. The atmosphere in the movie is darkly disturbing and it has a great plot. Although, if you're expecting some sort of horror movie this isn't what you're looking for. This film isn't made to outright scare the viewer, it has creepy scenes believe me but the horror is more subtle and toned down which somehow makes it more dark.If I had one thing to say about this movie I would say it is very unknown and underrated for what it is, because quite frankly, it's a masterpiece.</fullReview>

Well, I must say that right from the start I was captivated by Christian Bale's fantastic performance as a man seemingly sliding into insanity. Throughout the film Bale manages to make his character a likable, ordinary guy whilst at the same time time giving him a quite scary and unpredictable edge which makes the viewer nervous. You are constantly on edge, expecting him to go off like a time-bomb at any second and frightened for the other characters as to what he might do to them! I can fully understand that this dark film may not be to everyone's taste, but it is undoubtedly a superb exercise in the highest quality acting from the entire cast. It is also an example of what great cinema can achieve, knocking all the Hollywood dross that we are force fed into a cocked hat! An excellent film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Art of Acting at its best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Machinist" is a bleached, taught yet engaging Motion Picture. The standout feature of this pessimistic film is the remarkable central performance by Christian Bale. On its impressive strengths alone the film should be seen.Christian Bale is a very talented actor, it did not come easy, but he has finally made it. His performance in "American Psycho" was excellent and marked the moment of his arrival as an actor. That does not mean that all his subsequent work and choices have been good, I have seen him act very poorly. This may not be his fault, as usually the blame for poor performance should rest with the director. This performance is marked by that of an artist becoming one with the art. Is he acting or being? It is truly impressive how far actors will go for the sake of their art (See my review of Visitor Q).In this case the director Brad Anderson seems assured and confident. The result is a controlled and claustrophobic Motion Picture, that seems almost to have been shot in black and white. I really enjoyed this film more for the lead performance than anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie; takes an unoriginal concept and does it right for the first time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only things I didn't really like about this movie are the unoriginal basic concept, and the predictable twist. Other than that it is very well done.The movie is based around the idea of a tormented individual with a guilty conscience creating guilty figures in his mind whom he pursues to bring to justice, and ultimately, discovers his own guilt. Various versions of this idea have been done quite a bit and it tends to get a little old, which is one thing that made the twist more predictable.As for the twist, the movie was obviously intended to make the viewer think that there was an elaborate conspiracy against the main character, which would be even less original, had it been the case, but reveal that it is all his internal struggle to bring himself to justice. The issue is that you never really trust the main character as an entirely mentally stable person, especially as you are given a number of clues of his insanity, so when other reliable characters, ones who have no apparent motive to be involved with this conspiracy, other than possibly money, as mentioned by the main character, contradict his claims, you are naturally inclined to believe them. Basically, aside from specifics, there are no surprises at the end.However, in these flaws there are some very unique qualities. For one, as I mentioned, you never really trust the main character, and for that matter, he's not very likable either. It seems like every other movie like this one, the central character is portrayed as some together, happy individual in order to make him seem more trustworthy and make the twist less predictable. I, personally, don't think sacrificing the realism is worth it. Trevor gradually deteriorates from a lonely blue-collar worker with minor issues with obsessiveness and insomnia through several stages of psychosis, until he finally sheds it all with the admission of his guilt, and can finally sleep again with his return to reality. Movies that are somewhat similar (High Tension , Memento, etc.) portray a totally innocent, trustworthy character throughout the movie, then dump on the reality at the very last minute. Sure, it's shocking, but it's hard to buy, and really hurts the believability of the characters.Within his mind, aside from Trevor pursuing Ivan, the incarnation of his own guilt, he also pursues the victims of his crime for reconciliation. The time spent with Marie seem to distract from the main plot until the end. It is the only time in the movie you feel you actually like Trevor.Aside from the plot, this photography in this film is beautiful and really captures the mood of the story.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale went above and beyond in the making of this film about a man who is literally killing himself. Trevor hasn't slept in a year and is having hallucinations and is slowly starving himself. It opens with him rolling up a body in a rug and bring it to a beach to dispose of it and then flashes back and forth between reality and a dream like state. Trevor has this obsession with bleaching his hands as if to get rid of some invisible dirt and frequents a coffee shop in the airport at 1:30am every night. He is being followed or is following a man known only as Ivan who claims to be a co-worker with toes on his fingers. He writes everything down on post-it notes and becomes even more confused when a post-it appears on his fridge with a hang man game that is spelling out a 7 letter word ending in "er". The skeleton of a man that was once Christian Bale is scary. He really didn't eat to prep for this role and is disgustingly thin (and I like the thin guys but wow to thin.)

		<fullReview>(note: my name is Geoffrey Vandervoort, can't seem to get that right) The Machinist is a controversial movie. It was produced in Barcelona in stead if the U.S.A. and features Hollywood actors such as Christian Bale along with native Spanish actors and ex-pats. It's style is very direct and visual, which is a good thing if you like realism like I do. However, the story that is portrayed is so dark and horrific, that you will be aching to stop watching at times. Christian Bale, the main actor, lost a LOT of weight for this movie, and his mind-bending adventures combine with the previous fact into sinister and disgusting scenes. However, the plot is simply brilliant and the colorless industrial settings and '30-'40-like music perfectly match the whole atmosphere of the movie. Of course, you could say that a lot of story has been seen in Fight Club or Alzheimer Case if you know that one, but the differences are significant and I feel that this movie has done a better job in capturing the desired feel for such a movie. It is also very re-playable because you'll always miss something on the first view. The references are intelligent and enjoyable. I give this picture 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale is fast becoming one of my favourite actors. After all, he was the man who singlehandedly got Batman back on track after the disastrous course Joel Schumacher took the series in. He'd already made a name for himself from a very young age with Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun and then turned in a career making performance in American Psycho. But just before Bale slipped on the cape and cowl, he went through an equally striking transformation in The Machinist, a part that required him to lose a staggering 60 pounds. And its all up there on the screen for us to see.Bale plays the emaciated Trevor Reznik. The man is a literal walking skeleton. When he takes off his top his ribcage is obvious to see. You can see his shoulder blades as well as his spinal cord. And his eyes are hollowed out. If you can sit through those scenes without squirming in your seat your made of sterner stuff than I am.Trevor works a lathe at a local factory. He's alienated from his co-workers who are repulsed by his spindly frame. He hasn't slept in a year. And the only release he gets from his wretched existence are trysts with a hooker, Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and late night conversations with Marie, a waitress at an airport diner.Trevor is haunted by a past he can't quite put together. After all, something is causing his insomnia. And his weight loss. A carefully directed chain of events, such as a mysteriously filled in Hangman puzzle on his fridge, lead Trevor into paranoia and despair. As well as visits from Ivan (John Sharian, a dead ringer for Marlon Brando), a person who only appears to Trevor. Its at this point Trevor begins to question his own sanity. And why did the opening scene show him dumping something rolled up in a carpet into the sea?The Machinist is a film that obviously has influences from other films like Taxi Driver and Memento. All loners traversing a world seemingly at odds with them. Christian Bale gives one of the most powerful performances of his career. The fact that he was willing to lose so much weight (at risk to his health) shows how committed an actor he is. The lengths he will go to disappear into a character is truly extraordinary.Bale gives a carefully modulated performance of a man losing touch with his humanity. Some of the dialogue from Scott Kosar is beautifully crafted around Trevor's character and cuts right to the bone ("If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist").Brad Anderson is a filmmaker with a talent for darkly driven psychological motivation. He's careful the way he showcases Trevor's increasing instability and fragmented mental state. There are some great touches throughout, like the ghost train ride Trevor's on at a carnival that turns into a frightening journey through the maze of Trevor's psychosis.It wouldn't be half as effective a psychological thriller as it is without Bale at the centre of it. He is The Machinist's heart and soul. Two things that are gradually chipped away as the film progresses. Weight loss is also an excellent metaphor to signify Trevor's mental state. He is a man who wants to disappear inside himself. He's just not sure why. And he's a man who wants to reconstruct the puzzle of his life, without all the pieces.The Machinist is also a film with a dark, brooding edge. The gloomy, washed out cinematography heightens the oppressive mood hanging over Trevor. And when his growing dementia starts to take on a life of its own, the images it conjures up are intensely weird and scary as hell.The ending is a little confusing and a little commonplace at the same time, but I assume The Machinist is a film that once you've deconstructed its major plot twists, it will leave you with a sense of satisfaction as time goes on. But the climax definitely holds an undeniable charge, and that final scene is a surprising ray of hope in an otherwise depressing situation.Kudos to Christian Bale for turning in another masterful performance, and for accepting a role that must have been an exhausting and physically demanding one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Machinist - A review by Dave Gledhill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the opening scene of The Machinist, two things become apparent very quickly. Firstly, its lead actor, Christian Bale is a long way away from the well-built healthy appearance he showcases in both "Batman Begins" and "Equilibrium". Having lost 40lbs (Just under three stone) for the role, Bale looks a sad skeleton of a man, haunted, broken and unwell.As the camera pans out around Bale's sunken and battered features, taking in a pitch-black coastline and a deserted nightscape, the second more alarming aspect of the scene is revealed. Bales character Trevor Reznik appears to be frantically trying to edge a corpse, rolled in carpet, off the edge of a cliff.As openers go, this obviously poses more than a few questions to the viewer (Who is this guy? Who's in the carpet? How did they both get there?), and this trend continues from beginning to end with twists intertwined throughout the films complicated plot line.On the surface, Trevor Reznik has a reasonably basic, if not slightly unusual life. He lives on his own, he pays his rent on time and he works as a machinist in an industrial factory for an unappreciative and unpleasant foreman.However, despite the exterior normality of Trevor's routine several things quickly indicate that all is not well in his life. Trevor cannot sleep and has not slept in quite some time. He spends most of his time, scrubbing both his hands and bathroom floor with litres of bleach. Significantly, Trevor's only human interaction outside of his day job is with a pretty but downtrodden prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh).As Reznik's insomnia begins to take its toll on his mental state as well as the more than apparent punishment that is echoed in his gaunt reflection, things take a definite turn for the worse. Trevor's mind starts to become unravelled and his grip on reality is tested when a mysterious and obnoxious stranger named Ivan (John Sharian) seems to be deliberately making his life difficult.The pace of the film is rapid and does not hold back on throwing key plot elements into the mix right from the outset. Because of its frenetic energy and relentless need for attention, this outing by director Brad Anderson (Largely unknown prior to this project, having being mainly involved in TV work) will test most peoples ability to take in all it has to offer in one sitting.What sets this film apart from other titles I've watched this year is the sheer quality of both its acting and its direction. Bale is utterly convincing as Reznik and draws you effortlessly into his deranged world of uncertainty as it begins to crumble around him. An excellent supporting cast only works to strengthen the impact of the characters further with Jennifer Jason Leigh playing the tart with a heart to perfection.Anderson's direction is deliberately basic (most of the film takes place in a handful of locations) but is utterly engrossing and proves to be a grounded but emotionally involving nerve shredder.For those of you who enjoy tense, dark and overall entertaining thrillers, this film comes highly recommended and is guaranteed to keep you thinking as the credits roll.For those of you who like your films straightforward enough to be able to watch over a Chinese while you decide what to do at the weekend, this probably isn't for you.Overall rating: 9/10 (Because its initial complexity may put some people off).One-minute summary: Great film, Great script, Great twists. This will have you coming back for a second and third viewing, just so you can stop trying to figure out what the hell actually happened.You will like this film if you liked: Fight Club, Memento, Usual Suspects.You will not like this film if: You thought Bambi was complicated, have a low tolerance for plot twists, are about to roll someone into a carpet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superbly Dark Hitchcockian Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie! The Machinist is a very dark Hitchcockian thriller that packs a real punch, is there any role that Christian Bale can't do? The guy sweats blood for a role like Trevor Reznik and is barely mentioned for an Oscar! He gave everything to this role and will definitely get an Oscar sometime in the near future for the personal sacrifices he makes for his parts. He lost about 6 stone for this and gained 7 for Batman Begins - now that's dedication! The Twist at the end can be spotted earlier but if you go with the intention of getting a kick out of it just go with the flow and paranoia of the movie and you'll love it. Dark thrillers don't come much better than this and Brad Anderson directs with much style and class. Bale is brilliant, ably supported by the stunning Aiton Sanchez-Gijon as the female interest/link, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michael Ironside ( who keeps losing arms in film roles! Total Recall!) and John Sharian as Ivan, who plays the best alter ego role of recent times. Also the settings are superb as the production was filmed in Barcelona and made to look like L.A. and the music by Roque Bannos is suitably very creepy and gives the movie a gritty, moody edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many actors will go to great lengths to transform themselves into the characters they play.Robert De Niro gained 55 pounds for "Raging Bull." On the other end of the spectrum, Matt Damon lost 40 pounds for his role in "Courage Under Fire." Christian Bale ("American Psycho") made both of these accomplishments look tame. He lost 63 pounds, weighing in at 130 after a diet of a can of tuna and an apple a day, to play an insomniac in the newly released "The Machinist." In this thriller filmed in Spain, Trevor Reznik (Bale) works long hours in a machine factory and is haunted by his past, causing him not to sleep for over a year.Reznik lives in a world of paranoia and conspiracy theories.He spends his nights in a diner sharing his secrets with waitress Marie (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, "A Walk in the Clouds") or with Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh, "In The Cut"), a prostitute who is in love with him.His job as a lathe operator is rough ? and, without sleep, so is his mental comprehension.One night Reznik meets Ivan, a new employee who distracts him to the point of causing an accident. As a result, a co-worker loses a limb and Reznik's employer no longer trusts him.After screaming at the factory about everyone supposedly trying to kill him, Reznik is fired. He goes into a deep depression ? playing hangman on Post-its to figure out his identity ? that ultimately leads to insomnia.Bale's performance as a man dying of insomnia is truly astonishing. The images of his emaciated body are haunting, and one can feel the life leaving him as he spirals into a painful neurosis.Director Brad Anderson ("Session 9") has the ability to make the audience feel like it actually knows the characters. Like classic directors Stanley Kubrick ("A Clockwork Orange"), Roman Polanski ("Chinatown") and Alfred Hitchcock ("Psycho"), Anderson has the ability to make a powerful psychological thriller without relying on external killers for horror.Although there is a twist ending, it is very predictable. The clues the movie reveals are almost the same as in other movies with similar endings.But that doesn't render the movie any less entertaining or frightening."The Machinist" has the identity elements of "Memento" and "Fight Club" and a dark feel reminiscent of Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered a movie would be better if you could change something in it? Has it ever occurred to you that if this and that had been done differently in a movie, you'd like it much more that you already do? Well,in this case, those questions are all answered NO. This IS the perfect movie in every way! You cannot find any deficiency in it, you cannot make it any better and you certainly cant deny its brilliance!Christian Bale, as always, acts extraordinary and in my opinion, his acting in this particular movie is the best in his entire career so far. He will make you believe in Trevor Reznik and before you know it, you'll be sucked into the tension that Trovor is in, you'll feel what hes feeling and this is the magic of Christian Bale. Either if you like him or you think of him as a mediocre actor, you will love his performance in The Machinist.Brad Anderson is one of those directors who hasn't done anything bad so far. Particularly in this movie there are so many unique scenes that no director could pull off easily. The way he forces the atmosphere to the audience is just amazing and I had never experienced such brilliance in building tension from another director whether it was Chris Nolan or Ed Wood. What I'm trying to say is if ANYONE else had directed The Machinist it never could have been as good as how it is with Brad Anderson.Scott Kosar is somehow an underrated writer who hasn't done much yet but he certainly shows he is an excellent horror writer and I hope he proves to be one of the best in the future. By watching The Machinist, anyone could see how much potential he has. It doesn't matter who you are, how many people have you killed or even if you're into horror movies or not. This will be an entirely different movie experience for you and you will truly enjoy The Machinist for IT IS The Absolute Masterpiece of Cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody psychological flick with incredible actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the ingenious "Session 9" I was really eager for "The Machinist". Basically the 2 movies have a lot in common in the end... both set up a dark, intriguing atmosphere, giving irritating hints here and there and blurring the lines between reality and imagination. Both movies have incredible lead actors who kind of get to your heart. Christian Bales Character is played perfectly ... not just that he looks so broken with the dozen pounds he lost but he has the same way of going to your heart because he has this soft and broken and lost look in his eyes which makes the end of this movie as dramatic and heart-breaking as "Session 9"."The machinist" is about a heavy machine operator played by Christian Bale who suffers from insomnia and has his reality breaking down on him, seeing strange characters, eerie notes on his refrigerator and getting paranoid with all his surrounding seeming to turn against him. Of course there is a lot of Memento and Fight Club in this movie but even more its Session 9. After all "The machinist" is a deeply psychological movie about facing your inner demons and what the human psyche can play to cope with extreme situations. The recurring bloody refrigerator scene was such a perfect image for this with Bale staring on the post-it sticker only and his mind blurring out the parts of reality he just doesn't want to see.Actually I think the movie was a bit too stretched but it still manages to keep the viewer tense and waiting for the twist which in this case is as far from a horror movie or thriller as can be. Its a great movie with incredibly humane acting by all involved, especially Christian Bale. If you loved this don't hesitate to watch "Session 9".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A murky psychological thriller with depth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist is a film that references the big-budget Hollywood of Fight Club and the more low-key surrealism of David Lynch... managing to fashion a story that seems to make sense, whilst simultaneously, taking us through numerous bizarre twists and turns. As a thriller in the psychological sense the film is great, and more that stands up to repeated viewing; allowing us, as an audience, to go back and re-discover some of the images and subtle clues woven into the labyrinthine-like script, even once we're familiar with the ending.Right from the start we know that our protagonist Trevor is somewhat unhinged, and we can tell from the bleak cinematography (offering us a depiction of black and white in colour) and the grimy, minimalist production design, that this isn't going to be the kind of film that leaves us with a sweet, sugar-coated climax. Instead, the film is darkly intriguing and surprisingly intelligent, what with it's references to Kafka, Lynch, and allusions to Dostoevsky, in fact, even more surprising given the fact that scriptwriter Scott Kosar was also responsible for the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Amityville Horror remakes!! Perhaps the greatness of this film has something to with director Brad Anderson...? Though, to be honest, I'm unfamiliar with his previous work; the overall handling of the mood, style and pacing of this film is exceptional though, with the story presenting the audience with a serious of hints and clues to the enigma at it's heart, without ever feeling the need to beat us over the head with over-blown symbolism or trite hand-holding.There are some astounding images in the film too, not least the sight of Christian Bale, hunched and emaciated beyond recognition, left cowering and crying in the corner of his apartment towards the end of the final act... but also, a terrifying trip through a fairground's haunted roller-coaster, a man with a badly mangled hand, and a refrigerator that constantly drips blood. As effective as both the script and direction are, the film is really carried by Bale, who here gives a tremendous performance only hinted at in his previous work (well... specifically, American Psycho), taking the method to extreme ends to portray the insomniac machine-worker, trying to make sense of a world in which everyone's a possible fiend.There's strong support from Jennifer-Jason Leigh, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, Michael Ironside, Craig Stevenson, Anna Massey and the sinister John Sharian, who offer help, or persecution (depending on how you look at it), whilst simultaneously adding to the wavering atmosphere of dread and unease so perfectly created by the director. The film definitely works as both a dreamlike mystery and a surreal thriller (with hints of straight-drama, moments of industrial horror and metaphorical existentialism all thrown in too) and certainly rewards repeated viewings for those wanting to revisit the major narrative turning points littered throughout the script. Though it should be said that those looking for light-entertainment might find the continually dark locations and sinister characters slightly off-putting, those with a fondness for filmmakers like Lynch, Polanski and David Fincher, will certainly appreciate the film's bleak themes and dark sense of irony.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first movie I can say I watched whilst noticing different clues throughout every time I watched it.Picking it up for about $14.00 AUD...I saw the comment "Fight Club meets Memento". Should be interesting I thought.Again I got something different then expected. I would not describe it as Fight Club meeting Memento- I would say this is a unique movie in its own, and a highly enjoyable thriller and mystery at that. This is one of the first movies I personally watched that works with your "subconscious" so to speak, as you try to derive meaning and associations- this was another step in a new direction for me personally movie-wise - away from the traditional Hollywood films that hit our screens, and would lead me to watch classics I would have never watched such as David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, and Blue Velvet. But that is just my personal experience.My advice to you is to see this movie if you can tolerate ambiguity and like a mystery thriller..a feeling of uncertainty as the clues come together in the end for a brutal and shocking revelation that tears me up inside every time I see Bale nail the end scene perfectly. Hats off to the writer for a clever tale.This movie hit me hard so it gets 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even know where to start with this. This movie does rule a lot though. It's one of those mind-bending films that gets you thinking about it for ages after it's over. This one will stick with you. The acting is all very good as is the directing, which is very dark and grungy. You're given bone-chilling view of a man's severed hand whirling in what would be his death machine, and the ominous view from below at the beginning of the film as you see Bale looking down, wondering what it is he's staring at. It's very fitting, and reminds me a lot of movies like SAW 3 or Session 9 (the latter of which was directed by Brad Anderson, same guy who directed this, which explains a lot), what with the overall creepy vibe set. The directing also managed to oddly remind me of Fight Club, which this movie reminds me quite a lot of plot-wise. Same principle.This is a psychological thriller, so it gets off by messing around with your brain. The Machinist does that quite well, and you're left guessing right till the end, where a plot twist is revealed that you probably never thought of. There were many instances in this movie where I thought I could predict what was going to happen next, but I turned out to be wrong 4/5 times! This one doesn't follow a formula. The use of foreshadowing is excellently done and gave a lot of depth and intelligence to this film, made you smile when you thought back on it after the end.I won't spoil anything for you all, but this is a phenomenal psychological thriller/horror flick, and any fan of the genre needed this yesterday. Also recommended to fans of Fight Club. It's a bit short, but who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally another great film in this p***-poor movie decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing's first: I think Christian Bale is insane. To risk one's health ? and life - for a mere movie is something I don't understand at all ? even if it's a great movie such as this. Perhaps he is "The Masochinist". It is absolutely amazing to see how much weight he'd lost for this role; I guess he must have lost around half of the initial weight. And like a true "method" actor he must have hung out with fashion models to learn the tricks of the trade. It is also quite possible the director went through several actors before finally finding one who was willing to do this to himself. Fortunately he ended up with Bale, because I have to say that he has never been this good. I also have to mention here how key it was for the director to cast the right person for the role of Bale's conscience. (I wouldn't be surprised if he worked as a Brando impersonator.) The movie is one of the very best ? made in this decade ? that I've seen. The theme of reality has been explored quite well in a half dozen films that came out around the turn of the millennium, and this is another great addition. The photography is superb (creating a unique look, so essential to a movie of this nature), the soundtrack is refreshingly traditional, i.e. reminding of 50s/60s thrillers, the entire cast is good, the premise is original, the dialogue convincing, and the conclusion is not a let-down. I loved the way Anderson decided to have all the dialogue put through a special effect, giving the entire movie an even stranger, unique feel than it already would have had.Essential viewing, needless to say.</fullReview>

Guilt will control your life, your feelings, the relationships you have. Anyone is suspect, there's a plot against you! You must find who's behind all this? ?but it's all in your mind! This movie is just E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T! It has an exceptional photography as the entire film seems to be shot in a dark room! It's a "film noir" for excellence and all the grey and dark colours just give it an intense atmosphere. We can feel the dark ambiance, the dark emotions and the suspense just through its photography, but there's more?in fact, there's a lot more! There's a tremendous plot, there's great characters(Christian bale is just unbelievable!), there's mystery and suspense until the end of the movie? At the middle is a bit hard to understand the plot, because the clues are confusing, some characters are mysterious and sometimes it just seems that they don't even exist? but all the questions will be solved? I really appreciated this movie not only because of its plot or its photography but especially because it has a message of hope and redemption. There's always a solution for something you have done wrong? and you just need to find it to make yourself free! It's in the end of a dark and tortuous labyrinth, but it is right there... you just have to choose between the "Highway to hell" or "The Road to Salvation!"</fullReview>

The story of a man whose past comes back to haunt him is a familiar enough tale, the enjoyment is all in the telling. Bale delivers a powerful performance as the paranoid, misanthropic Trevor.

		<shortDescription>Sorry, usual flashback flick with character that doesn't exist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically the director had some very cool ideas for scenes he'd like to put in a movie. So he borrowed the ole' "He's crazy and sees things that aren't real" jack-of-all-trades.This isn't even a "movie" as far as I'm concerned. It makes very little sense, since the director always crosses the lines between what's real and what isn't. So for example the prostitute says that "hit and run drivers should be hanged" (and of course there's the whole thing with the post it and the hangman). Now this would be fine if this was part of the dream sequence, but this is supposed to be actually happening, so she would have no way of knowing. The movie is littered with other coincidences that could never happen in real life, and problems are conveniently glossed over without explanation.For example okay he trips the lathe's switch, which results in his workmate losing his arm. Fine, he hasn't slept in a year, so whatever, he stumbled, he saw the guy, he was distracted. But why didn't any of the safety brakes work? There's a reason they're there, and people who actually work with machines would have been way more surprised than the director evidently was.The movie sports the usual neon-lighted, greenish cast, two-thirds-stop underexposed photography, which is kept up for the whole movie pretty much uninterruptedly. The main actor was very good, but the whole thing with the thinning was a bit of an eye gimmick.In the end this movie only "makes sense": 1) you have a bit of a masochist streak and you like to be anguished (that's okay, some people like to be scared by horrors, some people like to watch this stuff) 2) You just take it as a riddle and don't try to make sense of it as a story For example: the connoisseur of the genre might think "Okay: so he was fishing in the photo, and there's a "I'd rather be fishing" bumper sticker on the car where he walks himself into the accident, so there's probably something about fish which is important. But the problem is that the presence of the bumper sticker only makes sense if you let go all suspension of disbelief or consideration for the movie being "real", and think "the director is trying to give me a hint, what is it"?But this isn't a movie, it's simply a riddle. It's on the same level of "A guy walks into the elevator of his apartment and always presses the button for the 12th floor. He then walks up the last 8 floors to his house. The elevator is in good working order and is perfectly capable of reaching the 20th floor. Why does he behave as he does?" And the answer is that he's a midget and can't reach above the 12th button. The point is that the guy who told me this story only took two minutes of my time. He didn't force me to look at one hour and thirty seven minutes of a crappily lit waith, of arms turning on lathes, and rotten fish heads on the kitchen floor. Some movies include riddles, but few good ones are BASED on one. Fight Club contains some similar themes, but the characters' actions INSPIRE US, instead of knocking us down. Honeslty, it hurt to watch this movie.In the end what was his point? People who do bad things can't sleep well? Gee, thanks Einstein. I can see how that required pounding on my testicles for two hours to explain.Watch it if you like this sort of thing.I don't want to say this movie is PARTICULARLY bad... it's a competently filmed, and very well acted specimen of a genre I HATE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regarded as a work of art, without any point of reference it's a good film with an interesting topic with some disturbing imagery and stylistic elements. Christian Bale brings final proof to me that he's a force to be reckoned with, an actor who will go to unbelievable great lengths to serve his art, and reminded me of the young De Niro. Aitana Sanchez Gijon is always a pleasure to watch, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Ironside deliver great as well.However taking originality and the time period it was created in account one cannot avoid comparing it to previously released movies(for the single, distorted point of view, including imaginary characters and rearranged elements to fit a tortured mind searching for relief) like Memento, Fight Club, Angel Heart-to name just a few. Also for those who have the exercise in decoding the prolific in the last 50 years "final twist"-genre(reminiscent Hitchcock-elements are visible, like the empty streets, absence of score and absence of true color), the movie will reveal it's secrets a bit earlier than intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated and unsatisfying besides for Bale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really know what to think about this film, it's a scrambled mess with no real plot and an ending which doesn't make much sense. The Machinist is a bad movie but I still have to very mildly recommend it for Bale who gives an outstanding performance. An outstanding performance given to a largely unlikeable character.The plot centers around Trevor Reznik, an insomniac who is repulsive to look at. He's a loner who follows the same routine, gets coffee at the airport dinner dispensed by his waitress friend Maria, and goes to the same hooker every night. He works at a pitiful looking factory where his coworkers think he is a freak. Trevor loses his grasp on his life and reality when he meets his new coworker Ivan, an eccentric nut who distracts him while he is handling heavy machinery which results in the loss of a coworkers arm. His bosses tell him this Ivan isn't on their payroll and so Trevor desperately tries to prove he is sane.It doesn't have a plot at all for the most part. It creates a surreal world but this world isn't an interesting or compelling one. It acts if this world sets you up for a big shocker ending but this ending is irrelevant to the rest of the movie besides for a few images throughout the film.The draw to this movie is Bale. Just looking at him puts you in awe. Never since Lon Chaney has an actor suffered so much for his craft. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination for this film simply for his weight loss. I kind of wished he suffered for a character that was more charismatic and engaging than this Trevor Reznik.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this movie I just knew that I had to see it. It looked tense but above all, mysterious, original and also certainly unusual. Plus it had Christian Bale in it. I'm glad that I have finally watched this movie and it certainly lived up to my expectations.Although the story itself might not be that unique or original, for it certainly uses several elements from other movies, the story is still good and mysterious on its own. Most of the things in the movie happen as a surprise and the movie leaves you guessing till the end. Therefor the scripts still remains powerful and original on its own.It's the script that mostly is the reason why this movie is an unique viewing experience. It has more than enough surprises in it and you never fully understand what is happening to the main character. You know that it can't be some sort of large scale conspiracy plot against the main character, as the main character himself thinks. It's too complex and too many unusual things are going on for that. But what exactly is going on and why, remains largely a surprise till the end.The movie is beautifully crafted by director Brad Anderson, who also provides the movie with a nice visual style. The story is nicely told in a mysterious and mostly unusual way but never without getting too complex to follow. The movie has very few characters in it and it mostly only focuses on just the main character, so we never loose track and are fully captivated with the story and feel for the main character.The main character of the movie is being played by Christian Bale, who lost a shocking amount of weight for his role. If he was any thinner, he would seize to exist. It's a real achievement, especially considering he had to get in shape again fast after this movie, for his role in "Batman Begins". But above all Christian Bale is just a wonderful actor. One of the discoveries of this decade and a name for the future. Of course he already received lots of fame after his role in the Spielberg movie "Empire of the Sun" from 1987 but it wasn't until the early '00's that he appeared in some good movies again and showed his remarkable talent and skill. He also certainly doesn't disappoint in this movie and he is good enough to basically carry the entire movie on its own. It also was great to see the actors Jennifer Jason Leigh and especially Michael Ironside in this movie. John Sharian also plays a magnificent and significant role in this movie. He's a really powerful actor with a great charismatic face.An highly recommendable movie that has plenty of surprises and will mostly leave you guessing till the end. Not the most original but certainly one of the most unique movies of this decade.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welshman Bale best young star in Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it about Welsh actors? We know about their singers like Tom Jones, Shirley Basset, Charlotte Church , Kathryn Jenkins, Harry Secombe etc But for a tiny country they produce extraordinary amount of world talent. Especially in the arts.Burton? Hopkins? Bale? Ray Milland? Stanley Baker (Zulu)Zeta Jones? Jonathon Pryce? Ian Gruffudd? Rhys Ifans? Michael Sheen (plays Blair in the Queen) etc These aren't just B listers who make a living these are the absolute elite of the elite. You don't't seem to know about trash Welsh actors they all seem to be the leads.Bale's family are chameleon artists, circus acts, actors, entertainers, mavericks. yet like all welsh actors he has that kind of mystique, strength and sort of inner steel that's impenetrable. He IS batman, he is American Psycho, he IS the Machinist.So what's the secret with Wales?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one of your friends one day would come up and say to you: "Hey, I've got a script"; let's say you read out of curiosity.You know that your friend really loved Memento and Insomnia, so you are not surprised to see how the plot unfolds. He also likes many other famous movies of the last decade, like Fight Club and many of Lynch's, so it comes as no news if there are lots of nods to those movies; he also loves classic cinema, Hitchcock is his favourite.The script is utterly boring and you thank god because it's a short read. Later, you say to him "Yeah good stuff but it won't be easy to do something like this. You know, insomnia, MPD, they have already made some really good flicks with those." He seemed turned off at first...But one month later he comes back to you; the script is pretty much the same, short for some literary references slapped in the face of the viewer and thrown in for good. You start to feel tired about this, so you say "I can see that now it really has that much more subtle touch, but I don't really think you'll find someone ready to fork out good money for something has already seen many many other times, and better done." -- "Go back to your daytime job and quit your senseless dreaming about becoming the next Fincher or Hitchcock or Lynch or whatever -- you are a machinist! that's what you do well." You don't hear back from your friend anymore, but one day, you hear of a movie that sounds pretty much familiar: and it's not only because it's souped down mashed up boring version of Yet-Another-Cult-Movie of the 90s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great directing, obvious plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist portrays Reznik, a lathe operator, struggling with unexplained insomnia, loss of weight and progressive perceptual disorder, trying to find solace in a brown-and-gray world where his only friend is a lonely prostitute. Basically that's the whole plot of this movie. Reznik doesn't have cancer (that would be a surprise) but apparently has some mental problems.Christian Bale delivers a very powerful performance, and his photo as Reznik could be used as a perfect illustration for a dictionary entry on 'gaunt'. How much weight he lost for the role is perhaps the most impressive thing about this film. The direction is skillful, effectively delivering the atmosphere of depressing self-doubt and loneliness.However, the plot is as obvious as it can be. The symbolism is superficial and shallow. "Look!", says the camera, "there are two possible turns here! How symbolic!". And then, "Look how much this scene is reminiscent of that previous scene! We'll ZOOM IN here and then ZOOM IN AGAIN in case you missed it!" There are practically no surprises on the way, especially if you've seen Hitchcock's films or something newer and shallower like The Double. Even though on the whole it feels powerful, at the end of the day I'd rather spend 2 hours re-watching Fight Club.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great thriller mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist is an instant classic. A riveting descent into madness with Christian Bale bringing his A game. Bale wastes himself away to 120 lbs of a haunting and creepy shell of a man both visually disturbing and compelling. The story ambles along laden with foreshadowing and clues keeping the viewer involved in the mystery.Not much needs to be said except "Brilliant." Well constructed and nuanced atmospheric film that will be viewed 50 years from now and not lose anything; maybe only to be elevated as an example of filmmaking at its best.It's easy to draw a parallel to Hitchcock; but maybe it is closer to the truth that The Machinist is a movie that he would have evolved to make if he had lived longer. Hitchcock would have been fascinated by Bale and his extreme dedication to his craft. My imagination takes me away to a place where Hitchcock has just finished watching The Machinist and feels just a small pang of envy...followed by an immediate call to Bale's agent for casting in his next movie. If wishes were horses...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes there are themes lifted from Hitchcock, and any avid follower will notice that Anna Massey (who was in Hitchock's 1965 film Frenzy) portrays Trevor Reznik's landlady in this psychological horror film.That said, anyone who likes Christian Bale in his "off center" performances will like him as Trevor Reznik, an anorectic machinist with major percolating issues.He lives in a bleak apartment building, buys bleach to keep his bleak apartment sanitary, and goes to work as a lathe operator. Miller operating the mill gets his arm cut off, and results in a major accident (Michael Ironside is good here as working class Miller).Jennifer Jason-Leigh is the sometime girlfriend/hooker of Trevor who at first seems to want to help.In the meantime, Reznik spends time "escaping" by talking to Marie, a waitress at the airport (this was filmed in downtown L.A. according to the directors comments). They wanted the environment to look gritty and third world. It certainly does. We cannot tell which is part fiction, in Reznik's mind, or is actually happening.There is a hit and run, an "alter-ego" Trevor has discussions with named "Ivan", and issues of guilt, without clear explanation. Trevor likes to eat at the airport in case he gets the overwhelming urge to take off, once "they" find out his true identity.Overall recommended. The genre has been done before but anyone who enjoys suspense and mystery will find this film intriguing. 9/10.Addendum: If you liked this story you will also like "Carnival of Souls" a haunting earlier version of similar story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above and beyond the call Mr Bale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout film history, there are several well documented cases of actors taking their preparation to the max. De Niro's Jake La Motta springs immediately to mind as one prepared to physically alter his body to fit the role but what Christian Bale does here is way above and beyond the call of duty. It's genuinely disturbing and yet crucial to the film to see 'Batman' looking like an Auschwitz survivor.That said, it doesn't define the film. Sure it's a key part of it but the plot is excellent, the way the film unravels (literally in the case of the reveal-all carpet scene we return to at the end) and the way Reznik's reality and his fantasy world blend so seamlessly that it takes real concentration to keep up at times, make this a really, really good psychological thriller. It's possible to work out the ending, in the same way that some guessed Sixth Sense and Usual Suspects perhaps, but it doesn't matter. Brad Andersons "The Machinist" is an excellent study of how a bad decision that a good man makes, can lead to unbearable guilt and life changing mental frailty and it's a real tick on Christian Bale's acting CV.Congrats to all concerned. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking moody film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist is a psychological thriller directed by Brad Anderson, based on a script by Scott Kosar, and produced and shot in Spain after most American production companies rejected the project as weird.Trevor Reznik hasn't slept for a year, he barely eats, and has become a loner. He founds himself at trouble after a work mate loses his hand because of his negligence, and a plot against him, involving a mysterious cocky man called Ivan, unveils. His only comfort is the company of two very different women: beautiful single-mother and bartender at the airport's coffee shop Marie, and rough sweet-and-sour prostitute Stevie. Who is Reznik, who are the others, and, more importantly, which are the answers to the hung-man post-its he founds on his fridge every night? Although this is a Suspense film, the plot succeeds more at questioning the idea of self-identity than at building up a thriller. The movie is both an analysis on the need of sleep to have a healthy mind and on the power of our unconscious to define, redefine or distort the way we see us, both physically and psychologically. In fact, Reznik's story is just a quest to respond to the question, Who am I? When the question is answered, all the pieces of the story come together in an emotional closure puzzle.I did not notice that the movie was not shot in Los Angeles but in Barcelona, although, to be honest, there was something out of place in it or awkward about some scenes, like the smallness of the space related to the scene related to the cross lights with Marie, or the atmosphere of the Police Station. Still, the atmosphere and lighting of the movie are fantastic.Christian Bale is unbelievable as the insomniac paranoiac steal worker Trevor Reznik, and one wonders why he wasn't nominated to the Oscars that year. The fact that he bothered to get so thin, a walking skeleton really, shows how committed (or crazy) he is about acting. The viewer has to be thankful, though, as his decayed physique helps his character and the movie immensely. Bale just doesn't act, he psychologically splits himself to become Reznik. And anything he does in this movie is believable, raw and authentic.Bale's counterpart Ivan is played by John Sharian, who is cheekily disturbing in his performance. You hate him immediately, physically, the way the moves, the way he dresses, the way he smiles, still, there is something appealing and warm about him. I think his performance and his physique add even more interest to the theme of Raznik's quest for identity. Aitana Sanchez Gijon and Jennifer Jason Leigh are correct as Marie and Stevie, respectively. The rest of the cast are all believable in their respective supporting roles.The main flaw of the movie is its predictability in certain areas, so the tempo and building of the thriller resents it. The viewer immediately knows that Reznik is having mental problems, so, at a certain level, you are pre-disposed to anything crazy or out of the ordinary to happen. In other words, the surprise factor is somewhat killed before starting. The movie is full of clues to understand Reznik, which is great, but they are overly present sometimes. For example, the time of the watch when Rezkik is with Maria is used repeatedly, so this part of the story is killed mid way. However, the movie succeeds at not unveiling who Ivan is until almost the end, so the viewer gets what expects in a suspense film. I would have liked the same with regards to Marie.This is a terrific movie, with a great atmosphere, a thought-provoking script, and a brilliant performance by Christian Bale. The Machinist is one of those multi-layered stories and movies from which you get new details each time you see it. A modern classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist stars a rather shockingly thin Christian Bale who plays an industrial machine operator in social decline.The film is beautifully presented in black and white with a blue/grey tone and added dashes of colour! The supporting cast are great and Michael Ironside is always entertaining whatever his role.The film concentrates on the psychological aspect of Bale's character in a way that the viewer can almost experience his decline. Not many films have successfully portrayed this type of character particularly in such an entertaining way.Although the character has been described as unlikeable or repulsive, I found him to be human and as such had no judgement!The film moves at a medium pace and is thoroughly enjoyable. There are some obvious nods to Hitchcock's Psycho, and also to famous literature (of which I am not familiar). I did not think that these links were necessary and believe that they detract very slightly from the movie itself. Also instead of spelling out certain elements of the plot, the film could have benefited by a little ambiguity.Positives - Cinematography, Characters, PerformancesNegatives - Leaves too little to the imaginationOverall - Bale could do with pie and chips!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently was looking up films that Christian Bale starred in when I bumped into this gem. I never heard anything about this film but after watching it I say it deserves the praise that it gets on here and then some.Trevor Reznik is a factory worker whose life goes completely awry after he meets a mysterious stranger named Ivan(John Sharian) that claims to work in the same factory. Things get worse for Trevor as one his co-workers loses an arm(Miller played by Micheal Ironside) and he is questioned about the incident. Trevor believes he is going insane and constantly visits a hooker and a airport restaurant waitress in attempts to regain his sanity. He hasn't been sleeping well and things get more complicated for him once Ivan is introduced into his life.Christian Bale gives one hell of a performance as the tortured soul Trevor Reznik. Jennifer Jason Leigh as well as Michael Ironside turn in some good performances. Christian Bale looks ghastly and sickly but his point of shedding 63 pounds to play this role was well made. I also like the score for this movie. Its no overbearing and grating: Its haunting and eerie and complements the overall tone to this intriguing and well-written mystery. So if you are in the mood for a great psychological thriller you couldn't go wrong with The Machinist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It will get in your head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you hear? Christian Bale lost 63 pounds for this movie. That's probably the first thing anyone hears about this film, mostly because he went from looking like an escapee from a concentration camp to Batman in like, less than a year after he did this movie. But the truth is, this is actually a great thriller in the Hitchcockian traditions. Is it perfect, certainly not, but it's still good, and it gets in your head. Bale actually gives a great performance. He can be charming at times (although I have to say that his normally adorable smile became a little creepy because his face was just so gaunt) and he shows us a believable descent into paranoia and insanity. Despite his creepy appearance and slightly off behavior, you still love him and want to give him a big hug, but not too hard because you might break him in half he's so thin.He's got a great supporting cast as well, but the truth is, this is Bale's movie, and the film pretty much hinges on his performance and the creepy feel created by director Brad Anderson, and the interesting plotting due to Scott Kosar's script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is as complex as any I have seen recently. The main character reminds me of the underground man from Dostoevsky's "Notes From Underground." The internal tormoil and psychological struggle on top of the characters physical limitations is very rewarding. As a recovering drug addict I completely relate to to Christian Bale's performance of a man haunted by himself. Excellent movie for those that really appreciate the art of filmaking. This is probably my favorite movie at the moment, along with a Clockwork Orange. Movies today that are deemed masterpieces seem to be very marginal in comparison with a movie like this. Be warned though, if you are looking for an aesticially pleasing movie to watch with your significant other, this is not it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Subtle, Fantastic Independent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Christian Bale is rising fast as one of the most respectable modern actors. After having loved his performance as the in the freshly revived Batman series, I noticed this movie on the shelf at the local video store where I worked. I'd heard bits about it from friends around school so I picked it up; needless to say, I thought it was an awesome movie. Bale is Trevor Reznik, a machinist with a nasty case of insomnia who's withering away to nothing. Soon after he meets a strange new co-worker named Ivan (John Sharian), an accident causes a worker to lose their arm and Reznick becomes the negative center of attention as a result. From that point on, Reznick's life proceeds to deteriorate further as he begins to believe he is being targeted in a plot against him by everyone in his life, all in conjunction with Ivan.Bale, who dropped 63 lbs for the role, does a superb job as the increasingly paranoid Reznick. It's almost painful to look at when you first see an emaciated Bale at the beginning of the film; the man looks like the walking dead. Throughout the movie, we watch as he pieces together clues to determine what's going on and, while some twists become evident pretty fast, it all leads up to the final reveal where everything comes together. One reason I love this movie is the fact that you can rewatch it 2-3 times and still catch subtle hints and foreshadowing throughout that point to the truth. The story is complex to where it keeps you wondering until the end, but never becomes confusing.The film benefits from great supporting performances from Sharian as the strange newcomer who seems to tie it all together, as well as from Jennifer Jason Leigh as a prostitute who is essentially Reznick's only real friend. The movie's pacing is a bit slow but it compensates by keeping the story interesting with constant developments. This film shows the talent of director Brad Anderson and motivates me to seek out some more of his previous work. Those who watch it shouldn't expect a fast-paced thriller, but a thought-provoking piece of independent film that'll prompt you to watch again just to see what you might've missed the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I almost could not believe that Christian Bale lost that much weight to play the part. It looked like 2 completely different men. That's a lot of dedication put into the acting - I think. Secondly, I really didn't expect to be drawn into the movie quite as much as I did. The atmosphere throughout was dark, gray, chilling, never quite knowing what to expect in the next scene. I found myself trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together alongside Trevor, as weird thing after weird thing happened. The sense of hallucination from a severe lack of sleep is very well-portrayed here, and you can sense Trevor's frustration as images seem to fade as quick as they appear, and he feels he's losing his grip on what's real and what's not real. Its a bit like a horror movie, except there are no real ghosts in this show, just "ghosts of his past"...And when the show comes to its conclusion, it all makes sense, and you also feel (as Trevor must feel at the end of the show) a great sense of respite... though the movie did seem rather sad too as I realised what was really happening, at the end. I felt sad for Trevor's life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the performances (credits not only to Christian Bale, but to Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitana Sánchez-Gijón), the cinematography and the atmosphere created are outstanding, the plot (especially the "twist" at the end) seems to reverse around itself, and when in the end you come to think of it, there is is actually not much to reconsider.This is a pity, because there have been many interesting subplots that could have been developed. The post-its left by strangers (all indicating his own guilt in the end), the picture where he refuses to recognize himself, the epileptic boy (that was a shivery part), the arm cut and his own "accident" - I tend to believe that this must have been different originally, but had to be cut from the end version, but who knows.I have to admit that because of the elaborate son-mother line I assumed for the largest part of the film that Reznik is going to have his mother (who I supposed to have died in the car accident caused by Reznik instead of the little boy) in the fridge, the fish took me rather by surprise.The ending with the car accident is good, yes, but somehow unsatisfactory, because unlike in Fight Club, e.g., where the final impression is that of "how on earth did they come to this ending, I would never have thought of that, I'm stunned", the Machinist is a bit easier to predict, yet still an extremely strong and well-done film.Worth watching rather for atmosphere and great acting. You won't bite your nails but learn an important (if not belated) lesson about why to drive very carefully and how important a good night's sleep can become.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An eerie and effective film that plays with the viewer and forces some working out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist is a film that displays evidence of numerous things. It proves that Christian Bale is a quality actor, although he'd already done that with American Psycho four years earlier; it proves that there are good films still being made every now and again in an era when sequels and remakes are bringing in most of the cash for the American film industry but it also proves that Spain doesn't need to rely on Almodóvar to make their films appeal to a wider audience.What's clever about The Machinist is its overall delivery of its subject matter. It's bleak, colourless, eerie and has a distinct slow atmosphere to it. This is put through via the way the character of Trevor Reznik (Bale) talks to other people, because he's tired and very thin, thus rendering him weak. He says he hasn't slept for a year but this may be untrue (as well as some other thing) as things become clearer later on. The film seems like it's a psychological horror as each scene is particularly ambiguous and un-nerving. We're being treated to eerie compositions of strange things but I was never quite sure if I was supposed to feel scared, uneasy or whether I was supposed to be looking out for clues of some sort. A good example can be the ghost train ride scene where a series of uncanny images are flashed at us and a child goes into a frothing fit. When you look back at this scene at the end, it was merely just a fun fair ride and there was nothing too sinister going on at all. A guy and a child goes on a ride and an unfortunate incident happens, nothing else.But what makes this film particularly effective is that it plays with the viewer. I think most people who see this are so sure that 'soon enough, something really bad will happen' thanks to the eerie atmosphere it has, that they trick themselves into thinking something has. Some iconography of this can be the refrigerator apparently leaking blood and the mysterious memo sticker appearing on a cupboard with a drawing of a stickman attached to a noose, ala 'Hangman' style. When you look at these two things, the leaking fridge can be explained logistically ? there was a power-cut at his apartment and the fridge's power was cut off; thus the items of food inside were ruined and started to rot/leak a little. Anything else that raises questions can simply be brushed off using the old 'it was all in his head' trick. This includes the fact he supposedly murders someone in his flat, wraps up the body in a rug and goes to dump it off a pier but when he gets there, there's no body in the rug, and the guy he killed appears behind him as a coastguard on watch.The fact that Reznik also finds himself in delicate situations on numerous occasions, but seems to do the worst thing possible, is also a point of discussion. When someone looses an arm in some machinery at his factory, it's due to the fact he leans on the wrong button. When he goes round to apologise to someone about something, he rants about a supposed conspiracy against himself and gets thrown out. Also, when he accuses his prostitute friend's supposed ex-boyfriend of stalking him (when really he doesn't exist) he's only making things worse for himself as a certain photograph he found in the guys wallet is actually of him yet he can't see that even though it's right in front of him.Twinned with this, the people around him suffer a lot more than he does. I think he maps this suffering onto himself; thus taking the weight of other people's problems. Examples are: the prostitute who gets beaten up, the child that has an epileptic fit and the worker that looses his arm. These problems don't affect him at all yet he seems to take the brunt of them and each little thing adds to his delusion.It may sound like I was unimpressed with The Machinist, but this isn't the case. Any film that makes you think like this and, almost, demands a second viewing can hold its head up high along with other films such as Memento and Twelve Monkeys. The Machinist is a clever, well made and well thought out film that works on many levels as it tackles sensitive subjects such as insomnia, amnesia and mental illness.</fullReview>

In the recent spirit of films such as "Memento", "Pi", "Clean, Shaven", and "Fight Club", we have another truly interesting psychological drama asking us to decipher reality right along with the lead character (Bale). In order to look the role, Bale lost A LOT of weight ? until he looked tortured and ready to die. It worked. He is a machinist at a metal working factory. He claims to have not slept ? AT ALL ? in a year. It's not a healthy state for him. Incidents keep stacking up on him, and he sees a pattern to them? maybe? and on he goes, trying to lead a normal life, trying to protect himself from perceived threats, trying to find the answers to the puzzles.

		<fullReview>Brad Anderson made a strong mood film with Christian Bale in the main role.This film is half blood art film ,and half blood commercial movie,but very interesting,and emotionally without boring minutes.The story is about a machinist who became very slim cause did not sleep in a whole year.There are two womens in his life, Steve the sex-worker and a another from the airport-café.But I don't tell you more about the story cause it's maybe the only weak point of the film.You will understand what Brad Anderson want to tell you with this movie,cause it's not too difficult.You can learn something important about human behavior,and many other important things ,maybe just like your mind working.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside the Dark Places of the Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian Bale's appearance in this film is startling to say the least. He lost approximately 80 lbs. to portray Trevor Reznik, a character on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and he does an absolutely brilliant job of it. This is as close I ever want to get to witnessing someone having a nervous breakdown. Christian's portrayal is extremely realistic.Trevor Reznik is a nice guy, quiet, and kind of shy, and definitely the type that would bring out the maternal side in a woman, with his gaunt features and haunted eyes.Trevor works as a machinist. The machines there can be dangerous, men sometimes lose fingers, a hand, occasionally even an arm.Trevor's only friend is Stevie, a prostitute, but he begins to make friends as well with a very kind and beautiful waitress named Maria, who is divorced and has a little boy, Nicholas.Trevor is having problems, however. He can't sleep. In the film, he tells Stevie he has not slept for a year. Actually, a person could not go a year without sleeping, so perhaps it only seems that way to Trevor.We do not know until almost the end of the film, the reason for Trevor's sleeplessness, weight loss and other problems. On our journey to the answers, we are kept in a state of high tension by Trevor's growing suspicion of a plot by his co-workers and the mysterious and sinister Ivan, who keeps inserting himself into Trevor's life.I would call this film psychological horror. It is very well done, and certainly held my interest throughout.9 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good thriller that deserves a watch, It's best that you know as little about it as possible, so I won't give any spoilers.Christain Bale is superb in this, his physical state is remarkable, especially when you consider he had to put all the weight straight back on and get into shape for Batman Begins. It doesn't overshadow his acting though and I'm surprised that he never got a look in during the awards season. After all Oscar loves a gimmick.The cinematography is very nice and dark and the plot keeps you guessing, allowing you to figure it out rather than being flung around and confused. Director Brad Anderson deserves credit for not trying too hard to impress and surprise, he plays it out to a natural conclusion that brings everything together.Give it a try if you're looking for a dark thriller that makes you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the BEST Performances but the story falls short....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously Christian Bale is absolutely one of the only Artists with conviction left in this Hollywood full of egotistical pretty boys(with the exception of a few awesome actors and actresses). This performance will probably go down as one of his best. I definitely have even more respect for him after seeing this movie.Now, with that said, id like to just comment on the movie. the story is a very cool, very sleek version of memento meets fight club. its still original enough to definitely hold its own, but i think the end of the movie completely falls apart. the movie moves at a good pace and allows you to really get into reznik's life. But at the 1 hr 15 min mark, it all seems to just rush to the end. throughout the movie you are trying to figure out whats going on and who exactly everyone really is. This is futile though, because there really aren't any clues thrown out that anyone could possibly pick up on that lead you anywhere near what the truth is. In the last 15 minutes of the movie, everything just gets explained (with the exception of why the hell Ivan has toes on his hands or who he is for that matter) and its all wrapped up and presented like a gift to you, eerily like a Stephen King novel. this is an extreme disappointment as all the theories you develop throughout the movie become null and void.The movie has an extremely awesome look and feel and i think the crew did an absolutely awesome job of bringing you into this very eccentric world of sleep deprivation. all in all id say the movie is worth seeing, if not just for seeing these actors and actresses acting their hearts out for a relatively independent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating but not entirely unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist may have never been released if not for the sudden stardom of Batman star Christian Bale. But fortunately for us it is. However I don't think the film is ever a surprise to anyone. It's kind of the typical twisted psychological thriller you expect. Nonetheless it has some great performances and a dark overtone that makes it interesting enough to watch even though most people won't ever wonder about the outcome. That's not to say that the film is not open to interpretation. This type of film (see also the amazing The Jacket) is fun because it can be discussed and argued about and open to many different theories. Is this death?? Is he in some sort of purgatory where he must choose redemption or death?? The Machinist is the story of Trevor Reznik a machine operator at "National." Reznik hasn't slept at all in over a year. He's barely a shell of a man, thin as a skeleton and gradually losing grip with reality. The only people in his life are Stevie the hooker who has fallen in love with him, and Marie, the waitress at the airport coffee shop he frequents every late night. Everything begins to truly fall apart when while on break Reznik meets Ivan, a burly man who apparently has taken over for one of the other guys at National. Reznik doesn't remember ever seeing him. When back in the shop Reznik sees him again and gets distracted while helping another guy fix one of the machines. In a freak accident Reznik backs into the safety and the other guy loses his arm. Trevor's world begins to fall apart. Haunted by causing Miller's accident he begins to believe someone is trying to mess with him and Ivan (who the factory boss informs him does not work at National and doesn't exist) is the key to it all. Reznik's world spirals out of control and gradually we are introduced to elements of his world over the past year that has caused him the grief and guilt that has made him the man he is today. He will have to make the final choice between his redemption and the continued guilt for the rest of his life.The Machinist is dark, slightly twisted and most definitely haunting. Christian Bale is amazing as Trevor Reznik. He looks just horrible, deathly skinny, ailing and he looks like someone who hasn't sleep in a long, long time. But not only does he look the part but creates the roll of a desperate man who seems like your average guy. He's honest, hard working, a lover, no drugs, not a drinker...seemingly average but as the story unfolds we learn so much more about him. The supporting cast is also very well cast. Jennifer Jason Leigh who I am not a huge fan of does an adequate job playing Stevie, Michael Ironside and John Sharian play brilliant supporting roles especially Ivan who is haunting and deadly. The Machinist is a great thriller, it's absolutely worth watching but unfortunately I found it a little typical. I never once questioned the outcome of the film, only which aspects were real and which weren't. There are some genuinely interesting enough action scenes interspersed throughout the film and the gritty world in which it takes place is captivating. You feel each character's problems. Brad Anderson does an amazing job portraying this. For any fan of a Psychological thriller, Christian Bale or something a little off beat, check out The Machinist, you won't be disappointed. And then check out my review and the film The Jacket, something comparable but worlds above. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody psychological thriller, reminiscent of Pi and Memento</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Anderson directed two very different films I thoroughly enjoyed: Next Stop Wonderland, a funny, charming showcase for under-used actress Hope Davis; and Session 9, a creepy Blair Witch-style psyche-out that had me tense, and guessing, until the end.The Machinist is in the latter vein. It is an ambitious work that risked alienating its audience with a combination of art cinematography and symbolism. However, the sheer intensity of Christian Bale's performance and peril, paired with a delicate touch with the psychological symbolism, make this a satisfying example of art cinema.Half the fun of this movie is figuring out what's going on, so I won't reveal the concrete plot, other than to say Bale's year-long insomnia provides a perfect backdrop for a journey through the chambers of the main character's mind. You can never be sure when what you're seeing is actually happening, or a hallucinating, r.e.m. sleep-deprived brain.Besides an outstanding turn by Christian Bale (who dropped a record 63 pounds for his role), the film features Jennifer Jason Leigh playing arguably her most common role, a prostitute. However, the film avoids rehashing Hollywood Hooker clichés, and her character is quite compelling, as a result. My favorite appearance in the film? Michael Ironside plays a gruff co-worker of Bale's. I'm a huge Ironside fan (mainly because he's been slugging it out for decades in an almost mythological field - a Canadian Film Industry Career) and I hadn't seen him do a movie this high-profile in years.The Machinist will almost undoubtedly slip under the radar of most movie-goers. It hasn't been promoted too much, and it is decidedly intellectual fare, but the rewards are worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* * Potential Spoiler Alert * *Somewhere between Fight Club and Memento lies a film steeped in so many red herrings it beats a Norwegian canary ship any day of the week. However, unlike its maritime equivalents, The Machinist doesn't stink.It tries, with valiance and fortitude, to rekindle the languid Who the Hell Am I genre, a strand of cinema lurking in the shadows since acceptable Identity of two years ago. To attain this goal, The Machinist spins a gossamer story revolving around Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), a skeletal city dweller working at one of the anonymous locale's unionized machine shops. As the film opens, we know next to nothing about Trevor, but quickly begin to realize there's something seriously wrong with him, for the man's so thin he's next to non-existent, as several fellow characters so accurately note. In fact, how the hell excellent Bale went from lady killer hunk in American Psycho and Equilibrium to 110 lb stick man remains the movie's mainstay mystery. Reznik's haunted by an unknown trauma from his past. We fathom this from clues strewn about the plot rather than direct revelation, as well as from observing the lead's interaction with other personas. Soon thereafter, Reznik begins to see things, most vivid of which is Ivan (Marlon Brando-esquire John Sharian), a strange shop co-worker nobody else even knows about. Following a gruesome accident at work in which another of Reznik's colleagues suffers the odd severed hand (good as always Michael Ironside), Trevor proceeds to finally lose it to the point of endangering relationships with the few people who can still tolerate his eccentricity, like golden-hearted prostitute Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), a kind waitress Trevor confides in during his ceaseless bouts with insomnia.The movie's basic premise brings to mind other entries in the genre, alluding to a crisis of being and questions regarding the very essence of supposed realities. Through Trevor we perhaps shed light on escaping our torrid memories, for he too is always on the verge of discovering some cataclysmic moment in time that changed everything and could account for the many abnormalities he suffers from, such as extreme emaciation and being unable to sleep for over a year. For good or bad, The Machinist concerns itself mostly with throwing non-stop curve balls, for its story is riddled with dead-end head fakes like the notes Trevor leaves himself on a fridge filled with bloody, chopped-up fish and his entirely curious alter-ego who, although gratifying, ends up of little consequence. Likewise, occasional The Wire and The Shield director Brad Anderson went to great pains in pumping proceedings with incessant, clever foreshadowing, both visual and via dialogue. Upon watching the movie again, you'll glean pleasure from giggling at the significance of certain one liners and phrases denoting things to come, yet much like the plot proper they too lead down stray paths. Stylized and atmospheric with ample accompaniment by eerie sounds capes, The Machinist does work well as a free-from exercise in psychedelic, lyrical anarchy. At its very core lies an almost random progression even less coherent than Trevor's feverish mind, and we're lucky to get the modicum of resolution at the end that it so miserly dishes out. However, and as frustrating as never getting too close to what is "really" going on can be, The Machinist impersonates traditional cinema quite nicely, just like its Catalan locations do a believable job standing in for generic California, and for that kind of pleasantry forgiving it the open-ended enigmas can be a piece of cake.Rating * * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I entered the cinema expecting quite a mediocre thriller. There was actually a point when i thought that the movie was being strange for the sake of being strange. I was surprised. In my honest opinion i would have to say that THE MACHINIST is much better than MEMENTO. Don't get me wrong. MEMENTO was a fantastic film but i found THE MACHINIST more gripping. I think that Christian Bale's performance is amazing and i'm not just saying that because he lost weight for it. I thought Michael Ironside's performance was brilliant too even though he was only in it for a short while i found his character very creepy indeed. The faults don't even need mentioning. One CGI shot is very obvious but this is a trivial fault, i mean i wasn't watching the movie for fantastic CGI effects was i. Neither are you. You're watching it for the story the film is telling you and how it is delivered. There is also a part where Arnies words rang in my head "See you at the party Richter".All in all one of the best films this year so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I'll just start out with saying this movie was very good. This is one of those movies ya gotta watch more then once. I have only seen it once so there are still some things I gotta go back and figure out but I can tell ya that even after the first viewing you can see how smart this movie is. Christian Bale (oh how I love thee) is an absolute gem in this movie. He looks so horrible as he should being a man dying from insomnia, since he hasn't slept in a year. Why hasn't he slept....this movie will take you on a crazy ride to figure out why. Crazy things are happening in his life especially at his job (hence the Machinist) but is there someone really messing with him or is he just loosing whats left of his fragile mind? Plagued by crazy flashes and memory loss and confusion Christian Bale stumbles through this movie trying to figure out what the heck it all means. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitina Sanchez Gijon also give great supporting performances. (Particularly Leigh tho, she is amazing) The ending although predictable is exactly what you expect it to be. The movie is shot in mostly grayish blue overtones which work very well with Bales poor health and sickly look. A couple of bright shots of the supporting leads offer contrast to his condition. This is definitely a movie I recommend....see it as soon as you get the chance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dostoevsky reference was not a throw away. if you know or look up the story of Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment before seeing the movie you will enjoy this homage much more.Like the Russian classic, this is a tale about the inexorable and disfiguring load of guilt, making it as real as Seven did with the concept of sin. In both movies we see graphically that those are much more than just philosophical categories -- they warp who we are as human beings, in the case of the Machinist both figuratively and literally. The Machinist is similar in mood and storytelling style to Momento but that is really where the comparison should stop. I actually prefer the Machinist, because it is much more than just entertaining -- it had something to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostly unnerving (8/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film stays with you long after you walk out of the theatre trying to make sense of what you've seen, what you've heard, and of what you've felt. Exactly what part of The Machinist's world actually existed and when?Murky colors mixed into a world of someone's psyche is an unnerving thing to be a part of and rarely does it come off. But this film pulls you along and you go willingly. You knew that you were in for a completely different ride just from seeing the promos of Christian Bale and the unhealthy gaunt transfomation he made to portray Trevor Reznik; a insomniac, machinist who hasn't seen a wink of sleep in a year. We know there's got to be some shocking reason for it but we're willing to let director Brad Anderson show us when he's ready. There is a wonderful blend of cinematography and set design that really helps plunge the viewer into this opaque world which, to Trevor, becomes his own hell on earth. Roque Ba?os furthers the experience with a haunting musical score that varies from dark, based oboes to the surreal Theremin. The cast, some of which would have you thinking that they might be type casted into rolls, seem fresh and completely suited for the characters that they play, especially Michael Ironside and Jennifer Jason Leigh.When a film has the ability to take me to a world that I haven't quite seen before and leave me with a feeling of despair and unease, I have to praise it. Think Hitchcock marries Jacob's Ladder and adopts the bastard son of The Sixth Sense and Se7en and you'll be on the same ward. A completely different room, but the same hospital notheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching a string of US movies with derivative storylines at the 2004 Frightfest in London, The Machinist stands out as an impressive exception. Similar to Cypher or The I Inside, you know straight off that there's a puzzle here waiting to be solved, but although (on reflection) all the pieces are there, I found the resolution to be totally unpredictable, and consequently a real joy. Christian Bale's appearance is simply stunning (in a Q&amp;A with the director after the screening, Brad Anderson mentioned that Bale lost 55 pounds in two months to achieve the effect, and then took another two months putting the weight back on to film a very brief flash-back scene).The support roles, including Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Ironside, are also very convincing, and the retro-creepy soundtrack is very reminiscent of Herrmann's work on The Day The Earth Stood Still - this might sound strange, but it actually works to the film's benefit! The general tone of the film is particularly dark and grim, but there are some comic moments to relish, and there is very little in the way of padding.Evidently Brad Anderson couldn't get financial backing for the film's production in the US due to the story's subject matter, so found assistance in Spain, where the film was shot. None of this notices, as the locations look suitably American. Highlight of the film has to be Trevor's visit to the DMV office and his subsequent attempts to be a hit-and-run victim.</fullReview>

I became a fan of Christian Bale after i saw this movie.His acting skills are excellent and his expressions are perfectly timed that you forget him totally and indulge in the character that he played. The director portraits the entire movie from the perspective of the lead character that it becomes extremely difficult for one to predict the next scene. Overall This is a must watch film for all the viewers who like suspense and psychological brain twisting thrillers.Just relax one fine lazy afternoon(being a doc i am mostly free only in the afternoons) and enjoy the movie with a glass of vodka.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting if not completely successful Kafka-esquire thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Machinist" is an interesting if not completely successful thriller that feels like a cross between David Fincher and Franz Kafka. Fortunately, its a lot more subtle than any of Fincher's works and definitely not nearly as flashy. Its a very dark and low-key character study thats certainly won't be accessible to many mainstream audiences and may come across as being rather pointless to others. Still, those who appreciate dark industrial films or the works of the aforementioned Kafka will find plenty to appreciate here. The whole film is a psychological head trip, and while it doesn't reach the cerebral heights the finest entries in the genre do (such as "Jacob's Ladder"), its highly recommended to film goers whose tastes run in that direction.Like I said above, its far from a flawless film. Namely, a lot of the dialog is extremely awkward. Its pretentious prose that may have looked good on paper, but feels very unnatural when delivered by the cast. Also, during the first hour, the pace falters a bit and the twist ending can be seen about twenty minutes before. You could also argue the whole affair doesn't add up to too much and is rather pointless.Still, the acting and the direction are phenomenal. Brad Anderson (who also made the similarly intriguing "Session 9") knows how to frame an unnerving shot and really captures a foreboding industrial atmosphere that brings to mind a color version of "Eraserhead" at times. The performances from the whole cast are also very accomplished. Christian Bale plays a protagonist who remains sympathetic even when hes obviously in the process of losing his mind. He proves once again to be one of the finest actors working today. Aitana Sánchez-Gijón is very likable as the waitress Bale courts for a while. Jennifer Jason Leigh isn't as impressive as her two co-stars, but is serviceable as Bale's prostitute girlfriend. I must admit I was slightly disappointed by this film, but still, those with a taste for something original and rather disturbing should seek it out. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chillingly effective psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist Anyone, upon the sight of a near anorexic Christian Bale displayed proudly across the poster or trailer for The Machinist, must have had their curiosity piqued to a certain degree. How and why, the questions lingered, could the soon to be star of Batman Begins have lost such a large quantity of weight, and how does that figure into the plot of the film? And while the spectre of Bale is indeed a prominent point of interest for the film, by no means is the novelty of such an skeletal leading man the only appealing feature of The Machinist - instead, it only serves to compliment and add to the masterful construction of a truly classy and nerve wracking psychological thriller.Director Brad Anderson proves himself a master at effectively creating tension and atmosphere in a fashion which has become exceedingly rare in this day and age where increasingly formulaic CGI creatures, inane amounts of gore, and beautiful young women shrieking have become the standard for 'frightening' in the average Hollywood thriller. The Machinist is all the more effective by staying firmly grounded in reality, but still managing to extract many a quiver simply due to its exquisitely bleak atmosphere. Anderson's use of lighting is one of the single most effective instances of a modern film in recent memory - shrouds of darkness bathe the screen, as the spectre of Bale looms out, all the more chilling as shadows drape across his willowy form. This world of shadows is one where it seems anything can happen, and Bale's slow psychological disintegration seems entirely credible - the sheer physical agony of continual exhaustion seems to bleed out of the screen, infecting the viewer. The plot itself is one which may seem familiar grounds for viewers well versed in mind twisting films such as this, but the execution is so strong, the predictable twist at the film's climax hardly detracts from the viewer's enjoyment at all. One starts to wonder if the ending was even intended to be a surprise to the viewer, or if its purpose was merely for them to watch the dishevelled Bale creep towards this inevitable revelation. At any rate, screenwriter Scott Kosar's airtight script makes for a compelling watch, and the film's pacing is superb, introducing each new plot point at a steady pace while still allowing for the pitch perfect development of tension. The wonderful cinematography captures the shadowy locations in a wonderfully eerie fashion, and the haunting musical score adds to the mood perfectly, and although it does start to get repetitive to the point of almost being distracting at times, it's a small complaint in a mood piece as strong as this. Christian Bale has proved himself to be among the most watchable and consistently powerful performers in the industry of late, and The Machinist only proves the dedication and emotional investment he undergoes for each role. Bale resists the temptation to coast along on the shock value evoked by his emaciated form, and his powerhouse performance as chronically sleep deprived Trevor Reznik captivates in an almost peerless fashion. The strength and credibility of Bale's central performance is enough to carry the film through what might have otherwise come across as inane plot points. Bale is given quality support by Jennifer Jason Leigh as Reznik's call girl 'girlfriend', and Leigh instills her character with a down to earth dignity few other actresses would have captured. John Sharian makes for wonderfully eerie support as the mysterious Ivan, who continually causes Reznik mental strife throughout. All things considered, few films of late have parallelled the atmospheric success of The Machinist. While it's plot may not entirely be a surprise for those familiar to the genre, the gloomily lit, masterful atmosphere and pitch perfect development of tension, combined with an immensely strong leading performance are enough to make Anderson's quiet but high quality film easily worth a watch.-9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christian Bale deserved an Oscar nom for this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands down, this film featured one of the best performances by an actor ever. Christian Bale has always been a dependable actor. He shines in any role he takes on. Here, however, he truly outdoes himself as tortured Trevor Reznik. Physically, he has done what few other actors have. Some may shave their heads or gain a little bit of weight or muscle, but Bale has actually lost enough weight to give himself the physical appearance of a skeleton. Trevor Reznik is a machinist who has not slept for one full year. As such, he is losing weight like crazy and is a shadow of his former self. Soon he begins to see things that may or may not be there. When he is involved in the accident of a coworker that costs them their arm, Trevor begins to suspect that something is up. Bale perfectly captures Trevor's confusion and his anger as he tries to sort through what is happening to him. Never before have I seen such a dedication to craft as bale demonstrates. I thoroughly believe that without him the film would be only half the movie that it is. Indeed the script, which while it does have some great twists and turns and good dialogue, comes across at times as only so-so. There is a small feeling of familiarity to the proceedings but I don't know why. Perhaps its the glut of similar twist ending films in the last ten years or so. Whatever the case, it is to the benefit of this film that the director had such a great actor as Bale to work with. Jennifer Jason Leigh turns in a fine performance as Stevie considering the undemanding role she has as a prostitute with a soft spot for Trevor. If you haven't already done so, then check this one out. You won't be sorry for doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale lost a lot weight to get into character for this movie. He is what carries this film through a somewhat suspect plot. With better material, this could have been a blockbuster.Instead, the goal of this movie seems to be provide a large amount of disturbing images in such a way that you have a chance to see it coming without looking away from the screen (or your television).Excellent cinematography and excellent acting by the leads (Bale and Jennifer Jason-Leigh). But the problem with this film isn't the acting. It's the story itself.The plot, while uneven and mysterious enough to keep your attention, becomes more and more unbelievable as the film progresses. The turning point for me was when the prostitute (Jason-Leigh) reinforces the fact that Resnick (Bale) is the man holding the fish in the photograph with his co-worker from the factory.Simply put, the mere suggestion that Resnick has been chasing himself the entire movie really ruins the rest of the film. The director tries to make some sense of a morality tale but the bottom line is this: there just isn't enough meat in this story to make for a compelling "this is your conscience talking" theme.At the risk of spoiling the conclusion, the director could and should have thrown in a few more similarities between Resnick and Ivan (John Sharion). If you can stop scratching your head and rewinding the DVD for a second, the brilliant conclusion may have been enough to atone for an otherwise hollow film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen such a good movie in a long time. The story is clever, keeps you hooked and leaves you with a gap at the en of the movie. Unpredictable end but completely logical. A story with great structure and even greater cast... As for Christian Bale he should have taken an Oscar for this one, really captured the hero's feelings and way of thinking in such a way, one would think the story was actually written for him. Living and breathing the role and starving himself to make his acting believable. Well he carried it out brilliantly... Dark scenes, beautifully filmed and with great action scenes I think it is a great choice for every viewer that wants to consider himself/ herself eclectic...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Machinist (2004) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale) works in a dingy machine shop and is ostracized by his co-workers after inadvertently causing a near-fatal accident to one of his fellow employees. Trevor is inflicted with chronic insomnia and hasn't been able to sleep for a whole year, and his mind and body are breaking down as a result of it. He's been steadily losing so much weight that he's dropped to under 120 lbs and appears sickly and undernourished, and everyone around him suspects he's been using drugs. Lately his perception has become so affected by sleep deprivation that he's having a difficult time in telling reality apart from imagination. He starts to develop hallucinations and a paranoid delusion where he begins to believe there may be a plot against him. The only person he can confide in is his steady prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh), with whom he has formed a closeness above and beyond their business relationship, and who may or may not be a part of the plan to destroy him. Gradually, Trevor manages to but the pieces of the puzzle together in an unpredictable payoff that makes the whole film worthwhile.Christian Bale is excellent in the part of Trevor, and he really keeps us interested in him. The actor starved himself for the role, losing so much weight that he is an unsightly figure, as his bones protrude through his gaunt body. This is a film that is very involving, but also convoluted at times before its climactic revelation finally puts things into perspective for us. I didn't realize it until after the film was over, but incredibly this film was made in Spain after the filmmakers couldn't get funding in the U.S.! They certainly fooled me. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale physically transforms into a lifeless shell in the Machinist, a thriller derived from much better and more thought-provoking films. The cinematography is fine, and the story and pacing are OK, but the payoff just isn't there. The only reason to watch this movie is to see what Christian Bale did to himself. I'm surprised the director didn't tell him to stop much sooner as this looks irresponsible. I mean, when you see Tom Hanks in Cast Away he looks like he's been eating McDonald's in between takes compared to Christian Bale in Machinist. And when you see DeNiro in Raging Bull, you don't think his LIFE was at risk for being over-weight. I was actually fearing for Christian's life while watching this. Its like... if a 5 mph wind swept him away, he'd be gone for good. You'd never see him again. Irresponsible film-making at its most disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Machinist" is a very interesting film with a simply stunning performance from Christian Bale as Trevor - what he did was amazing and I mean not only his physical transformation that by itself was a real sacrifice an actor can commit for his Art. Besides Bale's performance, the film is masterfully directed and what is very important, clever written. It is one of few films that get under your skin and stay there. The ending was very satisfying and put all pieces of the puzzle together.***Possible Spoilers***: I read and heard that the film is a combination of "Memento", "Fight Club", "Angel Heart", Insomnia", "Thinner", and "Identity". "The Machinist" may bring all these pictures to memory but it is a masterfully crafted and compelling study of one man's journey from his crime to the punishment where he himself was a criminal, a victim, a prosecutor, and the executioner. (Trevor read the wrong Dostoevsky's novel - he should have read "Crime and Punishment") The one film I was reminded of while watching "The Machinist" - David Cronenberg's "Spider". Both films take place in the atmosphere of confusion, paranoia, guilt, and unbearable terror and both have the unforgettable performances by Christian Bale and Ralph Fiennes as two very disturbed individuals.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, there is so much to say about "The Machinist", and it's hard to do it without spoilers, so I'm not even going to try to keep it spoiler-free. The story is excellent; confusing at times, but intellectually stimulating. I loved that there were several Dostoevsky references (Trevor is reading "The Idiot", a sign in a funhouse reads "Crime and Punishment", an integral character's name is Ivan ("The Brothers Karamazov") and the film itself smacked of "Notes From the Underground"). What I admired most about the film, however, is that I had absolutely no freaking' clue what was going on until the end, and even then it took about three hours of reflection to really form solid enough thoughts to even begin to think about composing criticisms. Films like this come along far too infrequently, and I'm sure that there have been inevitable comparisons to "Memento", I think both for its cleverness and for its originality. The film, while staying linear (for the most part, a few flashbacks occur) is scattered and obtuse, but that is because we are experiencing everything through the eyes of Trevor, as he sees and discovers things. There are several clues that lead you to find out what the solution to the mysterious visions and notes are about, but truthfully, they are only effective after the reveal, and only then do you see the genius behind them. Most of the clues lie within a nightmarish carnival ride sequence that, once dissected, make complete sense. Also impressive were the subtle ways that Trevor's "conscience" is revealed; whether something as bold as a physical manifestation, to a book dropping to the floor ? any time Trevor tried to sleep, something would quickly happen, and the agony is almost tangible.The cinematography in "The Machinist" is dead-on and fantastic. Everything having to do with Trevor in his apartment, or in his car is in muted, blue-gray tones. The machine shop is dark, and certain key moments of the film are brightly lit, most notably the aforementioned carnival sequence. It's almost like, after having seen it, the scenes were screaming "Pay attention to this!" Anderson also does a great job of giving just enough in a scene to make you believe one thing, until you see the actual events later; there were several times where based on one snippet of information, or one image I was given, I was convinced of the circumstances until I was (every time) shown the "real" happenings. (Example: the yellow flashlight) It is only at the end, when Trevor discovers the truth, and becomes unburdened, does his world become light; and this is evidenced by the gleaming white of the room he ends up in. Much has been made of Christian Bale's physical transformation from 6 feet, 180 pounds to 120 pounds, and indeed, it was definitely an amazing (albeit dangerous) endeavor, but I went into the film telling myself that I wouldn't mention it in my review. Quickly, however, I realized that it wasn't just a gimmicky thing, this was the real deal, and the weight loss was an important part to the character. When we realize that it's not just "simple" insomnia, but torment that is plaguing Trevor, that makes his appearance all the more meaningful and pitiful. Bale was indescribably good in this film. I have enjoyed a couple of his other roles, (most notably, as American Psycho, Patrick Bateman) but his performance in this film completely blew me away. I really wonder where the nominating committees for various awards were (I'm mainly looking at you, Independent Spirit Awards) when this film was released, because it was certainly nomination-worthy, and one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. Also good was John Sharian, who played Ivan. He was one eerie motherfarker, and even when his true nature is revealed, you still want to shower after watching him. Frankly, there is not a lot of negative criticism I can attribute to this film; it is confusing, yes, but at the same time it is incredibly thought-provoking and intelligent, so being someone who (for the most part) respects challenging cinema, any confusion only meant that there were more puzzles to solve, puzzles I'm STILL working out in my head. This is going to be a turnoff to a lot of mainstream audiences. Also, because the film as a whole was extremely creepy and sinister, when the actual reveal occurs, it is a tad bit of a letdown because I expected something even more terrible than the events that actually occurred. (And anyone who has seen the film or sees it after reading this review is going to think I'm a pretty terrible person for saying that, I'm sure) but there were just so many other horrible scenarios that could have happened, that I almost felt the ending was a tad bit mild. Film endings can make or break a film for me, and though this has a (mostly) happy ending, it was really the best ending I can think of for this film, so because of this, for the reasons I've mentioned, and for many that I can't fit into this review, "The Machinist" is a film that I would highly recommend to Independent cinema lovers and to film-goers who love to chew on a film for awhile, turning it around in their minds until they come up with several different theories. That is what I have been doing since I saw the film last night, and even as I write this review I'm still coming up with other thoughts. See this film; you're probably going to see it on my Top Ten 2005 list in December. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst it should be forgiven for being reliant on modern narrative clichés, the Machinist is a magnificent rendering of guilt, emasculation and paranoia. Anderson utilises an uncomplicated Hitchcockian approach to his film-making with uses of bleak imagery, abstract characters (Bales emasculating performance is award worthy) and nostalgic compositions to create a film that fully deserves its cult status among contemporary culture. Its intellectual approach will leave you questioning aspects of the film, including the overall outcome. The Machinist is a truly inspired and wonderful film and is a must for all intellectuals and Christian Bale fans alike.</fullReview>

Without giving anything away this movie is very sad, heart-breaking even. If this movie didn't make you sad then you are heartless, methinks. Christian Bale gives a usual great performance as a man tormented by his past. Just looking at him makes you feel for him; the physical appearance of his character only reinforces the mental anguish he lives with every day. Truly a great piece of modern film that you can really relate to as far as his life in the machine room and his guilt for what he did in his past to cause his fall from sanity. He is truly a man tormented by his own misdeeds. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

Maybe it was the microwave popcorn. Maybe it was because it was a cold rainy day outside and I was on holiday in my blankets at home. You might feel guilty thinking that this isn't a Scorsese masterpiece. Nor does it contain the caliber of a De Niro. And it even doesn't have a bit of the razzle dazzle in a Spielberg production. But after you are done with it, you will realize that the 2 bucks that you spent on hiring it, will never do it justice. And do remember to get some sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MACHINIST is a film from director Brad Anderson (Session 9, if haven't seen it, you suck) I've been looking forward to for quite a while. Christian Bale plays a machinist who hasn't slept in a year, and has withered away to about 120 pounds. This is not a special effect! Christian Bale actually got to that state. He's basically skin stretched loosely over bones. Extremely gross. As his mind begins to break down, the machinist starts to imagine a sinister plot against him, and his world starts to fall apart.First, I wanna say that Christian Bale dedication to this role was amazing. For anyone who has been an insomniac, he played it accurately, though the idea that he hadn't slept AT ALL in a year, was totally unbelievable. I imagined instead that the director meant he hadn't had a night of sleep in an entire year.I was expecting a psychological horror film, much like Session 9, but The Machinist is more of a thriller than a horror. Perfectly executed, it surprised me as the story came to it's conclusion. As anyone who knows me, that's a feat not easily accomplished. There's not much else I can say without giving anything away. If I had any criticism, it would be that there were too few thrills and the film would have been greatly improved with a IRREVERSIBLE style soundtrack. This film was made all the better by having not slept properly all week, and racing around all weekend to see films. I was struggling to stay awake during the movie, which I have to recommend is the state to watch it in. (8/10)</fullReview>

I have to say that I am overjoyed.If we take a look at the others' acting, it is also done correctly, especially Jeniffer Jason Leigh's role. Plot progresses very well to the final plot twist, even though dialogue is very simple. Another thing which is done brilliantly is Xavi Giménez's cinematography. I can almost say that it is the shame that this guy is not so famous(at least I have never heard of him prior to seeing "Machinist"). And there is almost no CGI at all(expect for plane in the background I think).If you are looking for a shivers down the spine thriller movies, you have found it, and very skinny Bale is your star!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"THE MACHINIST(2004)"The Machinist is a suspense thriller directed by Mary Harron and starring Christian Bale and in whom we see an Industrial Worker who wouldn't exist, had he been any thinner. Bale literally ate only an apple a day for four consecutive months to prepare his body for the role and this along with his brilliant performance is enough of a temptation for watching the movie, the plot seems just an icing on the cake. The scene is set in an anonymous city and the atmosphere has a creepy touch to it. There are scenes of violence as well as disturbing images.The plot revolves around Trevor Reznik, an industrial worker, who suffers from Insomnia and has hallucinations.He doesn't remember events and so writes reminder notes. Having not slept for a year, he feels miserable and an accident at the workplace accompanied by meeting a mysterious co-worker only worsens0 his condition.Throughout the movie, it appears that Trevor is actually trying to recall something. The movie tries to portray the theory of "Karma", that your past sins will actually hit you some time. Although, it seems that the climax would not be able to wrap up things properly,but it does so in quite a clever way.The ending provides a believable and satisfactory explanation for its mysteries and contradictions.This movie is a must watch for people who love thrilling,dark and creepy movies. It is definitely a unique one and when you actually leave the theater, you realize how everything just fell into place quite amazingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist is a creepy movie. Christian Bale is so severely undernourished that he's uncomfortable to watch and there are a few scenes, notably some including machinery, that are almost painful viewing. You really get a feel that you are watching a man slowly unravel and that he is heading towards certain catastrophe.And make no mistake, Bale does a very, very good job here. His Trevor Reznik is in every scene of the movie and absorbs our full attention throughout. The supporting cast are very much there to support him and the only one that has enough of an arc to mention is Jennifer Jason Leigh who does a good portrayal of Trevor's confidante Stevie.But Trevor isn't the only lean thing here. At only 1h 39m there is not a wasted scene in the movie. It moves swiftly, relentlessly towards its (inevitable) conclusion. It becomes clear where it's headed some time before the end but it's still very satisfying to see it all come together. Every loose end is tied up without resorting to exposition or over-explaining.A fascinating, dark and somewhat depressing character study. Very well acted, shot and edited. A solid 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist subscribes to the Jacob's Ladder type film lineage where the entire thing is one big metaphor. Here, Christian Bale delivers an excellent performance as Trevor Reznik, a profoundly dysfunctional, out-of-touch zombie of a man who hasn't "slept in a year". The entire movie, and I do mean the *entire movie* is crowded with easter eggs, little secrets, hints, symbols, double meanings that all work in the direction of a superbly, superbly executed story and film with a brilliant twist at the end. The best thing about this film is that although its atmospheric, and very heavy/dark in color, feel and texture, something almost of a horror film, despite its definite taste for the haunting macabre it remains a totally healthy, composed watch without ever straying away from the plot or entering bizarre realm. Every single scene, and every single moment during the scenes is meaningful, excellently performed and executed, and contributes to a greater end, there isn't one second too much in this masterpiece. And the main theme which it deals with, GUILT, is developed in the most subtle and outstandingly relevant, neat way and offers great insight into human psychology. Just...just right. Really, perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilt, Paranoia &amp; Salvation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The past maintains a powerful grip over the present in "The Machinist" as it undermines the sanity of the story's main protagonist and fills him with ever-present feelings of guilt, fear and anxiety. The deep despair that he experiences on a daily basis makes his existence almost unbearable as he genuinely doesn't know the reasons why he's so troubled and therefore can't do anything to put things right or achieve some form of mental equilibrium.Physically and mentally, Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) is in a fragile state and lives his life following a daily routine that involves working as a drill-press operator in a factory, visiting his regular call-girl Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and enjoying a coffee and pie at an airport all-night diner where he chats with the attractive waitress, Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon). At the factory, his co-workers keep their distance as they think he's strange, primarily because he keeps himself to himself and looks so desperately thin. His emaciated appearance is the consequence of having been unable to sleep for a year and his inability to eat any significant amount of food.One day, when he and a workmate called Miller (Michael Ironside) are jointly trying to deal with a problem on one of the machines, Reznik gets distracted by Ivan (John Sharian), who's a new machinist, and in that critical moment, causes an accident that results in Miller losing his left arm. From that point on, Reznik's life goes into a downward spiral as he gets fired from his job, becomes disturbed by the fact that nobody else in the factory seems to know who Ivan is and starts to believe that he's the victim of a conspiracy. His hallucinations gradually become more frequent and distressing and for some reason he feels particularly uncomfortable when the cigarette lighter in his car pops and he repeatedly sees clocks that confirm that the time is 1.30.It isn't until the day when he looks into a mirror and says "I know who you are" that Reznik starts to achieve some form of mental clarity that enables him to begin his long journey on the road to salvation.The most startling feature of this movie is Christian Bale's anorexic appearance as his hollowed cheeks and protruding ribcage really make him look morbidly thin and emphasise the extreme effort and commitment that he obviously made into looking just right for his role. Added to this, his portrayal of Reznik is exceptional in every way and must make this one of the most memorable performances of his impressive career. Among the talented supporting cast, Jennifer Jason Leigh (as the caring call-girl) and John Sharian (as the mysterious Ivan) also provide a couple of real standout performances.The subject matter of "The Machinist" inevitably makes it rather grim and harrowing but it's also satisfying to watch because its conclusion explains so clearly the reasons for everything that's transpired. The perfect pacing, the colour palette (that reinforces the cold mood of the piece) and the score (that features a theremin) are all well chosen and contribute strongly to the success of this truly excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Machinist review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this dark and gritty film by Brad Anderson, you see Christian Bale playing Trevor, a man who works in the machinist industry, and senses there is something going on between his neighbour (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and her ex- boyfriend. In this psychological thriller, it shocked me at the end to know what happens, This was my second viewing of the film, and it still left me with that gritty feeling, the whole film is captured on very dark and grainy images which gives you a sense of a dream. Though Bale had not slept for over a year in the film, the twists and turns throughout the film matches up very well in the end, Bales performance as Trevor is remarkable, and the amount of commitment towards the character is outstanding. You could see in the film that Bale was suffering from a lack of food, but it is one of Bale's most memorable roles as he is one of very few Actors that would have gone through this transformation for a film role. I would highly recommend this thriller to anyone, if you are in the mood for a dark, pyshcological film which keeps you guessing, then this might just be the film for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not always a well oiled machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clearly informed by the works of Hitchcock, Fincher and Lynch, director Brad Anderson's 'The Machinist' carefully builds a tight little psychological thriller as it goes, but the ending--though complete and without many cheats--and the explanations may not sit well with everyone.That notwithstanding, an alarmingly gaunt Christian Bale is chillingly effective as a man poised precariously on the razor's edge of sanity. He's so good in fact that soon his appearance is secondary to his performance. Along with co-stars Jennifer Jason Leigh and John Sharian, he holds 'The Machinist' together even as it threatens to break down in the final act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredibly original and engrossing psychological drama. Very clever and ultimately very emotional. The only negatives would be that some of the clues are a bit too obvious, though a few smokescreens are thrown up to attempt to disguise them.Superb performance by Christian Bale. He clearly threw himself into the role, losing an incredible amount of weight to look the part (similar to what he would later do for Rescue Dawn). The only problem with casting him is that the plot has similarities to American Psycho, which he starred in, so this seems like a sequel or a remake.Good support from Jennifer Jason Leigh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful psychological thriller with hidden spiritual awakening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a MUST TO WATCH TILL THE END&nbsp;high-quality movie.Protagonist (Trevor) is pushed to pay out for his sin in his present life. The sin is about hiding a crime done about 1 year ago. The negative karma's payment is coming not only through the suffering of his physical body (he is not capable to get some sleep; having bad anorexia), but also via his psycho (hallucinations; memory loss, etc).One of the psychological disorders is the protagonist's interaction with Ivan, a brutal unpleasant man, who is not visible for other people. At the certain moment, Trevor realized that the brutal man is himself, his own (imaginarily) transformation, which has happened with him due to his sin. Realization of this is awakening his memory and causing an internal protest, which is pushing Trevor to announce his crime to the police.Excellent play of the protagonist by Christian Bale.The name of the movie is neutral ? it's not cold or hot, it's nor giving any hint for the plot, neither misleading. However, it would be perfect if the name could reflect the spiritual core of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute one man show by Christian Bale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist, directed by Brad Anderson (Session 9) is the story of an industrial worker who hasn't slept in a year and begins to doubt his own sanity. Christian Bale's transformation is impressive as he lost 63 pounds for this film and literally became skin and bones. Up to that film Bale's screen persona was largely defined by athleticism and physicality. In the machinist he becomes a shadow of insomnia. The film is an alternative psychological thriller of great artistic value. It's end may be considered predictable but still it's cleverly given. Despite the efforts of Brad Anderson to impress through his direction, the film ends up being an absolute one man show by Christian Bale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bale amazes in this bleak mind bender.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a mind-bending thriller very much like Memento ; the influence is clear as day. But The Machinist is a distinctly dark and disturbing film. Christian Bale dropped down to an alarmingly low weight to immerse himself in the role of his harrowing burnt-out character.Trevor hasn't slept for over a year, and it's taking a heavy toll on his sanity. With frequent hallucinations, it's up to the viewer to decide which events have actually happened and which are purely a figment of his imagination. You'll also have to decide which of the supporting cast of characters are portrayed in their genuine personalities and which ones are merely a projection of the protagonist's own regrets and desires.It's confusing the entire way through but the ending will clarify everything. There's lots of disturbing, bizarre and iconic imagery between bleach, the hangman notes, the fish and Dostoyevsky's The Idiot. Make of this nightmarish gem what you will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies you would never get bored of no matter how much you watch it. A well written story line which is not the usual dilemma we see in movies nowadays, it has a unique story line which is exciting to watch. The movie depicts a man who is alive but dead. Living a nightmare or maybe worse. People from his past have come to him . Like the hit and run which was actually an accident (love that part) and the movie portrays him losing his sanity due to insomnia which cost him a good life. His own identity is confused. The whole movie was a thrill to watch and I love every bit of it. The story is fascinating leaving the viewer with puzzles to solve. The movie has an eerie feel which is great to watch. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who would take a cinematic experience seriously and appreciate a good piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist stars Christian Bale in one of the weirdest and creepiest movies I think I have ever seen. Cue the theremin. It makes Hitchcock's Psycho look tame by comparison. Bale plays Trevor Reznik, who works in a gloomy machine shop from hell, one that apparently never heard of OSHA. The whole thing is filmed in a kind of high contrast off color monochrome. His whole life seems to revolve around visiting his prostitute/girlfriend and the girl whom he has come to know serving him at the Airport coffee shop. The guy is haunted and paranoid. He keeps getting post it notes in the form of a game of hangman on his refrigerator which creep him out. He also pursues a strange bullet-headed fellow with some fingers missing, who drives a red convertible and seems always there with a cheerful demeanor whenever something horrible happens, such as when a machine malfunctions and his co-worker loses an arm. Only Trevor seems to see him and is clearly going from bad to worse. Trevor claims to not have been able to sleep in a year. His weight is plummeting and he looks like a concentration camp survivor. The mystery to be solved is why all this is happening.All in all, I thought it was an effective psychological thriller in the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock at his creepiest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A multi-layered and dark character study !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you start watching "The Machinist", two things strike you instantly. The cinematography which is almost black and white which gives off a very intimidating and grimly dark look to the film. The other most obvious thing that will strike you is Christian Bale's physique or should I say the lack of it. He looks scrawny and almost scarily anorexic. He really became the character of Trevor Reznik in the film and this is a brilliant example of method acting of the ultimate level.The Machinist as a film depends largely on the eerie atmosphere that surrounds the film. From the first scene to the last, there is a consistent sense of dread and almost a despondent hopelessness that permeate from the screen. The film can be called a psychological thriller and also a horror film, but at the heart of it is an emotional character study, although for most of the film the viewer might feel lost and not find it too emotional. The film is brilliantly directed with a great style of storytelling. The director opts for a lot of reticence during the film, which might leave the viewer a bit perplexed about the goings-on in the film at times, but it always keeps the mystery alive. There is a lot of great visual imagery. The screenplay consciously makes an attempt to distort the distinctions between reality and dream sequences in the film. Hence the editing technique of certain scenes going by abruptly without a proper resolution actually makes sense and helps to accentuate the themes of the storyline. As soon as the film started getting weirder and weirder, the name Dostyovsky did come across my mind and my instincts about some Dostyovsky influence were vindicated by the scene where we see Trevor reading the "The Idiot" written by Dostyovsky. There are also some Satanic and hell-related symbolism in the film. Right in the first scene we see the reflection of three towers on Trevor's face and these towers closely resemble the pitchfork seen in many imagined images of the Devil. In a scene where Trevor goes on a ride in the amusement park with a boy named Nicholas, there comes a point where they have to choose between one way which might lead them to "Salvation" and the other which will lead them to "Hell" and that scene is extremely expressive and tells us a lot about what choices Trevor might have made earlier in his life.The director does a great job of keeping the narrative extremely interesting. Christian Bale as I have already mentioned is fantastic, not only does he physically become the character, but he also uses some very impressive acting choices for this character which range from the subtle and understated to the dramatically loud. Although I wasn't really shocked by the denouement at the end as I sort of saw it coming but I still remained extremely interested in the plight of this strange man. Viewers can find some similarities with other films like Fight Club and Memento which are there in plenty. So you can question the film's originality, but I don't think you can question its overall quality and the director's ability to grab your attention and not let go of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Christian Bale's more interesting roles and a film with a well-deserved good reputation. A story about one Trevor Reznik (Bale), an insomniac factory worker who moves through his life in a constant daze, a mere shadow of his former self. A continuous cloud hangs over his life and even sources of joy are filtered through a dark gloom. And then things start to go wrong.The Machinist works partly because of Bale's excellent performance and partly because it knows how to build and maintain suspense. Bale lost a considerable amount of weight for the movie, unhealthily so, but it cannot be said that it doesn't add something to the movie when you can count every single bone in his body through his pallid skin. A haunting visual and a haunting performance as Trevor starts to slowly question his very existence.The plot is also interesting, though it bears some resemblance to movies like Memento, another Bale movie. Not that it's a bad thing and the end twist is still original enough not to disappoint, but the similarities are striking.Not much else can be said about the movie without spoiling it, so I'll finish by saying that it's a movie well worth a watch for fans of thrillers. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene in the film hooked me up for something strange to expect the unexpected from Christian Bale.As the camera pans in and out, 20 minutes down the line the characterization of Bale as Trevor haunted me and it gets your mind to be prepared to meet Trevor and his murky life as an industrial worker. There is so much to expect from Brad Anderson and this is his best outing so far as well for Christian Bale. Suspense and Tensions of Trevor keeps us gripped to the seats. This is one of films that will keep you guessing till the end.Brad Anderson has done a wonderful job in capturing an insomniac mood. Overall The Machinist reminded me about Altered states of mind,Jacobs Ladder and the great memento.The plot is confusing and finally makes sense.If you enjoy dark atmospheric psychological mystery thrillers then this is a must on the list. And not to forget the ending i didn't see it coming. Christian Bale as Trevor will be the best in his career. the machinist still haunts after 9+ years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Machinist is a film that has to be seen to be believed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An industrial worker who hasn't slept in a year begins to doubt his own sanity. Trevor Reznik played by Christian Bale, is a machinist in a factory. An extreme case of insomnia has led to him not sleeping in a year, and his body withering away to almost nothing. He has an obsessive compulsion to write himself reminder notes and keep track of his dwindling weight, both scribbled on yellow stickies in his apartment. The only person he lets into his life in an emotional sense is Stevie, a prostitute, although he has an infatuation with Maria, a single mother waitress working in an airport diner. His co-workers don't associate with and mistrust him because of not knowing what is going on in his life that has led to his emaciated physical appearance. A workplace incident further alienates him with his co-workers, and in conjunction with some unfamiliar pieces of paper he finds in his apartment, Trevor believes that someone or some people - probably one or some of his co-workers - are out to get him, using a phantom employee named Ivan as their front. Roger Ebert said that: "The director Brad Anderson, working from a screenplay by Scott Kosar, wants to convey a state of mind, and he and Bale do that with disturbing effectiveness. The photography by Xavi Gimenez and Charlie Jiminez is cold slates, blues and grays, the palate of despair. We see Trevor's world so clearly through his eyes that only gradually does it occur to us that every life is seen through a filter. We get up in the morning in possession of certain assumptions through which all of our experiences must filter. We cannot be rid of those assumptions, although an evolved person can at least try to take them into account. Most people never question their assumptions, and so reality exists for them as they think it does, whether it does or not. Some assumptions are necessary to make life bearable, such as the assumption that we will not die in the next 10 minutes. Others may lead us, as they lead Trevor, into a bleak solitude. Near the end of the movie, we understand him when he simply says, "I just want to sleep." The Machinist is a terrific character study into the life of this mentally unstable man and we as viewers get to see him come undone in his quest for salvation. It is a dark psychological thriller that is hauntingly beautiful in its execution and it ultimately succeeds in doing so. The Machinist is a film that has to be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist is an awesome movie. The plot is great and unpredictable. Christian Bale is in the leading role and he does his job well. I have seen several movies featuring an insane psychopath who really doesn't realize what's real and what's his/hers imagination. For example Psycho, Haute Tension, Hide &amp; Seek and Black Swan are movies like that, but I will remember The Machinist for its dark and smooth plot. It doesn't take a lot of time to realize there's something badly wrong with Trevor, but the ending was very shocking and unexpected. I'm a huge fan of thrillers that include real psychological horror, not just blood and violence. This masterpiece really did its job.&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super surreal experience of a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist - one of my favorite movies. Trevor Reznik is a machine worker who has been suffering from insomnia for a very long time. We know this from the get-go of the film. His insomnia has caused him to lose a great deal of weight. It has even changed his behavior. When a series of strange events begin to happen to Trevor, he is forced to question his own reality. The tagline sums it up perfectly; "How do you wake up from a nightmare if you're not asleep?" I won't go too deep into the movie, because I don't want to spoil it. But one of the great things about the film is that we know only what Trevor knows throughout. We're experiencing the story WITH Trevor. And as the story continues developing, we start to realize that this is about much more than a lack of sleep. The whole film is like putting a puzzle together.If you are a fan of shows like The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, you will love this movie.</fullReview>

This film fits that bill and is something you should check out.It's also quite staggering to think that Christian Bale went from this physical condition straight to Batman, he is an underrated actor who has now likely pigeon holed himself into certain roles, but let's hope not as he has a lot to offer in a variety of roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Does Not Follow Hollywood Conventions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist is a psychological thriller film that stars Christian Bale together with Jennifer Jason Leigh, John Sharian, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón and Michael Ironside.It was written by Scott Kosar and directed by Brad Anderson.Trevor Reznik is a factory lathe operator who has developed a serious case of insomnia. Lack of sleep has already started to wear down on his brain and his body. When he's involved in an accident at work, his co- workers turn against him. He starts to find strange notes in his apartment and see people that apparently aren't there.Then he struggles to assemble the clues of his psychological conundrum. With a friendly hooker and airport waitress as his only stable links to sanity,he reaches critical mass and seems ready to implode just as secrets are revealed as the film progresses.This is worth watching due to the performance of Christian Bale,who literally threw himself into the title role with such devotion that he shed an alarming 63 pounds and gave life into playing Trevor Reznik.Also,it isn't your typical Hollywood film as the viewer has to watch this psychological thriller with full attention, follow along, and decipher for themselves events that happen in the plot.And finally,it is both interesting and entertaining despite being not really a "likable" picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Some Sputters, "The Machinist" runs smoothly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Christian Bale lost a lot of weight for this movie and I did spend time marveling at how thin he got and it inspired me to stick to a diet. A movie, however, should be more than marveling at a thin , albeit grossly thin, actor...and yes, there is more substance to the movie.It's film noir, unfolding in shadows and having characters with questionable motives moving in a paranoid world. In this case, an insomniac who is either being stalked or really is paranoid. Christian Bale is great. Besides being grossly thin, he is realistic, like when he confronts someone who he thinks is a stalker or rambles due to confusion from his insomnia (One year without sleep)The movie reminded me of "Memento" in both its film noir style and a mentally challenged character trying to piece event together, Also, "Repulsion", when we were seeing action through Bale's perspective and use of weird angles. There's also a bit of "Requiem of a Dream" in there.Overall, a good movie, but inconsistent. My interest revved up for some scenes, while dragging at others. The imaginative plot could have made a consistently gripping film.Perhaps in trying to capture an insomniac's mood, the pace was too slow.In all it's a worthy viewing, especially if you enjoyed similar movies. I watched it as one of the free selections on Amazon Prime. As a free flick, you could definitely do worse. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STORY: This is a film that intrigues you from the start. I knew I was going to like this film after only a few minutes. The story plunges you into the mind of insomniac Trevor Resnik; a worker at some form of machine works. He looks so thin he could break in half at any minute. In the first half an hour the film gives you so many questions: Why is he so thin? why hasn't he slept? what is significant about 1:30? What's with the eerie fairground ride? These are all questions that keep you guessing until the last five minutes. A Great film for lovers of this peculiar genre. Anyone familiar with my reviews knows I enjoy a change from the usual Hollywood clones being mass produced, and this definitely isn't one of them. It ( I feel) goes where Fight Club didn't quite reach. 4.5/5EXECUTION: Well most of us (including myself) thought of Christian Bale as Batman or the guy in American psycho (both good films by the way) but The Machinist is where we really get to see his strength and diversity as an actor, it has put him higher in my books. The supporting cast is generally great and the directing style used creates an eerie atmosphere. Most importantly, it avoids any cheesy Hollywood drama or clichés that I have come to expect in most films, a pleasant surprise. The execution really adds to the exciting, thought provoking plot, making the whole experience entirely worthwhile. 4.5/5VERDICT: Highly recommended film for people who, like me, get bored with the usual Hollywood blockbusters and would rather have a thought provoking, slow moving but intriguing film. 4.5 + 4.5 = 9/10</fullReview>

What attracted my attention the most (that could be reviewed without spoilers) was the music. There is a lot of use of stringed instruments and what sounds like a theremin to generate a feel that seems to be a very peculiar, otherworldly twist on 1950s film noir.The music is haunting and really sets the tone of the film. Visuals are used to good effect, and while the movie can be "figured out", it's very easy to sit back and let the movie lead you along without trying to "solve" the film.A very good film overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than just a showcase for Christian Bale's acting talent and frightening dedication to his work, The Machinist is a thriller that is truly atmospheric, and worth watching more than once.I would be doing anyone who hasn't seen the film a disservice by explaining too much about the plot. Simply put, Bale's Trevor Reznik is a malnourished insomniac who gets increasingly paranoid. And boy, is he thin. A real-life mirror image of the eerie hangman doodles that pop up throughout the film, Bale's body makes for half of The Machinist's disturbing quality. The other half comes from Brad Anderson's direction. An atmosphere of unease and paranoia runs throughout pretty much every scene, and Anderson just nails it. It's confusing how relatively little attention he seems to have garnered after the release of this movie. His talent is undeniable.The cast fit into their roles nicely, with Bale taking good material and doing amazing things with it in a performance second only to Bateman. Reznik's fatigue and subsequent disconnection from reality is often painfully convincing.Perhaps the way the film piles disturbing event on top of disturbing event gets to be a bit too much after a while, but none of what is shown on screen is unnecessary or irrelevant. And although the ending isn't wholly unpredictable, the final revelation, and Reznik's reaction to it, is moving and rewarding. The ending, in which we see this broken-down shell of a person find some kind of peace, makes the long, grueling journey leading up to it worthwhile. An engaging film, well worth your time.</fullReview>

The supremely talented actor not only gives in a towering performance but also carries the film on his shoulder. It's his show all the way. It is very difficult to find such a hard working actor in the industry and Christian Bale went ahead and proved his mettle. Screenplay was brilliantly executed keeping the attention of the viewers in mind. Cinematography was nice along with the editing of the film. Rest of the star cast was just fine especially the one who plays Ivan, So , overall , a very nice what-is-going-on-next thriller that is handled efficiently and worth watching because of only one person ?

		<fullReview>"Who are you?" Christian Bale goes beyond extremity in his role as Trevor Reznik. He lost over 30 kg (60 lbs) to get this troubled skeleton looking character to life. A tremendous act of commitment for the part and method acting at its best.Trevor Reznik hasn't slept for over a year. He works in a factory as a machinist. One day he causes an accident to a co-worker. He was distracted because of Ivan, a mysterious man who seems to know something about his past.After the accident, Trevor starts to get closer to paranoia, he thinks that his co-workers have made a plot against him. Mysterious notes, with the game of hangman, starts to appear at his home. The only comfort he gets is from a whore, played by the always great Jennifer Jason Leigh, and a waitress, whom he meets every night after work at the airport cafeteria."What, babe? What's going on in that crazy head of yours?" 'The Machinist' has some familiar themes like insomnia and the consequences of it. Is it all just an illusion or harsh reality? It is hard to trust the images given to the viewer, the world seems different to Trevor than to the other people in the film. It's difficult to know who's real and who is not."You outta do something about that faulty memory of yours, pal. Might make life a little bit easier." The film offers some "deja vu" like scenes. For example the Route 666 scene where Trevor is offered two choices; "Highway to Hell" or "Road to Salvation". Later on in the movie, in the sewers there's either A or B, dark or light. This is just an example on how detailed the script is. Another fine example on the mystery is the register plates on the cars.

		<fullReview>Chrisitian Bail is lord of loners. The way he portrays a character cannot be done by anyone on this earth. He is so dedicated to his work, that there are no limits. In this title he is worker at National Machines doing night shift. In the starting scenes he says to his girl that HE HASN'T SLEPT IN A YEAR. I was surprised to see that his skinny body is real. he has shed a lot of weight to become like that. First time I saw his scene where he is almost naked, I thought Is he really the BATMAN guy. Then strange things starts to happen. He starts to think that everybody is plotting against him. After one hour of the movie he really starts acting like a true psycho. The mystery is revealed at the end. Its another great movie of this star who always do philosophical roles, which have some philosophy hidden in them. This movie also has a philosophy, philosophy of Hidden GUILT inside us.You should really watch, its out of line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kudos to the director, writer and the lead actor along with the entire cast. Psychological thrillers are my favourite and to find a good one is difficult. This surely went past my expectations.While we guess what will happen to the Christian Bale and what will he do, pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are served to us without us even knowing that they are a part of a larger puzzle. So when in the end everything is brought together along with the past of the central character the audience take home more than what they were looking for in the first place. Isn't that the best thing to have in the world - getting something more than what you expected?The characters of the waitress at the airport, the prostitute in the apartment, Reznik were well drawn and the acting impeccable. The movie is gripping and when the suspense opens in the end we are left with a remarkable insight into the mind of a schizophrenic. The realization that Bale/Reznik has is sudden and abrupt, but it does not hurt. The reduction of camera colour brings a gloom very necessary for the film. If you like discussing films, this movie will give you plenty of things to do just that.If intricacies of the human mind fascinates you, this is a made for you movie... Don't miss, don't delay watching it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the most underrated movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was just incredible. I obtained it by reading one of the lists on IMDb called 'the most depressing movies' or something along those lines. I really didn't expect what I saw. The fall into paranoia was something that I have never seen portrayed in this way before. I could relate to the movie because I've had my share of bouts of insomnia. Not chronic, thank god, like the movie character Reznik, but mild that lasted almost a month. I recommend this movie for anyone that can handle such realism; it might appear to be one of those fake movies with the supernatural, but the doppelganger in Ivan is one of the most thrilling characters in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see for Cristian Bale's performance and his appearance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist is a psychological thriller directed by Brad Anderson, based on a script by Scott Kosar, and produced and shot in Spain after most American production companies rejected the project as weird. The Machinist plays out like something David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick might have made, but most of the strength comes from Bale's performance. It should be noted that Bale lost 60 pounds in preparation for this role, and the result is disturbing to look at. We see this man reduced to a mere skeleton, not just in body, but in mind. The whole film has shades of dark and is reminiscent of something, which we discover towards the end when the mystery unravels. Simply put, the film shows what can happen if one tries to hide something from self long enough. Christian Bale is unbelievable as the insomniac paranoiac steal worker Trevor Reznik, and one wonders why he wasn't nominated to the Oscars that year. The fact that he bothered to get so thin, a walking skeleton really, shows how committed (or crazy) he is about acting. The viewer has to be thankful, though, as his decayed physique helps his character and the movie immensely. Bale just doesn't act, he psychologically splits himself to become Reznik. And anything he does in this movie is believable, raw and authentic.Bale's counterpart Ivan is played by John Sharian, who is cheekily disturbing in his performance. You hate him immediately, physically, the way the moves, the way he dresses, the way he smiles, still, there is something appealing and warm about him. I think his performance and his physique add even more interest to the theme of Raznik's quest for identity. Aitana Sanchez Gijon and Jennifer Jason Leigh are good as Marie and Stevie, respectively. The rest of the cast are all believable in their respective supporting roles.This is a terrific movie, with a great atmosphere, a thought-provoking script, and a brilliant performance by Christian Bale. The Machinist is one of those multi-layered stories and movies from which you get new details each time you see it. The stylish cinematography and washed out colors are very effective in adding to this nightmarish atmosphere. The art direction and special effects are brilliant. Even though it starts off a little slow, the gradual building of tension is very well done and the mystery is properly revealed in the end.I love films that make you think, and this one certainly does that. Yes, at times it does get a little ponderous, but I can forgive that because it does all tie up in the end. So, over all, a well made, dark mystery thriller with a great score and a brilliant performance from Christian Bale?His appearance shows the guy's tremendous determination towards acting and everyone must appreciate that. I wonder why din't he get an Oscar nomination that year. I rate the movie 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

If you like thriller and mystery, you are going to love it.The whole film has shades of dark and is reminiscent of something, which we discover towards the end when the mystery unravels.After the film, I did some research on the film: Christian lost more than 28 kilograms for this film! That simply means how dedicated he was for the film and it really shows as you watch the film.This is probably my maiden review on IMDb and not without reasons?watch the Machinist and find it out yourself. Great acting by all, great story with justice, in the end. Christian Bale rocks! Not everyone will like this film though?many people like their movies to be loud and obvious; such people can avoid this film and watch his other films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film-making at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film for those having a soft spot for mystique. It's an absolute masterpiece, and personally I give it the highest rating of all the films I have seen in, say, last 4 years. The setting, the pace, camera work, the cast - all together create an effect of instant classic, that sticks with you for days after viewing, demanding multiple views. Yes, this film can (and should) be seen many times, and each view is a treat.It should be said that there are quite a lot of references to the Freudian\Jungian elements in the film (as well as Tarot) and being able to read those symbols can significantly enhance viewing experience. All key characters and even scenery elements have reference to symbolism\archetypes used in psychoanalysis.A possible tag-line for this film could sound like this: IF YOU'RE HIDING FROM YOURSELF, WHO DO YOU EXPECT TO COME SEARCHING? Simply put, the film shows what can happen if one tries to hide something from self long enough. Trevor Reznik is a person who is haunted by something, and until the very end we are not clear, what it is exactly that haunts him, although we also see clear indications that he isn't quite aware of who he is.As we know from psychoanalysis, the unwanted\traumatic memories are typically repressed down to our subconscious, while our consciousness can play tricks on our perception, creating visible and even palpable manifestations of the repressed facts (which constitutes so beautifully the subject matter of films such as this). The 'Ivan' character, for instance, is clearly the 'Shadow' archetype (the deeper Self that keeps the repressed memory). The carnival wheel-ride (and the huge towering building) that at one point are seen as background for the traumatic female image, are clear embodiments of the 'Tower' archetype (symbol of foreboding, looming trouble).Music calls for a separate Academy Award because if Hitchcock's name should be mentioned here, music is the key ingredient that makes all trademark features click into one. The interplay between vibraphone/harp and cello/theremin in most significant themes are beyond any praise.This is indeed a brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Machinist' is a tense and chilling atmospheric and character driven piece. Anderson, his cast and crew do a tremendous job in building suspense. Where style of execution is concerned, Brad Anderson seems to have been inspired by filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick. The editing and score feels very Hitchcockian while the claustrophobic darkness and feel of space is very Kubrickian.The stylish cinematography and washed out colours are very effective in adding to this nightmarish atmosphere. The art direction and special effects are brilliant.Christian Bale and Jennifer Jason Leigh deliver exceptional performances. Even though I have reservations about the fact that in reality Bale thinned down to a bag of bones for the role, his appearance does add to the atmosphere. Beautiful Aitana Sánchez-Gijón has a charming screen presence.The writing is wonderful. The dialogues are poetic in a subtle way and this couples well with the artistic visuals. I cannot say much about the story without risking spoilers but, even though it starts off a little slow, the gradual building of tension is very well done and the mystery is properly revealed in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent stuff... A great modern dark mystery thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film several years ago and I remember being amazed by the performance of Christian Bale. He is so thin it's almost unbelievable that he is able to perform. The film deals with the tricks the mind can play on you and the consequences thereof. But more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please help Miller fix that machine over there while I write the next paragraph).Trevor Reznik has not slept in over a year; he hardly eats and leaves lots of post-it notes all over his apartment to remind him to do things. He works, as the title suggests, as a machinist in a factory where he is just about tolerated by his workmates. He visits a hooker, Stevie, who he confides in and she, looking for a way out of the business, has some affection for him too. Late at night he goes to the airport where he has coffee and has conversations with the waitress, Marie. One day a mysterious stranger turns up at work, a man who calls himself Ivan. And whilst helping Miller fix a machine Trevor gets distracted by Ivan and causes an accident. This eventually leads to his dismissal as he becomes more and more paranoid about Ivan. As he sinks deeper into his paranoia he begins to hallucinate more and more and the line between hallucinations and reality becomes blurred. What is at the root of all this? Well, a resolution is found in the film? but you're crazy if you think I'm gonna tell you here.This is a really dark gritty film, very well made with a really great soundtrack that fits the mood perfectly. It almost has the air of film noir about it, or maybe that's just the mood set by the musical score. A really great performance from Christian Bale as Trevor Reznik, how he got so thin I'll never know. Also worth an honourable mention are; Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stevie, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón as Marie, John Sharian as Ivan and Michael Ironside as Miller.I love films that make you think, and this one certainly does that. Yes, at times it does get a little ponderous, but I can forgive that because it does all tie up in the end. So, over all, a well made, dark mystery thriller with a great score and a brilliant performance from Christian Bale? Very highly recommended.My score: 8.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I really enjoy about movies is in this film. A twisted tale that keeps your mind focused and gives different ideas where the story might go. So intense. A real pleasure to see. Except Christian Bale (Trevor Reznik), who is phenomenal, but not so good to see. He weighs about 120 pounds and looks like an human skeleton. But he is the king of the castle here. Absolutely steals the whole show. His greatest performance by a clear mile. In my opinion, very underrated.All the distractions should be removed when you see this one. It would be better if the lights are off. You get that cold chill through your body, I guarantee. It's a thrilling experience. I utterly enjoyed it.

		<shortDescription>Not a film you can just throw in any old time, but it is good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, when you see Christian Bale in this film know that it is indeed him and not a computer generated image. Bale lost nearly 60 pounds for this role and he looks so gaunt and emaciated you wonder if it could possibly be real, it is.Bale plays Trevor Reznik, a machinist who hasn't slept for a year. His physical appearance is just one side effect of the lack of sleep, he also suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations. Watching the movie I spent a great deal of time trying to determine what was real and what was fantasy as I witnessed Bale's slow decent into utter madness. The movie is not just about the journey though, it is also about the cause, which we discover in the closing minutes of the film. I won't give away the ending but I will say that it is a satisfying and sensible one.Be patient with the film, it does take some time to really get going, but once it does you will be hopelessly trapped in the shifting maze that is Bale's reality. In every scene you recognize and believe his pain, confusion, anger, and madness. The Machinist is not the kind of movie you will want to see over and over, but rather take in once and keep it with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent Bale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just before Christian Bale really became famous he was the leading role in this brilliant suspense flick. I wouldn't say that it is a horror but some do because the mind is playing tricks. Nothing supernatural but still spooky. The director Brad Anderson was already famous with Session 9. Here he shows that he can do it again. The acting of Christian is really excellent. For me the movie "American psycho" was a big flop, sadly his name was attached to it. But here, you really can't believe what he did for this flick. See his body, no tricks, he was really skinny. The shots where the dreams are revealed shows Christian as how he looks in a normal life. You really could see that an Oscar is on his way...Which actor would dropped an amazing 63 pounds for his role? It's all about the insomniac Trevor Reznik and his hallucinations. The other actors are all believable. It isn't really bloody but the flick is over before you knew it. Michael Ironside has a small role in it, typical Michael. One to watch especially to see the body of Christian and no, I am not gay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have started watching this movie a while back, but turned it off after about half an hour, because it was already getting late, and however much i might like movies of this kind, I just couldn't keep my eyes open (shame on me) and I have to admit, it did not quite grab my attention as much as it is supposed to at the first time (again, it might have been because i was so tired) Yesterday, I had some spare time and decided to watch The Machinist. The pace of the movie is rather slow, and during the first hour, I had basically no idea of the protagonist's background at all, and most of the time, there is no overlap between scenes, which makes the movie very interesting, yet extremely hard to follow. I can say however, (without spoiling any details of the story) That in the last couple of minutes, everything suddenly becomes clear, and you will be left staring at your television with your jaw hanging, unable to comment on what you have just seen. This movie is not for everyone though. It's a genuine dive into the depths of human mind, insanity, loneliness, and the like. There is certain darkness hanging over the movie the entire time, the atmosphere is depressive, unsure, and you have nothing to grab onto. This is further strengthened by the acting of Christian Bale, which is -needless to say- flawless. If you like movies that leave you thinking about it even hours after you turn off your TV, this one is definitely for you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superbly atmospheric and engaging film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist stars Christian Bale (playing the main lead excellently) who plays the character of Trevor Reznik, an exceptionally thin man, so much so you can see his skeleton who is plagued by fatigue after not having slept in more than a year. He works in a machine factory where one day he causes an accident one of his co-workers that leads him to losing his arm. They blame him for it and want him out of the job. Soon he starts to suspect they are conspiring against him when strange post it note messages appear on Trevor's fridge. whilst also he is haunted by a figure dressed in a black leather jacket and sunglasses called Ivan (played superbly by John Sharian). He tells Trevor he works in the factory but his co-workers and bosses claim he dosen't exist.Trevors quest to find out what is happening to him takes him into an interaction with other characters, Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays hooker Stevie with surprising heart in places, a waitress Maria at the airport who Trevor goes to for coffee and pie and her son. Is Trevor going mad in his investigation with not having slept in more than a year or is someone/people plotting against him for the accident at the factory? You won't get me telling you.This is a wonderfully bleak and atmospheric film with director Brad Anderson using dark and natural lighting to convey the fatigue and loneliness of Bale's character Trevor. Bale actually became deliberately thin for this part and when you first see this film, it's a shocking and grotesque sight to see particularly when Stevie comments on his exceptionally thin figure and he moves his body so you can actually see the shape of the bones beneath his skin. It's a testament to Bale that he has helped make Anderson's film so authentic in this way and like mostly every actor Bale has had his good and bad films but this is one of his better one with a performance that truly depicts the horror of what Trevor is going through.Be warned now this isn't a typical Hollywood pop-corn trash movie. It's the film with the air of an independent one with a low budget, the story is structured in such a way, it becomes confusing as to what's happening (quite similar though not as complex or grand a scale as Mulholland Drive) but stick with it as it is intriguing and by the end it is all explained. The twist of what actually happened was shocking though it would have been nice to understand more motivation behind Trevor's character of why. If you watch this after reading it or have seen it and read this. You will know what I mean. This is a great film for character study of a man and his mind. I thoroughly enjoyed this even if it did take a little time to become immersed in it as I was unsure at first with where the film was going. Be patient though and you will be rewarded with a complex but compelling and excellently acted and made movie that puts Bale's dismal performance of the Dark Knight (the last film I saw him in back in the shade)and him back on form. N0TE: It seems after this film his family fattened him up again. Thank god!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christian Bale is simply amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist is just one of the many reasons why Christian Bale is my favorite actor. I can't help but be amazed by every role that he takes on, each so different than the last. But what is even more amazing is his dedication to each character that he portrays. Before filming the movie, Bale lost 63 pounds... enough said. The Machinist is a very unusual movie, however it's the originality that makes it that much more interesting. It follows Trevor Reznik (Bale) throughout the entire film, you only know what he knows, and that isn't much. Slowly the movie throws clues at you, however it is not until the end that you find out what has been going on the whole time. The best part is that it is not the typical, "lets finish this by throwing in some bull crap twist," (M. Night Shyamalan) because each scene is crucial to the end. The score is also something to pay attention too, it's actually almost impossible not to. It sounds as if it was pulled straight from a Hitchcock movie, however it works beautifully throughout, building suspense at just the right moments. The movie is a complete mind trip, one that I look forward to going through again, seeing as this is a movie you cannot watch only once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be interesting to know why this movie was shot in Barcelona, Spain and how it came to this American-Spanish Co-production. The Movie is full of details. Again and again aspects of strong tiredness are shown which I have experiences by myself. Of course I have never suffered from exceptional insomia, but the doubt, whether something is a dejavu or whether something just happened before of for the first time, all of that I can understand. For a long time you think that Trevor's insomia leads to a simple wellknown schizophrenia but in the end everything is a lot more low-digging which is great. In the end there is the question why Trevor works in a factory. If I add the cinematography, which shows a depressing image of the city Trevor lives in, I can't help of thinking about the "expressionism", when people could not deal with the depression of the city and feared the threat of modern life. I come to the conclusion that Trevor is a victim of the isolation, which, as a result of the cities, developed because of the industrialization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The eerie appearance of Christian Bale serves to underscore the bizarre happenings of this film and add more than a mere touch of terrifying realism to the movie. Trevor Reznik, a machinist, is literally wasting away. He has not slept in nearly a year. Something is eating him alive. But what? Rather than he obtaining nourishment from life, this unknown force is eating him alive from the inside out.It's not a case of anorexia?in fact, he appears to be fed rather well by a lovely waitress, a single Mom whose son is the center of her universe, (whom he generously over tip?perhaps out of guilt or maybe a sense of kinsman ship, he also having been raised by a single mom). Yet despite his generously portioned meals, he continues to be eaten away by some unknown, more than ordinary force.To compound the intrigue, a co-worker, whom only Trevor seems to interact with, serves almost as Trevor's alter-ego or conscience. He seems to be aligned with a mysterious game of hangman which appears throughout the movie, seemingly pointing one in the direction of the unknown villain. The shock comes to a climax when both Trevor and the watcher realize the letters of the game seem to spell Trevor's name. The crime, if any, remains the mystery.This is a very suspenseful, psychological, thriller. I'm usually fairly good at guessing what's going on, but this one took me a while. As the truth slowly dawns on Trevor, it also awakens the watcher to the reality of the situation with a shuddering thunder.Well worth the watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could so easily have been a 9 out of 10, but it loses some points because of the predictability towards the end. Starring Christian Bale as Trevor and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stevie in two of their best performances, the only weak character I found was Nicholas. I didn't connect with this actor; perhaps that was an intentional casting choice given his role in the story. Without giving any spoilers, I will say that it was a shame Anderson didn't receive the industry support he needed. Why we can see incredibly stupid movies made and promoted while projects such as The Machinist are abandoned eludes me.Both Bale and Leigh are not pleasant actors to watch; when they take on a role, they do not sugarcoat any aspect of that character. They have an ability to make the entire character come alive - as real as any person you meet on the street. This is a rare talent in the current crop of "a mile wide and an inch deep" so commonly seen today. I think the best way to judge the quality of an actor's work is by whether or not you are aware of the actor playing the character or the character itself. As always, with these two, it's Trevor and Stevie you remember, not Bale and Leigh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Psycho-Drama: Good, but not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drawing influence from Hitchcock and, in particular, David Lynch, Anderson weaves the odd tale of Trevor (Christian Bale), a heavy machinery operator. What strike you right off about Trevor is how INCREDIBLY SKINNY he is. This is the famous role for which the 6-foot Bale starved himself down to 117 lb. He literally looks like a walking skeleton. Trevor never sleeps, eats little (of course), doesn't drink much either. He does see a prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh, some 12 years his senior, but she pulls it off) who wants to be his girlfriend, despite the fact she outweighs him by at least 20 pounds. Anyway, Trevor's minimal life is thrown into turmoil when he starts finding strange post-it notes on his refrigerator. They seem to be the beginnings of the old 'Hang Man' word-spelling game we all played in the school yard. Simultaneously, Trevor meets a waitress, with whom he begins a romance. There is violence and a couple of shocks in this movie, intended to throw the narrative off-kilter, and to open up numerous interpretations. As the film progresses, reality and unreality become mixed. Paranoia and impending doom become the dominant moods. Characters we come to know cease to exist or become interchanged. One is never sure quite what is real and what is not. This is not a terribly original idea, of course, but Anderson, with the help of Bale's very committed performance, makes it very watchable. By midpoint, we are firmly in David Lynch territory, and while the film lacks Lynch's poetic touch, it's a pretty satisfying watch. The music score by Roque Banos pays homage to Bernard Herrmann without actually quoting him; it adds quite a bit to the experience.Here's another, and pretty good, example of where Film Noir went after the classic period: deeper into the psyche of the main character. Recommended to all aficionados of post-, neo- Noir, or whatever label you want to use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although bleak, it's only the exterior.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, this is not a mood piece. Although bleak in general terms, the pristine cleanliness of the tone of the movie and the surroundings in most of the scenes of this movie, even the main character's working place, gives and impression of detachment. It is probably due to the fact that in movies, one almost never sees surfaces smudged with greasy fingerprints or such things. For dirt to look authentic it has to be applied. In any case in this movie, the sterility enhances the emotional and physical austerity of the atmosphere, yet providing the viewer with modest beauty.I was positively surprised by Christian Bale's performance. His over-enthused conduct (albeit fitting to the character) in The American Psycho left me cold. I would recommend the Machinist to anyone who wants to take one's time to really watch a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Study of Guilt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a creepy film, but as a psychological drama and a study in the devastating effects of guilt, it is absorbing. How many other lead actors would lose sixty pounds from their normal weight and look as bad as a Holocaust survivor just for a movie role? That's dedication, although obviously, going to such lengths unnecessarily is ill-advised. It is interesting the way Trevor gradually deduces who it is that is screwing around with his mind and his life, blaming first one person and then another. The best scene was when he suddenly suspects that his hooker girlfriend, Stevie, must be the guilty party and he confronts her in the kitchen. Sobbing, sarcastic, and resentful, he looks absolutely pathetic. After I saw this thing, the possibility that I, too, might have done something bad that I can't quite remember was swimming around my addled brain. In a weird way, I enjoyed the troubling sensation. This is a good movie and well worth a look. Expect, however, to be disturbed by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straight from the 60's "Twilight Zone"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm coming right out and saying that this movie is really good!! However, you will feel like you have taken that, "..giant leap, into - The Twilight Zone!" I love the "Twilight Zone" shows of yesteryear, so this movie really appealed to me. A lot of the scenes were so lacking in color, that I swear it was actually in Black &amp; White. The eerie music that is "Classic" Twilight Zone material quickly takes you back to the 60's. Also, there is some of that double exposure and tilting camera angles {along with that eerie music} - you just cannot help making the comparison. I was expecting Rod Serling to pop up at the end for the ever famous final thought and recap. WOW!! OK - enough for that.Anyway, This is a real exciting "Slow paced" thriller. By that I mean that there is a real story behind it and it's not all covered up with high speed chases and junk like that. Is Trevor {Christian Bale - played Batman in Batman Begins} insane? Is it a plot to get him fired from work? Jealous Boyfriend? Or something else? You may not guess the answer until the ending as any good thriller should be able to do.WARNING: Christian Bale is so skinny - "That if he got any thinner, he wouldn't exist". {No - that's not a spoiler - just a line they use in the movie}. He's about 120 lbs So that's about it, I think it's pretty good for a low budget movie.</fullReview>

This is one movie that I did.I agree with one submitter that it isn't for everybody (what film is) but that doesn't diminish the quality of the film. I was very impressed by Bale. Jennifer Jason Leigh was terrific, as was the waitress. The mood is creepy enough to keep me from being disinterested, and yet doesn't attempt to scare me for the sake of doing so. I would compare this movie to Momento, so if you enjoyed that one, this is right up your alley. Less shock and mayhem that American Psycho, and much better acting, IMO. I plan on seeing Session 9, I enjoyed this film so much.Bravo Bale and Anderson...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerising: study in guilt and paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film where atmosphere and images are the plot!! The film is atmospherically shot, with no real colours, representative of the darkness and sombreness of Reznik's mind.Reznik (the central character) who hasn't slept in a year, is captivatingly and convincingly played by Christian Bale. There are shades of Beautiful Mind here: the film is, clearly, a study of Reznik's psyche, and a brilliant study of paranoia, bought on by guilt. This is Bale's film: physically, he creates a likable but painful Trevor Reznick. Jennifer Jason-Leigh, as a prostitute who is prepared (eventually)to commit to the character played by Ble, is equally good and understated.This is not an "easy" film to watch-- because we are dealing with a man who is not in full control of his mind -- he hasn't slept for a year, and has insomnia and delusions.But it is a rewarding film and well worth engaging with: it is NOT a "crowd pleaser" but should be sen by movie-philes and those with an interest in psychology. Mesmerising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim, well-acted movie that grabs your interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian Bale and Jennifer Jason Leigh give outstanding performances in this psycho-drama that steadily cranks up the chill factor while keeping you dreading whatever kind of weirdness and bad news will happen next. This movie isn't quite as good a psycho-thriller as the top-notch "Frailty" (which is one of the most intense, frightening and gripping movies I've ever seen), and will remind you somewhat of "Jacob's Ladder", wherein the protagonist's hallucinations are hard to separate from the "normal" state of being and where the penny drops for you at the very end of the movie, but it's really entertaining, especially the macabre amusement-park ride that the protagonist, Trevor Reznik (played by Christian Bale), takes at one point.The movie is beautifully filmed in a sort of pseudo black-and-white, to emphasize Trevor's bleak world and state of mind - a state of mind that goes along with working in a large machine-shop and not having slept for a year. A year! Not only that, but Trevor is a physical wreck - skeletally gaunt and looking strung out on the coffee and cigs that he consumes and whatever it is that is driving his apparent psychosis. So why has Trevor not slept for a year and why is he such a wreck? And why does JJL, playing a hooker, seem so fond of him? (She's too plumply gorgeous to be a hooker in Trevor's world, but who cares?, and she manages to act believable anyway.) Watch the movie and enjoy finding out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Vertigo, and worthy of the comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An outstanding modern fable about obsession, memory and identity. All these issues have probably been covered for all time by Hitchcock''s Vertigo and Brad Anderson's film doesn't ignore that 1958 masterpiece. The Roque Banos score recalls Bernard Hermann's (by way of Portishead) and there are a number of other very specific Hitchcockian devices - thematic links, symbolic objects in the foreground of shots, as well as quick inter-scene movement via cross-fade. We even get Vertiginous colour coding to an extent: the largely green hues of Reznick's struggling rationality offset with the pungent scarlet of the car that is the beginning of his fall.Anderson doesn't try and do too much over and above this. His concern is the consistent pacing of the narrative, a goal which is admirably achieved (there's no patchiness). Bale gives a quite brilliant performance, complicated but coherent, using his celebrated weight-loss as a bit-part to the character. His grasp on Reznick's unravelling combines with Anderson's pacing to ensure that the one or two inevitable loose ends are swept up in the story's momentum. Fine support from Jennier Jason-Leigh too. Excellent 8/10</fullReview>

Bale makes a huge blow in this epic thriller as an insomnia stricken blue collar worker Trever Reznick who begins to question his own sanity as he plunges deeper and deeper into this mind numbing mystery that echoes of a Hitchcock twist. Director Anderson does a phenomenal job directing the stars and Bale gives 110 percent losing sixty-something pounds to be the lightweight paranoid Trevor, not surprised if he wins best actor. A truly deep and dark tale that is sure to keep you guessing to the last dramatic scene. Leigh also plays a fine tuned prostitute, great acting all around.

		<shortDescription>Shades of "Fight Club" blended with Hitchcockian mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trevor Reznik(Christian Bale,starved and almost sickeningly fleshed-out)is the title character,a quiet,unassuming man who hasn't slept in a year,eats very little and has few(if any)friends. His only real relationships are with a good-humored hooker(Jennifer Jason-Leigh,perfect in this part.That sounds bad,I know)and a kindly waitress at an airport. His sense of reality seems to be taking a beating as he finds himself unable to explain his erratic behavior and his meeting a person who nobody else at work is aware of. While distracted on the job,he causes an accident that maims one of his coworkers(Michael Ironside,understated here),and from there,the film's pulse-beat really picks up.Actually,I'm trying hard not to give anything away here,but I feel like I am almost doing so anyway by my description of this film in the summary above. It is,however,tough for me to describe it WITHOUT drawing these comparisons. A quick parallel:both "Fight Club" and "MAchinist" have a main protagonist who is sleep-deprived and socially crippled,and both are having their lives slowly spiral out of control. Both also have a twist ending,too. The Hitchcock touches to me are mostly in the cinematography and music,which always hint toward something more sinister and dark on the horizon,even as the settings and events on the screen SEEM pretty ordinary. THis film is,on the whole,quite interesting and well-done,but a previous review summed it up well:this is NOT a movie for just anyone. In fact,it could be considered the definitive of an "aquired taste",cineaste type of viewing,because the rhythm and images of this film are certainly unsettling. However,if you like moody,strange films with darker messages and a puzzle at its heart,go for this one.</fullReview>

However, i was very impressed with the film. Similar to films such as Fight Club and Memento in its portrayal of a disillusioned man, who begins doubting his own memory and perceptions, believing everyone else to be plotting against him. The slow tempo to the film, backed by a sombre soundtrack means that the mood of the film fits perfectly with the slow, unravelling of the plot. Christian Bale gives an excellent performance as Trevor Reznik, an insomniac whose physical appearance is somewhat disturbing. Overall, an enjoyable film to suit the tastes of all movie-goers who appreciate that everything you see on-screen is not definitely there!</fullReview>

Starving yourself this bad for a character is borderline uncool - even though it made the story more believable. All that press about Bridget Jones and putting on weight - what about looking like a walking corpse?The story is well written and the set is almost black and white in its bleakness - it has a sickly green/gray/yellow tint. The feel is paranoid from the get go, and then it gets more and more twisted.This is good weird - and Christian Bale is fantastic!</fullReview>

Very good, very dark, very well written and directed...the storytelling is awesome. So, much like my summary states, is familiar in both subject matter and the general feel of the film. Christian Bale is awesome (and looks AWFUL...he ate a one-cubic-inch size piece of fish for months to lose enough weight to do this movie, he looks like a starving Ethiopian, sorry if that sounds politically incorrect...)...and believe it or not, Jennifer Jason Leigh is actually quite good as well. If you get the chance, get the DVD and check out the Special Features AFTER you watch it.

Bale is so freakishly thin in this movie that you cannot help but watch to find out why. He seemed to actually unzip himself and crawl right inside of a man who was guilt stricken and seriously ailing from it. it makes me wonder even more about our mental states and how we cope with our actions, or the actions of others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd like to report a hit-and-run.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to say that I hated the film Monster. You are probably wondering what that has to do with the film The Machinist? Let me tell you. In Monster, Charlize Theron goes "ugly" in attempt to capture the character that she is trying to portray. She wins an Oscar, not because her acting was good, but because people could not believe that was Theron so "ugly". From that point on I was a strong believer that you could dress up the actor all you want, but deep inside it is still the same actor. Charlize Theron ugly is still Charlize Theron. So, needless to say, I was skeptical at first to see how Christian Bale would do with dropping 65 pounds to play the role of Trevor Reznik, an insomniac factory worker with a forgotten secret. Was it going to be like Monster and spend two hours watching Christian Bale play a skinny Christian Bale? I my utter surprise, it was not. Bale, by dropping the weight, accomplished what so many "physical" actors can only dream about. He gave depth, a physical persona, and a very frightening image to this character that took us away from Bale the actor. Throughout the entire film, I could only see Trevor Reznik. Perhaps it was a trick. Perhaps Bale couldn't do the character otherwise, but for me, a viewer of the film, it helped create the dark ambiance that shook me to the core until the very end.My first applaud goes to director Brad Anderson for his simplistic, yet chaotic filming of this story. Throughout the entire viewing, you are given this impression that something is going over your head. You know that you are missing something and that the ending will shock and amaze you. For anyone that has grown up in the Usual Suspects or Sixth Sense era, you can smell this film coming from a mile away, but it is the way that Anderson provides the story to you that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. After a vast array of "shock-ending" films, it is hard to come up with a new, original, and tactful idea that will keep audiences talking long after the credits roll. Anderson has done a brave new job with The Machinist in providing that chatter after the film. He showed us his darker side in Session 9 and he doesn't go too commercial in this film. It is haunting, riveting, and challenging all at the same time ? to say that about a director's work is rare today.The acting is superb. Jennifer Jason Leigh again gives us the beauty of grime and the ability to transform this very small character into a powerhouse role. She gives so much emotion and humility to her character, which makes you forget (or perhaps not notice) what her true "profession" is. There are also so many secrets about her that you cannot help but sit around after the film and think of her story outside of how she reacts with Reznik. I don't know if anyone else did this, but I couldn't keep her out of my mind. She was amazing. Then you have John Sharian playing the polar opposite of Bale in such a frightening way that he nearly steals every scene away from Bale. He is huge, bulky, and rather transfixing as perhaps the living conscious of Bale. Following Leigh's feminine role is that of Aitana Sánchez-Gijón playing Marie. This very unknown character that seems to be the only smiling face in the film. She gives comfort to not only Reznik, but also to us. She is our guiding light at the end of this dark tunnel that surprises you to the very end. Then you have everyone that is around Reznik like his co-workers, his landlady, and even himself. A powerful cast that is accentuated with a bold and original story.Finally, I would like to say that outside of the talented acting and bold direction, you actually have an amazing story. I know I have mentioned this several times, but you cannot walk away from this story without discussing it thoroughly with friends and family afterwords. It is like a cinematic drug that you cannot get enough of. I thought that with my second viewing that I would have already seen all that I could, but instead I was provided with moments, mere glimpses of truth, that I just completely missed during the first viewing. It was inspirational to see such dark, yet powerful storytelling to come from a nearly recycled Hollywood. Sure, there are elements of Fight Club, Sixth Sense, and Usual Suspects all mixed into this film, but Anderson gives it his own flare. Bale goes to a new extreme proving that he can manage both big box office hits, and these itty-bitty gems. The Machinist is a refreshing moment for both you and your DVD player.Overall, I really thought this was one of the most powerful films to come out of Hollywood this year. I would love to see Bale take home a golden statue for his portrayal in this film, but I noticed that Charlize Theron is going to be "ugly" again in North Country, so I think he will be passed up again. Bale is becoming such a strong actor because he is constantly working with the quintessential directors in Hollywood. Not the Bruckheimers, not the Bays, but with these smaller directors that are not afraid to take a leap of faith with Bale. I have not been disappointed with his work, and I think all that watch this film are going to walk away and see Bale as more than just the "man in a bat suit", but instead a strong voiced actor that can tackle any role.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

While anyone could not actually survive without any sleep for a year, it makes you wonder how the mind can and will play tricks with what you see and hear. Though there are not any big screen names in the movie everyone does a wonderful job.

Sometimes to stress the mystery without keeping a tight hand on the symbols is undermining and the main flaw in the script starts from letting too much space for over-interpretation.However, the movie should lie next to Psycho in the Movie Theory Courses as a brilliant stuff for psychoanalytical themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Hallucination Backed by Classic Hitchcock Score ? 8 (very good)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking heed of the advice of my good friend and IMDb correspondent "The Oscillator," I searched out a DVD copy of THE MACHINIST and was rapt in suspense from beginning to end.Christian Bale plays an emaciated Trevor Reznik who after a year of insomnia starts to lose his mind. As with any well done film about insanity, THE MACHINIST casts a nightmarish cloud of confusion over what is real and what is hallucination. No one knows what's going on, and it appears that the key to the puzzle rest deep on the oceanic floor of Reznik's subconscious.Brad Anderson, poised to direct a 2006 remake of Romero's The Crazies, does a nice job of stringing together quiet, eerie scenes that culminate in periodic epileptic fits of psychosis. Wasting away in his delusional world of half-sleep, Reznik causes a horrific accident at the machine shop. All of his coworkers, including his nasty boss are conspiring against him, or so he thinks. Slowly Reznik gets the feeling that the conspiracy against him is deeper than it appears and that some of his coworkers don't really exist. To make things worse, someone is sticking random sticky-notes on his refrigerator.One glaring point of distraction, though, was that I was constantly asking myself, God, how did Christian Bale lose so much weight for the part? For those who don't know Bale, you might think man, that guy's skinny. But for the millions of Christian Bale fans out there, simply seeing his face in THE MACHINIST might conjure up a myriad of irrelevant questions from "How much does he resemble that British kid in Empire of the Sun?" to "How in the world did he wind up in that awful Batman Project?" Sorting through different images of Bale in your head, from stick figure to schoolboy to bat, could be called entertainment. For me it gets kind of distracting.Fortunately for the audience the macabre storyline remains tangled and dizzyingly suspenseful right up to the last five minutes where everything is unraveled and the mystery is explained. As always in this genre the bulk of the entertainment behind THE MACHINIST lies not in the final five minute ennui but in the preceding 90 minute cloud of schizophrenic psychosis. For another movie that has the same effect, I highly recommend Angel Heart (1987) with Mickey Rourke and Robert Deniro.One final note, the score was excellent. It had a classic feel to it that made me think of Hitchcock's PSYCHO. An appropriate score (or an appropriate absence of one) is more than half the battle in any film, and the score behind THE MACHINIST proves that some Hollywood formulas for suspense never get old.JYJimboduck-dot-com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Machinist" belongs to a special branch of film, where we know from the beginning that the main character is somewhat disturbed (and who wouldn't be with a deeply oppressive working environment and hardly any sleep or food?) but are forced to view everything through his viewpoint. This creates a deeply unpleasant atmosphere, where you are never quite sure what to believe. It is the mark of a good director (and writer) that we are drawn to the movie anyhow and never give up on or lose interest in finding out what is actually happening. Needless to say, Christian Bale is amazing as Trevor Reznick - forget about the weight he lost for the part, I am talking about the credibility of the role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It kept my husband and me and guessing throughout, and the denouement hit us between the eyes. "The Machinist" didn't have quite the impact of "The Sixth Sense", but we were intrigued with the story and spellbound by the title character's depressing state of events. The movie was well crafted. It has great art direction, using color in an unusual way: some black &amp; white and some "tinted" scenes and some in full color. The actors did a good job, and the star should get an award for losing so much weight to portray a skeletal man in torment. Although I never read "The Idiot," I presume there are several parallels between the film and the Russian novel. I should have looked for more info on the DVD before I sealed it up and dropped it in the mailbox to be returned to Blockbuster.com. It's also the sort of film one should watch a second time, after fully understanding what's been going on--with an insider's view, as it were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good, but a little predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the comments about this film talk about it's predictability. I think we sometimes view movies as if they are quizzes, or game shows, in which we pat ourselves on the back for guessing and ending. I think if you are caught up in a GOOD film, it's predictability should be incidental. First, Bale's transformation rivals anything Lon Chaney Sr. ever did, and makes Deniro's Raging Bull weight gain look easy. He wanted to go to 100 pounds, but the producers were afraid it would do harm to him. I have to say that I went into this film not knowing that Bale was in it, and did not even recognize him until 30 minutes into it, and then still wasn't sure. The Machinist is dark and thoughtful. It's not meant to trick us. It's meant to treat us to the absolute horror of having killed a child and repressed the memory, and it succeeds in this. Jason-Leigh is very good as is the counter girl. But the object of the movie is obviously to pull us into his nightmare, and to this end, I think it trumps movies like "The Sixth Sense". Johnny Depp did a horrible version of "The Secret Window", a Steven King short story turned movie with a similar plot line that was childish compared to this thriller. To me, the mark of a movie that it meant to be emotionally unsettling is whether it is or not. I was definitely emotionally involved, and to some degree depressed afterwords. It worked. I have a whole new respect for C Bale.</fullReview>

Renzik has his every waking moment an unrelenting state of confusing, paranoia, guilt, anxiety and terror. His only friend from his living nightmare is an affectionate prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh).When strange notes turn up mysteriously in his apartment. When his hallucinations of a co-worker (John Sharian) that no one sees him in a machine shop that Renzik is working in. Since Renzik cause an unexpected accident with a co-worker (Micheal Ironside). Renzik embarks on a journey, where he finds out an elaborate plot against him or he is tired that it robbed him of reason. The more he learns, he is closer to the shocking truth.Dircted by Brad Anderson (Happy Accidents, Next Stop Wonderland, Session 9) made an fascinating original thriller with a dynamic performance by Bale makes this film worth seeing. The film has good performances by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon as the mysterious Maria and John Sharian. It is also nice to see Canadian B-Movie Star:Micheal Ironside in a small role.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an commentary track by the director, behind the scenes featurette, deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer. This is a breathtaking psychological horror film. This is one of Anderson's best films. Director:Anderson and Screenwriter:Scott Kosar (The Amityville Horror-2005, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-2003) will re-team for the upcoming remake of George A. Romero's The Crazies. Do not miss this extraordinary film. Arriscope. (**** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian Bale is one of the best actors. It surprises me how underrated he was until this year considering his performance in a numerous number of terrific flicks (Amer. Psycho, Equilibrium etc). This year, due to both Machinist and the new Batman movie, things are at last looking better! This movie is not an easy one. It is disturbing and confusing many times but follows a logical and unexpected plot. It basically tells a story of how bad conscience and loneliness may affect a human mind. A psychological thriller at its best! The performance of Mr Bale is top-notch as always.Score: 9 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** SPOILER HINTS AT PLOT PATTERN ** With films like fight club setting the bar for this type of plot twist thriller, I don't think this film reached it. I'm an enormous Bale fan and a major fan of this sort of film, that shows feasible paths for normal people to become the most unrecognisable shadow of themselves. Throughout the movie, there is an obvious and pending plot twist as you watch reznik rip himself apart but the director made us wait too long. The plot twist is powerful but not worth the preceeding period of boredom, since its quite obvious what is and is not real, watching the scenes that reznik completely imagines becomes tedious. It's definitely worth a watch for fans of Bale and the genre. The plot twist is enlightening and agreeable but its the sort of movie you'll want to take a break in the middle of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist fist gained popularity from the record setting weight loss that lead actor Christian Bale under went to film this movie. Bale looks like a talking zombie and because of that it gives his performance a more twisted edge. In this twisted story Trevor Reznik is a machinist whose physical appearance and attitude begin to concern his co-workers. When a mysterious southern man begins to appear everywhere in Trevor's life it sets off a chain of events that causes him to question his sanity.Bale transforms himself into Trevor so brilliantly that you forget it's him just playing a role. Jennifer Jason Leigh helps the story along as a prostitute named Stevie and is a good equal to Bale's intense presence on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was interesting. Firstly for 20 minutes it is hard to even watch Christian Bale without feeling ill. Losing 28 kilos must have seemed like a good idea at the time, but surely one visit to the mirror and the man realised he was in trouble. After getting over that sick feeling your watching someone about to die, I really started to evaluate the movie. It seemed very arty, with an almost blue tinge to it. It reminded me of Fight Club, Memento and Requiem for a dream at times. There was a melancholy underneath everything that Christian Bale did. I sat mesmerised by the movie, but in the back of my mind I kept thinking sure it's a beautiful movie to watch, and sure Bale is brilliant as always, but is it really a special movie. I was unsure for most of the last half hour, until the end came, and then I'd known I had just seen a very special movie. It was unoriginal in an original way, and I'm so glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not your average thriller or psycho-drama, this film is unbelievably good - and as freaky as they come. It's intense, totally gripping and scary. My stomach was in knots the whole way through, but at the same time I kept sighing and shaking my head in awe of the film's subtle wit and tenderness. I was as scared as I've ever been watching a film and then, the next minute, I was weeping like a baby. A truly deep and powerful, lovely movie. Imaginative and amazing. Really brilliant. I'd go so far as to say it should be required viewing for anyone studying film or screen writing. And I now realize Christian Bale, one of the finest actors going, is also one of the most underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better movies recently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching the machinist, and I must say that this was one of the better movies I have seen for a while. Dark and brooding, and nice use of suspense played out thru the movie, some nice little gotcha's thru out the plot. It kept me engaged for the entire film, and guessing all the way to the end. I am glad that the gore factor was kept down to a minimum, as when it was used, it certainly heightened the viewing experience. Bale is superb and I feel that its a pity that he does not get the credit that he deserves, both his physical transformation for this, and his acting was some of the best I have seen for a while. I am glad that as an actor he takes varied roles, American Psyco and Batman begins are great movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome build-up, but the payoff not so much....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains information that may be deemed a spoiler by some people. Basically, I tell you what horrible plot device I'm happy they didn't use. Overall I thought the movie was really good. The Machinist kept me wanting to know what happened next, up to the end. The end which wasn't entirely terrible kinda reminds me of a "Kill Bill Vol.2" ending. At the end of "Kill Bill Vol 2" I expected an awesome fight scene but on first viewing was disappointed with the way Tarantino handled it. Subsequent viewings have made me appreciate the way Tarantino threw a sucker punch in there that you wouldn't expect. In "The Machinist" the build-up is so twisted that you expect the ending to be something you couldn't possibly have imagined. {b}I{/b} wanted the ending to be so far out there that it would freak me out like the rest of the movie did. (*possible spoiler*) All signs pointed to Trevor and Ivan being one and the same but,thankfully, that wasn't the case. It was was an all right "Aha!" in "Fight Club" but if they had done it here it would've almost ruined the movie because of the sheer cheesiness of it. (*/end spoiler*) I think upon a second watching I might like the ending more and knowing the end will change the color of the movie for me. Events that seemed sinister during the first viewing will take on a lighter tone. As for the how the movie was shot, it's really good. The coloration they use gives a lot of the movie an almost black and white look which is effective in creating a sense of foreboding. The way the dark halls were shot reminded me of what a dark hall was like as a child. The movie is able to convey a sense of dread through the use of a muted color palette. I'm definitely going to recommend this movie to people and I'll watch it again just so I can have foresight this time. It'll be almost like watching "Identity" for the second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World According to Trevor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though "The Sixth Sense" came first, raked in more dough, and established that GOTCHA! third act twist that re-defined everything that had gone on before, "Fight Club" took a route that was more psychological (and satirical) and less gimmicky and ultimately suffered at the box office for being too damn subversive and challenging for audiences expecting a bare-knuckles movie about, y'know, guys beating each other up. In that film, we follow an insomniac narrator who takes charge of his nihilistic life with the aid of anti-corporate crusader Tyler Durden, who winds up being nothing more than a figment of the narrator's imagination. It's a testament to the cleverness and believability of this twist that it has been mined pretty successfully in subsequent films like "Session 9," "Secret Window," "High Tension," and now "The Machinist," a film as frightening as it is compelling, with an uncanny psychological depth and a keen eye for detail.Like the aforementioned films, "The Machinist" is quite disorienting upon first glance--its ending requires the viewer to all but re-start the movie to find out what it all means. Patience is essential to get into the rhythm of the film, which is deliberately paced and builds gradually to its turns, both expected and unexpected. If you expect a movie to lay down all the facts, explain every detail, and come to a tidy conclusion, you might want to bypass "The Machinist." Directed by Brad Anderson (who helmed the brilliant "Session 9") from a script by Scott Kosar (the same man who graced us with the loathsome "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" remake), "The Machinist" is the tale of Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), an industrial worker harboring immense feelings of guilt for unknown reasons--he hasn't slept in a year as a result, and has starved himself down to a dangerously low weight (though the image of an emaciated Bale is not the film's most harrowing aspect); his bosses and coworkers are uneasy around him, and one day he causes a gruesome accident while distracted by the mysterious Ivan (a brilliantly cast John Sharian), a fellow worker who might not even exist. Anchored to reality by a sympathetic hooker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and an airport waitress (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), Trevor is plagued by cryptic messages on post-it notes that somehow wind up in his apartment, the most grim being a 6-letter hangman with two letters already filled in.In the paranoid stew brought about by his guilt, Trevor's perception becomes that of a mad conspiracy theorist who believes the ultimate plot is against himself...and who is to say it isn't? There is a brilliant sequence within the bowels of a carnival ride, where every image--from a corpse with its guts splattered to the silhouetted customers inside a brothel--triggers a twinge of panic in Trevor that makes us wonder how much of this is an actual ride, and how much is imagined (or amplified) by his guilt-riddled conscience. The ultimate beauty of "The Machinist" is that it endures past its revelation because the world we have just watch unfold, with characters we THOUGHT we knew, turns out to be the product of a sleep-deprived (and, at a whole year, certifiably insane) mind; at the same time, this also reflects the kind of person Trevor Reznik aspired to be in the wake of the crime he perpetrated. The film's title and the oppressive, grease-stained factory environment lends it to a moody metaphor: was Reznik really a machinist, or was the scenario a representation of his swaying conscience, as gears turn clockwise and counterclockwise inside metal boxes as machines are turned on or off and are at times unstoppable for discernible reason, thus causing unforeseen tragedy? In addition to its loftier ambitions, "The Machinist" is calmly effortless in showing how clever it is without being showy--which is why the film warrants multiple viewings. The amount of foreshadowing and character flip-flops and real-life incidents transposed into Reznik's remorseful fantasy world is done with an incredible amount of care. Seemingly trivial details, like a fishing rod on a closet shelf; a close-up of a sticker; the image of bumper cars in the foreground while Trevor talks to the waitress' son, all have a soul-shattering impact that is impossible to uncover upon a single viewing. Like the bastard child of "Spider" and "Fight Club," "The Machinist" is a persistent challenge, an ultimately bleak glimpse into the life of a man whose mind has been hollowed by guilt even more so than his body.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christain Bale (American Psycho and more recently Batman Begins) stars as Trevor, a factory worker who, for reasons unknown to even himself, has been unable to sleep for over a year, but as the film builds to it's revelatory climax, the reason's for his insomnia start to become clearer.The Machinist has hint's of Jacobs Ladder, Memento, Dark City and The Sixth Sense, and like those movies, this too is a superb piece of film-making with a shattering denouement.Bales performance is method acting to it's extreme, he lost an incredible 65lbs to achieve the skeletal frame of Trevor Teznik, and his tortured performance must be commended.There are clues to Trevors past but you will have to pay close attention, and like The Sixth Sense this is one film you will want to re-watch in a 'new light'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come with me, if you will, into the Twilight Zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the dark vibe to this film. It felt to me like a modern, expanded 'Twilight Zone' episode and also had touches of Hitchcock to it. What made me feel this at first was the great film score and then as I watched further it become more apparent to me. I am a huge fan of the Rod Serling's 'Twilight Zone' series and this really had that feeling to it.I would have to say that I have seen films similar in plot before...a man who may or may not be imagining people or things around him. I thought to myself while watching, these people better be real...otherwise I've seen this way too many times.But I think Christian Bale is a great actor and I really enjoyed his character here. Everything in his physical presence showed he really went the distance for this role and his acting was top notch. The cinematography was wonderful also, and I suppose that goes back to the Twilight Zone-ish qualities that I love. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Really Happened!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. I have seen this movie twice and the only reason i watched it again was because its a great movie! The movie is about Trevor, a Machinist/Insomniac who can't determine the difference between reality and illusion. He begins to see things that he can not explain, and through the movie he searches for answers. However, not being able to trust anyone, including himself makes this journey very difficult.Exactly one year before the story takes place at one thirty, Trevor Reznick was driving down the street when he fiddles with his lighter and runs over an innocent child. The trauma from the event forces him into a state of severe insomnia and memory loss. Now, one year later, Trevor begins to experience some very strange things. He meets a guy named Ivan, who people say don't exist. Ivan is actually Trevors guilty conscience. If you notice the cowboy clothes that Ivan wheres are the same that Trevor wheres when the accident takes place. You see, after a year trevors conscience all of the sudden decides that it's time for him to remember what he did. So he begins to leave himself signs, the sticky note hangman. Trevor leaves himself notes, because he can't remember things. Thus, he leaves himself a note to remember the accident. Also the whole bleach thing. After killing someone he feels dirty and wrong so he's obsessed about becoming clean, thus the bleach! And the mother does not represent the whore(stevie). It's simple; everything that is an illusion comes form trevors memory! The constant deja vu, the mother as the waitress and how all of his mothers things were in the waitresses home. Anything that is an illusion or part of trevors conscience thats reaching out to him is something he remembers or is feeling, brought to life. The carnival ride is the most significant illusion. It shows everything that trevor has been through, his entire life that one year after the accident. And like the ride Trevor chose the highway to hell instead of heaven, I think that this is because after the accident he didn't do the right thing, because he was so traumatized! However after he realizes what has happened he turns himself in and is finally able to rest. This is just my interpretation of the film, but i think that it makes the most sense! And if i have left anything out I'm sorry. Ther's so much detail in the movie its hard to write them all!~ My heart goes out to Christian Bale, who had the guts to lose so much weight, which really made the movie come to life and become all that it was meant to be!And the director, Wes Anderson, did an amazing job making the film feel real and yet so terrifying. I felt the Hitchock inspiration.Last but not least, the writer. Genius! I love the work, and I can't even begin to express my admiration! I'm really hoping to see more from these guys, they are amazing! If you see the movie you'll understand! and you'll agree.Thank you, all of you, for making such a terrific movie! ~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective film noir with a skeletal Bale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the sight of an ultra skinny Tom Hanks in "Cast Away" was shocking enough but here in this film I don't think anyone can really prepare themselves for what they are about to see with this effort. The only thing that bothered me was that the weight loss really doesn't have much to do with the rest of the story although this is a well made film that (for the most part) keeps you guessing. Story is about a man named Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) who works as a machinist but weighs somewhere around 120lbs and mutters that he hasn't slept in a whole year!*****SPOILER ALERT*****The skeletal Trevor keeps company with a prostitute named Stevie (Jennifer Jason-Leigh) and together they talk about going off and starting a new life but he also starts a relationship with a waitress named Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who works at a diner at the airport. While at work Trevor encounters a stranger named Ivan (John Sharian) who claims he works another shift but nobody else has seen or heard of him. With his lack of sleep Trevor's paranoia starts to get the better of him while trying to figure out who exactly Ivan really is but once he finds out he starts to piece together a tragedy from his past.Director Brad Anderson is also responsible for making the equally effective "Session 9" a few years back and both of these films share an incredibly dark atmosphere that seems to be Anderson's forte as a filmmaker. One doesn't really have to be a serious film buff to recognize this as being inspired by Alfred Hitchcock especially when viewers hear the "Vertigo" styled music score from Roque Banos but the story itself not only has elements from "Spellbound" and "Psycho" but "Memento" as well. Bale has emerged as one of the more interesting actors and roles like this command attention and show that he's not just a good looking guy who can star in films because of his genetics and his career will be interesting to watch. My real beef with this film is aimed at the fact that Bale lost about 60 odd pounds and has this freakish presence on screen but it's really never incorporated into the story except when Leigh mentions it in the beginning. I understand he's playing a character that's just a shell of who he once was but it seems a tad wasted and eventually becomes a non-issue. This is just nit picking and while I thought the conclusion was satisfactory without being overwhelming (like The Sixth Sense) this is still a well made film with a distinct noir feel to it and shows once again that Anderson is a director to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I disagree with the opinion that the bathroom scene contains a continuity goof. I don't think the soap dispenser back on the wall is a continuity goof. I think Trevor hallucinates knocking the dispenser off, providing an excuse to seek a stronger cleanser to wash (the guilt)off his hands. When he is washing his hands with the bathroom cleaner, the viewer sees the soap dispenser back on the wall, as,I believe, the director intended. Another apparent goof also took on a new perspective as the plot unfolded. When Trevor drove down the street, the airport tower seemed to appear the same in shots from different angles, but once again, I think the viewer is seeing through Trevor's (guilty) eyes. Fantastic movie. Christian Bale was mesmerizing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thrillers as of late have been rushed and not well made. Gothika, for instance, could have been great, but instead, it was a good idea that wasn't care for. Identity was great, but even that could have had more work done for it. What you need is a great story with a great screenplay=lay, a devoted cast, and a director with vision. This movie has it all.The Machinist (or El Maquinista) is a thriller about a man named Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), a factory worker who seems to be physically wasting away. His weight is getting lower and lower with each waking hour, and that is a lot since he hasn't had any sleep in over a year. His friend, a prostitute named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), worries that he truly is wasting away and wants him to get better. Soon he meets a man named Ivan in the parking lot at work. Trevor didn't know they got a new guy, but he thought nothing of it. When Ivan distracts him from his work, an accident involving another worker occurs due to Trevor's focus on what Ivan was doing. Now begins the chase of whether or not what Trevor is seeing is real and how the past catches up with you awfully fast.Bale gives a performance that will resonate in my mind, that's for sure. Losing that much weight to play this role must have been grueling. His character is one that you like, pity, and don't understand. His sleeping habits, work ethic, and mental state are all at question. His "lady of the night" friend Stevie is another character that is likable but one you pity and don't understand. Whether or not what Trevor is seeing is real makes this movie that much more entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The relationship between him and the waitress at the airport diner is one that is interesting. Why would he keep driving all the way out to the airport for a piece of pie and a cup of coffee when he could get one near his apartment. Either way, the story unfolds beautifully and is truly amazing. The whole story just blew my mind.It's hard to say much without giving away the ending but all you need to know in order to see this movie is that it will grab you until the very end. It's not a movie you can watch for a while and come back to. Sit tight because you are in for a great ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>==Maybe it's me, maybe it's not.== This is one of the better guessing-game movies out there, and that question should be the query throughout the entire movie, because that is what the movie is about.All I have to say is "Hitchcock". Yes, "Hitchcock" should the category this movie is placed in. The creepy music that matches the dark and dank environment that matches Trevor Reznik's insanity that further disproves his sense of reality that sets up the twist of the story; that's all "Hitchcock" formula right up yer sleeve.I really don't know who this Brad Anderson is, but clearly, he's got to be a Hitchcock junky. The influence is all seen throughout this movie. I for one am a Hitchcock admirer, and once I've seen this film, the first thought that came to my head was "Hitchcock made this, right?" Of course that wasn't so, but I wanted to believe it was.The credibility of the Hitchcock effect was also thanks to the horrific state in which Christian Bale has undertaken, the emaciated insomniac. He scared the sh*t out of me!! He should serve as a scary example at why those who starve themselves to lose weight shouldn't do so. He was almost unrecognizable! Scary indeed.All in all, I'd recommend this film mostly to those who have seen and enjoyed or appreciated a Hitchcock film, because the influence is there, or at least to those who like good mysteries and guessing-game films. Unfortunately, it's still not a tour-de-force in its own genre, which means that this film doesn't appeal to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of the alter ego in "Fight Club" and the memory issues of "Memento" will love this dark drama. Trevor Reznik takes a deep look at himself through an alter ego. Much like Edward Norton's character, Trevor has some should searching to do, and the lack of sleep (it's been a year) may have caused his inner struggles to manifest into a "freind" others don't seem to see.Trevor is ravished with guilt, and seems to have forgotten something very important from his past. A series of post-it notes (Memento, again) and events with the mystery co-worker, are part of the pieces that put it back together.We find out much of Trevor's life are illusions created from within, both the happiest moments, and the greatest hardships.Christian Bale was amazing, we all know the story about the weight loss. The sunken eyes, and protruding bones told a story of their own, greatly adding to the troubles Trevor was battling.In the final scene, which I won't give a way, fans of the band Audioslave will walk around with the chorus to "Exploder" in their head for days (I did), "If you're free, you'll never see the walls." If you like dark dramas, dealing with human issues, don't miss this Brad Anderson gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist is a movie much in the same vein of The Jacket: well sculpted and put together, but it's short comings are far too glaring. The difference is how everything unfolds within The Machinist, a taut, yet slow-moving film that becomes fairly predictable at the first sighting of Ivan.The one thing that really makes this film work is Bale, who quite literally gave his all for the film, which in many ways, makes you forget about some of the obvious moments in the script. While the lighting and general eeriness of the film really brings you in, Trevor Reznik's decent into madness doesn't follow too well with the scenery. It's like trying to shoot a film at 60 miles an hour while the script only let's you get up to 35. The ending just couldn't live up to the rest of the movie, which had a great build-up but just seemed to fall flat.</fullReview>

He is ALWAYS a character actor, and a different suit. ALWAYS impresses me and this story is so awesome that the end had me crying while the flick had me at the edge of my seat constantly yelling out at the TV monitor (on DVD) "No way! No way!" This is a combination of Memento versus American Psycho. Bale's American accent has never been as fluid and natural as this. I couldn't believe my ears and eyes--he was absolutely astounding! The end of the story impacted my life as well, however it was Bale's critical yet dead-on creation of this fictional character that really moved me to love this movie for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy head games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rare film that excels at nearly every effort it endeavors to achieve. Smart writing, excellent direction and a pitch perfect performance by Bale as a man slowly wasting away.For almost a year, Trevor Reznick (Bale) has been unable to sleep. His body wilts away from the lack of sleep, making him look like a Holocaust victim. As his body deteriorates, his mind begins to follow. After an accident at the machine factory he works in (in which a co-worker loses an arm), he begins to receive notes from a mysterious person that jumps in and out of his life. The more he seeks to unravel the mystery of the man as well as his own life, the more the lines of reality begin to fade.Part mystery, part horror, part psychological study, the film takes many roads and rides them all to completion. The mystery is embodied in the enigmatic man and the secrets of Reznick's past. Like many modern thrillers, there is a twist to the mystery; while it's pretty easy to guess the twist, the actual reason behind it is unique and satisfying.The horror arises in the form of grim photography and Reznick's ever mounting paranoia. Hardly a frame in the film isn't drench in bleached colors and low lighting. Complimented by methodical direction that keeps the camera focused only where it needs to be, which is Bale. He is so committed to the role (rumored to have lost upwards of 65lbs)that he ceases to be himself and becomes Reznick. As his life falls deeper into dementia, the viewer is right along with him, feeling every bit of the fear and sheer exhaustion of a man that hasn't slept in a year.And in the last it is a quiet character study on the causes and ramifications of guilt. How dealing with our issues and owning up to our failures may be the only way to actual get on with life; that denying or ignoring our short comings can only lead to more duress.A creepy, thoughtful tale that will hold viewers riveted for the duration and force them to analyze after it's conclusion.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gritty, disturbing, powerful &amp; ultimately everything i look for in a movie. Movies like food can be standard fare, sometimes you expect a great experience and are disappointed, other times you are pleasantly surprised.This movie is easily one of the finest of the year and what is surprising like a great little restaurant, is how come i have never heard of it? Everything was right, the acting, the locale, direction and filming.... Now i always like to comment without mentioning any plot or specific scenes as i believe people should see a film with an open mind and new eyes, not through somebodies likes and dislikes.so whilst people may think the storyline eventually may not be exceptional, as it deals with something experienced by a lot of unfortunate people from both perspectives, how it is told and how Christian Bale relives the experience is without doubt awesome.His appearance in this feast of a film is amazing and i have to really stand in awe of what he has achieved in this movie.without doubt it ranks along the MUST SEE films of all time, and my list is very selective. If you miss this you really are missing a film that sets a standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Kafa-esquire nightmare for the main character (played by Bale and wonderfully supported as ever by JJ Leigh)trying to solve out why a big fat man is haunting him, and why post-its are being left to tease and frighten him. A gaunt looking Christian Bale takes us on a journey that can be quite tiresome at times but is an enjoyable movie nonetheless. Regardless, it is intriguing but you can see the influences from elsewhere and in parts it can try to be too clever (e.g. references to this and that are everywhere but don't piece together well). To understand it, you have to watch it till the end, but don't rush out to watch it. Can see better in the future from all those involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a 16 year old boy with a huge psychological plot appetite, I couldn't wait to see this film. Yet nothing could prepare me for the perfection that followed. The lines between reality, and imagination are closely blurred. This is the kind of movie where you understand it more with time. It Starts at the end and then tells the story of how it got to that point, and then tells what happened afterwords. The writing is so good that as soon as you are sure that you know what is happening, the plot twist occurs, yet it is a plot twist that is not expected. It all makes sense psychologically, and physically. I wish all current movies were written this well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hypnotic, dark, film with an amazing performance by Bale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected the worst after reading review after negative review. All the critics seemed to totally miss the story and focus actor Christian Bale's dramatic weight loss for the part he was playing. Sure it should be mentioned, but to go at lengths about his physicality instead of the story? I do not agree with that. The story is dreamlike. The washed out cinematography gives off a disorienting affect. The story deal with Trevor Reznik, a machinist at a factory who has not sleep in a year and continues to loose weight. Strange things start to happen to him: a mysterious, bald mad that he befriends, Post-it-Note hang-man games on his refrigerator, bloody leaking from his 'fridge, and an ever growing sense of paranoia. The acting is top notch and I hope it finds its audience on DVD. The music is very reminiscent of Bernnard Herrmann that shows that director Brad Anderson was aiming for a Hitchcockian approach to this film. Scott Kosar's script is quite good, and make you forget about his work on the terrible Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. If you like this film, I also recommend checking out Brad Anderson's first film SESSION 9, a subtle and suspenseful flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dostoyevsky and Italian title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I totally agree with who noticed big inspirations to Dostoyevsky's books. I just read one of them, the double, but I studied about the others. Watching the movie it came to my mind immediately, I liked that book! Anyway, it is usually a trouble for a movie to be inspired from a book, more if it is transported to a modern period, it is impossible to be compared to a good book you loose, but here no risk has be paid, it just use the idea of "some" books of the same author and play a story a part, so it doesn't need to be compared, well done. I am disappointed indeed with the Italian title. The translation of "l'uomo senza sonno" is something like "the man who doesn't sleep". OK, he really doesn't sleep since one year but in my opinion it didn't get the point, it has a secondary role, I don't know how to explain, ti is just a consequence. I mean, if the director have chosen this title is OK (i.e. Insomnia), but he chose another one so I don't understand why to change it. I know that everybody say that and that it is obvious, but Bale was incredibly skinny, I don't know how is possible. Kilos a part his interpretation was really good. To me, the problem of this movie is that was not long enough. It could seems a no sense, usually there is the contrary problem. I think that a longer movie give the possibility to remark a stronger anguish. I just "feel" it sometimes, and when pathos is growing it is going to be concluded. Maybe I am masochist, but I have preferred to feel anguish more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock comes down with a Kafkaesque head cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Alfred Hitchcock ever got into Franz Kafka stuff and made a creepy, monochramatic head-trip of a film, you just know he'd get some sick satisfaction of starving actor Christian Bale of 63 pounds for his role in "The Machinist", here directed by Brad Anderson (Session 9). While I can't say if Anderson treats his actors as poorly as the notorious Master of Suspense, I can say that he has crafted a well-made potboiler starring an actor so good he must suffer from some level of sadomasochism.As Trevor Reznik (the writer, Scott Kosar, must be a Nine Inch Nails fan), Bale's body underwent a deterioration so great that it appears to have affected him psychologically. Reznik's small talk and little jokes he makes perfectly demonstrate the humanity he's clinging onto by the decayed strands - eventually transforming into pathetic desperation, and the audience is shocked with him at every revelation in the story's mind-tripping narrative. Reznik hasn't slept for a year, his coworkers at the machinist shop are seemingly plotting against him, and a strange man is stalking him. If I'm being vague, it's because I have to.Some of this may also sound very Lynch, and it is - except Anderson gives it a streamlined narrative, yet still demands the viewer's patience so the story can methodically unfold with every new threat posed to Reznik's sanity. Some of the characters disappear out of existence. It's true that much of "The Machinist" can be attributed to other works; but, as the cliché goes, it's greater than the sum of its (body) parts. Like an M. Night Shyamalan flick, you know it's leading up to some great twist you've probably predicted already. But Anderson is smarter than that. Unlike "The Village", his film doesn't hinge on the 'twist'. If you should have any expectations before seeing "The Machinist - expect one of the best, otherworldly suspense thrillers in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked this movie up, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is the perfect combination of horror, mystery and drama. The film concerns a factory worker named Trevor Reznik. He has not slept in quite some time, a year to be exact. As you can imagine, a few days, no less a YEAR, without sleep can do some funny things to the mind. Well, that's exactly what begins to happen to Mr. Reznik. He sketches his way from day to day and becomes worse and worse. A horrible accident occurs at his work, and he begins to believe that there is a method to the madness. The performance Christian Bale gives is one I will not forget too soon. His weight for the role alone is enough to make most people not even want to sit through it. Jennifer Jason Leigh is also pitch perfect as the prostitute that enjoys the company of the frail Reznik. Certainly not a film for the squeamish, The Machinist is a bonafide mind-bender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kafka comes to America in this startling and disturbing thriller that explores the decent of a mind into delusion and madness through insomnia and finally guilt. Not since Polanski's "Repulsion" has mental breakdown been so frighteningly portrayed on the screen. The Joseph K of this excursion into hallucination is one Trevor Reznik as played by Christian Bale.With suggestions of Welles "The Trial" in the low key contrasty photography of bleak haunting landscapes, wherein even an amusement park is threatening and sinister to say nothing of the grim factory scenes. But finally it is the riveting performance of an emaciated Christian Bale, that captivates the film, obviously his best portrayal yet. Bale is hardly recognizable (looking like an escapee from a Concentration Camp) and far from the sophisticated suit he played in "American Psycho" Although it appears to be set in USA, the style of the film is firmly rooted in Spain, and it is Spanish films that seem to capture so well the twilight worlds such as this. Not for the feint hearted, but an excellent excursion into Kafka territory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lick of Lynch, a pinch of Polanski, a modicum of 'Memento'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) doesn't have the happiest of lives. He's virtually ostracised by colleagues at the plant where he operates a lathe; the only company he keeps is with a whore (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and an airport-diner waitress (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who he chats to nightly; he's so skeletally skinny that folks openly comment on it, and he hasn't slept for ages. Still, he's mostly a pleasant, pretty calm character ? until the mysterious Ivan (John Sharian) enters his life? From the opening sequence ? Trevor wrapping a corpse in his carpet and taking it to the sea ? it's clear we're in for some heavy-duty expressionism. A lick of Lynch, a pinch of Polanski, a modicum of 'Memento', heaps of Herrmannesque menace on the music track ? all this and Anna Massey, mirrors, dismemberment, machinery, dead mothers, doubles, Dostoevsky, post-it notes, power cuts, ghost trains, sewers, bleach? Director Brad Anderson and writer Scott Kosar toss everything including the kitchen sink into the pot, as their emaciated somnambulist protagonist tries to fathom how he got to such a bleary, bruised and scarred state of being (or not-being?). The resulting stew, frankly, is a bit messy; though it almost makes some kind of psychological sense, it never really persuades as an authentic portrait of a tormented mind. That said, it's very watchable; above all, one can't deny the dubious appeal of the spectacle of the skin-and-bone Bale, quite possibly endangering his health for the sake of his art. Against the odds, the crazed intensity of his performance makes the movie work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the success in Spain of his gritty horror Session 9 (2001), director Brad Anderson was approached by production company Filmmax to shoot a feature in Barcelona. Finding that there's a corner of America anywhere, if you look hard enough, El Maquinista (The Machinist, 2004), became a Spanish produced, English language film.The Machinist documents the dreary twilight existence of a shift working lathe operator Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), and his deteriorating physical and mental health. Emaciated and insomniac, Reznik causes a work accident that claims the arm of a colleague. His deterioration quickens. The post-it aide-memoirs he leaves for himself become increasingly cryptic and alien. He soon becomes convinced of an elaborate conspiracy against him, and chases it's, and his own, shadow.Current Batman Bale undoubtedly provides the core of the film, and not just in terms of content. If you've heard anything about The Machinist, it's most likely in reference to the physical appearance of it's lead. Bale shed around a third of his body weight in order to portray Reznik, a man who proclaims he hasn't slept for a year. The result is a painfully sullen, gauntly compelling central performance, for which Bale will remembered in years to come. In contrast to the narcissistically athletic physique displayed in American Psycho (2000), Bale here resembles a concentration camp victim, wearing his clothes like a wire coat hanger. There's even a shot in which a rotund refrigerator seems to poke fun by comparison at his frail figure. The film's exploration of identity, reality, insomnia, and memory will draw obvious and rightful comparisons with Fincher's Fight Club (1999), and Nolan's Memento (2000). However, the film's strong visuals and distinctive sets evoke also the nightmarish industrial claustrophobia of Lynch's Eraserhead (1977) and Gilliam's Brazil (1985).All of the performances in the film are of a high quality. Jennifer Jason Leigh copes well with the burden of 'tart with a heart' Stevie, the prostitute that Reznik relies on for intimacy, but it's John Sharian that steals his scenes. Looking like a cross between an Apocalypse Now (1979) era Brando and Sloth from The Goonies (1985), Sharian plays Ivan, a gimp limping, toe fingered enigma who may or may not actually exist. There's even Michael Ironside on hand to put in a reliably villainous turn as Reznik's work supervisor.A fittingly delicate score rounds off a very well made, but faintly hollow film. At points, it seems as if the screenplay has been kept deliberately vague in places to avoid having to make decisions; instead piling on the allegories, visual cues, and literary references. Let Dostoevsky sort it out. I was however taken aback that the screenplay was as good as it is when found out that writer Scott Kosar's only previous credit was penning the horribly redundant, ignorant remake of the classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). He seems to have reverted to type with his most recent project, beating the long dead, never haunted horse of The Amityville Horror with another 'pretty people in peril' exercise in cloying Michael Bay gloss. Overall, The Machinist fails to reach peerage with the likes of Memento or Fight Club, but features more than enough quality to make it well worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist is the new thriller from director Brad Anderson and manages to pack in a few surprises. The first surprise is Christian Bale's dedication. He plays a machinist who could be losing his mind due to chronic insomnia. He claims he hasn't slept in a year. Bale lost a reported 63 pounds for the role! His screen appearance is startling. Remember Stephen King's Thinner? Well Bale's using no make-up and he achieves a similar look as the main character in Thinner. It's astounding and disturbing at the same time. The second thing that surprised me was the script. When the writing credit crept on screen I thought "Scott Kosar...isn't that the go-to remake guy?" He penned the new take on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (and he's redoing The Amityville Horror next). This film is a long way off from that one. I guess Ben Affleck was right. You do the safe picture, then you do the art picture. The Machinest is a nice quiet pace for a change, without all the choppy editing tricks. I like those kinds of films when the slow pace builds a good tension and the payoff is made tenfold better. However, I felt the payoff here was a bit disappointing. I had ideas as to what was going on but kept saying to myself "This film will rise above that." Well, it didn't. I was expecting something truly astounding at the end to knock my socks off. I guess M. Night Shamalyan can be blamed for that one. But Anderson's own Session 9 left me wanting more immediately and I over-hyped myself for his next outing. Regardless of what I see as flaws, the film looked breathtakingly beautiful and I'll be watching out for Brad Anderson's next film. I just won't let the hype get to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good and The Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've decided that the film is somehow disrupted by the two major "forces" which created it: the director and the script. And here is a summary of the ups and downs.The Good It's only fair to begin with this, given that it is also the most obvious bit for the innocent viewer. Brad Anderson is simply awe inspiring in this totally atmospheric joint, so dense and sinister you can feel it grow on you. From colors to angles, they all form this self sustaining being which pulsates constantly with death - because this is what the movie is about, no beating about the bush here. Furthermore, Christian Bale - who so resembles Ethan Hawke in this slim version - is just as much of a decisive factor as Brad's directing, simply because he is so absorbed by his character that he displays an utterly convincing performance.The Bad However, no matter how dense or tense of an atmosphere you've got, when the viewer (like myself) can't stop thinking of another movie (Fight Club) while watching this one...it's bad. I just kept on watching and expected something to happen, something that might've elevated the thing, something that would've given it some actual meaning, something beyond the macabre curtains of the world. But no, it feels so streamlined that it brings too little of an original story to actually be appreciated on the whole. It's all well tied up, but totally by the book.After putting it in perspective, the conclusions seem obvious to me: meager concept, marvelous achievement in making it be. Whether to watch it? Yes, I suppose so, but generally some patience is advised for, especially given the conditions (images so penetrating, that I could actually feel their terrible stench...such misery).</fullReview>

Christian Bale takes "method acting" to new heights with his portrayal of Trevor, a machinist with a dark secret.The use of flat colours really emphasise the mood of this picture in which we find ourselves following a short period of an insomniacs life.Trevor begins to encounter problems at work, beginning with a colleague having an accident caused by Trevors lack of concentration. We are then introduced to a whole host of characters from a hooker (Trevors closest friend) through to a waitress whom Trevor befriends during his sleepless nights. What baring do these characters have on the direction the film takes? Watch it!! you wont be disappointed.I don't usually post my thoughts on movies (as you can tell if your still reading this drivel) but felt I had to comment on this one.It's nice to see a film that does not rely on special effects and an all star cast to deliver what can only be described (in my opinion) as a cinematic victory! Bale turns in a terrific, believable performance and the rest of the cast support him in delivering a disturbing tale that should not be missed. Some great cinematography and clever editing make this film exactly what it is, un-missable! Steve</fullReview>

This is the kind of movie that if you saw it on a transatlantic flight at three in the morning with no hype or spoilers would really give you the creeps. SPOILER The final reveal is a little underpowered, perhaps, although seeing Bale suddenly back with flesh on his bones was oddly shocking. And there was plenty that was worth it - as well as Bale's extraordinary body and equally fat-free acting, there was a terrific sense of Hitchcock pastiche (especially, as noted, in the driving sequences) and a bravely depressing palate.

		<fullReview>The character portrayed in the film by one of the best actors of his generation Christian Bale - Trevor Reznik is, arguably, one of the most demanding, if not the most demanding, roles in the whole history of cinema. Forget about De Niro's Raging Bull or other record "sacrifaces" made by actors for their films, this is Christian Bale's The Machinist Trevor Reznik who will be the role model for all actors who want to give everything they can for a role. (Though frankly his performance was not that great, but he should have got a standing ovation for his weight loss anyhow).Unfortunately, Bale's "record" is the only great thing in this film. It borrows a lot from Fight Club and though tries to be different from it, will certainly be compared to it, and, to my mind, it is fair. If it was released some ten years ago it might have impressed people and could have gained a Cult status, but by the year 2004 we already had numerous films which El Maquinista references, and, let me tell you, references a lot. An OK film, but a disappointment for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale delivers one of cinema's most sacrificial performances in Brad Anderson's mesmerizing thriller. Written by Scott Kosar (2003's THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE), THE MACHINIST takes place in a bleak and nondescript American city, where Trevor Reznick (Bale) is quite literally withering away to nothing. During the day Trevor works in a colorless industrial factory, while at night he seeks refuge in the bed of a tender prostitute, Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh). For reasons unknown even to Trevor, he hasn't been able to sleep for an entire year. In the process, he has shed over sixty pounds, making him look like a walking skeleton. After an accident at the factory costs Trevor his job, he finds himself tracking a mysterious figure that may or may not, in fact, provide some answers to his confusion. Meanwhile, he begins to connect with a pretty airport waitress, Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), who shows Trevor some much-needed sympathy. By the time the film builds to its revelatory conclusion, it becomes quite clear just what has been tormenting Trevor all along.Anderson and Kosar's vision is brought to spectacular life by cinematographer Xavi Gimenez and composer Roque Banos, whose haunting atmospherics recall the best work of Alfred Hitchcock. And then, of course, there is Bale, whose performance is as terrifying, brave, and devastating as the screen has ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst this may have echoes of 'Memento', it is still a most original and darkly involving movie. Christian Bale puts in a monumental performance (it being said he shed 60 pounds for the role) and convinces us of his vision of reality till the very end. Utterly involved, we are taken this way and that as our perceptions of what is real are truly tested. Even Jennifer Jason Leigh is convincing and in fact the scenes they share are pivotal. The film opens with a body being disposed of yet this slips to the back of our minds under the relentlessness of the story telling. Everything is unbelievable, yet we are sucked in. I did not enjoy 'Session 9' as much as some but this is a tremendous achievement and much helped by the bleached colour and sensitive use of music.</fullReview>

Although this is something that everyone will stress on, I simply must admit that Bale's performance in this movie was brilliant. I think he was great in American Psycho but this is the one movie where the phrase "seeing is believing" really fits. I'm sure this movie will not appeal to everyone and I guess that if you tend to consider movies like Return Of The King the paramount of the world's cinematography then Machinist probably won't be your cup of tea. But then again, I might be wrong about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A thrillingly different experience from the mundane rubbish I have come to expect from Crappywood. Most of what needs to be said has already been done so in the initial review, all I will add is that make it a priority in your life to see this film. I didn't give it a 10 simply because I felt the running time was slightly more than it needed to be. The film is replete with imagery and metaphor all of whose purpose becomes clear towards the amazing finale, needless to say this film is the defacto treatment on the nature of guilt and conscience but to limit it to such a confined description seems wrong somehow. Christian Bale is without doubt one of this generations finest actors and this film represents what results from the combination of immense talent and fantastic story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A machinist's life has become a paranoid drifty existing;insomnia haunts him,skeleton-body makes everybody think he's doing drugs,visions and hallucinations make him confuse reality with past. Bale's interpretation of an anorexic at the final state of gravity is amazing;at the same he lives and works just like a machine-that's what somebody becomes when their lives are no longer their own property. The movie is playing with our psychic all the time;the spectator is obsessed at the very beginning with the protagonist and his mental disturb,the source of which is kept a secret until the final episode. Kudos to those who see in blindness. For Bale himself is trying to fix the puzzle and explain all the strange things and visions occurring to him:I found great the idea with the clock always stuck at 1.30 pm every time he was seeing the waitress;the road 666 trip wasn't bad at all and his double-face,the new machinist,was an image of all he wanted to escape from-his sin.What was keeping my interest growing was the simple fact that the skinny was surrounded by all kinds of accidents in his paranoia:accident is a key word here and accidents are caused by machines... So Bale,a machinist,killed a little boy by accident at 1.30 pm,road 66,whose mother's figure running for her child behind the car appears as his waitress in his dreamy consciousness;Bale escaped. Paranoia,anorexia,schizophrenia are after him from this moment on; he's a killer against his will and he repays his sin with the price of his...awakening. Like after a nightmare by day,he falls asleep at last(after a year of insomnia)in his prison cell,returning to what he could dare to call reality.And this is his redemption.When I first saw the movie and the lights were on after the final lines,nobody in the cinema made a move or said a thing;we were all sitting still for about 5,10 min.I don't think they all fell asleep.When somebody takes a life by accident,all his life is spoiled.No matter what. That's what The Machinist is for. Not a movie to be seen by paranoids!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me the machinist was a good movie. I mean I surly can understand the rave reviews i've been reading here on IMDb. But. There is a problem with the film. I've saw its parallels with other similar movies (i won't list them in hopes you didn't read any other comments, if you did you've probably spoiled the experience for yourself too) too soon and basically after first 20 minutes knew what is the trick. That really spoiled my movie experience, since I spent the rest of the movie just waiting for the confirmation. I think if I had enjoyed the movie before checking out some reviews I'd enjoy it even more. This way I'm giving only 7/10, for what the movie could be but wasn't. Go see it before reading further, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'd like to get this out of the way: Christian Bale is painful to look at. Honestly, if the dead could walk, they would look like Trevor Reznick. He is excruciatingly thin. When I was walking out of the cinema almost every conversation I heard was about Christian Bale's weight loss and no one spoke about how haunting his acting was. This is going to be a reoccurring theme for Bale and I would like to apologize now for it. Hell, I'd even write the guy a letter and congratulate him on nailing such a demanding role. In fact, I might just do that. Because in a society obsessed with their weight, that's all certain types of people will want to discuss.Its unfortunate that the film reminds of Fight Club and Memento because that will detract from its originality and probably wont stand out as much in years to come. This film, again sorry to mention, will probably stand out for Bale's weight loss which, again, is a shame.The Machinist is brilliant. It captures the bleak reality of a man haunted and how his life has gradually deteriorated. Also, this is a working man's film. Forget Edward Norton's bourgeois character in the beginning of Fight Club, Trevor Reznick is a man with no goals, aspirations, he just lives one day to the next, hardly drinking or even doing drugs. Also, Trevor is not an attention seeker: he just wants to be left alone to continue his bleak life.Some of the twists are obvious ( it would be better if you hadn't seen Fight Club ) and the symbolism a bit overplayed; but it carries a stronger message than even Fight Club. Without giving too much away, Trevor's redemption, as difficult as that must be, is really the only way he could have gone. Gritty, bleak, poignant and, yes, depressing. The last time I was as moved by a film it was My Name is Joe - now THAT it a depressing, yet strangely uplifting, film.If you can find this film playing ( which will be difficult ) GO AND SEE IT. It deserves recognition that it probably will not receive. As does Christian Bale's acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first a question. Does anyone know if there was any intent to somewhat portray some of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's works in this film? Early in the film he is reading "The Idiot" and since I just finished "Crime and Punishment" as well as an overview of all his works, I wanted to know if anyone knew of more of a connection besides just the inner mental workings of someone coping with killing another.second, the only part of the movie that i am having trouble with right now is why he cleaned the floor with bleach. The hand cleaning makes sense and has been used through the ages in all stories, but him killing Ivan on his floor in the bathroom comes after him washing the floor with bleach and a toothbrush. Is this a mistake in the time line? or is there some other reason for him cleaning the floor?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought The Machinist was a great movie with excellent acting and an intriguing story-line. It is an interesting look at a man who is being eaten by guilt and shame, to the point of insanity, over a horrible thing he's done. However when it ended I was stuck in my seat because the suspense was building up for a long time, but the conclusion was very short. I wanted to know why exactly he saw himself as Ivan(the bald guy). I understand that he saw himself as an evil person for doing what he had done which would explain Ivan persona, but where exactly did his face come from. It isn't that important because the movie as a whole is very intense and emotional-mostly due to Christian Bale's performance.</fullReview>

Honestly, I was very touched by the story. I enjoyed the visuals (in cinemascope) a lot. Greyish colors and a superb soundtrack added up to the psychotic state I myself gradually grew in... as a result of identification and absorption - there aren't many films these days that have this power. Obviously in the tradition of "Fight Club" and "Memento" - and another superb example of how potent the medium film can be if all its advantages are used properly. Sad it wasn't advertised much and already runs only for late screenings in its second week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this as part of the Leeds International Film Festival. Trailers looked great and I love everything Bale does, so I had pretty high expectations... Positives about the movie: Bale really outdid himself dropping all those pounds; Bale's acting is great - several times found myself cringing as he descended into madness; cinematography was excellent with a very interesting visual "tint" about the entire film; machine shop set was perfectly surreal; (I must admit) JJ Leigh's nude scenes. Negatives about the movie: Predictable, predictable, predictable - although I was interested in the ride I knew where it was going far before the reveal. The plot seemed hatched out of the offspring of other films that have done it better: Secret Window being the most recent foray. All in all, it was an interesting viewing, but I'll take American Psycho over this any day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a superb movie with a fantastic performance by the lead Christian Bale. I wont get into the details of the movie, but I will say that it's very much like an episode of the old TV series The Twilight Zone. In fact, it's a hybrid of two episodes from the original series, YOU DRIVE and PERCHANCE TO DREAM. The atmosphere of the movie and cinematography were second to none, and really immerse the viewer into Bale's character's private hell. Bale has played psychotic types before, with the other most notable role being American Psycho. While that film was a black comedy in some segments, this movie is very serious and can be disturbing for some. Bale's physical transformation and acting should garner him academy award nominations for sure...My score: 10/10 Superb... Atmospheric and creepy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not even Robert De Niro in Raging Bull or Charlize Theron can hold a candle to Christian Bale's shocking physical transformation in this film as Trevor Reznick. If he doesn't win an award somewhere in this politically charged landscape of a voting world then we're headed for the end as we know it. Casting this film had to be right on and they got it perfect. Jennifer Jason Leigh's troubled and sad turn as "Stevie" the prostitute is rich against Aitana Sanchez-Gijon's "Marie", a compassionate kind soul. Although the two never cross paths, the wide spectrum between the two is not lost. Brilliantly shot in a modern day Hitchcock-like genre ala Brad Anderson, you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor as you descend into an insomniacs madness where only the end can offer you the payoff you deserve. Scott Kosar's dark and disturbing script is a wild ride for sure. Thank goodness someone had the guts to take this one all the way to the big screen. Warning, this one ain't easy to watch.

I was simply amazed, I've hardly ever seen a movie of this quality: the scenario is totally complete, nothing's missing, the end is worth the rest of the movie, there's no waste of time, no useless scene, it's just as precise, complete, interesting, full of suspense, frightening and amazing as such a movie should be. Christian Bale is perfect, simply incredible. Jennifer Jason Leigh makes a great come back, she's very touching. I like the way the spectator sinks into madness with trevor, at least, it's what I felt during the vision, I felt like I was Trevor, like it could happen to any of us. And I don't think I was the only one feeling that way, cause when we got out of the screening, everyone had the same look of fear and incredulity on their face.

		<fullReview>This film just won the HR Giger Award "Narcisse for the Best Fantastic Feature Film" and the "Silver Méli?s Award" at the NIFFF 2004 (Neuchatel International Fantasy Film Festival) in Switzerland. The very dark story with excellent pictures tells about Trevor Reznik, a machinist, who isn't able to sleep for months (the reason for this will only be explained at the end of the film). He is exhausted and causes an accident at work, where one of his colleagues loses an arm. Slowly he becomes paranoid and strange things happen around him. In Europe we call this kind of movies "Mindfucker"-Films (in the US you would probably call it "Mind*****"-Films - but at the end it's the same...). Director Brad Anderson plays with the viewer and you never know what's real and what's not. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a usual the white trash slut and Christian Bale's performance is troubling. To see this thin man, only being bones and skin (like a KZ-survivor) is really a "tour de force".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Hitchcock since "Psycho".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a huge fan of his breakthrough hit "Next Stop Wonderland", I had high hopes for Brad Anderson's latest work, which I was fortunate enough to have seen at the Sundance Film Festival last week. However, I was not ready for the pleasant surprise that this exceptional psychological thriller would deliver.From the first frame I was on the edge of my seat, my brain working overtime to try and figure out what was happening and where things were going, all the while enjoying the crazy ride I was on and the unbelievable performance of Christian Bale who I understand lost 65 pounds to play the role of our sad protagonist Trevor Reznik.Anderson's storytelling chops have never been so finely tuned as in "Machinist". He never lets go of the audience and paces things so well you don't care how long it takes to get to your destination YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THIS THING IS GOING! And the climax delivers without the slightest sense of disappointment and/or abruptness that even many of the great master's films did in the last act.I haven't stopped thinking about this film since the curtain came up and it's probably because I've never been so spellbound (pun intended) perhaps since "Memento". Though "The Machinist" may not be as ORIGINAL a concept as that other film, in every other way it matches and/or surpasses it and, unlike "Memento" it has no gaping holes in its logic.Go see this movie and see if you're as blown away as we all were at the World Premiere in Park City.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A for Bale, B+ for film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian Bale, who has never really impressed me except in American Psycho, turns in a tour de force performance in The Machinist, an indy thriller I saw at Sundance last night. He lost a ton of weight for the role. It's obvious from the progression that some scenes were shot at different times, as Bale gets more skeletal and there is a brief scene in which he looks healthy. Beyond the physical work, Bale is mesmerizing as an extremely troubled blue collar worker who is trying to discover what's wrong--either with him or the world. I won't list any spoilers here. Jennifer Jason Leigh is fabulous as always as his hooker girlfriend. The most memorable aspects to the film for me is the use of what I'd term "Twilight Zone" music. The soundtrack sounds like TZ or The Outer Limits, and there is a definite 60s television feel to the eerie puzzle script. The palette is mostly browns, sepia, and though there are modern cars and other signs of modernity (cell phones, etc) the scenes could be anytime USA. There is a heavy-handed amusement park scene which almost works, and a few fairly obvious turns in the figure-it-out plot, but overall very effective. Bale is so good at looking in shock, tired, hopeless, afraid, frenetic, etc that he holds your eye throughout the film. I'm sure this will get picked up and distributed widely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly Interesting, but a Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited to see this movie because I heard so much about how dangerously skinny Christian Bale got for the role. I thought if he was willing to risk his health for this, it must be an amazing film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I was disappointed in the plot, not Bale's performance. He was excellent. He was a creepy, scummy, mysterious guy with a secret, sleeping with a prostitute, getting coffee from the same waitress every night, and working at a dark, dirty factory. I got his character, I felt it. I didn't feel like I knew him (which is one of my favorite things about movie characters), but that was the point. I felt the director was very successful in this. I wanted to know what his deal was. I longed to find out what the heck was his problem. Bale's facial expressions and actions provoked this need in me. That's great.The plot is my problem. This is a movie that tries desperately to be some kind of complex thriller, where the conclusion pieces everything together and the viewer feels like they've just witnessed some incredible puzzle be ripped apart and put back together. It fails. It's confusing, it's not cohesive. It doesn't really feel like it fits together. It's like putting that puzzle together with pieces from another puzzle. The ending was incredibly unsatisfying to me. The movie tries to have some metaphorical pieces, I think, but they go unnoticed. They just add to the confusion. I would like the story if it didn't so hard to shock you, twist up your perception of the whole situation at the end. It would have had a better impact if it was more simple. I like thinkers, don't get me wrong. I just cannot stand movies that try to fit that description and fail.This is an okay movie that is almost great. It's kinda tragic, I think, how close the director was to having gold, but then having plastic instead. I didn't buy this movie but I think I would have regretted it if I had. I'm not going to buy it. If a friend wanted to watch this movie with me, I wouldn't mind, but I wouldn't spend anything on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its hard to write a review for this movie without giving much away. If I hadn't seen 3 movies that have nearly this exact ending it could be one of my favorites, that or if this was my first time seeing a movie like this. The bottom line is that they took the easy way out. It almost seemed like they had a bunch of really cool ideas for different scenes and scenarios but didn't know how to make it all fit together, so they did it the painfully obvious way. The only thing that kept me going on this movie is the hope that they had to take a different approach. I was wrong, and am seriously disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is probably better than the other 3 movies I am thinking of, but that doesn't excuse the predictability and the easy way out. I am half tempted to write the other 3 movies I have in mind (there is a duel meaning of me writing there are thr3e other movies... movie buffs will know what I mean. but there really are three movies that I could list). Its like they say third strike and your out.I gave this movie 6 stars because it really was well made. Considering Christian basically went anorexic (it was hard to even look at him) to play the part shows the dedication, and that shows a lot about how much work was clearly put into this film. Rent it if you don't try to figure things out for yourself, and want to be "surprised" by the ending. I will also say I am surprised this wasn't a huge hit in theaters.</fullReview>

It has such strange atmosphere. It's like something is going on but we don't know what it is. I must say the the film really succeeds in giving such mystery.

I heard people talk about that before and after I saw the film, I totally agree with it. Just looking at him makes you feel the tension. I really admire how he devoted to his work and got that skinny for it.One flaw, though. This type of film that gives clues and mysterious things along the way should have a satisfying ending that answer them all. But this one, well, the ending is not bad, but it's not that much shocking or unpredictable. It's a fine ending but it's similar to most Hollywood formulated films. I wish it was more powerful.Overall, I give it a 8.5. This film is worth checking out.</fullReview>

Seroiusly, his body reminds me of all the pictures of concentration camps that I see in history textbooks. It is almost shocking that an actor would go as far to prepare himself in the role.The plot itself is tight and gripping.

He has not slept for year and comforts himself continually bedding a hooker who has taken a liking to him. He also sits in an airport café in the middle of the night and flirts with the attractive waitress on duty. He works as a machinist where his workmates and superiors worry as to what has transformed Trevor into a walking corpse. Trevor befriends a colleague at work named Ivan, but as events unfold we learn that Ivan may be a figment of imagination in Trevors tortured mind.It takes at least 2 viewings of The Machinist to truly appreciate the entire story. The final act of the film ties up every loose end and we understand why Trevor has deteriorated in such an intense manner; But with a second viewing some ambiguous scenes make a lot more sense and bring a bigger sense of foreboding to the atmosphere.The cinematography of the film does a great job of bringing us into Trevors perspective of the world, the atmosphere is dreary and worn, just like Trevor. There are 2 scenes in the film which explore Trevors inner psyche, one of which is the ride in the amusement park. which is wonderfully shot and show first hand the extent of Trevors guilt and how deep it is buried in his mind. The main highlight of this movie is Christian Bales performance, he pulled out all the stops to nail the Character of Trevor, losing 60 pounds of a 180 pound frame. He genuinely looks disturbing and it brings so much more realism and authenticity to the plot. Its hard to root for such a sick looking protagonist but Bales charisma keeps us enthralled.The storyline could be panned because of the overuse of alter egos in movies (fight club, adaptation), but i feel, like with those 2 movies, it is necessary to progress the plot and adds to the dreamlike state that Trevor is imprisoned in, giving a much more deeper meaning to the story. A truly great psychological thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all in the mind !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what the pangs of guilty conscience can do to a human being , playing havoc with his mind, life, and reducing him to a mental wreck. Do we realize the integral part of peaceful slumber in our life, or only when we lose it, that we desperately try to get it at any cost ? And still it can elude us, no matter what ! Alone, but not lonely, in his earlier phase of life, Trevor is a handsome, healthy man, working though with machines all the time, his sense of humor still intact. One unforeseen Hit and Run car accident by him, killing a young boy on the road, and the life is never the same for him again ! Every thing goes weirdly psychotic, his work life, his love life, and his very existence, until and unless, there comes the moment of realization, that confessing to the crime committed by him, may not be deliberately perhaps, but not reporting it, and running away from the reality, has given him the insomnia of the worst type ,does he fall to sleep after all. Though quite heavy in the atmosphere, sequences, and the deterioration of the main character, Trevor Reznik, superbly enacted by Bale, the director achieves his goal of taking the viewer through the turmoil, the mental agony, the confusion, cleverly maintaining a thin line between the reality and the delusions of Trevor's world created by his disintegrating mind. The casting is perfect, carefully chosen, and every one making justice to his or her role. especially ,John Sharian , playing the role of Ivan, has given an awesome performance. The dialog is thoughtfully written, and naturally delivered, the sexual content is in place, and not out of the context, or unnecessary to the plot line. one must watch this movie for this amazing actor Christian Bale, who has emaciated himself, to the extent of showing every damn rib in his body ! Perhaps the only flaw one might think of ,is the period of one long year, which takes the offender to surrender to the law, and the police not able to reach him, though the accident takes place right in the middle of a busy street, with every possibility, that people , or the shop keepers have seen the driver, and the car too. still they are not bothered to trace him ? Perhaps, the script writer could have reduced the period of one long year, to a few months , to make it more realistically acceptable. but then, the emphasis is more on the journey of the human mind through hell, created by his very own guilt complex, which is simply soul stirring . Hope this movie does not give insomnia to some of us , after they are through the experience !</fullReview>

I use to like twisted movies, like Seven, Hannibal, 12 Monkeys, Twin Peaks, The Sixth Sense, American Psycho, and it's very different movie, it's almost alternative movie. It's amazing how tiny Christian Bale become for this movie, it looks even worth than people German prison camp, and next year he have to gain his weight for Batman, he talks about this on special features Batman DVD. Direction, cameras, colors and music absolutely fantastic. And of course Christians Bale acting is just great. I't almost feels like this is opposite character from Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. I'm asking myself: Is it good for actor's career to act in this type of movies, and I would usually say not, but with his type of acting plus all movie is is focused only on Christian Bale, so we can see again his acting at his best. I also like minimalism in this movie, very simple sets, but works great to create mood of the Trevor Reznik's world, some time I even fell that it happens in middle of 20 century, and when he goes out I can see todays world, but through the eyes of Trevor Reznik. And ending is just great, reveal form his misery.It's a great movie, but this movie not to everyone....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist portrays the life of a very lonely insomniac that cannot remember anything. He has trouble focusing on things, and has a hard time distinguishing between what's actually happening and what he's just thinking about.This film was done beautifully. It's not for everyone, due to the fact that a normal film watcher would probably find it a bit on the boring side. The fact still stands, the story was very unpredictable, and told in a creepy kind of way to that makes you think, "If this was happening to me, I'd go crazy?" The character of Trevor Reznick was flawlessly done by Christian Bale. The amount of time he had to have put into this film to look the way he did must have a substantial. And then to film Batman Begins a year later? Wow? This guy deserves some respect for his obviously disciplined motivation to be a great actor.</fullReview>

Listen and watch for messages, signs, symbolism and imagery. Sounds of laughter, dripping, breathing, knocking - all the things you would miss if you hadn't slept in that long.It is creepy, edgy and full of tangible exhaustion, as a viewer who may have slept the night before you even start to wonder who is real and what is actually happening. It was good, although the suspense is so built up you hope to be brought down at the same speed.Christian Bale is fast establishing himself as one of the finest actors of his generation. I am so glad he did this film - actors like him need to work hard to stand apart from all those 'stars' who can't act. We respect you Christian!</fullReview>

The musical score is wonderful, as are the locations. I hope Bale--like Edward Norton--does not do too many 'delusional' roles. Playing a blue-collar American, Christian Bale shows he can become anyone. He starves himself in this role in a bit of 'method acting' that would challenge Kafka's "Hunger Artist." Superbly brooding and desperate, the plot continues to surprise through the last scene. As for the rest of the cast, Jennifer Jason-Leigh should hang up the whore with a heart of gold character. Or wait, was this Elizabeth Shue in "Leaving Las Vegas"? Sharian as Ivan has a great bit part, looking like the fattened Brando as Kurtz. There are Trevor Reznik's in the world, deeply in need of solace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>experience what a schizophrenic goes through...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely the best and most intelligent film I've seen for a long time. About half way through I realized 'this must be what a schizophrenic experiences.' The ending is completely unexpected (even for people who, like myself, find M Night Shyamalan's "twists" predictable) and ties every odd detail together tighter than a slip knot. You will be talking about this one after the credits roll. I have read many comparisons to David Lynch. But the endings of films like "Lost Highway" for instance are like dreams that can only be computed on a subconscious level. "The Machinist's" resolution will please viewers who insist that a story should make sense while they are awake. (Don't get my wrong, I love most of David Lynch's work and "Lost Highway" is one of my favorite films.) At first I was a little hesitant to rent this because of the 'disturbing images' warning. I love films that are disturbing on a cerebral level but I have never been a fan of gore for gore's sake. Given the title of the film and the warnings I thought this might be a festival of machine tooled body parts flying about. But it is not like that at all. The accident scene (which is mentioned in the plot outline so this is no spoiler) really isn't so bad and it is brief. I've seen worse images in mainstream R rated action thrillers. I guess the ratings people just found this film disturbing in general. And it is but that is what makes it so fascinating. This is what independent film is all about! You must see this film!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was damned good. I just watched this, and I have to say it affected me so much I went and immediately Googled Scott Kosar (the writer's name) to see what other movies he'd done. Christian Bale's performance (as Trevor) and devotion is to be commended; he was unrecognizable in this film, so my hat goes off to him for having lost so much weight and putting so much into his role as a skeletal lunatic. Well I don't know if lunatic is an accurate adjective but he was certainly delusional and very skinny. John Sharian played Ivan, and his sick laugh and wide smile still haunts me, as does Bale's fragile and emaciated form. In all actuality, a little realism is lost in the latter half of the film. The little stunt Trevor pulled towards the end should've kill him by his appearance. My only real complaint is that the notes' corollary was just that; by that I mean a little too predictable. For that I give it a 7 instead of 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry for the bad pun in the title. But I feel this movie wouldn't have half of its strength if it wasn't for Bale's performance and the creepy fascination it induces in the viewer.I saw this movie three times as of today. The first time, I thought like many other viewers: just another "Fight Club/Memento" type flick. And the final plot twist is disappointing, feels "bland" in comparison of all the mystery the movie is making of this.I saw the movie a second time and then, you read the movie in a very different and interesting way. I enjoyed it much more. For this story, the "plot-twist" device is, in my opinion, a mistake:1 - it makes you go through the movie missing a lot, even if you're really captivated by the mood and it may give you the feeling the movie was gratuitously sordid.2 - it gives the feeling it felt for a trend I believe to be inappropriate to tell such a story 3 - it may give the feeling the writers were either not confident in the strength of their subject or they weren't taking it seriously using it as an excuse to tell yet another plot twist type of story.All this to say "please don't be disappointed by the plot twist" and expect something very dark and dramatic and realistic. I should almost spoil the story for you who haven't yet seen the movie, but that would be disrespectful.Despite this, I must say the movie has great visual qualities, a very well rendered mood, great acting from everyone. But most of all Christian Bale's performance at every level is what keeps you hooked, the suffering you feel for the character... But it also may be what will turn you off as he can make you feel really uncomfortable, in which case, there's not much one can say to help you go through this rather dark, difficult movie.</fullReview>

Although i agree with another IMDb user's comment who said this film is not for everybody, it sure worked for me. THe performances were good, but i especially liked Kosar's screenplay and Anderson dark moody direction. The film had a great atmosphere throughout, was very entertaining, and surprised me by having a great third act (for some reason i had this feeling the ending would be a letdown, but it wasn't).

		<shortDescription>Twisted, intelligent film which takes two viewings to properly appreciate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There should really be two reviews for this film, one for the plot, and one for the subliminal images and ideas which pervade the story the second time you watch it. I loathe using spoilers and see them as detrimental to the point of a review but to talk about a film like this they would be hard to avoid.I will concentrate instead on the need for this film to be watched a second time, I really cannot underestimate the difference a second viewing makes, it really is like watching a different film. Odd lines like "Trevor! I need a hand!" take on completely new meaning, scenes such as Christian Bale's Trevor screaming at people who may be plotting against him are simply terrifying when watched with different context.Brad Anderson excels himself packing the film full of literary references and images, the acting is fantastic, I don't know whether Bale was nominated for any awards, but he should have been and he should have swept the board, becoming so immersed in the character he inspires fear and revulsion as well as pity and empathy, an absolute masterclass.The first time I saw the film I came away thinking it was a clever psychological thriller. The second time I saw it, having sat through the Route 666 scene, I came away with the distinct feeling that this was a horror film, I was shocked at how my perceptions had changed. The aforementioned scene will probably go overlooked, but is possibly one of the single most disturbing scenes I have ever sat through. Skin-crawling, and we don't need over-the-top violence to shock us when film-making is this clever.I'd urge everyone to watch it, wait awhile, then watch it again, there aren't many films I re-watch unless for a specific reason, this should be mandatory for everyone.</fullReview>

Whatever it is, it's very good, and will need to be seen twice to fully appreciate the detail of the main character Trevor Reznik and the effort that went into all of he the details of the character (not just Christian Bale's jaw dropping weight loss). I don't want to say any more for fear of giving too much away, but I will say if you thought the film had "been done before" to an extent, you mustn't dismiss it, but re-watch it, discover the differences and see that this film is an exceptional character study of a very interesting character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A little guilt goes a long way..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and makes "The Machinist" a film you simply can't tear your eyes away from, and not just because of how astoundingly Christian Bale starved himself down to skin and bone for the role of Trevor Reznik, a man who hasn't been able to sleep for a year and is suffering for it both mentally and physically. Or is there more to it than that? Tightly scripted by up-and-comer Scott Kosar, who did a tolerable job on the 2003 remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," along with last year's "The Amityville Horror," which I haven't seen yet, and is slated for screen writing duties for the updating of George A. Romero's "The Crazies," and directed by auteur Brad Anderson, whose prior work is unfamiliar to me, but will hopefully not remain so, "The Machinist" is a prime psycho-thriller along the lines of "Memento," "Fight Club," and numerous others mentioned elsewhere on these boards. I can't say I've seen such an effective portrait of psychological disintegration since Catherine Deneuve's descent into madness in Roman Polanski's classic "Repulsion." In addition, Xavi "Darkness" Giménez' stark cinematography, cast in washed-out blues, grays, and greens, the immaculate art direction of Alain Bainée, and the remarkably appropriate score by Roque "Sexy Beast" Ba?os all contribute to the film's sense of unavoidable deterioration and inescapable doom. The acting support from Jennifer Jason Leigh as a sympathetic prostitute, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón as an equally sympathetic widowed waitress, Michael Ironside as an unfortunate victim of Reznik's psychosis, and John Sharian (sporting an awesome set of choppers and one of the oddest disfigurements in recent memory) as Reznik's sinister nemesis, Ivan, is uniformly effective. There really isn't a false note in the entire film; one finds oneself drawn completely and utterly into Reznik's Dostoyevskian, Twilight Zone world, replete with signposts up ahead, all the little hints that lead us along with Reznik to the film's ultimate revelations.Certainly "The Machinist" is not a film for everyone. It's a grim picture, a portrait of a man drowning in his own paranoia and confusion and suppressed guilt. In some respects, it's like watching something very unsettling in slow motion, a living nightmare that, unlike Bale's tormented character who craves the blessed peace and oblivion of sleep, you want to wake up from. Thankfully, at film's end, Trevor Reznik does "wake up" and confront the source of his torture in a resolution that is somewhat predictable (if only to the inveterate film buff), but logically and emotionally satisfying.Highly recommended to those who appreciate the superior acting chops of Christian Bale, as well as thriller fans who love Hitchcockian mind play. Don't miss the visual nod to "Psycho!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very involving deep psychodrama (for me at least, it seems enough people here did NOT get caught up in the story that make me wonder what specifically failed for others). Definitely Hitch's shadow (though sadly not the bloated belly silhouette) is cast upon this fine film.I was hesitant to see this, not sure why. Maybe the title put me off, I was afraid it would be Hollywood glitzing up the blue collar world. Or equally as bad, they would tilt the other way with excessive squalor and no humanity. Little did I know Hollywood passed on this, additionally, while the film does take place in machine shop, machinations (of the mind alone?) are more pivotal to the plot here.So that being said, I guess this is recommended for Christian Bale fans (one of whom I was not), or perhaps for fans of Bernard Hermann scores (the soundtrack here I *must* track down for KFJC, it played like the weather...omnipresent and affecting every scene). I actually saw this over a month ago, and it has stuck to my ribs...if that's any sort of recommendation.Spoilers may follow...Gaunt haunting of the film by Christian Bale is only one aspect of the atmos-fear created here. When he initially strode shirtless across the screen, I first thought CGI. The comments here and elsewhere about body loss, even if I had read them ahead of time, I would have been jarred. Of course, body torture alone does not make a formidable flick, otherwise that "Sick" film would have made it off my list of maybes to have-seen long ago. His weightless, while eye-catching is not so disturbing as several brutal scenes herein where machines injure people. Didn't bother me but a good friend mentioned that he had to sorta skip by them, definitely not a film for the squeamish, but as my friend did you can maybe not watch those scenes and still get a lot of this film.I've seen others champion Jennifer Jason-Leigh's performance, I don't know I thought Aitana Sanchez-Gijon was far more compelling. When she's on camera, the film feels like it can breathe, color splashes in and the hesitant courtship adds a nice hint of sweetness to the dour proceedings...at least for awhile. Other actors like Reg E. Cathey (as watchable here as he was in Oz) and John Sharian also lend a little more muscle to this film's frames. Speaking of "Oz" this was sort of like that HBO series, I watched but stricken with a tight stomach of unease.The payoff of the film (i.e. REALLY stop reading now if you haven't seen this and think you might want to) comes as the tarp is unraveled and nothing is there (nice tie to the lead-off scene and helping to feel your watching world fall apart). We find out about the car accident, and that connects to so many other things...and we realize that Reznick's mind has sprung up this alternate reality to try and rectify his misdeed. That I think is a very powerful human response, not as noble as honest atonement, but perhaps more real, or more likely to happen in such a horrible case.Like I said a deep film, even without touching on the Doestoevsky references. Bale's performance along with the script and direction do a great job at placing you at the center of a tragedy without knowing you are there until its too late and everything comes crashing in on you. Surely not for everyone, but for fans of grim yet thoughtful suspense, this is a must. Watch it late at night, it will add to your appreciation of Reznick's insomnia and the dreamlike darkling in this film.My review is not at all capturing this fine piece of work.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's becoming more and more frequent that a split personality type mystery leaves me feeling cheated. Film-makers now need to realise that audiences can spot this device so easily now that the final 80% of most films is simply filler until the audience is shown to be right.In it's defense, the Machinist never really attempts to keep up the pretense that it's trying to trick the viewer. From fairly early on it's apparent that not all is as it seems in Trevor's world and we are left to try and figure out exactly why. To be honest, we never stood a chance. And that's a bad thing.Christian Bale has already proved himself one of the finest actors of his generation, showing his range in films as diverse as "All the Little Animals" and "American Psycho". Here he strikes a memorable figure, losing I don't know how much weight, and creates a character that at times is difficult to watch. He manages to produce a performance that is just vacant enough to be believable without ever slipping into parody. If only he could choose the right scripts.Bale was good. There was a definite eerie quality about the film. Jennifer Jason Leigh was in it. Those are the good points.We all know the bad points. And we all knew them before we watched it.</fullReview>

The comparisons with Finchers "Fight Club", Nolans "Memento" and "Identity" are obvious, but whereas the first one deals with brutality, the second with memory and the third with schizophrenia, this one is more about the inner torments of its main character. The twist (and solution) towards the end is not weaker than that of the ones mentioned above, but its clearly not the intention of the director or the writer to show the audience how clever they are and how blind we were. The movie ends not with the shocking twist, but has a convincing epilogue. The colors, the atmosphere, the actors, the rhythm of this film are wonderful. Dostojevskys Book is shown in a short sequence, and that is mainly the only clue you will get, just how that might end. A "9" at first sight and maybe a "10" on second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the Machinist, director Brad Anderson has created a love sonnet to Hitchcock. If the fact that it has Christian Bale in it rather than Jimmy Stewart throws you off the scent, all you have to do is listen to the music. The soundtrack to the Machinist sounds like Bernard Herman's greatest hits. This purposeful tip of the hat to Hitchcock, and Christian Bale's impressive portrayal of a man who is slowly losing his mind make the Machinist worth watching, despite the fact that it boasts one of my least favorite twist endings.Bale plays a tortured man who hasn't been able to sleep for a year. The cause of his insomnia is unknown, but it's taking a toll on his health. To say that he's lost a lot of weight is an understatement. Bale is positively skeletal in this movie. As he struggles to maintain his sanity and keep his job at the machine shop, Bale tries desperately to understand why he can't sleep.Things take a turn for the worst when Bale meets the new guy at work. He's a bald-headed, leering man who lost his hand in some kind of unfortunate circumstance, and now has two of his two sewed on his hand in place of fingers. This guy has a weird way of showing up just when something bad is going to happen, and pretty soon Bale thinks that Baldy has got it in for him. If you've seen SECRET WINDOW, HAUTE TENSION or even HIDE AND SEEK, the big twist of this movie will come as no surprise. Typically, I think this revelation is overused and cheap, which is why I didn't give this movie a higher rating, but at least the Machinist is done with some style.Taking into account the undeniable Hitchcock style that Brad Anderson gave this movie, and the remarkable acting from everyone involved, especially Christian Bale, I would recommend this movie to horror fans who are interested in thrillers that move a little slower but are thick with atmosphere. The ending is a bit of a letdown, but as with HAUTE TENSION, the telling of the tale justifies at least one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited when I found out about this film, that I ran down to the video store and rented it immediately. I was sure pleased after viewing it. It's one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. Christian Bale was outstanding in his performance, and everyone else involved in the film should win ten awards each for the work that they all did. It was an amazing movie.Trevor (Bale) is suffering from insomnia. He hasn't slept in one year. His weight is down to 119 pounds and he's over six feet tall. His job is the pits, and he works as a machinist at an industrial work factory. His apartment is dark and dreary (but this is actually a running theme in the movie.), and he has no real life. Suddenly, that all changes. Strange things start occurring, and we're never quite sure if this is real, or if he himself is just imagining all of it, from lack of sleep.I had to stop the movie twice, because I got so nervous and was so tense from watching it. There were times, when I thought I was going to end up having nightmares, because some of the scenes were so realistic and psychologically nerve-wrenching! I could go on and on about how much I adore this movie. I'm ready to own it now, and I recommend it to anyone over 18 who loves thrillers like this, and can handle a little bit of disturbing aspects in film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoy this film first time round you will LOVE it by the end of your second viewing, I won't talk about the plot, i had no preconceptions going into this film, i'd never heard of it, am a fan of Christian Bale and was in the mood for something dark, and i loved it!I watched it again about a week later and spent the whole film transfixed, i didn't want to miss a thing and it was even better than the first time, the script, editing, cast, soundtrack and production are all excellent and you can taste the trauma that Bale experiences.A haunting, spellbinding and quite disturbing journey, that is criminal to watch only once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One way ticket to paranoia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist follows Christian Bale as Trevor Reznik, a man who has not slept in a year, who's body has wilted down to skin and bones and a guy who is loosing his grip on the world around him.Trevor works in a machine shop and meets a new guy called Ivan. One day at work Trevor helps a fellow workmate fix a machine, but is distracted by this Ivan who makes a not-too-friendly gesture at him across the workshop. Trevor knocks into the machine, sets it going and his action costs his work mate an arm. From then on Trevor spirals into paranoia, convinced everyone - including Ivan - is out to get him. But no one seems to know who Ivan is.Christian Bale plays the part of an insomniac with a weight problem very well. The fact that he actually lost half his natural body weight to play this part shows his commitment. The thing about this film is you never know until the end whether or not he is going crazy, or if he is indeed being set up by everyone around him. The ending is a kicker and unless you know exactly what you are looking for you will not guess it.Definitely worth the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Machinist runs on cinematic greatness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Machinist" is such a grandiose motor of a film that it has geared its way to film supremacy. This is the most unique and one of the best films of the year. Let me first give you the "skinny" on its protagonist, Christian Bale. Mr. Batman Begins himself was no Fatman Begins here. Bale lost 60 lbs. to play the part of Trevor Reznik, an industrial worker who has a severe case of insomnia due to not sleeping over a year because of a life-altering event. I will not get into the specifics of the event because that would be a major blunder to this review. Reznik is paranoid &amp; lonely but at the same time has in-depth knowledge &amp; intuition. The thin man Trevor befriends a co-worker named Ivan, who is non-existent to his other colleagues. Is Ivan the Great providing sound guidance to Trevor or is Ivan the Terrible playing psychological mind-games to Trevor? Reznik has two main women in his lives who he sporadically sees: his call girl girlfriend and and airport diner waitress. These fems see the melancholy in Trevor, but they also see the humanity. They both play significant parts in Trevor's unyielding complexities. In fact, I wonder if they see anything at all in Trevor since he is almost physically transparent. Director Brad Anderson's archetypal construction and ingenious design of "The Machinist" has enough fuel to be classified as one of the best directorial efforts of 2004. Oscar voters' mechanisms needed a tune-up when they snubbed Anderson from a Best Director nomination. The acting of "The Machinist" was also a well-constructed acting machine. Bale most definitively was the spark plug of the film with his daring and compelling performance. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon were competent maquinitas as the women in Trevor's life. John Sharian was mesmerizing as the overbearing Ivan."The Machinist" has enough credible cinematic groundbreaking qualities to make this well-tuned machine into a cult classic in the film industry! Gear up to "The Machinist" asap. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting with an impressive Christian Bale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching 'The Machinist' I felt a great admiration for Christian Bale who lost 63 pounds for his role as Trevor Reznik, a man who tells a prostitute named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) he has not slept in a year. The way Bale looks and acts is very impressive, too impressive maybe, since it sometimes takes the attention away form the film itself.Stevie is one of his friends, Marie (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón) is another. She works as a waitress on the airport and Trevor visits her every day for a cup of coffee and a slice of pie. He works as a machinist where his co-workers are not very fond of him, even less when he causes an accident where one of the other men loses his arm. Trevor was distracted by a person who, according to his superiors, does not even exist. Other strange things occur. Trevor finds little Post-Its with a game of hangman in his kitchen. Who is writing the Post-Its, or do they even exist? Does the man he saw and sees more and more exist? Is Trevor losing his mind?The final moments explain a lot and some things were a little predictable but I didn't care. The movie for me was more about the journey than its destination. What we get to see is how Trevor is feeling and the ending only provides a reason for that. I was satisfied with the answers the movie gave me. Director Brad Anderson with a lot of help from Bale's performance create a creepy atmosphere around Trevor. The movie therefore is effective and basically that is all I wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uh, so what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Trevor Reznik suffers from insomnia, in fact he claims not to have slept for a year. And he has lost a lot of weight. So, his life revolves around three places. An all night open café at an airport, a prostitute called Stevie and his work at a factory. It is at the factory he first meets Ivan, an odd character. One day a co-worker asks Reznik to help him, but Reznik gets distracted by Ivan and an accident were the co-worker loses his arm is the result. This is the point were Reznik really start to slip into a strange behavior. Management at the factory claims to know nothing about Ivan and his friends at the factory turns their backs on him. At the same time mysterious messages appear at Rezniks refrigerator. He believes that he is the target of some plot, and that Ivan has the key. But Ivan is hard to catch, and Reznik starts to doubt what is real and what is not.Comments: First, it is a very well made film. The directing is superb, with a lot of hints, clues and references planted around the movie. Use of music, sound effects and visual keys are used in a nice balance. So there is no wrong there. And there is no fault in the acting either. The focus is heavy on Bale/Reznik, and he does it very well. You might actually think that Bale went a little too far with the weight loss, as he is scarily thin in the movie. Well, that's his decision and it do augment the message of Reznik not being very well. In total, I can't actually find any problem with the making of the movie. Instead it is the story that fails. It totally failed to connect, and I found myself not really caring what happened. I sat in the cinema, saw Reznik acting crazy and thought: "Aha, OK... so what?". The story lacks the ability to reach out to the audience. I couldn't identify with Reznik, nor could I feel sympathy for him. Actually I didn't have any feelings about what Reznik did that could engage me in the story, not sympathy, not wonder, not anger. Nothing. This movie is proof of that you can do everything right in a production, but still fail. You need the story to carry the movie. Still I hesitantly rate it a 5, only because of the directing and acting.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose many would consider "The Machinist" a neo film noir. Although it is filmed in color, the processing gave a very muted color that often looks almost black and white. There is a red car which appears at various times, and it is about the only thing that is bright. The muted colors work very well for this noir story, set on the USA west coast, but filmed in Spain. This is not a story about good people for whom everything works out well in the end. It is a fairly gripping psychological study that for me fell a bit flat in the final act, but well worth watching for the style and Bale.Christian Bale plays a very skinny Trevor Reznik, a blue collar machinist who says he hasn't slept in a year. When not working, he often looks sleepy when still, but never quite dozes off. He has what would usually be called a girlfriend, whom he sees regularly and cares for, but Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a prostitute. He leaves her very nice "tips". He also becomes friends with the waitress at the airport coffee shop, Marie, and also leaves her big tips. An accident at work throws everything in turmoil, and as the story progresses we suspect that not all is as it seems.MAJOR SPOILERS. Michael Ironside is a fellow machinist Miller and while distracted Trevor accidentally starts the machine that Miller was working on. Miller loses part of his left arm, gets a big settlement, but everyone at work turns against Trevor. He ends up being fired. He often sees a red car with a mysterious man in it, he purposely walks in front of a car to get hit so he can report a false hit and run, so the police will identify the red car via its license number. It turns out to be his car that he reported stolen a year earlier. The man isn't real, Trevor finally figures out that he had killed a young boy a year earlier in a hit and run, it was the guilt that was keeping him from sleeping, causing his weight loss (flashbacks showed him healthy), and only after he turned himself in was he able to sleep again. We don't know which, if any, of the characters were real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can only admire the discipline of Bale as he emulates what DeNiro has done in Raging Bull. They probably summarized the shooting scenes where he had his medium build before he lost some weight and ended up looking like the cadaver he is in this movie. He has this intensity that clearly is reaping the rewards of his earlier career in heavy drama as a child actor. The movie is extremely creepy and the score has some traces of Bernard Hermann influence in it. It's very Hitchcockian more than anything and it has moments that are not for the faint of heart. I wonder if the green palette was intentional and I wonder if it was achieved in post or during shooting. It has a clichéd concept though when you get to the end, but the execution, the tension you get from watching the film. The contageious fury that Bale brings to his role. It's all worth it. All involved are to be commended but praise goes to Bale, director Anderson and of course his scorer. The music makes this movie creepier than it would have been without it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend rented this movie the other night and I had no expectations about it what so ever. Eventually I found myself nailed in front of the TV. Couldn't even take the usual cigarette break, I just had to watch this one from start to end without any kind of interruption, that's how intensive I think it was. The casting is carefully chosen, with Christian Bale as a guy who really looks like a relic from the concentration camps of World war II Germany. I'm not usually a sensitive person about ugly and disgusting things but Bale's appearance really made me feel sick from the starting minutes of the flick. This guy really knows how to sacrifice his body for artistic reasons. The visual settings are pretty dark and hopeless and the misery of Mr. Reznik can be sensed with a good mixture of devoted acting, matching soundtrack and good camera work. Also I liked the film noir-type elements in the story. What more could go wrong in a life of an individual? This is a f****d up movie, I recommend you watch it in one piece to maintain the rare intensity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the choice of Dostoyevsky's "The Idiot" as the book that Trevor was reading. Dostoevsky himself suffered from epilepsy as did Prince Myshkin, the main character in the idiot. This explains the source of the epileptic fit that the kid had on the route 666 ride.The movie also reminds me a lot of Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment" where the protagonist commits a crime and is then riddled with guilt which drives him to the brink of insanity. Like Trevor, he has a lot of hallucinations and it gets to the point where he can no longer tell what is real and what is not.I liked the movie a lot. But I think the lengths to which Bale went to play this character was excessive. My God, it looked so real it's scary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're the kind of person who savors dissecting movies like a cinema professor, you will enjoy cutting this one up. Bale is awesome in his force of will; to lose that weight, look like a Holocaust survivor, and still have the focus to execute his performance flawlessly. All the supporting actors did they jobs too. If you like wankering around with symbolism, the movie is loaded with clues. Film looked damn good too, from an editing point of view.If not, you really have to like creepy films. But its more Hitchcockian in pace, than say a slasher flick. Could be ideal if you have a date that's really into that kind of flick.Otherwise, its an incredibly well executed, but overly long Twilight Zone episode. I don't agree with the Fight Club plagiarism accusations. I loved Fight Club; you can pick out one or two details, but its totally different movie. Memento was more confusing than Machinist. Really, the style theft was Twilight Zone. (Its a damn shame none of the sequels could match this movie.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reviewers on here who are making the comments that this is "the same movie as Fight Club" are missing the point of The Machinist, and Fight Club at that. The point here isn't about "who is Ivan?" or "who is sneaking into Trevor's apartment?" This movie does a fantastic job of passing the fragility of this man, hanging on to his last thread of sanity, on to the audience. the use of blues and grays in the photography lets the audience see the world through Trevor's sleep-deprived eyes. we are not supposed to know what's going on for the first hour, neither does Trevor. Beautiful work by Bale(possibly his finest yet). though some may argue that his weight loss for the film was unnecessary and detracted from his performance, it really does take the viewer out of their comfort zone and is a constant reminder of just how shaky the character's grip on both life and sanity are. Fantastic use of silence and accent music, as opposed to a soundtrack, fits the tone of the film incredibly well. don't check this out expecting to be scared, or told a story. if you are ready to step outside the comfort of your own world, and into the mind of a man fading into insanity, give this one a look-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Mystery-Thriller, awesome performance by Bale, but conservative plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who have seen Memento, Fight Club, Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway will probably not be as thrilled by "The Machinist" as others. At least that was how i felt. The main advantage of this film is definitely Christian Bale's brilliant performance, that even outshines method-acting performances of Robert De Niro. Besides his dramatic weight loss, Bale marvelously shows the machinist's development into mental and physical illness. Bales countenance and gesture brilliantly illustrate the machinist's insanity. But the rest of the film is not more original than other lately released psychological thrillers. The cold and mysterious atmosphere is very well pictured, but one doesn't get rid of the thought that you have seen this on several Lynch films before. The gray and dark colors of the film work perfectly as a stylistic feature, but the whole atmosphere inevitably reminds you of films like memento or fight club.The denouement at the end of the film is also a bit disappointing, I thought that the twist at the end had to be something special if this film wanted to be silhouetted against other mystery films, but then it was approximately what i had figured out before. Skilled movie watchers won't be having too big problems with figuring it out.But simply because its stylistic and plot similarities to Lynch or Fincher films, it can also be exciting for mystery fans to watch a movie with such a suspenseful atmosphere and try to figure out the twist before the end.Nevertheless is "The Machinist" a thrilling and atmospherically good Mystery Film with an absolutely worth seeing performance by Christian Bale!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is similar to surreal Memento and Pi movies. But if you liked Memento or Pi you will be very disappointed with Machinist. Movie is just plain boring, predictive and there are no big surprises. Things happen very slowly and it takes nearly half one hour for anything interesting to happen. Another mistake in Machinist is that there were not enough material telling what the main character was thinking (when compared to Pi and Memento). So you cannot fully understand mental state and actions of main character. I was also able to guess the ending/explanation beforehand.I recommend this to those how haven't seen Memento and/or Pi and cannot choose to see either of them instead of this mediocre copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting, the directing, the story and the mood were exceptional.One commenter correctly mentioned the analogy to Crime and Punishment and the subject of guilt. The book Reznik was reading when he dozed off (short sleep?) for a moment on the couch in front of the TV was another Dostoyevsky work, "The Idiot." If memory serves, the first name of the main character in The Idiot is Ivan, the name of Reznik's tormentor.The Idiot is also about guilt. Prince Myshkin is a Christ-figure (not my favorite "philosopher). Myshkin has a a pervasive sense of guilt and a need to suffer. Unlike Reznick, Myshkin's guilt springs from mere intentions, repressed aggressive impulses. I am enamored of everything Jennefer Jason Leigh does so that may affect my positive reaction.Larry Hochman</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will have to watch this film again.It was good, but not excellent. But i am going to have to re-view it in order to catch what i missed the first time round.Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) starts the film by being caught trying to dispose of a body, and the film then jumps back on the timeline and we discover what happened prior to this event.It was quite horrible to see the extent that Mr Bale had gone with his weight lose in order to appear in this film. He is alleged to have eaten only a can of tuna and an apple each day for some time and managed to loose 60+ pounds.Mr Bale's dedication to the character is self evident, and not just through this willingness to alter his physical appearance so significantly.The whole film is quite dark both in plot but also in style. The film is filmed in low light with drained colours, but this adds to the atmosphere.Unfortunately the basic theme of the plot is nothing new; A confused mix of scenes both real and not so real, with the connectors and clarification only becoming evident near the end of the film. The Usual Suspects revisited.Worth watching, but Don't read ANY reviews beforehand. Although you probably need to see it more than once, a spoiler could ruin the first viewing and therefore the whole film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting concept that plays out rather ordinarily. The explanation is simple and easily deduced, if one is paying attention. For all its moodiness, atmosphere and seemingly falsely created tension, the tale is straightforward while trying to be Kafkaesque and in achieving a Rod Sterling/Twilight Zone type appeal. The film fails miserably in both of its attempts and at 102 minutes, the denouement feels prolonged as if the director did not trust to have a tighter round tale. How far more effective it might have been had it been shortened and the recurring man in the red car (so sophomorish)had made only one or two appearances throughout. A sure give away sign that things are not what they seem.Bale has proven himself adept at roles such as this and it is his very gauntness that lingers after the film has ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can hope for good films. When preparing for the journey, one communicates with one's self about what to expect. If the construction is like this, a "puzzle film," then the conversation continues through the film as it sustains two souls watching. Often, those souls can be sent down parallel paths in so-called narrative folds.But sometimes, one of those souls jumps out of the path determined by the writer and "solves the puzzle" in ways never imagined before the encounter. That happened to one of me in watching this. The determined solution is intended to be rather Russian: a tool operator is fishing with his buddy, is tired on the way home. At 1:30 pm he kills a child crossing the street and runs away. We meet him a year later when he is fully split, having not slept or eaten much that entire year. The art here is in how his interaction with his second self is mapped onto the telling of the story: with parallel mothers, wives, children, cars arms and fish. There is a situational confusion that the film harmonizes by collapsing selves. Unfortunately, the puzzle is too rich for this simple solution, and an attentive watcher splits and finds other more rewarding interpretations.The one my other self prefers is: a factory worker named Reynolds goes fishing with a coworker. That coworker, Reznik, has serious mental problems and projects them onto his relationship with Reynolds. Reynolds has previously been traumatized by an industrial accident damaging his arm. The two disturbed men argue, one trying to be the son of the other. Reznick is killed and dumped in the lake.On the way home in his flashy car, disturbed Reynolds has an accident and is thrown into a coma. We meet him after a year of being asleep, hallucinating himself into the emaciated body of the man he killed whose sleep he has stolen. This dream world is cornered in four directions by women: whore, mother, companion, nourisher. Reynolds dies without waking, but only after he has "confessed" and redeemed himself. This is hard for us to see because we have been introduced to Resnik as a real human. Does he succeed? My other me says yes.JJ Leigh is again the prostitute/movie viewer.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoilers ahead* In spite of a committed and interesting performance from Christian Bale, and striking cinemaphotography, this was poor stuff. The premise - man haunted by a figure representing his own guilt - is familiar fare. Not a necessarily a bad thing, because a familiar premise can mean that the film contains a powerful idea worth re-exploring, but I feel the director and/or writer made a bad choice by trying to make the central character's predicament a mystery.It might have made a well-shot, well acted, and even moving mood piece about the impact of guilt and the importance of atonement if we'd been shown the reason for Bale's guilt upfront (cf. Crime and Punishment, and the numerous other spurious Dostoyevsky references that littered the film in a sixth form attempt to make it appear 'more cleverer' than it actually was), but the forced and unconvincing attempt to warp the story into a suspenseful mystery made it seem like a grossly overstretched episode of the Twilight Zone. And I like The Twilight Zone.By halfway point, Bale's character was completing the word of the hangman game on his fridge with M O T H E R, and I was silently screaming 'no, it's K I L L E R, and that's you, f*ckwit' and wishing I could fast-forward.Shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant moody trip through a damaged mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of Christian Bale's most memorable performances. I have read that he lost nearly 70 pounds for the role, which is an astonishing amount of weight and supposedly the most that any actor has deliberately lost for any role in a movie in film history. His appearance is frightening in itself, with his protruding bones and sunken eyes, he inhabits the role of a man struggling with severe insomnia and an increasing array of other problems. He has a job as a machinist and it is not pleasant work. It's repetitive and dark and boring, and he tends not to get along with his colleagues so well. He seems a little out of place, even a little confused by his surroundings, and becomes increasingly distracted by various strange occurrences.I love that Bale's character's name is Trevor Reznik, named after Trent Reznor, the singer of Nine Inch Nails, one of my favorite bands. I hear that they were sought after to do the soundtrack but they decided not to go in that direction with the movie. It's too bad, too, because Nine Inch Nails could not possibly do anything bad to a movie like this. There is an intense scene in the film where Trevor is giving a 'hand' to a co-worker named Miller, when he gets distracted and bumps into a power button, activating a machine which then won't stop, and Miller loses an arm at the elbow. It's a grisly, painful scene to watch, and it is a major turning point in the movie and Trevor' life.Later, Miller is able to make feeble attempts to joke about the accident, apparently trying to make some light of the subject while at the same time barely covering his mixture of anger at Trevor's catastrophic carelessness and shock at how quickly his body and his life were forever changed. Trevor, on the other hand, is tremendously upset at the accident, and becomes increasingly irrational and angry as time goes on, as he tries to figure out what happened. There is a man named Ivan who works with Trevor, and for a variety of reasons they get to know each other. Ivan once suffered an injury at the workplace and lost some fingers, which were then replaced with some of his toes, resulting in one of the most grotesque things you may ever have seen organically attached to a human hand. It is truly disgusting. Things start to get weird for Trevor when he discovers that he is the only person who knows of any Ivan that works there.The idea of a character getting to know someone and then discovering that that person doesn't really exist is nothing new, but here it prevents us from having any idea where the movie is going. I think it's safe to assume that a lot of what is happening is happening in Trevor's head, but more importantly, it is a fascinating trip through the moody blue atmosphere of Trevor's sleep-deprived mind. For a temporary escape from his lifeless life, he looks to Stevie, a prostitute who gives him much more than sex, she gives him an understanding that he can't seem to get anywhere else. Jennifer Jason Leigh is surprisingly effective in this role, and she is able to very clearly portray Stevie's understanding of Trevor, as well as the emergence of their mutual need that goes far beyond just being physical. If there are any slow points in the movie, they are easily glossed over by the interest generated by Trevor's deteriorating condition. Something terrible has happened to him in the past, or continues happening, and the movie shows us his own efforts to figure it out, put everything back in order, and finally get some sleep. The end of the movie will disappoint some viewers, but like so many other great films, it doesn't tie everything up in a nice little bow. It leaves you thinking, and demands a second viewing. Note: According to the IMDb trivia page for the movie, Scott Kosar wrote the screenplay for this movie right out of film school, which would mean that, when he wrote the script for the 2003 Texas Chainsaw remake the year before, he was still a student. This may provide some reason for why that movie was so astonishingly bad. Director Brad Anderson, on the other hand, also wrote and directed a brilliant horror film a few years ago called Session 9, which I also highly recommend?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great ode to the classic days of Polanski and Repulsion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great film, albeit a little predictable. Christian Bale is brilliant in this film, his abhorrent weight loss is the most disturbing aspect. The film follows an insomniac, Trevor Reznik, and the paranoid mystery that plagues him. After a horrific work related accident, due to the sudden appearance of a mysterious stranger, Resnik is thrown into a spiral slide to either madness, truth or both. This film is not particularly original, but it does have a soul, at times it is painfully predictable, at other times, terrifying because of it's unpredictability. It won't go down as a classic of the genre, but is instead a nice rental. Recommended!</fullReview>

Didn't anyone of the whole production ever think "I think I've seen it already somewhere..." ? OK... It's not a "1" because it's well made, acted and even well directed, but as soon as Ivan gets into the movie I realized that this story was something that I had already seen somewhere. Ten minutes later I confirmed my fears. I really can't believe that this movie has been made. If no one realized it, I can't believe it because Fight Club is very well known. If they did realize, it's straight cheating. 90 wasted minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent and captivating film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an interesting study in the progression of insanity. The guilt of causing an industrial accident makes main character Trevor Reznik's already unstable mind turn to paranoia. As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that the cause of his mental state goes further into the past than this traumatic event. It becomes more and more evident that some aspects of Trevor's life will turn out to be in his mind, before his mental deterioration draws to its inevitable conclusion.With an excellent performance from Christian Bale as Trevor, this is definitely a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Similar To Mulholland Drive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a BRILLIANT movie !! One of the reasons why I loved this move was because, to me, it was so reminiscent of Mulholland Drive (one of my all-time favorite movies). The parallels are obvious ...In both movies, the majority of the movie was a surreal dream-scape that gradually unraveled. The main character in both movies (Trevor in the Machinist and Betty/Diane in Mulholland Drive) developed this dream-scape due to guilt and denial of a horrible act, which only gets revealed at the end of the movie.In both movies, some of the real-life characters in the life of the main actor assume alternative personas in the "dream-scape". Both movies also had odd imaginary characters (in Mulholland Drive you had a whole parade of strange characters, in the Machinist you mainly had the creepy Ivan - very effectively played by John Sharian).Both movies (Roque Ba?os in The Machinist, Angelo Badalamenti in Mulholland Drive) contained an extremely effective and creepy musical score, although they were quite distinct from each other.Finally, the main character (Christian Bale, Naomi Watts) in these movies showed extraordinary range in their acting talents.Of course, there are some obvious differences as well, both of these films are quite unique. And, as many have mentioned, there are some obvious parallels with other movies such as Memento.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mechanical references to Dostoyevski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist contains a constant stream of references to Dostoyevski: The books on the table, the landlord, signs on walls, name of the main character. But they are so direct that there is no greater cinematic effect as a result. More interesting is the copying of the form of Crime and Punishment, giving away the killer in the beginning but not the process. But as Dostoyevski is the inventor of the novel it doesn't necessarily guarantee a great movie.The double character-trick that made Fight Club such a surprise is once again used. Well portrayed is the psychological mindset of the main character that translates in the blurring of the line between reality and imagination.Art-house movies often suffer from the misunderstanding that a slow pacing in itself guarantees a better movie, but that's only the case if there is interesting camera-work involved or a complicated, multi-layered storyline. Not so here. It's even overexplanatory: For example it would be a nice ending to stop at the double-reporting of the hit-and-run, but it goes on to explain that Trevor can now sleep again; When the fish falls out of the fridge we immediately see the photo as if we can not use our own imagination.Dostoyevski-lovers should certainly check out the Brazilian movie Nina that has more imaginative and visual storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long, Boring and Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've decided to watch this flick with my girlfriend due to the rather high rating it had (IMDb 7.6 out of 10).Both I and her were quite disappointed with the movie. Although only an hour and a half long, I had the impression it was at least 2 hours long, during which I was occasionally thinking when will the point of the movie finally arrive.When it finally did, I was far from being surprised or shocked, and actually part of the point was pretty obvious to me throughout most of the movie.To sum up, I consider watching this movie as a waste of time. I find the movie to be quite uninteresting, boring and pointless. I also find this movie to be too long (depite the rather standard runtime). I feel like the same story could have been told in half the time. In contrast, I could easily watch the extended version of "The Return of the King" (almost 4 hours long) without feeling the movie is long.The only good thing about this movie is Christian Bale's act, which is very good and convincing. It's a pity that he has chosen such a terrible film to act in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>almost in spite of, or despite, the shabby been-there-done-that script, and a near gimmick of weight loss, Bale makes it watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist is kind of like intellectual counterfeit money, and with a few twists meant to keep some interested and some keeping far as possible away. The more one thinks about the Machinist, the more it's irksome by the cluttered screenplay (Scott Kosar, with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Amityville Horror remakes to his credit), which reveals no surprise, or much suspense, in the mental downfall of one-year insomniac Trevor Reznik (mega-gaunt Christian Bale, even more-so than in the recent, more worthy cause Rescue Dawn) as he keeps seeing a portly bald guy named Ivan who may or may not work at the factory he's a machinist at, and may or may not be dating a prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh), AND who may or may not have taken a little boy Trevor sort of knows as hostage.By the time the obvious twist comes along- the kind that my girlfriend points out about a third of the way through the movie, aw-hell!- there's a feeling of being cheated from the smug retread of better post-modern psycho-twister fables (i.e. Fight Club). That Kosar does 'clever' tricks like putting in Dostoyevsky hints, without ever making much light about why they're there, compounds some of the BS. It's a shame, too, because he sometimes gives these characters some believable dialog (mostly with the machinists and in some of Reznik's talk), without trying to take into account a conceit that is used: an insomniac for a year is, practically, not possible, hence there has to be a catch at some point or another. It's almost like a battle that wages on the creative side of things between director Anderson's very good compositions and (typical-for-this-stuff) lighting, and the script.Meanwhile, Bale holds up, even if after the fact it's a wonder why he went to such extreme lengths for a character like this (i.e. would losing 40 pounds be any different than the whole 60). Bale remains totally captivating, immersing as always in service of the character like the most method m-fer since De Niro, though in the reverse here. Because it is such an extreme transformation- unlike the more gradual turn in Herzog's film- we're called attention to it at times, which is unnerving, and works to a much greater effect as a sign of his deterioration than that of the script providing the mental faculties. But Bale does his best to fill in some emotional blanks, and to his credit makes the Machinist at least a passable effort. That being said, it's hard for me to see myself watching this all the way through again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Machinist" is the sort of movie where not only are you surprised that it came from Spain, but you feel influences from other directors. Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) is an emaciated engineer whose life is upset when a new man comes to work at his factory. What secrets does this new man hide, and how do they relate to Trevor? The movie unfolds like an Ira Levin novel: everything seems normal at first, but then something doesn't seem right, and then there's the revelation of the horrible truth. There's also a hint of Hitchcock, with the numerous references to certain things. In this case, it's the two meanings of the word "sinister": Trevor keeps turning left, and evil things keep happening. All in all, you just might start doubting your own sanity after seeing this movie.So I understand that this was a Spanish movie, but everything about it seemed American.

		<shortDescription>The payoff is not half a good as the promise the premise makes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Machinist is one of those classic stories in which a man goes out on a quest to solve a troubling mystery that ultimately leads right back to himself," says director Brad Anderson. Mix Memento and Insomnia with The Tenant and The American Friend and you will have some notion of a dark brew of a film that has more calories than nutrition, whose payoff is not half a good as the promise the premise makes.Trevor (Christian Bale) is a gaunt (Bale lost 60 pounds, down to 121), sleepless machinist whose life is unraveling even faster after his inadvertent responsibility for an industrial accident. Because he hasn't slept in a year and his refrigerator oozes blood, it's fairly certain his mind is on its own trip. As the story progresses, he becomes more disoriented while the film slips from extreme psychodrama to middling thriller and then relatively nothing in the end.Bale's publicity for losing the pounds (the women in the film tell him, ''If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist'') can be compared to De Nero's gain For Raging Bull and CharlizeTheron's makeover for Monster, but in Bale's case not a positive since his role is not as rich as the other two's.The women in the story have been given the memorable roles: Jennifer Jason Leigh as the hooker girlfriend, Stevie, has perfected the heart of gold thing; Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) a late-night waitress, is a naturally sympathetic beauty who takes a shine to him: "You're lonely," she tells Trevor. "When you work graveyard shift as long as I have, you get to know the type." We do get to know his type of psychotic from films, but only his demons (There's a fun house named Route 666!) have any real interest. He remains for me only a malnourished neurotic with guilt to satisfy the most demanding Catholic bishop."If you were any thinner," Stevie tells him, "you wouldn't exist." If the story were any thinner, it would be machine-gunned to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's like they took A Beautiful Mind, scribbled out the title on the DVD, and wrote The Machinist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw The Machinist, if you asked me what the most predictable/pointless movie I have ever seen was, I'd most likely say A Beautiful Mind. Now that I have seen The Machinist, it easily takes that #1 most predictable, cliché, pointless rank because it IS?no one can argue this, it IS?A Beautiful Mind with a little less cheese, a little better lighting. To top it off, A Beautiful Mind was cliché and predictable when it came out, but The Machinist came out AFTER it.According to cheap Hollywood, the detention of "physiological thriller" is as follows: a movie with a main character who has some sort of mental disability (but is smart), and then "weird" things happen (which can be copy/pasted from episodes of The Twilight Zone if you have no idea how to be original) in his daily life, only to find out that everything weird was in his mind. For "daring" directors, this could include the use of a murder that the character thinks his imaginary friend committed, but it was really him. If you still cannot think of a plot for yourself, just take the script from movies like A Beautiful Mind, Fight Club, Sev7n, etc., and copy it wholesale and change the character's names. Also, as a side note, a physiological thriller cannot be based on anything but multiple personalities and/or pink elephants?anything more original than that means your film will be destroyed by the critics and it will be too intelligent for the audience to understand.The paragraph above also doubles as the plot for The Machinist. Normal life, weird (cliché) stuff happens, main character finds out it's all in his head, end of movie. Can people just get over it already? If you didn't find The Machinist predictable and understand every "twist" before they were revealed, walking down the street to get a cup of coffee must be insanely surprising to you.On a technical level, the film was flawless. Great atmosphere and directing. Pretty good acting from Christian Bale, and far superior to the acting in the films this movie rips-off. That's the only thing I can complement.The movie itself moves along at the slowest pace humanly possible. Boring daily life has never seen so much screen time. To call The Machinist boring is an understatement. I personally fell asleep around the middle of it and when I woke up I simply could not finish it until the next day. Nothing was happening, and in the end, nothing happens. There was not a single thrilling moment in the movie, no matter how much the raised volume of the annoying classical score wants to suggest.Some people are trying to say the film is great because of the moral value the ending suggests, but, really, it is nothing special or life changing. I can see a lot of people not even noticing that it tries to be moral with a positive ending.The Machinist in the end is a waste of time. I wanted so badly to like this movie, and I did for the first hour or so?up until it turned to the most cliché movie I have ever personally seen. The movie would have benefited so much if it kept the same beginning, same ending, but just got rid of the clichéd "mystery" that was no more mysterious than an episode of Scooby Doo. The Machinist is a copy of a copy. Maybe I'm the only one out there who is sick of movies like this, but, I'm sorry to say, this was pathetic.1/10</fullReview>

I mean, how often do you see an actor you know (Christian Bale) drop mega-pounds and wind up playing 122-pound man who is literally skin-and-bones? His next film had him as a buffed-up Batman. Go figure. Actors are a strange lot.This film is fascinating because of Bale and the involving storyline. You just HAVE to find out what this is all about, especially one strange character, once you start viewing. And, without giving anything away, the ending was outstanding, message-wise.The bad news is the aforementioned sordidness, particularly exhibited by the scummiest actress of her generation, Jennifer Jason Leigh, who once again plays a foul-mouthed, low-morals character. At least she's consistent in her roles. Listening to her, the other profane characters and looking at the grotesque face and figure of the emaciated Bale, are not easy to take. Be forewarned. He ain't pretty to view. He has to be the poster boy for anorexia.Yet, the film is still fascinating, well-photographed and certainly a unique story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How's it hangin', Travis? I mean Trevor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intriguing yet ultimately unsatisfying film that seems to have been made by a copycat movie fan rather than a real filmmaker. It all seems oddly familiar -- from the disturbed, sleep-deprived young man staring into his coffee cup ("Taxi Driver") to the Bernard Hermann-style score ("Taxi Driver") ("Psycho"). Many of the scenes -- even the shots themselves -- seem to have been stolen from other, better, films ("Taxi Driver) ("Psycho") ("The Tenant"). Locker room reprises cafeteria ("Taxi Driver"). Strange solitary guy crossing parking lot to car recalls strange young guy crossing train tracks to apartment ("Eraserhead"). And check out the closeup of a hand grabbing a shower curtain ("Psycho")! But far worse than any of the plagiarized visuals is the plagiarized main character. Trevor Reznik -- a quiet loner who can't sleep and lives in a crappy apartment (sound familiar?) -- is such a carbon copy of Travis Bickle ("Taxi Driver") I wondered as I watched it whether Paul Schrader or Martin Scorsese were considering legal action. The name "Trevor Reznik" even has the same number of letters as "Travis Bickle." Wait, don't tell me -- it's an "homage," right? (anything by Tarantino). The bleach bypass look ("Minority Report") ("21 Grams") makes for some interesting cinematography, and Christian Bale is worth checking out in almost any film. But ultimately nothing can save this dreary, convoluted mess for one simple reason: the main character is not sympathetic, and finally not worth our time or emotional investment.Even though Trevor is stolen from other movies ("Taxi Driver") ("Eraserhead") ("Repulsion"), he's missing some of the most important qualities that made those characters intriguing. We all know it's difficult to get an audience to cheer for a sullen, self-destructive character; we also know there will never be another Robert DeNiro ("Taxi Driver") or Anthony Perkins ("Psycho"). But doing a radical reverse weight-gain ("Raging Bull") just for the sake of shock is not the answer! The ironic result of this Method experiment gone awry is that Trevor is not only unlikable, he's physically repulsive -- and pushes us away rather than drawing us in.The secret to Travis Bickle was that he was essentially a child; his simplicity made him endearing. By the time he turned psychotic, we still loved him -- the way any parent would still worry about their disturbed son or daughter. Travis was also good-looking, had an interesting philosophy of life, and occasionally smiled. But Trevor is something else. He's someone we rarely identify with, someone we have little reason to care about (his bantering with the friendly waitress is the only time we come remotely close to warming up to him, but even then, it's all for nothing; unlike Travis, Trevor has no apparent designs on a woman, and therefore no goal or apparent desire -- she makes the first move, making Trevor passive rather than active. Bad story construction, bad character building!) For these reasons, the audience is never really given an entry point into the character. We may pity him, but we don't really care about him (the director obviously didn't understand this, and emphasizes the physical grotesqueness rather than trimming it down -- which is what a real filmmaker -- as opposed to an amateur trying to shock -- would have done in the editing room). Sure, we're horrified by his emaciated appearance, and it's sad and everything, but it's also over ("Night and Fog").On top of the physical problems, Bale's wild-eyed, Manson-like outbursts are so overblown and psychotic that we eventually side with the hooker who rejects him -- the exact opposite of what Scorsese so skillfully created with Cybill Shepherd's character, Betsy ("Taxi Driver"). And perhaps the only thing worse than being forced to watch physical deformities is being forced to watch limbs being severed by industrial machines. So naturally the director throws this at us, too, and for no apparent reason -- just more shock value (it ends up having nothing to do with the real story).Oddly enough, Trevor's physical abnormality has very little to do with the story, either -- it's basically just window dressing. It's not like Bale lost 60 pounds to shoot a sequel to "Philadelphia;" it's not like the script was about someone starving to death. And from what I've read, Bale wanted to lose another ten pounds. Thank God someone stopped him! He'd probably be dead by now. And for what?! A third rate independent art house flick that most people won't see anyway?The unfortunate truth is that this little picture won't even generate a footnote in the film thriller/horror history books. Like a gnat buzzing around the great bodies of work of Hitchcock, Scorsese, Polanski and Lynch, it will quickly vanish into obscurity, receive zero Academy Award nominations this year (despite, or rather because of Bale's 60- pound weight loss), and that will be the end of it ("The Machinist").Better luck next time, Brad. And Christian -- next time you decide to risk life and limb for your art, maybe you should find a better script -- and a director who's moved beyond first-year film school mentality!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow slipping under the radar ? possibly because it was made in Spain ? THE MACHINIST is probably the best film of 2004, certainly beating the heck out of every other film I've seen from that year as yet. To say too much would be to spoil the proceedings, so I'll keep it simple by saying that this movie is one of the most original, inventive and, yes, moving that I've seen in an age. The movie unfolds at a slow pace which never really speeds up, but the strength lies in the character build-up of Trevor Reznik, a fully flawed and believable human being. It's a movie hard to classify, bearing similarities to MEMENTO but again, being very different in scope and storyline.There are certainly frightening, gruesome moments to this movie but neither is it a horror movie: instead it's a creepy psychological thriller with some superb acting from Christian Bale, who is at his best when cast as tormented anti-heroes. Bale ? whose weight loss for the film is extremely disturbing in itself ? appears an emaciated skeleton and the viewer gets to watch as his mind slowly unhinges. Why didn't the guy get an Oscar for this acting? He beats the heck out of anything Russell Crowe has done?the other cast members also give human performances, from Jennifer Jason Leigh's hooker-with-a-heart to Michael Ironside's industrial worker, once again continuing in tradition by losing a limb in this film. The exception is the demonic performance given by John Sharian, a kind of doppelganger/nemesis for Reznik, who's just plain weird. Still, THE MACHINIST is a flawless piece of cinema which has a brilliant twist and something very, very true to say about the human condition.</fullReview>

He puts up post-it notes as reminders. He spends time at an airport diner where single mom waitress Maria works the graveyard shift. He is haunted by menacing new worker Ivan or maybe he's not even real. His carelessness cause Miller (Michael Ironside) to lose an arm at work. Then a game of hangman appear on post-its on his fridge.Two things stand out in this movie. The bleak neverworld existence and Christian Bale's emaciated body are both shocking. The dark moody feel exists even in the bright daylight. The colors are washed out and there is a grinding darkness about the movie. Director Brad Anderson is unrelenting although I don't think the reveal is perfect. The paranoia is so disjointed that a lot of it feels random. The reveal would work much better if the movie is sets up with more logic and orderly storytelling. The best twist endings are ones that everybody thinks they could guess at but nobody actually does. There are simply no clues to the final reveal. Christian Bale's body is horrific and shocking. I'm not going to reward this obsessive weight loss but it is insane.</fullReview>

The Machinist concentrates on the psychological aspect of Bale's character in a way that the viewer can almost experience his decline. Not many films have successfully portrayed this type of character particularly in such an entertaining way.Although the character has been described as unlikable or repulsive, I found him to be human and as such had no judgement.The Machinist appears to moves at a medium pace and is thoroughly enjoyable. There are some obvious nods to Hitchcock's Psycho, and also to famous literature (of which I am not familiar). I did not think that these links were necessary and believe that they detract very slightly from the movie itself. Also instead of spelling out certain elements of the plot, the film could have benefited by a little ambiguity. The Machinist keeps its audience on its seat from its great pace and use of suspense. The visuals are equally as stunning and the conclusion is really well written.</fullReview>

There is something about Jennifer that I really like and I think she should have been and still should be in many more movies, but good ones.So, there's this terribly skinny guy who lives in an almost film noir world, there is color but it's very muted. The music is strange (almost melodramatic) and definitely sets a mood. The whole film is weird, that mix of I wanna be noir and I wanna be David Lynch but it's neither. To me it's just out of place. If this were made in the 1940's to early 50's with a serious tone, it may have worked. The story isn't strong enough for the films style or its weirdness and certainly does not justify anyone dieting themselves down to a near corpse. I guess if they gave Oscars for best skinny Bale would have blown 'em away but...The point of Bale's weight loss is his character's attempt to vanish, to not be the person who he is which turns out to be a killer, hit and run in a red 69 Camaro. I forgot to mention that he's an insomniac who hasn't slept for a year. That plus a guilty conscious makes for a very paranoid delusional life. Finally he takes the exit on route 666 and confesses his sins to the police, he's wearing a tee shirt that I believe reads, "Justice Brothers." Yep. I mean I dunno, was that supposed to be heavy, deep? This film did not in any way, shape or form do it for me. It lacked any real substance and I bet Christian just gains it all back anyway, fatty. That last part was humor. Yes, I know he's not fat, at least until a script comes up needing a very very fat man... Jennifer Jason Leigh, we need you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has some good points but has no original ideas and is fully predictable, if you're not new in relation to the cinema, you'll find all after 20 minutes. After the first 20 minutes, almost everything that happened in the movie reminded me of "A Beautiful Mind" of Ron Howard, but first I have to confess that I knew nothing about what was going on and even the first twenty minutes excited me and i thought it'd be a very good movie. After that, the film just fell down, the only good things we can highlight is the soundtrack, which is unique and the atmosphere of loneliness and sadness of the film (by the way, the fact that Christian Bale be thin here helped a lot). Christian Bale saved the film, he is a great actor and here, even VERY thin he he made a great interpretation. The director didn't do a great job, but we can't found holes in the plot and although not original, the film is clear in what tries to present. The Machinist is a weak movie, not original and not recommended.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mesmerizing performance by Bale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Machinist" is a bleak, psychological and deeply disturbing piece constructed by director Brad Anderson that examines raw terror which lives inside every man. Bale's physical transformation for the role is unreal--he lost 63 pounds. In addition to his radical physical transformation, he provides a marvelously terrifying performance as well. "The Machinist" is an expertly manipulated exercise in psychological horror, as it reveals itself gradually, allowing us the pleasure of slowly putting the fragmented pieces together.Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) hasn't slept in a year. The shocking deterioration of his physical and mental health make his every waking moment as an unrelenting state of confusion and paranoia. He hallucinates and begins to have trouble discerning reality from fiction, and the story begs the question, "what is real, and what is not?" Neither Trevor nor the audience may answer until the final moments of the film. One man's struggle with his very essence -- living in a state of severe physical decline, confusion, uncertainty, and self-doubt -- represents a horror that supersedes all others."The Machinist" looks appropriately dreamy and visually detached from reality. The visuals are subtly hypnotic and the movie seems to reflect Trevor's life, which is devoid of certainty. It presents a surreal series of events surrounded by equally surreal imagery, but remaining ever-so-slightly planted in reality that adds a tremendous amount of doubt and confusion as to where the story is going. The film conveys a state of mind, and Bale does that with disturbing effectiveness. Bale offers a spellbinding and haunting performance from a mental and emotional perspective to his physical transformation as a tortured soul on the brink. Not until the very last moment do the pieces snap into a completed puzzle that's as tight as a steel trap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of film i assort by the psychological category. Its one awesome psychological and mysterious thriller. It has a wow-experience at its end. Its not a film for a shallow person for sure, you need some aging to watch this. Watch it and enjoy the ride.The coolest thing is that as i was on the web before people even knew it existed, i did a lot of Mirc chatting, you talked with random peeps for fun. None really knew who was behind that nickname. Before this film i actually chatted to Bale without knowing it. He mentioned being an actor that was gonna do this film actually, he mentioned the thumb dude and stuff, its actually for real that part. We talked random stuff then tactics about starvation and i knew well what that was. Summing it up i told him to eat something that is good for real, or you would throw it up by pure reflex. Cant eat the same thing 3 days tops a row or you will throw it up, unless its real good food. But we drew the conclusion that a can of tuna and some vitamin would do the trick, since he liked the apple it was chosen for vitamins. But remember telling him to drink water as the feeling of hunger leaves you and you feel exhausted, and that an apple is very sour to the belly so its not wise, but he said he loved apples so it was a good choice for him. Im speechless about that web meeting, its just so cool. I actually chatted to Bale and he actually listened to my wisdom that made him this skinny for this film. I first realized this as watching the interview with bale after making this film. Bale, i love you man.</fullReview>

His physical appearance was very disturbing. You could see bones popping out. His mental health was not much better. He was a very lonely man, disliked by people. I assume because they did not understand his situation, but still...very insecure...his apartment was awful too...dark, dingy, probably very cold &amp; damp as well..........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale flawlessly plays the role of Trevor reznick, a machinist who is withering away because he refuses to eat or sleep. It really messes with your head at some points but it has many Christian subliminal messages in it. i can not tell you about the Christian tones in this movie without spoiling the hole film for you, but if you are Christian i would watch it. Even the film poster shows that there are very subtle Christian references in it by putting a cross over Christian bales face on the movie poster! i would recommend this film to fans of Christian bale or fans of psychological drama films!

		<shortDescription>THE MACHINIST is/makes you sleepless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt like a 21st century revisit to my all-time favorite thriller film director Hitchcock's Psycho, Vertigo etc. Christian Bale was awesome in the film with a skinny appearance that puts you spellbound. He plays the lead character who suffers from insomnia. I found extremely disturbing seeing him in this state. I must credit the movie makers for the wonderful dark setting to the movie. The movie is so upsetting (because of tragic theme) so not recommended for the commercial movie goers and surly not for younger audiences. I loved the way the suspense unfolds at the movie end. Must admit that I watched it at night and was sleepless just like the machinist in this film, so be warned.I'd recommend the film to serious movie watchers who are interested to see a character development and appreciates the dark setting to a thriller movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the opening minutes, emaciated factory worker Christian Bale (as Trevor Reznik) apparently disposes of a lifeless body. In his apartment, Mr. Bale washes up with bleach. We assume Bale had something to do with a foul deed, but there is no forthcoming investigation. Later, this opening act is revealed to be a flashback. Bale enjoys eating chicken and pie, but seems to also be on a weight-loss binge. He claims to have been awake for a year ? perhaps this has caused his weight loss. At work, Bale becomes involved in a gruesome machine accident. He appears to have been distracted by newly hired machinist John Sharian (as Ivan), but none of Bale's co-workers have seen the heavyset man. For someone apparently near death from lack of sleep and food, Bale appears remarkably functional. He dates golden-hearted prostitute Jennifer Jason Leigh (as Stevie) and attractive airport waitress Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (as Marie)...With fine work from writer Scott Kosar and director Brad Anderson, "The Machinist" is intellectually engaging. A mostly Spanish crew assists Bale and Mr. Anderson skillfully. It's possible you may figure out much of what is going on; still, it is interesting to find the many patterns in story-telling, both real and imagined. There is a clear thesis and ending for those who appreciate clarity, but food for thought if you want to consider other possibilities. The obviously influential writer Dostoyevsky would approve. Unfortunately, the first and most obvious talking point is likely to be Bale's shockingly low weight ? he overplays the physicality of the role needlessly; his acting ability is certainly worth 10-20 pounds. Other notable strengths include stellar photography by Xavi Gimenez, moody music by Roque Banos, and the always foreboding Michael Ironside (as Miller). Remarkably, Mr. Ironside has not been told to stay away from sharp objects.******** The Machinist (1/18/04) Brad Anderson ~ Christian Bale, Jennifer Jason Leigh, John Sharian, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Anderson directed this psychological thriller that stars Christian Bale as Trevor Reznik, a young machinist in a factory who has an alarmingly(and increasingly) gaunt, withered appearance. Trevor claims to have insomnia, and not having slept for a year(!) He leaves notes around his apartment to keep track of his weight, and has a girlfriend/prostitute named Stevie(played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) who is remarkably patient with him. He is unpopular at work, and after an accident injures a co-worker, he realizes that the phantom figure he has been seeing called Ivan has something to do with it, though his obsession with an airport waitress and her child will lead him to a stunning realization... Christian Bale is magnificent, delivering a dedicated performance(he really did lose all that weight) that is remarkable. Despite his efforts though, film is fairly obvious, and anyone who has ever watched "The Twilight Zone" will likely figure it out. Still, worth watching once for Bale's astonishing talents.</fullReview>

He lost a loads of weight to portray a sleepless guy with some serious health issues and some mental instability..Psychological thrillers weird dreams and insomnia are the most interesting topics a movie can have..(if its not a comedy or something)Starts with a gloomy atmosphere and ends with another. But still what makes it worth your while is the face of bale looking like crap.. Must have been a hell of pressure and pain trying to loose THAT amount of weight just for a movie.. Talk about taking risks.. But it was still worth it because its one of the best movies he ever did.. The acting performance is superb even by the actors who play minor roles Coz the movie is basically about bale's character reznik.

		<fullReview>The Machinist is a well-crafted thriller with one of those usual(but well-done and surprising) twist endings. This low-budget movie is just worth watching for Christian Bale's performance alone as he totally transformed himself and lost sixty pounds for this role. Now that is commitment at it's finest. The overall look of the film is bleak and dismal with grayish colors. That is what we see because we view the world from the main character's eyes and we can effectively see his emotions and feelings through them.Brad Anderson's film is about a factory worker named Trevor who hasn't been asleep in over a year. He causes an accident at work due to a sighting of someone who no one else can see and from there, his life begins to unravel even more as his paranoia increases.As I mentioned above, Christian Bale is amazing. He takes a gritty role and brings it to a whole new level. I have never seen such dedication to a role as Bale did. This is one of those films where only one main actor is needed and Bale definitely came through.Overall, this is a tense thriller that clearly explains the negative effects of insomnia. I liked the ending as it really closed the film in a high note. However, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. I expected a 10/10 film based off what everyone told me but while this film is very good, it's not great. I admire all the craft that went into a low-budget film like this but I found it really slow at times. But it's still an above-average film. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wont spoil the twist, but this is one of the most fascinating scripts ever. Forget Bale and his amazing performance (even better then his in the Fighter or American Psycho, which were both absolutely amazing) and forget the weight he drops, he is just all around paranoid because he cant sleep for apparently a year. He must of meant a full sleep because you would die if you did not get any sleep for a year.Hallucinations, confusion, paranoia, all of this seems to cost him his friendship and job, making him a loner by nature.The twist to this film makes the movie.The film is dark and its compelling, very slow but not too slow. The movie makes so much more sense once you know why all the weird things in the flick are happening. Once you see the end I highly suggest you watch it a few more times and think hard about every line. This like the Sixth Sense leave you in awe on re-watches making you think, how did I not catch that.Amazing and one of my favourite films. Bales best performance</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Homage is such an inadequate term. If you truly love something, a person or a thing or an idea or an art form, you will strive to plant yourself in the rich soil from which it sprang, and strive to bring forth the same or even better fruit. This is how I try and view that thing that others call "homage" when they compare movies like this to Hitchcock. "The Machinist" is beyond Hitchcock, the same way that Lynch, Coppola and Tarantino are beyond Hitchcock and I don't think I can put it better than that. I became a Brad Anderson fan the instant I completed my first viewing of "Happy Accidents" nearly a decade ago on IFC. When you feed from the vast trough of U-S media, you remember and cherish the rare times that true brilliance races through you and past you in a great teleplay. I was enchanted by the way Anderson's tale of time travel, and longing and loss, and loneliness were all handled and resolved. The story pushed the boundaries of suspended-disbelief to new limits, yet via the artist's talent it landed from that great height like the greatest ballet dancer, gently on the tip of a single toe. Only the best of Chris Carter's "X Files" pull off this same outrageous fulfillment of the transaction between artist and patron with such power and grace. Happily, "The Machinist" while radically different from "Happy Accidents," is every bit the equal and superior of the best films to which it is compared. And I would go further and derive more comparisons, not to detract from the work but to celebrate its sublime balance and power. A previous commenter pointed out the bifurcation of reality, where the dreamworld pops in and out of Resnick's constant waking life. There were echoes of Lynch in the pause that occurs with each reach for the cigarette lighter, each look at the clock at 1:30, felt in the way that each pause evokes the deja-vu of dreams. There was Hitchcock homage in the sense of unending and unresolvable tension. You suspect a nod to Coppola (and Brando) as you look at Ivan and wonder to yourself what Colonel Kurtz would have done after the war, had he lived. And there is over all of it, the constant and obvious excellence of Christian Bale, doing what few if any others could ever do; fitting his every molecule to the role of Trevor Resnick. THAT sets this film apart and puts it where not many others will ever go. I cannot stress enough the importance of seeing this film, and unlike others who have said they probably won't endure it again, I will see it again and relish its greatness again.

		<fullReview>Trevor(Bale, giving an incredible performance, and showing true dedication to the craft by losing an unhealthy amount of weight), the titular machinist, hasn't slept for a year. Strange things start happening - at home(Post-It notes on the fridge inviting to a game of Hangman... who made them, and how?) and at work(what's with the new guy...?), and he tries to figure out what is going on, becoming increasingly determined to learn the truth. This is a taut, Hitchcockian psychological thriller(in part due to the Bernard Hermann-like score), with elements from Kafka(persecution, no one to turn to) and Lynch(seriously strange, haunting occurrences), as well. I did not care much for director Anderson's earlier effort Session 9(the only other thing by him I've watched), but his gutsy move to make this unrelentingly, overwhelmingly bleak in mood throughout(with no exception... they really took a chance, and you can see why Hollywood wouldn't produce it; and because of that, they painstakingly had to make Barcelona look like LA!) is uncommon, and it works perfectly for the film. This atmosphere genuinely evokes the feeling of insomnia, with gradual progression and pace(every so often erupting in high tension), not to mention that scene changes are sudden, like being woken from dozing off for too short a time. The plot is well-crafted, building to the satisfying and smart twist-ending, dropping clues and not pushing it with red herrings. All of the acting is solid. There is a lot of disturbing content, a moderate amount of strong language and a little sexuality, nudity and bloody, brutal violence in this. I recommend this to any fan of suspense and movies that keep them guessing - and thinking. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizingly excellent. An amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty disturbing and disorientating at times. The Machinist is pretty disturbing but compelling and mesmerised me throughout. John Sharian plays as Christian Bales "Tormentor" if you like. His character is particularly disturbing and brilliant. Bale is superb as an incredibly thin industrial machinist worker. He only weighed 8 stone, 9 lbs in this! There are 2 comments from women saying "If you'd be any thinner, you'd probably be dead" It's hard to believe he put on 109 lbs in the 2005 Movie Batman Begins! Christian Bale, whom plays as machinist Trevor Reznik has frequent hallucinations of Ivan (John Sharian). There is a disturbing incident involving Reznik and Miller (Michael Ironside) in the workplace. Reznik hallucinates and sees Ivan, who isn't actually visible to anyone else, and when eye contact is made between the two. Ivan does a disturbing gesture across his throat. Bale inadvertently catches a button with his back and Miller's arm becomes trapped on the conveyor belt. Bale can't stop, even with the emergency button. This results in deadly consequences with Miller having his arm amputated by the sharp blades on the machine. A chunk of his arm is shown spinning in the machine. This is IMO, the most brutal scene in the whole Movie. Bale catches Ivan on the road and yells "We need to talk!" Bale says "A guy lost his arm, he could have died!" Ivan replies "Thats not my problem. You caused the accident, not me." Bale later on ironically gets his arm trapped and blames Miller for the whole thing. Telling Miller it was all set up as a revenge plot on Reznik. Later on, Ivan takes Rezniks son to an empty building and when he finds Ivan in there, to Rezniks horror, he finds out Ivan killed him! Bale attacks Ivan and Ivan says "Where's you're hospitality partner?" You can't expect Reznik to be polite after what Ivan did to his son. Reznik attacks Ivan, who is armed with a knife and takes the knife off of Ivan by surprise. He violently slits his throat and goes to dump him in the sea rolled up in a piece of carpet. In the distance on the beach is a bald man resembling Ivan walking down the beach, with Ivan's motionless carcass in the carpet. Reznik throws the dead body into the sea, but to Trevor Reznik's horror, the body disappears like magic! The man behind him flashes his light on Reznik and utters: "Who are you?" Reznik is in sudden fear and is paralysed to the spot in disbelief. It's Ivan, and he's alive! And, not only is he still alive, there are no wound marks on his throat! Ivan then says: "Well, looks like you've got some explaining to do partner." And he chuckles like a maniac. Ivan gets his revenge by sending Reznik to prison and taunts him as he walks into prison. Reznik is left in a cell and the film ends. I like the eerie atmosphere giving it that horror and gloominess. It is one of those Movies that drags you in and has you glued to your seat. I highly recommend anyone to watch this, especially if your a Bale fan! Give it a watch! My rating: 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''The Machinist'' distributed by Paramount classics, 2004.The Machinist is a very dark, English language Spanish psychological thriller film that centers around a machinist named Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) who suffers from chronic insomnia. Trevor works as an industrial worker in a gloomy factory and after not sleeping for a year he's in terrible condition. One morning his supervisor, Tucker sends him to his boss' office to have a little talk and his boss asks him for a urine sample because they suspect he might be on drugs due to his horrid appearance and behavior. Trevor walks out on to the factory's parking lot with the cup and goes to have a cigarette in his car.When he is sort of dozing off in his car, he hears a voice. It's coming from a huge, bald man sitting in a car beside his. The man introduces himself as Ivan and says he's a new co-worker of his, picking up Reynolds' shift, saying that Reynolds was ''picked up'' by the feds because of an old warrant. Ivan is a mysterious, eerie looking fellow with a huge grin that never seems to leave his face. He's almost demonic in his appearance and his high-pitched voice and laughter is taunting.Trevor spends time with Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a sympathetic prostitute that he sees every now and then and she's very fond of him, in fact she's probably the only person he can actually trust or talk to. The guys at work have turned against him because of an incident that caused one of his co-workers, Miller to lose an arm and they don't want to interact with him because of his strange, paranoid behavior and dismiss him as a lunatic claiming he's ''lost it''. Every night, Trevor goes to a diner at an airport and talks to the kindhearted Maria (Aitana Sánchez-Gijon) who's a waitress there and always serves him black coffee and pie. When he's there the night before mother's day she suggests that he come to the amusement park with her and her son Nicholas. He says he'd really like that and they arrive there the following day. There's a scene where Trevor takes Nicholas on a grotesque horror-house ride called: ''Route 666'' after Nicholas' enthusiasm drags them there. The ride is terrifying and symbolic to the film's plot, even though I've seen people over-analyze it a bit, it is still a terrific scene with the kind of atmosphere where you just want to look away but still witness it like a kid seeing his first horror movie. I don't want to spoil too much in this review but this really is an excellent film, trademarked by it's theme of paranoia and guilt, poetic structure and it's creepy atmosphere similar to the work of Alfred Hitchcock and more recent filmmaker Gaspar Noé. It's also a good example of how insomnia can make you paranoid. There are a lot of references here to older films, mainly Hitchcock's like for ex. Vertigo and also a lot of Dostoevsky books are referenced in the movie; ''The Idiot'', ''The Brothers Karamazov'', ''Crime and Punishment and ''Notes from Underground''.Trevor is experiencing a hellish nightmare and the movie begs the question, is the nightmare eternal? The way the story is built up is a lot like something out of a Kafka novel, even the directing and environment that the characters live in, are all unseemly in way that Kafka would have imagined.Now I want to focus on the main parts here.Performances: 10/10. Christian Bale's performance is golden, I've always appreciated him as an actor but I think this is his best performance thus far. It's so sincere in a way that you begin to believe Trevor is a real person. The rest of the cast is rounded up well and the guy who plays Ivan, John Sharian is magnificent. Jennifer Jason Leigh is convincing portraying the role of a sympathetic prostitute and her character blends well with the script.Dialog: 10/10. It's surreal but sharp, It appears to have a red herring subplot on first viewing but if you watch it again you get all the double meaning messages that were going on through out the film. It's a fantastic script by Scott Kosar.Cinematography and directing: 9/10. While viewing it, it feels like your walking through a mist, first connecting with Trevor as an observer but then you join him on the ride to hell or salvation, who knows, it's a blur. Some is very Hitchcock-like for example when someone is driving their car (which actually occurs a lot in this movie) it has the feeling of early 50's cinema. Great angles are used to perfection and to say it's bleak or cheerless is an understatement.Fantastic film, the atmosphere is terrifying, breath-taking, obscure and appears unseemly. All the portrayals of these characters are vivid and complex. It fits well with the paranoia. It's a good mix of drama, thriller and mystery. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist is indeed one of the best psychological thrillers of the decade.The story revolves around an industrial worker,Christian Bale as Trevor Reznik,who is suffering from Insomnia and hasn't slept in a year.He is a bit eccentric in character and weird things are happening to him recently including Hallucination.Now in order to find what is going wrong with him he finds himself in a big trouble which is related to a Sin committed by him in the past.His dreadful past is haunting him but he is not aware of it.And the best thing is that you will get to know the secret only at the end of the film. This is no doubt Christian Bale's best performance as Trevor Reznik.He is even better in this film than The Dark Knight.If you are a Thriller movie fan then It will be a treat for you to watch.So friends sleep well after watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A predictable, engaging but dimly lit psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A piano and a few violins which sound like a cat is being savagely strangled is all you really need to make any situation feel as nerve racking as watching a woman parallel park into a tight spot and this movie exploits that fact very schemingly. All the way through its torture to your ears like someone is tickling your cochlear with a sulphuric acid soaked soldering iron.Basically this is a story of a guy who has insomnia but like everything else Hollywood it can't JUST be insomnia, you know the problem you just go to your family doctor about and take sleeping pills for, NO! He's had insomnia FOR A YEAR and its only when the film begins that he starts to lose his mind over it, seems like he was doing fine before that, just a bit freakishly skinny that's all (hold that thought). The movie is gripping and sticky right up until we meet Mr Ivan, he's a shinny, bald headed, squeaky squirrel voiced, irritating version of Tony Soprano (wow, lots of adjectives!) and from then on its pretty Mr predictable. Oh by the way did I mention his weird toe hand? The movie has your standard twists and turns but with a nifty and downright heartbreakingly evil use of a mundane everyday office item ? Mr post-it note, I will never look at him the same way again! And whilst I'm on the subject will someone please teach Trevor (played by Christian Bale by the way) how to play hangman! There are two moments in the movie when we actually have some technicolour and that happens to be both the times Jennifer Jason Leigh (who plays Stevie) is naked ? fine by me, but why does even a sunny day in the movie look like it was shot using a camera from the 1900s and not 2004? Back to skinny Mr Bale. I'm not really sure how him being as skinny as a 1980s anorexic HIV positive heroin user with a strange addiction to bleach (I don't think he really knows you can just use soap) adds to the storyline but it's really disgusting and pretty cool at the same time. I mean you know you shouldn't look, like when you see two dogs humping in the park but you still do! I, like everyone else who critiques this movie am amazed at how he did it but I guess it becomes a lot easier when you know a big fat cash injection will be coming your way for doing it but that aside "nuff props" to him for doing so (and that's me being cool).Overall, and I don't say this much so cherish it, a pretty good movie, engaging, interesting, dark and gross but unfortunately predictable even if you have just a tiny bit of movie know-how. A good performance by Christian Bale and we all know how generally a nice and bubbly guy he is ? especially to his DP. I'd almost say I'd recommend it ? wait; that's enough of me being nice I think I just swallowed some vomit whilst typing that last line so I'm going to stop there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man named Trevor has not slept for a year. He is deliriously tired. He inadvertently causes accidents at work, at a factory of unspecified sort. His only companion is a prostitute, and he is starting to see things.Not just mild hallucinations, either. He finds strange notes all over his apartment, and sees a strange coworker that no one else does. He begins to envision a vast conspiracy, one that everyone in his life is contributing to.So is the first act of 'The Machinist', a very interesting thriller to say the least. It is somewhat reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' in that much of what is obscured throughout is due to a severe mental condition. Trevor's symptoms are extreme to put it mildly.First off, Christian Bale's performance is outstanding. He looks terrible, moves like someone that hasn't slept in a year, and talks like one too. When he starts to lose his grip on sanity, his sudden and frightening reactions to what only he sees illustrates the true alienation from reality that this character is experiencing.The film's style is also very interesting. The color is very muted, as it is when one is sleep-deprived, and the editing is random and scattershot, using sometimes odd angles that serve to immerse the viewer inside Trevor's head. The film takes a few minutes to get used to, but when it's going, the viewer becomes entranced in not only the story, but the protagonist's mind as well.The story itself could have used some more originality in its conclusion, but I tell myself that a film is more about the journey than the destination. I suppose that is true, and the ending works, without really serving to shock or surprise.In the end, however, the film is very much worth watching for the experience of the film itself, much like Nolan's mind game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insomnia leads to madness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist,is a very strange and a very unique mystery movie.The movie starts with Trevor(Cristian Bale) rolling a body in the carpet and dumping it in the sea.Then suddenly the movie changes.And we can see that Trevor is facing Insomnia for the past one year.He starts imagining people and all.Due to an accident caused by Trevor a man looses his arm.That makes everyone in his work his enemies.His insomnia turns to madness,as he finds things written on his fridge.But what does it mean.And who is writing them all.He never sleeps and still feels nightmares.Cristian Bale gives a tremendous performance.So unique acting and he has mad himself so lean just for this movie.Thats his dedication.Rest of the casting is good.The movie keeps you guessing as Trevor continues to find the answers of his madness.Brilliantly directed and fantastic cinematography this movie is very rare.Strange though just like Memento,there it was amnesia here it is Insomnia.Truly Insomnia can drive anyone to madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepare to be psyched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught up with this movie last night, and I am still thinking about Christian Bale's performance continually. It will be difficult for me to think of him now, without thinking about Trevor Reznik, the character he played in this movie - such was his devotion. A full 10 stars to him for his acting and those long agonizing days he must have gone on without food to skin himself off, literally.Lighting and camera work is brilliant. Nothing wrong there. Entire movie has a greenish gray color to it that helps building up the confusion in the environment for the story to traverse. All actors have done well too. Jennifer Jason Leigh looks sexy as ever. Nothing really to complain about on technical grounds.However, following areas could have been worked upon slightly more. I just got a feeling the director ignored them for some reasons, perhaps out of indecisiveness about how much to scare the audience.1. There was way too much background music in the movie. The story really should have forced the audience to focus on each and every sound, such as footsteps, running water, blowing breeze, opening of door locks etc., and thus, let their wild imaginations run amok. Instead, I found the score somewhat distracting in some scenes. Psycho thrillers should let people build up the fear in their hearts themselves? There really are not required any external stimuli to produce the scare. I believe the human brain will do it itself if left alone in silence.2. The final revelation about the reality of Trevor Reznik was not as impressive as the build up to it was. Yeah, I let out a loud "Ahhh... now I get it", but really, it was only a sigh of relief after having landed upon the solution to a mystery that I had been struggling to solve for the previous 97 minutes. In other direct words, the truth wasn't really as impressive as the journey to it was.Other than these two areas, everything was just great. I just cannot stop praising Bale for this efforts in this movie, and probably never will.I take two stars off for the above two points, and assign this movie eight stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bale shows that he's one of the most dedicated actors of all-time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bale shows his determination at being a method-actor, in this delusional thriller by Brad Anderson, by losing a record-breaking sixty-three pounds (Bale wanted to lose more) in order to render the appearance of a man who hasn't slept in over a year. Trevor Reznik (Bale) is an industrial working insomniac whose grip on reality is slowly deteriorating and struggles to find answers to such mysterious events that begin to unravel in his everyday life: hangman post-it notes on his refrigerator, a new coworker named Ivan (Sharian) that seems to bring doubt every time he appears in Trevor's life, and a waitress (Sánchez-Gijón) who has befriended Trevor and also has a strikingly familiar relationship with her son Nicholas (Moore) that Trevor had with his mother. An overall original, interesting and thrilling film; with Anderson creating an uneasy mood of paranoia and distrust. The film tends to linger for a little while after it has made its point.***?

		<fullReview>I must say that the lenghts Christian Bale went to get into this character are amazing. In my opinion his best work. The movie goes from one bizarre incident to another without giving you a hint of what is coming, at times you think you have figured out the movie just to realize that a new chain of events branches out from it. The writer of this script in my opinion is a genius to come up with such a weird chain of events, don't know what kind of a person can write such a story. the actin is great, the movie is carried by Bale from beginning to end in Oscar deserving fashion.

		<shortDescription>An engrossing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts of with a very emaciated looking Bale and you know that you are in for a tour de force performance. And the amount of effort put up by bale for this role is extremely commendable. The supporting actors also have complemented pretty nicely. The protagonist Trevor lives a pretty basic but unusual life. He is lonely, pays his rent on time, washes hands with a bleach and his only human interaction outside his job is with a prostitute. The entire look of film, the washed out cinematography is extremely expressive, correctly portraying the message. The dialogue's are pretty decent and the direction reminds you of Hitchcock classics like Psycho. The stories link up pretty nicely at the end and till then the director creates enough tension to keep you riveted. The flaw for me was the editing could've been a bit more crisp by further 10 min. And while watching you cant help but compare it to Fight Club, Memento, and these movies define the thriller genre for me. So was a little disappointed. But still you cannot take anything away from Christian Bale. It's his movie throughout and he commands most of those 7 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Thriller which swept me off my feet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let the Spanish title not fool you, this movie is entirely in English, based in America but shot in Spain (It took great pains to make Barcelona look like an American City) The movie is about a Machinist(A worker who works on industrial machines) played by Bale who is also an insomniac (Apparently he has not slept for about a year). He spends his nights having sex with a prostitute cum friend or sipping coffee and eating pie in the airport canteen in the company of his favorite waitress. One day in the The place where he works, an accident occurs which changes his life and with the occurrence of a mysterious co-worker, his life becomes a living hell. The movie is a psychological thriller with noticeable similarities with cult classics like Fight Club and Memento. Yes, the non-linear style, dual personality blah blah. About the movie, it is fast paced and does not bore the viewer which is the necessity of a good thriller. The editing should be credited for this. About the acting, the entire movie was on the shoulders of one man - Christian Bale. And damn, he has excelled. Great actors are known for their complete dedication and focus for a movie. Examples given could be of Robert Deniro for Raging Bull who changed his physical appearance completely to look like a boxer etc. In this movie, Bale has lost considerable weight to get into the character who must have a visual impact on the viewer as a supposed freak. Hats off to Bale for his dedicationRating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trevor Reznik looks so bad, and at the same time, so pleased with some people, you may wonder if he is not actually satisfied with the lifestyle he has.The movie has a similarity with Memento and Identity as the connections with the past become important in the story. The music creates the right mystery atmosphere and Bale's gloomy appearance matches it.Christian Bale's character, so lonely, reminds me of Kevin Bacon's Walter in The Woodsman. They live their lives for just... that. Living, not a single interesting goal(OK, maybe just at the beginning). His skinniness is scary and will make you wonder how he managed to shoot the movie.REALLY NEAT and not so intricate. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Mood Experience of Grit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After not sleeping for an entire year, a machinist named Trevor (Christian Bale) begins having encounters with a strange man named Ivan. Ivan's presence causes him increasing trouble with his girlfriend and his employer, and as life unravels he is less and less sure what's real and what's not. Throw in a game of Hangman and a bleeding refrigerator and the story gets even more strange."The Machinist" has been called a mood piece, and I think this is a perfect description. The writer's love of Nine Inch Nails, mixed with director Brad Anderson's unique psychological themes (see his "Session 9" if you haven't)... and throw in references and parallels to the works of Dostoevsky... this film is deep, complex and edgy. Fans of "Seven" or "Fight Club" or "8MM" will love this one.Great supporting actors Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Ironside are here, but no one can deny the amazing work of Christian Bale. Bale gives his all when playing a role (whether as Patrick Bateman or Batman or any other number of roles), but it might be "The Machinist" where he gave his most extreme. Losing many pounds to play the role -- without even requested to by the director -- he became a sickly thin man living off of tuna and cigarettes. That's dedication.I don't know what more to say... deep psychological thriller, lots of subtle clues along the way... prostitution... this is just a dark tale. Well, more dirty than dark, but dark in its own way. I strongly suggest that anyone who hasn't seen this film make it a priority to get this one on their viewing list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly excellent Paranoid Psychological Thriller with a supreme Performance from Bale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was recommended to me by someone who bought this and thought it was excellent. I watched it and was immediately drawn into the film by the acting from Christian Bale and the moody atmosphere. When we first meet Bale's character he seems to be in a depressed mental state, and due to his wafer thin appearance and his difficulty remembering and sleeping he may be going over the edge. He starts to see and even speaks to a character called Ivan who claims to be a new employee at his factory, but no-one else has heard of him and insist he does not exist, he causes a severe accident at work and as a result is distrusted by his co-workers. Throughout the movie we see him being slowly tipped over the edge and descending into paranoia. The ending is excellent and reveals all with a fairly surprising climax.The movie is very well done with great acting. The only problem preventing me from buying it is that I am not really into dark depressing movies such as this. Don't get me wrong it is an excellent film with top drawer acting, just not the type of film that would entice me to watch it many times over. It is a little disturbing and not the sort of film I can enjoy in the traditional sense.Still I give it a very solid 7/10.</fullReview>

The two actresses are no less than hot?and I was glad that Mrs. Jason Leigh got a significant role in a very fine movie.Bale makes his role a triumph; it could of been only a curiosity, instead it is a triumph of good performing. Truly impressive performance, intense and convincing and sharp, of a very well written role which needed a mind?bending physical appearance; Bale has chosen to provide for it. The history of the cinema will record that Bale nearly killed himself, he atrociously starved himself to be able to do this character of blurred identity; well, artistically it merited. The movie is so exciting it defies every expectation.The category of 'heartbreaking eerie mystery thrillers' is one of our sources of true joy; the Bale movie honors this category.Do you know any other thrillers from the mentioned class?

		<fullReview>I was very impressed with this movie. It really is not a 1st class movie, its low budget, but it suits its purpose and message very effectively, from the emotional point of view. I was clueless of the ending until the very last minute, but I suppose some people may not be, suspense is not the point. But the intensity of the characters was impressive, even though with average performances from everyone, the music and atmosphere were perfect, the physical and emotional downward spiral representation of the main character too, and the story subject is interesting. Some may have compared this movie to Hitchcock's, I would say there is something there of "Twilight Zone". The only thing I didn't understand was Stevie's character. Was she his ex wife? Was she an illusion too? Don't know.However, I have to say this, this movie is not for everyone. It will make sense if you have been there... on that travel in your own life. Guilt can really make you insane, I had an uncle who killed himself before trial for running over a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful mood piece thriller that leaves questions unanswered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first question that we beg of "The Machinist" (of what will be many) is "holy crap, why is Christian Bale so damn skinny?" Other than the actual fact that he dieted on tuna and an apple every day, there's no real answer for this in the film, but it can pretty clearly be deciphered as a metaphor or a physical manifestation of his character's troubled mind. But while the film has its metaphysical bases covered, along with its distinct color palettes contributing to a pervasive feeling of paranoia, "The Machinist" offends the one thing a viewer can't ever forgive: common sense. Not in its plausibility, but in terms of expecting that it can get away with not tying up every loose end."The Machinist" is a thriller in the purest sense. It is one character that strange events happen to that cause both him and the viewer to go insane trying to make sense of. The soundtrack even has a classic suspense score a la Hitchcock. Specifically, Bale plays Trevor Reznik, a factory worker who lives a lonely existence that consists of early morning (1 am) ventures to airport diners and paying the same hooker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) over and over again to the point that they're more or less together. When he meets a strange man who accidentally causes him to sever the arm of a fellow factory worker, Reznik begins to yell conspiracy, finding notes on his refrigerator that equate to a game of hangman.The film has a great look. Director Brad Anderson succeeds at turning it into a mood piece with the constant use of blues and greens and the lighting. It makes for a film with as much of a suspenseful look as plot. "The Machinist" will have you trying to get a step ahead the entire time, trying to figure out how much of it is in this emaciated insomniac's head versus what's real, with an ending that will not disappoint. At the same time, while many questions are answered, some glaring ones are not. The significance of the film's title is lost and what role this job and what happens in the film at it with the severed arm and the like seems to have nothing to do with the plot twist. Perhaps the general obscurity of the film's events will lead most people to a mostly hazing understanding of it all when it is revealed.Still, fans of the genre will have something to enjoy in "The Machinist," especially ones that give equal importance to film-making and not just the plot coherency, much like true Hitchcock fans. While it may not leave you fully satisfied, you certainly won't regret the whole experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quite a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All throughout this movie I had the inkling feeling that the explanation at the end of it would be quite disappointing, but fortunately it was not! I won't spoil it here, but it was quite a good and slightly unexpected ending. The journey on the other hand was as boring as it could be! My wife usually gives a good indication whether a movie is any good: she falls asleep quite fast when it gets boring. From the corner of my eye I viewed her nod off when we were only 20 minutes on the way. And I have to agree with her: it was very slow, tedious and had a sincere lack of tension. On the good side: Christian Bale is a good actor! He gave a magnificent performance, but at none of the moments I could identify with his personality. I think that was exactly the point, because how can one live with oneself after having done what he did. I give this movie 4 points for the acting of Christian Bale and the others, but none for the story. It was just not worth spending a little over one and a half hour.</fullReview>

Be true to yourself which is fairly a simple to make a movie but the manner as I mentioned earlier that the director shows us is brilliant.

		<fullReview>After waiting 2 or 3 years to see this I finally watched it tonight. Well worth the wait. Personally, I think this is Bale's best performance (I find him to be a bit wooden at times, a la a smarter Keanu Reeves, but not in this film at all). The casting in general is excellent overall with the whole weight of the movie falling on Bale's sickly thin shoulders. Because of just the right amount of supporting roles peppered throughout and used effectively there's never a feeling of too much Bale. Nor do these supporting characters seem underdeveloped. So much for the acting...the story is creepy and suspenseful with a good, unforeseen twist. What's better is that this twist doesn't feel like "cheating" at all...it makes sense and there are hints along the way, but yet it still comes out of nowhere. After the climax, the whole mood of the movie changes to reveal a surprising moral. I've seen other movies attempt this sort of thing before - both the twist and the moral, but none anywhere near as effective as this. Overall: entertaining, creepy, mysterious, well acted and scripted, and a fulfilling ending. Solid 9 stars!</fullReview>

The Machinist has this weird, dark feel to it and was heavy influenced by Memento,if you like those kind of movies, then by all means, watch this. Nonetheless this is a very original film.Christian Bale's performance is mesmerizing and hands down, I have never seen such dedication to a role, he really got into it and the weight he lost is proof of it.

		<fullReview>Overall I liked this movie. It reminded me a lot of Hitchcock, darker aspects having nothing to do with supernatural but the inner-workings of a person. In fact, that can be so much scarier. The Machinist is a bit darker and more violent that Hitch, but the elements of man vs himself (without that realization) is certainly there.The movie is about Trevor. He's a guy who works with heavy machinery, sleeps with a call girl, and seems to really like sticky notes and bleach. Overall leading a simple life. However, it's obvious that this guy had some serious issues. For one, he has a body that concentration camp inmates could envy, people keep telling him, "If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist." I'd have to agree with those people, as I found one of the most disturbing aspects of the film to be Christian bale's emaciated body. Then there's also the fact that he admits to not having slept for the last year, although he consistently complains of being tired. Why? Well, that what the film is about. What is the cause of his insomnia?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a stellar example of psychological film-making. Bale is superb in the role. His gaunt appearance is horrifying, but..as Charlize Theron did in "Monster" it's the entire performance that resounds. It's more than the look, it's the inner emotions. The script is stark, unnerving, and downright scary at times, and the ultimate outcome is "not" telegraphed way in advance. When it is revealed, it amazes by it's starkness and believability. The visual style of the film is outstanding, as is the supporting performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh, a great, underused actress. For those who loved "Memento" this is a similar example of "that" style of film-making, and for those who adored the TV show "Twilight Zone", this is in the same realm. I enjoyed every moment of this film and believe more people should see it. It's a shame it's getting such a limited release, because this should be a must see film for lovers of stylized and intelligent film-making. My vote 9 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frail Bale enhances a somewhat average movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not slept for over a year, industrial worker Trevor Reznik begins to interact with people and see things that are out of the ordinary. While trying to prove that the mysterious Ivan is real, he begins to question his own sanity. What is real, and what is a figment of his sleep-deprived imagination starts to become unclear.'The Machinist' has become famous for being THAT Christian Bale film where he's dangerously thin. And, guys, Christian Bale is dangerously thin in this film; scarily so. That's literally the only reason I had for wanting to see the movie, as I had no idea what the film was about, or what it's critical and commercial standing was.And yes, Bale's performance is immense. As the insomniac Trevor Reznik, he is a livewire on screen, stealing every scene he's in. You forget quite quickly that it's a Hollywood superstar, and get lost in the character. Reznik is a man in constant suffering ? the lack of sleep, the breakdown of his sanity, his helplessness, his lack of trust ? and Bale every emotion with class. His very thin physique adds to the aura of the character, and the star deserves huge kudos for the dedication.But truth be told, it's a very good performance in only a decent movie. While I was fully engaged by the Trevor Reznik character, and thoroughly enjoyed seeing Bale's performance, I didn't have as much enthusiasm for the rest of the film. None of the other characters (except maybe Jennifer Jason Leigh's character Stevie) really resonated, with the chief antagonist Ivan (John Sharian) more annoying than anything else.At the heart of it, the film is a mystery thriller full of twists and turns. Again, just like the characters themselves, I was never really blown away by the changes in the narrative. Because I didn't engage with the characters, I didn't engage with the action either. The ending was also extremely anticlimactic, leaving me quite unsatisfied.I think 'The Machinist' is a movie which gets by on the appeal of Christian Bale's acting performance, and he is perhaps strong enough to make the film watchable. The fact he lived on just a can of tuna and an apple for so long is ridiculous, and it's worth seeing the movie just to experience the result of that dedication. But don't be fooled that this is an amazing film. The comparisons to 'Memento' and 'Shutter Island' are obvious, but 'Memento' this is not. It's a decent film, anchored by an excellent lead performance, that's all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great performance by Bale but a film you'll probably need to see twice to get everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A psychological drama in which Christian Bale works as a machinist with very heavy and dangerous machines. He suffers insomnia and hasn't been able to sleep for the past year. He has a relationship with a hooker who he has slowly become more and more attached to. There is an accident at the start of the movie in which a co worker is maimed because of Christian Bales negligence. This sets off the mystery in which Christian Bale tries to figure out who the mysterious character is who distracted him at work and also who keeps leaving him mysterious notes in his apartment. This is probably the best performance I've seen from Christian Bale so far and for that you should definitely watch this film. It was quite difficult to figure out the ending so as a mystery film it definitely succeeded. However there just feels like something is off to this film. It might be that none of the other performances from the other characters really shined. Also the music at times was a bit overwhelming and was probably too much of a distraction. A lot of the film felt eerie but not in the ways in which it should have. Also some of the mystery in the film leaves you quite puzzled and you'd probably have to watch it at least twice to put everything together. Also the production value felt very low budget, making the world slightly unbelievable. Splitting the main characters interest between two female characters also was a bit disconcerting. At the end of the film you find out why it happens but it leaves you feeling a bit cheated. It's a great story and Christian Bale is superb but there are just a couple things holding it back from rising above a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Machinist is the sort of film Hollywood does not dare to make- risky, taut, and smart. While not a great film it certainly is loads better than the usual bilge Hollywood feeds the public. That director Brad Anderson (who directed Session 9) had to go to Barcelona, Spain to finance and film the picture says it all. The film stars Christian Bale (who lost over 60 lbs. for the role) as Trevor Reznik, a machinist who has not slept in a year and is wasting away physically. His only sources of comfort seem to be a prostitute named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that he sleeps with, and an airport café waitress named Maria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), whom he confesses to. Then, one day, on a break at work, Trevor meets Ivan (John Sharian)- a bald biker dude with a Cajun accent, red sportscar, and a claw for a hand- after his left hand was mangled in an accident. Not long after Trevor accidentally causes the dismemberment of a co-worker named Miller (Michael Ironside) and is shunned at work. He seems to be losing his mind when no one believes him that the reason the accident occurred was because he was looking at Ivan- whom his bosses claim is not on the payroll?. Perhaps the only downsides to the film are Leigh's hooker with a heart of gold (although she does what little she can with the role) and the ending. As Trevor sleeps he dreams of the first few moments after the accident and then we get a fade out. There should have been something more definitive and climactic than merely Trevor's getting shuteye. The end feels almost tacked on, as if Kosar had no idea how to get out of the corner he painted his character into. Still, were this a Hollywood film there would have been car explosions, pedophilia, and many other overblown elements. The best thing for this screenplay was that it had to be made overseas. There are a number of excellent little points in the film, such as scattered Dostoevsky and Kafka references, Trevor's looking eerily like his Nine Inch Nails namesake Trent Reznor, Trevor's choosing to turn left, in the Route 666 kid's ride with Nicholas, and in the sewers, when he encounters forks in a road, until the end, where he turns himself in and turns right on the highway, which picks up on the mangled left hands of Miller and Ivan and other left aligned things in the film. Also, Michael Ironside- who works far too little- seems to always lose a limb in his films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trevor cannot sleep and he is also extremely skinny. Trevor hasn't slept for a whole entire year and he is losing his sanity as well. He sleeps with call girls and visits an all night café in the airport. Then people go in and out of his life. They disappear and come back but some people don't even exist. Strange notes start to appear on his fridge and there are some surprises in the fridge and in the rolled up carpet.I liked it because it was so weird and everything was explained in the ending. It is somewhat of a horror movie with a sense of strangeness to it. The movie starts getting good when he realizes that he is going insane. From that point on, there is no logic to any of the movie until the end. Watch it and then get some sleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Machinist...a darker than dark drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kudos to director Brad Anderson. THE MACHINIST is like slowly driving past a horrible train wreck; a morbid curiosity makes you stare and rubberneck. The physical transformation of Christian Bale is a sure shocker. And this story is flat out dark and dank. Bale plays Trevor Reznik, a drill-press operator on the graveyard shift. He is a very troubled man suffering insomnia and is horribly emaciated from not sleeping for a year and counting. He is practically a walking skeleton and he soon starts suffering paranoia from sleep deprivation. It seems the only people he feels comfortable talking to are Marie(Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), a waitress at the airport deli and Stevie(Jennifer Jason Leigh),a hopeless prostitute that is willing to give him some time "off the meter". Trevor begins loosing grip on what is left of his sanity when he's haunted by a mysterious man named Ivan(John Sharian)and tormented by menacing memories of a secretive past. This movie touches every shade of gray as you watch the tortured Trevor slip deeper into a nervous breakdown. Also in the cast: Michael Ironside, Robert Long and Anna Massey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A skeleton figure of Christian Bale is impossible to imagine after the Batman roles. How did he lose all that weight? you can count all his bones in the scenes he has his shirt off.The heroic effort of the character has to be approbated on putting so much weightage into the movie. Its classic Bale, doing a lot more than homework.The protagonist is losing sleep and weight over something. He commits blunders of immeasurable proportions due to strange happenings around him. These bizarre happenings seems like a plot to make him take a tumble. Or is it? Anyway all things are tied down neatly in the end.Personally I found it a difficult movie to watch, since the mood of the movie is always on the depressing side. It isn't the run on the mill sort of movie, so bearing that thought in mind enjoy the movie in all its dark splendor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give Christian Bale a lot of credit. To go so far as to lose THAT much weight for a role is impressive. Now... as for the movie itself, it wasn't as impressive. Maybe I've seen enough psych-thrillers where this one didn't substantially set itself apart, but it began to wear on me. It became glaringly obvious that Trevor was nuts and that Ivan was just a figment of his imagination. Why Trevor failed to realize that he was the batty one and that the entire world was not in on one big prank is what annoyed me the most. He severed one relationship after another and made himself look more and more crazy as he accused everyone of plotting against him.I hung around to find out what was driving Trevor batty and it was somewhat worth it, but overall this thriller was just average at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Focused observation...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a work of special care, making a movie like "The Machinist". A work of confidence and bravery, of knowing the same mistakes aren't going to be made. The story of Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), a machinist, and the problems his insomnia brings to him and the ones around him; establishes a fine premise and character development, but then it goes deep and it becomes dark and (at times) unconvincing?But it doesn't make the same mistakes that movies of its genre commonly make these days.Like those movies, "The Machinist" relies on focused observation, which is okay if you're the kind of viewer who likes to 'watch'. Director Brad Anderson, from the warm "Next Stop Wonderland", proves he's able to control various moods and feelings in the same movie. With big help from Roque Ba?os' score, Anderson accentuates the drama, the suspense, the little amount of horror and the loneliness the story contains.A story of a man so lonely that he could invent a parallel world?This is, briefly, what Scott Kosar proposes in his screenplay; and Christian Bale gives Trevor the unpredictability only he can achieve, in a performance that's not superb but that requires the responsibility than no one else has for a role. How the guy who wrote this is the same writer of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" remake? We don't answer those questions, because people need to work. But this, Kosar's best screenplay, is what lets us see that mistakes can be omitted.For example, in the place where Trevor works, a place as lonely as himself, he's not the only one the camera and the movie care about. There are other people there, and they live and talk and participate; unlike films where everything is about the main character and the characters the plot requires. The same in the street, where everyone carries on with their lives normally, but they are there?They exist! How interesting the contrast that the movie is so lonely, and its main character too, but he never finds the time to be alone. He suffers from insomnia, he's about to fall asleep, but something always wakes him up. "We always suffer from insomnia from time to time", Stevie (another main character nicely developed, played by Jeniffer Jason Leigh) tells Trevor. "Stevie", he says. "I haven't slept in a year".Then he goes to the airport coffee shop, Maria (another main character, also nicely developed, played by Aitana Sánchez-Gijón) serves the coffee and he just looks at it; and the clock, which appears to be stuck at the same hour, at the same minute. "The Machinist" is like the awful "Darkness", produced entirely in Spain and worked by the best technical team that exists there. Better than "Darkness", the film could have been directed by Christopher Nolan; and it would have been even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfactory ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian Bale played a factory worker, Trevor Reznik, who suffered from insomnia and became paranoid that a new worker might have conspiratorially done something against him.On the surface, the movie came across as a psychological thriller; but it was, in fact about someone who became conscience-stricken as a result of what he had done in the past. The movie, in the end, provided a satisfactory explanation why Trevor turned into such a sleepless, hunted zombie walker but, be that as it may, the Machinist, as a whole, was not that peerless.Despite giving a good twist, there were not enough engaging scenes. The whole movie, indeed, did not catch my imagination much; seeing that I could speculate at an early stage, that it would eventually arrive at an understandable conclusion. As a matter of fact, it was a bit insipid. I wish the movie had delivered some spine-tingling moments. While I was watching a bony Christian Bale performing his role skittishly, I felt that the director could have advised him to be a bit spookier.Bale, however, gave quite a good performance. He was convincing in his character. I felt like I was watching a real psycho, weirdo person. He successfully held the entire movie together. His body in this movie was believably anorectic. I thought he was going to die from a heart attack as a consequence of losing such a lot of weight. His dedication to the character was commendable.This movie managed to set itself apart from other typical psycho thriller movies because of its twisted result. It also sent out a message of taking responsibility for your own action. Any decent human being cannot avoid being assaulted by waves of guilt. Forcing yourself to forget your bad deeds is not the right way to sort out a sense of despair. You, in the end, could a lot suffer from them in terms of physicality and mentality.The Machinist is in every way a well-made movie, particularly for a movie goer who is interested in more than just a usual psychodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Repressive Redemptive Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I heard the Machinist was recommended, so I saw it. It stars Christian Bail. Now hold on a second, Christian Bail has lost weight for this role. Christian Bail has lost a lot of weight for this role. Christian Bail has lost so much weight for this role that I had a hard time believing there wasn't CGI involved. I know there was some degree of make-up artistry involved but come-on man! This is one of those movies that requires research in watching. It's not as slow as say memento, but not as action packed as fight club. There is however, some degree of gore involved, and things are dingy/dirty/scummy. Great cinematography, well, color-matching I suppose. It's one of those movies that requires more than one viewing, I would say if you're not an intellectual movie buff, you won't go for it. That's all I can say without giving it away, so...SPOILERS AHEAD!!! For those of you who have seen it, here are my views for discussion. The character of Trevor Reznik played by Christian, has run over a little boy, I have only seen the movie once, but plan to watch it again. Anyway, at the end this is revealed. There are many hints that allude to this actual event, lighter popping out of car, him going to the intersection or pulling out into it, Aeriel shot pans downward of the stoplight. Fine.Trevor hasn't slept in a year he says, before we cover anything, let me point out that when you don't sleep, your body dreams anyway. It's a proved fact, learned it in psychology. Dreaming is something your body needs to do.There are a number of these so-called hallucinations in Trevor's so-called life, but before we tackle those, there are two interpretations: The one I just mentioned, or Trevor is actually dead, supposedly dying after the hit and run by crashing into a truck in a tunnel. A scene that is shown in the movie but he actually avoids the truck when tailing the red car. The police also tell him he reported his red car stolen and/or it was totaled. So you got that going for ya.Anyway, there are a number of scenes that are either hallucinations, or Trevor's own personal limbo between heaven and hell. If he's not dead then he's fighting between redemption and repression of a sinful mistake which could lead to hell.Before we explain that further, lets go to Ivan. Ivan is a character that Trevor sees. Ivan says he works with Trevor but no-one else can see Ivan but Trevor. Ivan represents Trevor's guilt and repression of the memories of the accident(s). Ivan is almost a super-persona of Trevor as he looks similar to him, appears in a picture in which is really a picture of Trevor, or where he should be in the picture. He looks like Trevor but is more overweight. He eats, as we can see in the scene where Trevor spies him through the machine before the machine accident. Which causes an almost replay of things as another accident occurs as a result of Ivan (his guilt) distracting him. Presumably, Ivan's shadow is seen coming down one of the sewer tunnels which mimics a heaven/hell redemption/repression symbolism. He doesn't want to face his guilt. Ivan drives Trevor's car, the car he had the accident with.The waitress. She's the mother of the boy Trevor hit. He sees her at the airport, but as we learn toward the end of the film, she doesn't even work there. We see a camera-shot in the first airport scene. There is a suttle filter over the camera, a strange glowy grainy texture of him in front of his cup of coffee that he's not drinking. We later learn that's all he does at the airport, I suppose this is a reality camera-shot hint.He talks to the waitress and she's very friendly with him. You almost think she's flirting with him, and he's flirting with her. Using every line in the book in a very friendly way. She talks about how he eats there but you never see him eating. She even invites him to come along to hang out with her and her son at an amusement park. All this is stuff he wishes he could do to reconcile the situation with the mother and the kid. I've read on the IMDb that the book featured in the film, "The Idiot," has something to do with this, but a bit of a reach in some degree.This review is getting too long, and a second viewing is required by me. Obviously I've left stuff out, but not to cover everything for you.Redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take the colors in your typical machine shop and apply them to an entire movie and you have set the tone for "The Machinist." If you want to spend a couple of hours with a tortured soul and see things like a man getting his hand ripped off in a machine, then this movie is for you. I don't think I have ever seen a better depiction of paranoia in a film, for what that's worth. I was so distracted by Bale's physical appearance that it was difficult to watch him. I have to question what it was about the script that excited him to make such a personal sacrifice. It's too bad there wasn't a Holocaust movie being made at the time so that he could have doubled the gain for his effort. Indeed "The Machinist" would not have had its fascination without Bale's skeletal form, but you have to question if this was worth his effort.This is the kind of movie that you are afraid to recommend for fear of incurring the disapproval and suspicions of your friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>subtle 6 digit number provides insight into depth of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was recommended to me by a friend who has a taste for certain great films of a dark, foreboding quality, that, however, DO ask the hard questions and pose scenarios with plausible outcomes that leave one hanging on to the movie. Films that leave a piece of themselves in your mind, make an impression, and even make you think...these are the films I appreciate most. This is what I appreciate about The Machinist.I had seen part of the film about a month ago, but I only watched about 20 minutes (in the middle of the movie), then stopped lest I ruin it for myself. I am curious if anyone else has picked up on this one thing, as i'm sure other's have but just haven't voiced it or i haven't found it in writing.We all know that Trevor Reznik's world and perception of reality have been twisted. In particular, the scene in which he is following the red comaro through the tunnel, squinting to try to identify the license plate numbers, he reads to himself aloud "743 CRN". Staring off into space, concentrating so the plate number will remain etched into his mind, he veers from his lane, almost hitting another driver. After he swerves to miss this driver, he comes to a stop on the side of the road. In this shot we see the front of his car coming to a halt. In this moment you can catch a glimpse of the front license plate of the white truck he is driving. The license plate number reads "NRC 347". This plate number is the exact opposite of that on the red camaro he is following. Later on, the viewer discovers that the red camaro is his own car. So in the twisted reality of Trevor Reznik, the backward license plate number can represent his skewed perception of the red camaro, of the other driver so called "Ivan", and most importantly represent the skewed perception of his reality, everything about him, the way he is perceiving these events, or more importantly the role of the people in these events.This makes me wonder what other minute, quick, subtle details are also in the film. I have read the popular comment on elements of Dostoyevsky in The Machinist, and I'm sure, upon another viewing, I would catch some of those and then some more, hopefully.That's just a few thoughts of mine on the film. I absolutely loved it and plan on purchasing it. But I was just wondering if anyone had caught the license plate number on Trevor's white truck and realized the connection?</fullReview>

Christian Bale gives an utterly spectacular and haunting experience and this might just be the most original movie I have ever seen. The plot seems a little odd at sometimes, but everything seems to have importance at the end. The only bad thing I can say about it is that there may be a few things that you find to be unexplained and it may seem a bit rushed. It did not feel this way to me but I can understand why someone would feel that way.

		<fullReview>That's what came to mind after looking at the emaciated Bale. He is so scary skinny and it's not special effects. I don't know how he lost all that weight and still function. He plays, Trevor, an insomniac. He says he hasn't slept in a year and his only friend is a prostitute he pays for. He starts finding post it notes on his fridge he didn't put there. And he sees a big bald guy at work that no one else does. Because of this he becomes distracted and causes an accident that results in a co-worker losing a limb. He visits a waitress at an airport diner on a regular basis. He's becoming more paranoid and thinks everyone is lying about the bald guy. He gets fired and turns on the prostitute. You know this isn't going to end pretty.FINAL VERDICT: Good psychological film but I did think that the bald guy wasn't real from the beginning. Bale gives a good acting performance and is so think it just gives the movie an added oomph. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Trevor Reznick; a factory worker plagued by insomnia barely participates in existence, he begins to doubt his sanity after a series of misplaced events occur in his ordinary life. Work becomes a place of abstraction as characters create themselves in his memory. The mangling of a co-workers arm leads Trevor to question his own validity and forces him to discover who or what he has become...Brad Anderson's brave plunge into the abstract and depraved character of Trevor Reznick is a portrayal that may have been better homed in a Chris Nolan film, the film carries a feeling of sinister foreboding and you're constantly waiting for Christian Bale's character to come to fruition. Like a caged Bateman he travels through the film almost and nearly making your hairs stand on end, but never quite achieves this feat. Trevor is physically wasted and gives new meaning to the phrase 'guilt will eat away at you', as he repents by starving himself. Post-it notes are his only clues in solving the mystery of how he spends his time, is he a killer, was he framed or is he living a waking nightmare? We begin the film in darkness and although Trevor painfully discovers the 'truth' we are both plunged back into that darkness in which began.The Machinist has great ambitions and signs of greatness lie in its plot. It belongs in the same vein as Memento and Lost Highway but does not have the confidence to go all out as they do and therefore fails to fully engage the viewer. The masochist in me thinks this film would have benefited from a little uncaged Bateman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are one of those people who absolutely hate horror movies and desperately seek heart pumping thrillers you will be really pleased with this movie. Christian Bale's acting is superb and his appearance reminds one of pictures from the concentration camps... It is amazing that an actor can commit so much of himself for a movie and it makes you wonder whether that is healthy. The movie follows very much the Hitchcock style with excellent music for each scene and amazing lightning and decor. Machinist's house is orderly yet very dark. The scene where blood flows from the freezer is fascinating and the scene where the fellow worker looses an arm is disturbingly realistic. It is simply a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>if Lynch was Catholic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie looks really nice, done in pastel colors and shot in a way that everything seems to have a layer of dust on it. Christian Bale's body is really a pain to look at, I found myself cringing. He really is a very good actor - not for losing all the weight of course, but because of how he can get into character in all of his movies. Notice the way he slurs his words like an extremely feeble person would. The cinematography is also interesting, with Trevor usually shot so as to make him look separated - from the surroundings or from the people around him (if there are any), which further brings out his harrowing loneliness.This is a movie about suffering, I think - suffering that one chooses not to admit (notice that Trevor rarely talks of his insomnia, for example). The story is really twisty, but you can feel you're slowly crawling someplace specific. The way things happen makes you think of David Lynch's movies, just with a different kind of metaphoric imagery. Instead of magic realism, we have visual religious metaphors here (fire, torturing machines, recurring physical torture, the crossroads, etc). One of the things I missed in this movie was just this lack of dreaminess (the surrealism is more in the visuals than in what actually happens), but then again, maybe this could be seen as being in keeping with the character of Trevor, who can't get any sleep and therefore, all dreams are withheld.I must admit I really didn't like the ending (a little too simple for all that came before). Overall, however, it's a very well made movie. Don't miss Jennifer Jason Leigh in one of her best performances as the prostitute, Stevie.</fullReview>

This one is in the category of a dark thriller with a very dark setup with shady characters and sanity of lead character. Well giving away any detail in this movie would be a crime but to sum up the experience of watching this movie, IT IS FANTASTIC... The story revolves around a factory worker and his shocking deterioration of physical health due to prolonged insomnia.The twist and turns are deep enough to keep you glued to your seat for 90 minutes. The acting by the characters are brilliant.Cristian Bale should have got a best achievement award for just playing the role by losing close to 60 pounds and gaining it to shoot the scene where he is still good looking(Incidentally I watched the trailer of this one during the premiere of Bantman Begins and couldn't recognize Bale)Jennifer as his call girl /girl friend is good.The rest of the characters give a good performance to make this one of the best thrillers around recent times. A Definite Treat for Movie lovers...( I gave a 10/10 cause Brad Anderson's hasn't made many movies like this before except SESSION (.. Which is an other classic...) 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice acting,nice scenario. A must seen movie. For the ones who didn't understand the film here's a summary: Trevor Reznik hasn't slept since a year. One day while he was driving with his car(while he was normal) he had crashed to a little boy and then ran away with his car. He feels very guilty about this,he cannot sleep since then.He's going crazy,he's losing his mind. He sees his killer side as Ivan. A part of him denies that he's a killer so his mind creates Ivan. He becomes together with the child he killed and his mother. He can't throw that woman(child's mother) out of his mind. As he goes to police and makes himself arrest,hallucinations leave him.And so he can sleep now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** When the unbelievable horrors of the Andersonville prison camp were made known following The Civil War (a most un-civil affair), the survivors looked not unlike Christian Bale in this movie; same reason(s), too (near starvation). There have been actors whose performances have hinged, to one degree or another, on their appearances (and I'm not talking here about "glamorous" looks; I'm talking, of course, about the chameleon-like transformations of actors like Robert DeNiro in RAGING BULL or John Hurt in THE ELEPHANT MAN, to cite but two). Nothing that has come before (so far as I can recall, with the possible exception of documentary footage of German concentration camp survivors) can prepare the viewer for Bale's appearance; it's that unsettling. Having stressed out for years while driving a taxi at night in a city acrawl with crack-heads, I can relate to the sleeplessness that plagues the machinist (said stress contributing, in the end, to a heart attack in my own case and quintuple bypass heart surgery). Guilt is the dagger of the mind (so Shakespeare tells us in MACBETH and Poe in THE TELL-TALE HEART). If you're interested in gritty, often surreal film-making (the music, which sounds a lot like the music from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, helps set the tone, as it were), don't miss THE MACHINIST.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good film, rubbish review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this over a month ago so forgive me if I am a little hazy.This film was very much in the vein of Fight Club and Momento, saying that I have probably ruined the twist. Christian Bale (the fab new Batman) plays Trevor, a man who works in a dingy factory. He operates machines funnily enough. He is also an insomniac, so his concentration is poor; one day, he gets distracted by a man at work which leads to his workmate getting his arm caught in a machine. Trevor explains what happened but everyone denies the man that distracted with him works at the factory. This sends him into a spiral of paranoia. The film is quite dark and the colours all looked a bit washed out.I certainly wasn't expecting the ending, it was rather good. The acting was great and Christian Bale was very dedicated to his work. He lost heaps of weight to film this, he looks frightful to be honest. I read on here that he: "dropped an amazing 63 pounds [28. kg] for his role as the emaciated insomniac Trevor Reznik in the film The Machinist (2004) with only a single vitamin consultation with a nutritionist to guide him. For the most part, he only ate salads and apples, chewed gum, smoked cigarettes, and drank nonfat lattes." Healthy.Sorry about this crappy review, the film deserves better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have watched this movie twice. both times i watched it i wonder how he was able (bale) to loose all that weight for the movie. i think the movie was a good cliffhanger in that it did not reveal anything all through the movie. it was a very good film that made me want to rent it again to make sure i didn't miss anything. i got the feeling that reznick was trying to keep himself busy when he almost fell asleep reading. it was almost as though he was afraid to go to sleep. what i am puzzled by is why he would not sleep. did something keep him awake or did he stay awake on his own? as i said before, i am truly amazed as to the actual weight loss he (bale) went through for this film. that made it all the more believable.</fullReview>

Thank you for all the people involved for believing in yourselves and for not putting up with the trashy markets that refused to accept and appreciate real art.

		<fullReview>All I can say is EXCELLENT! This movie is reminiscent of the movies of the late 1940's or early 50's. In true Hitchcock style. Trevor Reznick, played by Christian Bale, plays an American Machinist where the movie is intended to take place in LA. (Which is actually filmed in Spain) A definite Film Noir.Special care was made in making this film as a classically beautiful one. Even though the story line is just the opposite. The music score was deeply haunting &amp; lovely. The cinematography was superb! This movie reminds me deeply of the horror mystery movie "Jacobs Ladder". Things that are real, are really not real and so forth. Yet, they are all real in Trevors mind. This is definitely a psychological thriller! I cannot wait to watch it a few more times.

		<fullReview>I thought it a very well done movie, and I was surprised to see another Spanish film in English, a California-like DMV and all. 2001's _Dagon_ comes to mind, but the cast and crew of _The Machinist_, or _El Maquinista_, do a great job even for an American movie in a movie that certainly appears to take place in the United States. The film also has famous actors such as Christian Bale and Jennifer Jason Leigh; Michael Ironside also plays a role.It certainly has twists, and I was also surprised with the quality of the acting in this 2004 film, Spanish or not, expecting a sci-fi or horror-type film. Christian does not look himself in the part as he's lost a lot of weight. He could easily be a concentration-camp survivor, or victim, with all the weight he's lost! I had to wait for the credits once I suspected it was the guy who later played Batman in _Batman Begins_ (2005) and _American Psycho_ (2000).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very atmospheric movie that uses the good old not-in-chronological-order way of showing the scenes. Extremely devoted, to the brink of insanity I think, Bale lost lots of weight in order to match his Concentration camp victim kind of character. His acting is not affected by this though, he's very believable as the psycho - maybe too believable...? Anyway, he works as a machinist and *SPOILER*SPOILER*SPOILER* one day, he is distracted by one of the co-workers, which costs one of his other co-workers his arm. This is pretty gory and so is the rest of the movie, with blood leaking from a freezer that's not running, an obsession with numbers, road signs, and fishes, and a generally disturbing feeling throughout. I think 20 years from now, Machinist will be realised as one of the creepiest, most excellent thrillers ever made, and will get into the top 250, mainly because of Christian Bale's stunning acting and devotion to his character.There's been a lot of talk about Bale's weight loss, and it is pretty extreme. Sometimes looking at his fleshed-out, naked upper body is repulsive and scary, he looks like a walking skeleton, and his head and face is anorectic and sunken-in, seeming to big for his thin, horrible neck. Large bruises and insomnia-induced black eyes don't help, either.It's a great and disturbing thriller, and mainly a landmark in cinema because it shows just how far a devoted and good actor will go, and what he will do to himself, to pull off a role. Christian Bale quickly gained back his normal weight and then started bulking up to star in Batman Begins, so it seems like this movie finally gave him the recognition he deserves. I'd advice him not to do these kind of things to his body, it's not healthy. and he's a very good actor! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly, the ultimate story of psychological horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A worker at a steel factory is suffering from insomnia and hasn't slept in over a year. Is he sane? Is his world real? Is he DEAD? The film starts right away with the question: "Who are you?" And the thing is, the viewer is just as confused as the protagonist Trevor Reznik played by Christian Bale in a terrific performance. This heavy taste of initial irony propels the viewer right along side Trevor as he struggles through his world and tries to figure why things are starting to make less and less sense. His only happiness in his grim world is with an equally miserable prostitute who he sees regularly and a waitress at an airport café. When he meets an eccentric co-worker, Ivan, that apparently no one else sees and this leads to a brutal accident at work he is thrown out.From there on the story is filled with brilliant images and complemented by a terrific direction as Trevor goes to find out the truth about his miserable existence. From an amusement park ride that takes Trevor right to hell to a chase into the bowels of the city, it seems the more Trevor runs the farther from grace he gets. Also he finds cryptic post-it notes in his apartment, did he put them there? Is he being done in? Are the people he meets people he has known before? The questions keep coming and the resulting film is just as interesting as it is well made. Director Brad Anderson's previous film was also a psychological horror story and he must have learned a lot in its making, because this is better in every respect. From scale to tension, from imagery to pacing this is quite possibly the ultimate story of psychological horror. 10/10 Rated R: grim and violent content, profanity, and sex</fullReview>

		<fullReview>was permanently put to rest by Christian Bales as "The Machinist". This incredible evocation by Bales, including the astounding level of commitment and effort put into this role renders insufficient the standard Hollywood superlatives. I've seen, more serendipitously than by choice, all Bale's other works. This film and his work in it are in a different galaxy. Not a film for everyone; extremely intense and dark. But very brilliant and Bales delivers one of the best performances i have ever seen in 40 years or more as an avid movie fan. Set design, make-up, supporting work all compliment a compelling vision of inner conflict in search of resolution. It's wonderfully directed and a very creative work on its own, but with Bale's performance this is a must-see for all serious film lovers.</fullReview>

Look for good parts from Michael Ironside as well. I believe the combination of Brad Anderson and the Spanish production company, gave this movie a VERY eerie quality that would be extremely difficult to reproduce.This has got to be the most refreshingly original film I have seen in a long time, and I am proud of myself cos I chose it on a whim, and I finally have to say, Christian Bale fans, will be ULTIMATELY shocked by his transformation in this...

		<fullReview>yeah, we all know Christian bale is smoking right now in his career. this summer he will be batman, and solidify himself as an actor amongst the notable (not that he hasn't always been in some peoples minds). in this film, he truly embodies every emotion and frustration and defeat of someone in his situation. This man has not slept in a year, and everyone can tell. But it is that peculiar awareness that he carries, much like Guy Pearce in "Memento" or Edward Norton in "Fight Club" that really puts us in his situation and manages to keep us enticed all the while. True, i could somewhat tell where the film was going, sad that other films with a twist in the end have my mind programmed to pick up on every detail along the way now, but nonetheless there is a point where we simply ask "what will he do now?" despite some of its similarities to other films, the story itself is pretty original and able to jump from different moods and plot devices quick and efficient enough that it really had some staying power and a strong after-effect that is difficult to find these days. Bale is amazing as always, and the world he lives in in "The Machinist" is truly intriguing and worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie, I didn't really know what it would be about because I hadn't seen any previews or anything. The Machinist is a beautifully dark and twisted movie that allows the viewer to travel through the often-demented mind of Trevor Reznik as his life unravels before him because of his constant lack of sleep. His insomnia eventually affects every aspect of his life and causes him to hallucinate and have nightmares during the day, even though he's not asleep. I won't give away the ending, but I thought it tied the movie together nicely and you'll have to see it for yourself to find out how it concludes. PS: Christian bale's emaciated frame was very disturbing and realistically depicted how a man consumed by remorse for an act can eventually lead down a self-destructive path.</fullReview>

And I don't believe it came out of Hollywood, either. Christian Bale will get mega-attention for his emaciated body, but as painful as it was to see it,POSSIBLE SPOILER!!! his physical condition reveals the character's state of mind visually. Bravo to Bale for doing that, although I hope he's returned to a healthy state. Bale also carries this story as Trevor, and I was greatly impressed with the integrity and high level of craft with which he pulls the viewer into his character's story with his eyes, his voice, facial expression as well as his actions. He has solid support from the other actors. I also think the editing and writing was superb, and the photography and lighting perfect in setting tone and creating a suitably dark atmosphere. I would recommend this movie for anyone who's especially tired of the slick fare that comes out of L.A., and I would warn them to pay attention to details, from the very beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale's best performance so far is finally here. He has been a good actor in movies like: Reign of Fire, Equilibrium, Laurel Canyon, and let's not forget American Psycho. But now we have an exposition of inner turmoil depicted not only by great acting, but by the remarkable physical transformation that Cristian Bale undertakes for the movie. He obviously felt that the loss in body weight would add a sense of realism to the film that good acting alone would not accomplish. It is this dedication to his craft that makes this film enthralling. Christian Bale is definitely on his way to becoming a serious heavy weight in Hollywood. I wouldn't be surprised if he won an "Oscar" for his role in this movie. You don't want to miss it.</fullReview>

The surreal feeling of "what's real and what's not" is prevalent in today's movies, but this had a real dark edge to it. The weight loss that Bale had to go through must have really eaten away not only at his body, but got him into character much better (if you look into the mirror and you don't recognize what you see it's got to be easier to believe it and act it). Bale gives a great performance of a guy that is going nuts from insomnia. You can almost feel the sleep drip off the guy. I gave this a 8/10 only because the plot is a twist on a trend these days on the "what's real and what's not" thing. I'm getting a little sick of it. Bale's performance as a guy going over the edge and dwindling away was worth the 8$.</fullReview>

Christian Bale is fantastic to the point of scaring me because he lost so much weight, and his acting is as good as ever, but everything surrounding him was less than enthusiastic. The basics of this movie rest in one part Memento, one part Fight Club and one part Jacob's Ladder. Extract the climax of those fine films and insert cheesy 1960s science fiction background music, and we're set to roll. As this movie progressed I was struggling to piece things and people together and by the end of it I had mentally written two alternative solutions that were far better than the one they gave us. If this movie came out in the early to mid 1990s it would have blown me away, but I'm afraid my expectations for surprise endings are higher these days, and this overall didn't deliver the goods. At best this movie should be recut for television and have it aired as a Twilight Zone and/or X-files movie of the week. 2/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main reason to see this movie is because of the marvelous performance turned in by Christian Bale, who is bound to become one of the most sought after actors over the next few years. The movie explores the strange reality of the title character who suffers from delusions at his place of work and during his encounters with hooker Jennifer Jason Leigh. He keeps having visions and trance-like conversations with "Ivan," a mysterious character who reminds me of a white Morpheus. Although Bale ie excellent, the movie is obviously heavily influenced by "Memento," which in my opinion was better scripted, and kept the viewer in more suspense. Because this movie is shot so gloomily, the suspense angle is lost in the contrived "dark" atmosphere, and I found myself not shocked or even interested in the supposed "surprise ending." This would have been better had it come out before Memento, but unfortunately, this movie copies too closely plots of movies that were done more effectively in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting concept that plays out rather ordinarily. The explanation is simple and easily deduced, if one is paying attention. For all its moodiness, atmosphere and seemingly falsely created tension, the tale is straightforward while trying to be Kafkaesque and in achieving a Rod Sterling/Twilight Zone type appeal. The film fails miserably in both of its attempts and at 102 minutes, the denouement feels prolonged as if the director did not trust to have a tighter round tale. How far more effective it might have been had it been shortened and the recurring man in the red car (so sophomorish)had made only one or two appearances throughout. A sure give away sign that things are not what they seem.Bale has proven himself adept at roles such as this and it is his very gauntness that lingers after the film has ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Involving thriller with a weak resolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first screening at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival was The Machinist. It's a taut, slow-paced, involving thriller about a man (Christian Bale) who states that he hasn't slept in a year. He's beginning to show strain at work, in his relationships, and with himself when he begins to see things that might not really be there. Bale is good, and his weigh loss here (staggeringly shocking) puts Tom Hanks in Cast Away to shame. The music score is excellent, and reminds one of Bernard Herrmann, and the muted gray colors throughout keep one in an insomniac's limbo like its main character. If the resolution to the film's mystery and involvement hadn't been so weak, I would recommend it to those who liked Fight Club or Memento, but alas, it barely gets a recommendation at all, and only to those who are undemanding seekers of mysteries.

		<fullReview>This film began with a cleanup of a murder -- cool, and nowhere else in the entirety of the film do we see another reference of it, until the final seconds of the film. The murder, if it happened, was of the guard who came up to Bale's character and Bale decided to kill him because he was cleaning up another murder. As films like this go I appreciate the lack of precise time lines and factoring in the insanity of the people. I love this, though this film failed to deliver beyond the fact of 'guy is insane, crazy stuff happens that he can't explain'. There was no chance for us, as observers, to decipher any meaning from it. This was a pointless movie, that's all I could think the entire time.The worthlessness of this movie is not due to the actors, the director failed to deliver any meaningful care of us viewers to the characters. He produced the story in a haphazard way, introducing characters(such as the machinist friend) and then removing them. He focused heavily on Bale, simply focusing on him being skinny, rather than directing any sort of a story. This director then, microseconds after the final frame of the film, input his name 'a film by brad Andersen' in the credits. I will never watch another movie by Brad Anderson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well shot, but not that interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this film, I realized two things. One, this was well shot and written, and two... It became tedious and boring twenty minutes in.Some had to do with the slow pacing, and the rest had to do with none of his revelations being all that interesting. If your protagonist is going crazy, it should at least be fascinating to watch for the entire movie, not just the first twenty minutes.The whole 'Christian Bale pieces together strange clues that lead to a revelation' became far too repetitive after the first twenty minutes, leaving the rest of the film seeming like 'ah, he's found something else that correlates with some memory. How fascinating! Oh, wait, no, it's the same thing again, just with a different window dressing!' The music was also problematic, as it hurt the film by it's incredibly lack of subtlety. "This is weird! We've got violins to tell you this! Every time it's a weird moment, we're using this same violin riff! No, really, it's iconic, not trite!" Visually, it was very well done. I wasn't a huge fan of the look, but it was executed with such flair that was hard to dislike.Plot-wise, it was good also, but what hurt the plot was the pacing. If you're going to be repetitive about something, it's got to be absolutely mesmerizing. This unfortunately wasn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this film as Fight Club and Memento especially, the two movies to which it has been most compared, are two of my favourites.Unfortunately this failed to live up to expectations. The story was convoluted and drawn out, and failed to keep my interest. The protagonist was confused and lacked purpose or direction, in contrast to Memento, and the constant switching between scenes just made the film disjointed.The delivery was also surprisingly uninspiring. Jennifer Jason Leigh was far from engaging and Christian Bale - who was fantastic in American Psycho and Equilibrium - failed to evoke any kind of emotion - in my opinion at least.VERDICT - Best avoided, unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale stars as Trevor Reznik. an insomniac whom hasn't slept for a year . His sanity begins to deteriorate and his paranoia begins to rise after a work related injury befalls one of his co-workers. I rented this one when my lady friend wanted to get one and she told me this or "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" (which I couldn't help but laugh at the suggestion, which got her slightly mad, but I digress). Needless to say, I picked this one. I really got into it, not for the 'mystery', as any seasoned viewer worth his salt will figure out everything rather quickly (the first time I saw the Hangman game it was plainly obvious), but rather Christian Bale's performance which is mesmerizing. He's on a fast-track to becoming one of my favorite actors of my generation. The fact that he put himself through all this just for one independent film is amazing. Furthermore, this movie almost makes me forgive Scott Kosar for all his silly little wrong-minded remakes....ALMOST.My Grade: B- DVD Extras: Commentary by Brad Anderson; 25 minute Making of featurette; 8 Deleted/Alternate scenes (2 with optional commentary); Theatrical Trailer; and Trailers for "Mean Creek", "Enduring Love", "Suspect Zero", &amp; "Schultze gets the Blues" Eye Candy: Jennifer Jason Leigh gets topless</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes hypnotizing, gruesome and scary, with an attractive photography and some nice visual flashes, this movie had a high potential of mesmerizing and eerie impact. The basic idea of a man who doesn't sleep anymore was great and rich of chances. Nevertheless a fuzzy and labyrinthic plot, full of nonsenses and eventually useless actions (such as strange accidents and unrelated characters), transforms all in a jelly melting pot, with a bad screenplay and a childish text, weakly directed. The final comment is: boring and beneath every expectation.</fullReview>

He plays a loner, akin to the main character of "the Minus Man". I don't actually know why that movie comes to mind, just does.This movie is gritty, creative and the cast is awesome. The story could've been worked a bit better, but enjoyable nonetheless.I wouldn't read too many reviews or look at any pictures from this film if you do go and see it. It would seriously take away from the dramatic effect of watching it on the bigscreen.I was, quite shocked at Christian's overall bodyweight in this film, as was the rest of the theater.Jonathan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The machinist" is a typical story where somebody goes out on a quest to solve a mystery that ultimately takes back to himself. The masterpiece of the film is the great appearance from lead actor Christian Bale; known to most audiences for his part in "American Psycho", he literally transformed himself by losing something like 69 lbs and giving a wrenching and deep performance that leaves fascinated, sickened and astonished. Apart from that, the plot and the movie in general leave to be desired, cos they release a series of disclosures one after another expecting the viewer won't understand the many tricks, that is very disappointing. The final result lacks creativity and depth, that should be the most important ingredients for a psychological thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could have reached "Fight Club" or "Memento" if the scenario would have been as good as the actors (Bale, Jason Leigh and Ironside mostly). But we're far from it. In fact, after 25 minutes, the plot is easily delivered and then you only have a very good acting but nothing else to feed with. The treatment of the idea is so simple, clues and keys are so evident that you don't really care of what's gonna happen. As if the director feared that the audience wouldn't get the point. But it's so easy that a 12 years old kid would tell you he got it in the first hour. Pity because this could really have been a great movie. The cinematography and photography are very good ans even sometimes courageous (almost balck'n'white for a couple of scenes). And some shots will keep you awake, like the one on a phantom train in a lunapark. So, thanks to the actors. Little spank for the writer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never trust an insomniac.(6/10). Warning: MAJOR plot spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because the movie opens with the assumptive objectivity of Trevor Reznik(Christian Bale)'s struggle with a corpse, I have always been suspicious of The Machinist(2004). One of its most preposterous elements is his attempt to first kill, then carry such a (literal) dead weight when he is so weak&amp; emaciated he can hardly walk. Equally, he's still a smoker despite its known negative effects on weight and sleep.What follows is therefore my spoiler-house-of-cards for the very confused."No-one ever died of insomnia" is a refrain that reminds us of Fight Club(1999)'s beginnings as well, and Trevor is equally psychotic. He too is paranoid and hallucinates an entire person into existence--about whom he then becomes entirely obsessive. But he starts from a bad place. Like Fight Club's Narrator/Jack, Trevor seems to have no family or friends, and is permanently sad, merely surviving his insomniac half-life. The steel-blue filter and eerie soundtrack add much to our impression of his depth of isolation. Trevor's "needy"relationships with only two women he knows are inadequate, and he soon starts to verbally abuse his prostitute girlfriend Stevie(Jennifer Jason-Leigh), driving her from his life. Trevor isn't exactly a stable human: when confronted with his derangement, he throws a violent tantrum.His wild, obsessed rooting-around his own garbage and cupboards is already indicative of this, not to mention his "forgetfulness" and need for Postits. But why does one of them actually question his identity? This hints at even deeper mental disintegration.Yes, he is "f'king psycho", just as Stevie accuses, because he's hallucinated his swaggering "friend" Ivan(John Sharian) into life, meaning no-one else in the machinist shop can see him; "Ivan"'s Firebird convertible is a phantom car; and "Ivan" just won't stay dead: when Trevor tries to dispose of his body, the "corpse" DISAPPEARS and "Ivan" becomes Trevor's DISCOVERER instead.As with Fight Club, the protagonist's most threatening hallucination is actually his alter-ego!"Maria" the mother-figure waitress sadly is also a hallucination, telegraphed by 1) her collection of inanimate objects (the record-player, the glass bowl, the red clown)--which turn out to be Trevor's dead mother's; 2) the repeated clock readouts stuck on 1:30 whenever Trevor hallucinates (possibly the time of his hit-and-run); and 3) the airport reveal, when the waitress who'd been serving him all this time is unfamiliar. Like "Ivan", there never was a "Maria" working there.To our relief, there's a cascade of resolutions near the end. Starting with his screaming match with Stevie over the fishing photo, Trevor is forced to confront his isomorphism with the looming "Ivan". In confusion, he flees to his airport waitress "Maria", who turns out to be someone else too. Actually, his perception of the unknown waitress is a good sign--his mind is starting to reintegrate/reconcile his hallucinations with the real world. Unfortunately he has another backwards-stumbling hallucination of "Ivan" in the car park, stalking him to Trevor's own home, as "Ivan" takes "Nicholas" to his doom.Trevor apparently "kills" "Ivan" in vengeance, but as per the opening, "Ivan" keeps remorphing, and the "kidnapped" child is nowhere to be seen. In Trevor's tortured mind, SOMEONE bled to death on his floor, hence his need to bleach the grouting; but Trevor seems to be suffering classic fractured-world paranoid schizophrenia.Because of "Ivan", Trevor's identity itself is in doubt, just as the Postit mooted, until he recalls WHERE he first saw "Maria": in the final 7mins Trevor remembers the panicked mother running back to her run-over son who, we surmise, is the original "Nicholas". Trevor's overwhelming guilt and its brought-on insomnia-come-psychosis drove him to 1) emotionally identify himself with his child-victim; 2) subconsciously report his own year-ago hit-and-run, citing his OWN rego number as the vehicle that hit him in his present-day self-induced accident (supposedly to discover "Ivan"'s address).In the present, Trevor's bathtime commiseration to Stevie that "It was my fault, I wasn't paying attention" is a Freudian-slip admission, rather than a falsehood about his deliberate"accident". Stevie's automatic reaction, that "hit-and-run drivers should be hanged" actually inspires Trevor's hangman game with himself. The iconic stick-figure is reinforced both by the graphics from the police report, and "Nicholas'" Mother's Day card on "Maria"'s imaginary fridge.Trevor's memories of a childhood ride at the pier when his mother was still alive, are reconstructed by his sick mind as a present-day ride with "Nicholas", full of terrifying (hallucinated) hangman displays. Taking a very similar photo of them as one of him and his mother exists in the family album, suddenly blurs hallucinated memory and present-day hallucination for Trevor. However, since the filmmakers never found a proper way to depict this blurring, we're left confused by the scene.Trevor's psychotic "memory" is indeed playing tricks on him. His hallucinations throw up new situations and characters that are one-by-one revealed as imaginary. He finally redredges his incipient holiday drive in the Firebird, and realizes the cowboy boots were his too, a year ago. They remained among Stevie's clients' left-behind belongings: Trevor really had been "one of (her) best clients".During one last hazy recollection, to our surprise we resolve Stevie, laughing in the Firebird's front passenger seat, enjoying their holiday drive. Not sure if this is meant to imply any more than their longtime relationship, because had she been present and cognizant of his hit-and-run crime at the time, this interpretation's house of cards collapses.Machinist repeats Fight Club's theme of sleep-deprivation driving men to psychosis. Its plot is relatively straightforward once we (usefully) ignore the editor's sneaky corpse-dumping opening scene, which left us distrustful of an objective narrative. From then on, clues are laden everywhere.Finally, the reason Trevor won't be needing his security deposit back from his landlady is because he knows he's going TO PRISON. His decision to turn himself in for his real hit-and-run crime is going to be his Salvation--he'll no longer hide from his guilt. Now he just needs some SLEEP.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it has been recommended me by too many friends of mine, although I thought that it could not be a big deal at all.So, one day I saw the DVD 2-set version very tiny prised and I bought it. Then I watched it at night, really insomniac experience. For sure, it didn't help me to fall asleep, there is some fine aesthetic, I have to admit and I appreciate it. But the story was really deeply boring. In fact, I could not found a single point can catch me. It is a pretty wild mix of some well-known masterpieces still lacking understanding why they were made and what they wanted to say. I have read already the previous comments, the source are named and cited, I don't want to repeat them. There is some Lynch influence but lacks his magic indetermination, there is some Hitchcock but lacks his thrill and dramatic.There could be a second layer in this movie but I am in doubt I am able to watch it one more time just to discover if there is or not something more I have missed.</fullReview>

Christian Bale spends most of the movie with this stupid "what? you're telling me I'm crazy?!" look on this face, eventually leading to a plot twist you can see coming from a mile away (or at least I did). Do yourself a favor and rent Fight Club or Memento instead, since those are the obvious influences for this dark, gross, depressing movie (fortunately, these movies are not dark, gross and depressing)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film - just not one that I personally could feel strongly about. It's one of those 'what's it about??' movies - like Sixth Sense or Memento. It does a reasonably good job of keeping you guessing till the very end with Christian bale doing an excellent wasted, ribs-sticking-out, anorexic look. He works as a tool operator in a factory and believes everyone's out to get him as events seem to conspire against him. Shot in moody, bleached bluish tones and with some fabulously atmospheric scenes (such as when he takes a young boy on a '666 ride' ghost train at the local fair), Machinist will probably be a hit but by the time the explanation came I was personally no longer interested and didn't think it justified the story anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right upfront, let me tell you that I didn't enjoy watching this movie one bit. That said, I have to be fair and admit that this movie perhaps could find its audience. It's suspenseful enough to keep you wishing to get to the end and find out what's going on. The cinematography is extremely expressive correctly conveying the movie message. Christian Bale is truly unbelievable in what he has done for this role. (By the way, the way he looks in the movie is NOT for the weak-hearted.) The dialogue is pretty decent, and the characters have been well developed. Overall, the movie is definitely unique. But a word of advice to anyone looking for a lighter fare: this movie is not for you. If you don't feel disturbed, you will be by the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A creepier and more suicidal version of Tyler Durden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As said in this review's title, the basic premise is still an uncommon one although it's increasingly often used in thrillers. The recipe of insomnia + hallucination + going crazy because of the first two things is strikingly similar to the one used in Fight Club (1999). But The machinist (2004) take it on a more realistic route, that is the dwindling weight and deteriorating physical shape. At the end this movie takes it a bit further to make guilt as the the biggest drive of the insomnia and hallucination, and that the need to sleep is the main purpose of the main character. I personally give a huge regard on how Christian Bale gave his great totality in all of his movies. And this movie more than others highlights that totality by having Bale slim down to an almost dangerous level of body weight. The other cast member also did quite a good job, but they pale in comparison to Bale's efforts to get in to character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From what I understand (or try to), Christian Bale is a normal factory worker until one day he hits a young boy with his car. He drives away, and over the course of a year he becomes an insomniac who fabricates realities and people, some of whom are actually real. His new imaginary friend causes him to confront himself about what he did and the movie culminates with him turning himself in.That's all well and good, except that this movie is an hour of things that either don't matter or are not resolved. Is Stevie referring to Trevor as a psycho in front of his face? How does he know things about both Maria or her son that turn out to be true? Why does the guy who loses his arm seem like he knows what's really going on? Why isn't there an APB out for Trevor? While I'm wholly impressed by Christian Bale's commitment to this role, the movie was laughable at its attempts to be meaningful.</fullReview>

It borrows heavily from Memento, Fight Club, The Usual Suspects and other movies in plot and design, but is unique.There was no part of the movie that I found fault with, but I would never recommend it to anyone. It twisted a story that could have been told compassionately and simply made it into a series of cold, upsetting scenes. This is one of the movies that tests exactly how desensitized you are to wanton violence, dramatized tragedy, and basic grossness. Suffice to say, as someone who watched Requiem for a Dream and was not bothered by the tone, I found this film unnecessarily visually off-putting and felt physically sick after one scene.I give it 6 stars because its merits earn it an 8, but the purpose of a movie is as entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget Batman! Forget American Psycho! In my personal opinion, "The Machinist" is Bale at his best. Not just because he literally starved himself for the role but his acting once again shines through. The film itself is a roller-coaster into paranoia and you'll keep guessing "What's going to happen next?" and as for the twist at the end, woahhhhhh!! This is a film about punishment and redemption; a man suffering from insomnia for over a year and as the year has gone on, his weight has exceedingly dropped but he carries on. That is until Ivan makes an appearance and his world turns around completely as he begins to lose the remnants of his insanity and he works hard to solve the mystery before he loses everything.I'm not going to give away the ending but I suggest for the first viewing, just watch the film. Watch it, become emerged into it. Then watch it a second time to figure out the clues. Trust me, even after many viewings, you will STILL be looking for clues. I guarantee it.This is definitely Bale's movie so if you're a Bale fan, then take the risk and buy it. However, this film isn't for everyone so unless you;re a die hard fan, rent it :-) 9/10 Helen xxxxx</fullReview>

This movie is definitely his best performance to date. He easily could get an Academy Awards nomination for this role. I was shocked to see how much weight he had lost, this is what acting is all about, to be able to completely turn into another character. The plot is great, although it did remind me a bit of "Secret Window"... but only a little bit, and not enough to say it was a trying to copy it in any way at all.In any case.. Christian's performance is an highlight. The movie itself draws the viewer into a series of questions during the whole time.. is he mad? is it real? is he a killer? soon it becomes evident that Reznik ( bale ) has gotten himself into a web of physic delusions and illusion. The movie remains exciting the whole time over.. A very good movie, with some very good acting. the cinematography is tops, and the director went out of his way , to give us the atmosphere of Madness.Mr. Bale has elevated himself with this Movie,and I hope to see more of him in the future. I'm surprised that he isn't nominate for an academy award, maybe it was too late for this years entry.Beta2000 ( it was better than VHS )</fullReview>

Basically, some guy with an irrelevant trauma that nobody cares about and it's not worth even talking about it? That's the machinist. Over explanatory conversations, overacted characters, trying to create tension and basically just making you feel like fast forwarding. Maybe it has some Spanish influence, unfortunately, form that 'new wave' of Spanish cinema that relies on the "gotcha!" twist at the end, unbelievable story lines and characters nobody cares about. This sounds very negative, but I had to do it. It annoyed me so much. There was a moment in the film you could guess what was coming next.

		<shortDescription>To see Christian Bale like this is a major shock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Machinist' (or 'El maquinista', its alternative title) is a Spanish film in English language. It is a strong psychological movie, a movie of extremely moody nature and one that is difficult to digest for some.Christian Bale portrays Trevor Reznik, the title character. Trevor has had chronic insomnia for a year and a drastic loss of weight. The results of this are very visible: his corpse-like appearance, his puzzling behavior, his impossibility of concentration, his insanity and his obsession on the idea that every bizarre event in his life is purposely meant to drive him nuts.The film is extremely weird and bizarre. Plus, it is clearly one of (more than dark) sinister nature. Not just for the story and the bizarre stuff, but also for the extremely dark backgrounds/sceneries that only accent this feeling of creepiness.For this role, Christian Bale went through a brutal loss of weight as a personal decision. To achieve that, he went on a radical diet for something like 4 months. Actually, he wanted to lose even more weight, but the filmmakers didn't allow that because of concerns related to health. He is unrecognizable in this film. Who would say that this is the kid from 'Empire of the Sun'? I sincerely think it's crazy that he subjected himself to this, not only damaging his health but also exposing his health and life to serious risks. That is so dangerous! It's incredible what people do for money...Until I watched this movie, I had never heard of it and didn't know what was it about. I got to see it because a friend of mine has the DVD and he loaned me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining thriller with plenty for the mind to chew over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst watching The Machinist, I couldn't help but notice the similarities between it and a handful of other recent movies which have unravelled in a similar manner. The narrative structure borrows heavily from recent hits such as The Fight Club, Identity, Memento, Insomnia and The Sixth Sense but despite this, I still found myself gripped by this tale of a loner desperately trying to understand the strange occurrences happening all around him. Director Brad Anderson fills the film with so much for the viewer to think about that one forgives him for being somewhat derivative (check out IMDb's trivia notes for some great facts, and then watch the film again - you'll see the film in a whole new light).Christian Bale deserves much of the credit for his portrayal of Trevor Reznik, a machine operator in a factory whose life is not all it at first seems. All skin and bones, Bale is barely recognisable ? his dedication to his art lead him to shed 60 pounds in order to play the part ? and he gives a performance that will haunt you long after you have seen the film.The other players give equally strong performances; Michael Ironside is his usual dependable self, John Sharian is superb as the malevolent Ivan and Jennifer Jason Leigh is still looking good playing the tart with the heart.In fact, it is only the final denouement that stops the film from being a wholly successful affair; the ultimate revelation is not as immediately powerful as that in the film it most closely resembles in style, the Sixth Sense. Whereas the twist in Shyalaman's film came in a totally unexpected way, The Machinist never hides the fact that we are heading towards a 'clever' ending. Consequently, the impact is somewhat diluted (although it does linger in the mind for a some time afterwards, as you slowly digest what you have seen).But this is a minor quibble with what is a thoroughly entertaining film. Enjoy it for what it is ? a competently made, well acted, above-par thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>** What the hell!***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to say first that I thought Christian Bale played this character well, he is a good actor, he really looked and breathed the part of an delusional, paranoid insomniac. However, the film I think is too clever for it's own good, with lots of symbolism involved,(make sure you don't miss a bit of the film otherwise you could have missed something vital to the film's plot.) He is always washing his hands with bleach, the Post It notes on the fridge with a hangman, the dark overtone of the film. The story of the film is lacking something... maybe a fully fledged story, but it does have something, I am going to watch this film again and pick up bits that I missed. I was actually mesmerized with the shear darkness of the film, but I actually thought that the ending was going to knock my socks off..... but unfortunately it didn't. Overall it was a weird film that once I had watched it thought.... what the hell, is it good or is it a bad film, I will have to watch it again and make up my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Machinist VS The First 8 Minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with a very dark and strange atmosphere that makes you curious to see what will happen next.But while the time passes the movie gets boring and I think that the director wanted to do something different than this.He is trying to say something in the beginning but after he becomes confused and lose the story. Also this year I saw another movie which has a same end and it is short movie about 30 minutes.It is called "The first 8 minutes" and if "The machinist" gets 5 to 10 (for me) the "first 8 minutes" gets 9 to 10!!! It is a short film and for anyone who likes to see it send an email in the address : extravaganza_sette@yahoo.gr and ask them to send it to you. This is how I got it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Trevor Reznik has slept in a year, he starts to doubt his own mentality. Not sleeping for a year he is very thin, very thin; so thin its scary. Trevor works at a machining company and when an accident cut off a fellow workers arm, people start doubting him; thinking that he's a heroin junkie and losing his sanity. His only two friends is a prostitute Stevie and a waitress at the airport, Marie.The theme a paranoia and identity crisis has been done a lot; Meneto, Pefect Blue, Identity, Fight Club, Insomnia, American Psycho, and its been done good before, but in the Machinist its not as good as it should have been. The story is abit thin and its very noticeable, the movie is a slow burn and takes ages to build up. This one is hard to put together as well, it doesn't give you many clues, with there only being about 5 jigsaw pieces, instead of about 20 pieces. But there isn't a lot to this as there isn't a lot of depth to it. If there were more sub-plots and if it moved at a quicker pace it would have been more intense.The direction is detailed and the cinema photography is great. the use of blue-grey washes added a very bleak, depressed mood. Reflective surfaces are used to great extent; reflecting Trevors distorted and fractured life. The acting isn't great, but Christian Bale does a good job, but you keep focusing more on his body than his acting. You kinda need to watch this twice, once to see his stick of a body, then the second time to pick up all the pieces you missed from the first distraction.This is more of a mood piece than a thriller, its kinda like if fight club was an art house film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful masterpiece of a movie, it just keeps you glued to your seat, has it just pulls you in. The movie takes a Alfred Hitchcock like turn to it. In the world of Trevor Reznik(Christian Bale) fear and paranoia take an interesting turn, has his life becomes a mixed up puzzle, he has not slept for a year, his health is fading(I mean he has a real skinny frame, he makes it frighting to look at him). But things begin to get scary when he keeps finding little notes on his fridge, and feels blamed for a co workers accident(Michael Ironside). And meets Ivan(John Sharian) a co worker everybody says is not real. Is Trevor losing his sanity, or is somebody playing bad tricks on him. Christian Bales best performance ever. He really tried to make himself in the role, by getting really I mean really skinny. The movie has great suspense. It was worth it.</fullReview>

Could seem to some people as a new version of the Stephen king's book based film. U wont waste ur time watching it at all although. Very, very good indeed ;) .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark secret exposed to the light of truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** Dark and depressing movie about a guilty past thats above and beyond everything thats done by the person responsible for it; who' been trying to suppress it for over a year. Not being able to sleep or eat properly Trevor Reznik, Christian Bale,has dropped to under 120 lbs. from his normal 180 lbs. six foot two inch,frame looking like he's a concentration camp survivor. Working at the machine plant one day Trevor is spotted by Ivan, John Sharian, who seems to know a lot about him and tells Trevor that he works with him at the plant. Never seeing Ivan in his life, much less at work, this plays on Trevor's mind to the point where he asks his fellow workers who this Ivan is. Trevor is told that one one ever saw him on the work-floor or even knew him. One day at work helping fellow worker Miller, Michael Ironsides, with the machinery Trevor sees Ivan who for some reason gave him the slit throat sign.Trevor is so startled by seeing him he backs up hitting the activator button on the machine that Miller was working on causing him to lose his left arm.Even though Trevor is exonerated for the accident that cost Miller his arm, and even Miller forgave him for what happened, no one at the factory wants to work with Trevor. Trevor still holds,not just himself responsible for Millers loss, that Ivan had something to do with the accident and wants to find Ivan who he feels is somehow trying to do him in, but why? This Ivan is a very odd duck looking like Marlon Brando's portrayal of Col. Walter E. Kurtz in the movie "Apocalypes Now" with two of his toes grafted on his left hand to replace two missing fingers,looking like claws. He not only keeps popping up in Trevors life but has a connection with a number of people that Travor knows like Reynolds, who Ivan said that he replaced in "The Pit", in the plant. Ivan also knows Stevie,Jennifer Jason Leigh, a hooker who Travor's frequents. Trevor found that out through a photo that he took from Ivan's wallet as if Ivan left it at the bar on purpose for Travor's to steal it from him that he found in Stevies apartment. Ivan's wallet also contains a photo of Reynolds, who claimed that he never knew Ivan, on it together with Ivan showing off a catch that they had while out fishing! The story gets even weirder when Trevor's girlfriend Marie,Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, a waitress at the airport diner turns out to be a figment of his imagination. Trevor finds that out when he's told by the waitress at the diner that she, like Ivan at the machine plant, never worked there. Trevor knowing Ivan's car license goes so far as to get himself hit by a speeding car so he could report the license plate to the police in a hit and run report. All this to find out if this Ivan, who's license plate number he gave, is for real only to find out, to his surprise, that the plate number of the car was that of his car that he reported stolen by him last year! Slowly losing his mind Trevor again sees Ivan's car in the streets one night and follows it to his apartment seeing that he had Marie's young son Nicholas, Matthew Romero-Moore, with him. Following Ivan &amp; Nicholas into the apartment Trevor is told by Ivan that he just murdered the young boy leading Trevor to get into a fight with him slitting his throat; like the death sigh that Ivan gave him at the factory earlier in the film, killing him. Wraping up Ivan's body in a rug and taking it out at night to dispose it into the ocean Trevor finds out to his surprise that there's no body in the rug and that there never was any Ivan, he only existed in poor Trevor's sick and disturbed mind! It's then when everything that was safely hidden in the dark reaches of Trevor's mind started to reveal itself to him as he realized what he did and that he had to pay for his crime. It's then that Trevor finally made peace with himself as he gave himself up to the police to face the bar of justice.Very weird movie who's confusing story is more then made up by it's powerful surprise ending that ties all the loose ends together for those of us who were still around watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For fans of Memento... this is a terrifyingly dark, twisting descent into one man's extreme psychological hell &amp; anguish. Here's a man so tormented, he hasn't slept a wink in over a year. Christian Bale (our new Batman) nearly killed himself preparing for this role. In an unbelievably dangerous transformation, the 6 foot 2 actor (who normally weighs 185 lbs) wasted his body away, starving himself down to a skeletal 120 lbs. How was he able to remember his lines, let alone focus on acting? Did he need serious medical attention while filming this? Bug-eyed, horribly emaciated, and acting out various stages of extreme insomnia, hallucinatory paranoia and delusional disorder, Bale gives one of the most amazing screen performances I've ever seen.</fullReview>

Risking the own life to make a movie should not be an option. I prefer not to watch a great movie rather than see the actors/actresses torture his/her own body only for causing an impressive effect on a movie.If you think that yes, making a good movie allows any excess, then...what is the limit?

Watch this movie and see what a suspense is all about, because this movie has you thinking a lot of things at once, it's definitely a thinking mans movie. You think that he is just a sinister person that he must be killing out of his own dream world he lives in, yet it has been created out of his guilt of a crime that he had committed and was trying to keep it hidden, it's a brilliant movie, from top to bottom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot Of Mystery But Still A Bizarre Movie That Didn't Really Pull Me In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through the opening scenes of the movie, I for some reason immediately thought of "American Psycho" - probably because of Christian Bale and the whole prostitute angle. Then, when it was revealed that Trevor (Bale) hadn't slept for a year (and was obviously losing his grip on reality) I started thinking of "Insomnia." The problem with a movie that makes me think of those two movies is that I didn't care for either one! Same with this. It just didn't hit home with me.Bale's performance was good. He certainly nailed the part of Trevor - a guy who's obviously going off the deep end and becoming increasingly paranoid. There's also no question that there's enough mystery involved in this as we try to piece together the increasingly bizarre things that are happening in Trevor's life and to come up with an explanation for them. Those two things together mean that this certainly isn't an awful movie, but it also doesn't come anywhere close to the heights of greatness that some seem to have assigned to it. The strong points aside, the story didn't really work that well for me. I had trouble getting into it at the beginning, and even once the mystery finally grabbed me, my own feeling was that there were just too many twists and turns, too much bizarre-ness, and nothing that would even give the viewer a hint of the ultimate solution to the mystery, which eliminated the fun of trying to figure the thing out, which means that the ending certainly came as a surprise to me. Personally, though, I prefer to be surprised because I've figured the mystery out incorrectly, not because there was nothing to allow me to try to figure the mystery out! My own feeling was that it was what might be described as "upper-mediocre." 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen this creepy plot before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put succinctly, The Machinist isn't worth your time. You can see plenty of other creepy noir thrillers where the plot is about blocked memories (try 'Memento' or 'Fight Club', both much, much better). But why bother? The plot is more predictable than the writer would like you to think; judging from the documentary included in my DVD, he is just warming up to his subject matter, so let's not encourage him. But one critical reason to NOT see this film is to see Hollywood's new anorexia poster boy, Christian Bale, a man who truly takes Method Acting to a new low: 119 pounds. Thank God he has had a good run in 'Batman Begins', otherwise Bale would have this and 'American Psycho' to frame his career. What a shame. Good news: The photography is quite wonderful and the direction is good too. But a movie is more than pretty pictures and actors pacing their lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bale's transformation is shocking, but in the service of what? A ridiculous, pretentious, overwrought story that seems to think throwing in Dostoevsky is somehow a sign of intellectual depth. The pov of this story is muddled beyond belief -- although clearly not in "the real world" we are neither in lunatic land (too realistically presented) nor slowly going insane ville (as Bale's own physical appearance cuts against that; he's clearly six degrees around the bend already). Much of the symbolism is belabored and obvious -- if you haven't figured it all out by halfway through the picture, you need to see more movies -- and the actual lines are often wince-inducing. It's such a shame the acting is stellar throughout, as it seems like such a waste. I actually walked out of this, one of the rare times I've ever done that. One of the worst movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyably dark but lacks development and the conclusion is less than satisfying (mild suggestive spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trevor Reznik is a machinist in a typically greasy and intensive factory. For almost a year he has not slept and the effects on his health are clear for all to see as his weight has fallen off to leave him so thin that he barely exists and so worn looking that he looks steps from death. His tiredness also feeds his paranoia ? although it may be that he is rightly paranoid in this case as someone seems to be putting him under pressure over something that he cannot figure out. An accident at work turns his colleagues against him; a mystery man who nobody else knows seems to be stalking him and someone is leaving notes on his fridge door ? playing a deadly game of hangman with him.The premise for this film sounds brilliant and many who love the weird thrillers that recent years have seen will be flocking to this hoping for more of the same. In this regard the film will offer great hope to such viewers from the opening minute onwards because it gets the atmosphere spot on from the get-go. It all feels very tense and edgy and we are never in doubt (like Reznik) that something is going on and we want to uncover what it is. This mood is created and supported by great direction from Anderson, who paints the film so dark that it was sometimes hard to see ? even the bright outdoor scenes feel like they have had the colour bleached out of them.That the film lacks atmosphere is not a problem that this one ever has to deal with, for it has it in spades. No, the problem begins as I started to want to build on this atmosphere and start to give me more intrigue and development as it builds to a strong ending. Sadly it didn't do this aspect well enough ? the film never really tells us anymore or makes much more happen; red herrings along the way are dismissed mere minutes after they are started and they don't provide a wider story. When the answers come, they come all at once at the end ? a delivery that isn't helped by the fact that the conclusion is actually not that strong and pretty much does what most of us would have expected even if the detail wasn't guessed. This is a shame because the air of dark mystery was so well done that it really had me interested and the way that it didn't seem to have much to do before the ending acted as a bit of a let down.However, this is not to say that it was terrible because it was far from being that. Although I'm not one for style over substance, here the atmosphere really carries it while the material provides just enough movement to keep me interesting ? it was just a bit frustrating that it didn't do the latter better. The atmosphere is only helped by a wasting performance from Bale ? an actor whose massive weight loses and gains can only help his reputation generally. He is sickeningly thin, haggard throughout and convincingly paranoid; he is the core of the film and he is a big reason that it works. The support cast features plenty of well-known faces but few of them are well used and seem only to have been cast in order to throw the audience in different directions. Leigh is good, Ironside is a presence and people like Gilliard and Sanchez-Gijon do well; Sharian is a strange menacing presence but does it reasonably well but really the film belongs to Bale and it is hard to imagine anyone managing to steal it from him.Overall this is an enjoyably dark thriller with a wicked atmosphere and mystery within it. Such a shame then that the story doesn't build on this and instead just seem to plod along with the odd red-herring here and there before rushing it all out at once in a plausible but strangely unsatisfying ending. Director and star both do their damnedest to make it work and it is to their credit that it nearly succeeds but it is an underdeveloped script from Kosar that proves itself to be lacking when called upon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure something good came out of the making of this movie. Perhaps somebody, who might otherwise have been struggling for the rent, was employed and made an honest dollar out of this production. Perhaps a cat, that would otherwise have been run over, lived beneath the wheels of one of the Winnebago's and got a saucer of milk every once in a while. Perhaps a fly, who would have died, hungry and alone, found a crumb of cheese, the leftovers from some extra's sandwich.I have never written a review before. The swill we're fed these days arrives with such regularity that it passes through my system long before my taste buds register the will to care. However, every now and then, I raise my weary lids and quietly, secretly, dare to anticipate. Admittedly, each one of these moments of youthful innocence is crushed with such an inevitability it says something about my short term memory (a different story altogether) that I continue to succumb to the hack Hollywood illusionists. But I do. They got me again. Firstly it was the trailer. Rule no.1 If the trailer is good, the film ain't. I ignored Rule no.1. Then the reviews. Luminaries like "Fight Club" and "Memento". "Echoes of Hitchcock, Lynch, Kafka and Dostoyevsky" Todd McCarthy, Variety. Todd, are you kidding me? But wait. Once again I forget. The propaganda machine spreads its insidious tentacles far and wide. I must be stupid. But perhaps it's just because i'm powerless. Like a prisoner condemned to his dying day, I trick myself into following the slightest flickers of light. Hoping that perhaps they might warm my fingertips as I fester in my light-less cell. What is there otherwise? I forget because it means there is a future tending away from the current order. A future in which these films don't exist.Thank you Machinist. Thank you for finally, crushing those lasts flutters of hope. The machinery is in place. Ignorance won't save me. I need to accept.I guess this is just the way of it these days.p.s Go see this film. It's enlightening.</fullReview>

The problem is that this film played with my perceptions way too much. As a consequence, I felt cheated and disrespected like the whore in the film. With the classic psycho-dramas, I felt the time invested mindfully watching paid off. It compares with "Momento" on several levels, but isn't done with as much elegance. If you like your psychological chain jerked around, see this movie. If you like watching people get beat-up, murdered, in pain with lots of blood, this is YOUR film ... not mine. The actor crossed the line in losing weight for the part, in my book. I suppose this is the way the film industry is headed.

		<shortDescription>My Review IS a Spoiler (And a Meta-Review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to begin with an apology. Not only am I going to come right out and explain what this movie is about, I am going to make a few remarks about the other reviews that I have read about this movie. I saw the film for the first (and second) time just last night, and like most people, I thought it was a very smart and thoughtful piece. However, many people seem to be praising the film for all the wrong reasons, and the few who have something negative to say about it, don't seem to understand what it is exactly they are complaining about. One or two people truly seem to 'get it', but seem content to keep their thoughts to themselves. I will not be so coy.Let's be straight. The Machinist is the story of a fat and terribly insecure man who does nothing but consume his entire life, and in the end, consumes that as well. After loosing his hand in an industrial accident at work, and collecting a settlement check nearly as fat as himself, he tries to overcompensate for the fact that the only way he can get laid is to pay for it. He buys himself a really nice car, and begins acting all cool and macho like some idealized guy in his mind (Ivan), doing things like smoking cigarettes. He's an easily distracted fella though, he did manage to get his hand chopped off at work remember, and runs a red light one day while lighting his cigarette. Of course, he runs over a child. Being the heroic upright citizen this man is, he promptly goes on a fishing trip and hides from the police. After about a year or so, he cannot deal with the guilt any longer, has a total nervous breakdown, and contemplates killing himself. This last part is the only part we actually get to see on screen. I have seen lots of reviews raving about the amazing job that Christopher Nolan has done losing 60lbs. These would most likely be fellow actors. No one seems to question why it would be necessary for his character to be that underweight. The few that do posit that it has to do with the character guilt, and the fact that he hasn't slept in a year. No. The character is fat and in denial about basically his entire life. Denial so strong it has him on the verge of hanging himself. No real human being could go an entire year without sleep. These things were all in the characters mind. He saw himself as scrawny and beat up, because he was emotionally beating himself up, and denying himself the "reward" he used to find in food that caused him to be overweight in the first place. But here is the real twist, get ready. Many people have called this a "depressing" film, however I see something uplifting in it. You see, we are all consumers. We smoke our cigarettes, and catch our fish, and eat our food, and occasionally do something stupid like run over a small child. We constantly affect the world around us in everything that we do. We are all Machinists. The only thing that holds this crazy society together is the guilt and the shame that we feel for our negative actions. Without it, we would have anarchy and primal law. Our guilt and shame is what makes us uniquely human. Our gift from God. We can either master it or let it master us; succumbing to depression, addiction, and suicide, like our friend in the movie. Feeling bad is what makes us good. Hence, I began this review with an apology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should say first off that the ending for this film is very similar to that of Fight Club, where you find out something you think is real actually isn't. Anyway, Trevor Reznik (a very skinny Christian Bale) suffers severe insomnia, he hasn't slept for a year, and as time goes by with certain post-it notes he is supposedly leaving himself on the fridge, and cutting the arm off co-worker Miller (Michael Ironside), he questions his sanity. He attempts to investigate what seems to be a plot against him, getting two women, Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Marie (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón) involved, and also a mysterious man named Ivan (John Sharian) hanging around. As he investigates, more and more of his past comes back to him, and after discovering that Ivan is in fact himself, Trevor comes to realise the reason for his insomnia, he hit a child with his car, and everything he has been through fits around that, so in the end he lets the cops put him in a cell, where he can finally sleep. Also starring Larry Gilliard Jr. as Jackson, Reg E. Cathey as Jones, Anna Massey as Mrs. Shrike, Matthew Romero Moore as Nicholas, Robert Long as Supervisor Furman, Colin Stinton as Inspector Rogers, Craig Stevenson as Tucker, Ferran Lahoz as Gonzales, Jeremy Xido as Evangelisti and Norman Bell as DMV Clerk. Bale apparently dropped from about 180 pounds to 120 by eating nothing but a tin of tuna and an apple a day, which is said to be the record weight loss, but it was to get into the part. The film was okay, it was certainly dark and disturbing, and Bale did look the part, but it just felt like something I might have seen before. Worth watching, at least once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can't figure out the mystery before it's revealed, you might think it's a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christian Bale stars as an insomniac factory worker who begins to lose his sanity. This is the kind of movie that has a mysterious character, unknown and unseen by all except the protagonist, pop up. We know pretty much instantly that this mystery person doesn't exist, and, given the hundred other movies of the last decade where it has happened, we assume that it's a manifestation of the protagonist's psyche. In The Machinist, it's particularly easy to guess it all, because we're told from the outset that Bale hasn't slept for a whole year. We know he's probably hallucinating, so we know that everything we see him experience is possibly not real. This is also the kind of film where images and actions are repeated, so we can figure that these things are involved in some kind of major event that happened before the story started (perhaps the time Bale stopped sleeping, eh?). If we can stick it out to the end, we'll know the whole story. Brad Anderson's direction is pretty good, I'll admit, but we've seen The Machinist a hundred times since the beginning of this decade. If you've seen films like Memento, Mulholland Dr., Takashi Miike's Box, Fight Club, The Sixth Sense, Stay, or The Secret Window, you've already seen The Machinist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone and his mother have made such a big deal about the no-food diet Christian Bale went through to prepare for his role in the Machinist, and I, admittedly was sort of pumped and psyched to see this mad tale.. But, just like in Brad Anderson's previous film, the godawful "Session 9", this seems to be a whole lot of hype about nothing.While I appreciated the story, and liked Bale's character a lot, this movie essentially was a lot of bunk, tied together very VERY loosely at the ends, but leaving a lot of strings dangling that you have to figure out for yourself. I mean, I like a good psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the end of why things were happening the way they were (eg, The Sixth Sense was brilliant at this) but when the Big Explanation comes at the end of The Machinist, I was left with the expression of "HUH?" that totally didn't solve anything, and making me dislike the movie more every time I think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Unappetizing Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see nearly two hours of the emaciated corpse of Christian Bale, dragging himself across the screen in one of the slowest, banal, revolving (note: I did not say evolving) and revolting plots, take a seat.However, having made the mistake of watching this horror, I would not recommend this to anyone, except maybe a masochist. The movies that it's being compared to, were all unique and far better developed than this rehash.This flick has no substance. At the end, you are left with a sinking feeling that you have just wasted two hours of your life, watching nothing memorable except, Jennifer Jason Leigh's breasts, which are beautiful. In fact they stole the show from the rest of the cast.The 2 stars are for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, fascinating, with an underwhelming ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that is fascinating to watch since it is a mental riddle unfolding- a bit like SPIDER. However, once you know the riddle you will probably go- that's it?? I felt rather let down by the ending of the movie and also the main idea of the movie is a bit far fetched. One main part of the movie is that the central character, played by a SEVERELY emaciated Christian Bale (props to Christian for looking the part!) can't sleep. Yet, at no moment in the movie is this ever actually addressed. He NEVER attempts anything to make him sleep, yet he says he really wants to sleep throughout it. You would think that one day, he would do something drastic to try and fall asleep, like have some warm milk and a few valiums. I can't possibly recommend this movie because there are so many others in the "what the hell is really happening here" genre that outdo it. American PSYCHO was far better- another Christian Bale movie. Also in the genre and far better than this movie is John Cusack in IDENTITY. MACHINIST IS NOT A DATE MOVIE! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Christian Bale but not in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love watching Christian Bale act. He was amazing in the Batman movies but I could not stomach this movie. Seeing Christian in this emaciated state was disturbing. I was unable to watch more than 20 minutes of the movie before I turned it off. If you are someone who cannot watch disturbing movies I recommend not watching this one. Personally I have seen people like this in real life and they can't help the way they look they are suffering from malnutrition because of the hand life has dealt them, but for an actor of his caliber to intentionally make himself look like this is devastating and very hard to watch. Not sure why the casting director didn't just choose an actor who was already bony instead of having Christian do this to himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing American Psycho I've started to watch as many movies I find with Christian Bale, but this one actually was i disappointment. The only thing that kept me from not turning the movie off was that I had to find out one simple question, why? And when I find out, it was like "yeah OK, that's obvious". During all of the movie I was waiting for it to take a turn and hoping that something would happen. Have to say that I was surprised to see that the rates on this movie was so high. It must be something I haven't understood with it.It's a dark movie which I usually likes, but only if it's realistic. It was also too slow. I don't know, maybe some people likes that. Well, I gave the movie a 4 out of 10, and that's only cause of Christians performance...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promoted Promise of a Great Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointed.The Machinist was promoted with promise of a great film. Unfortunately, it was not. Movies of this genre require a greater vision and talent on the directors' part. It was as if Brad Anderson desperately tried to reproduce Christopher Nolan's 2000 "Memento" with Marc Caro &amp; Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 1991 "Delicatessen". Christian Bale as usual preformed well, though the film would have been more successful casting an actor less familiar and of the required physic of Trevor's character.Finely, Brad Anderson emphasized the great lengths to portray an L.A. environment in Barcelona, Then later describes his attempt to portray nondescript local in the director commentary on the DVD. This inconsistency was apparent throughout the duration of the film. One should be skeptical of the future film announced by Anderson, "The Crazies", for the plot has been over used since the beginning of zombie flicks produced since the 60's. It will be very difficult for Anderson to come close to Danny Boyle's 2003 film, "28 Days Later".</fullReview>

Let's have a whole lot of random odd things happen and in the end it will turn out the guys nuts. What a smart idea! Buddy it's been done. Do something new for the love of God! Like really, first there was Fight Club, then there was Identity, then there was Secret Window. It's just not a twist any more. You can now see it coming and you now say, "What, not this again." So this film gets a 1 for ripping off so many others. Go see the films that started the trend, like Fight Club, not the pieces of trash that rip them off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this picture has any meaning to it or is trying to make a point about something, I sure didn't get it. The movie doesn't let you know what is happening until the last few minutes of the film, so it requires that you sit through almost an hour and a half wondering what is going on.The dark gloomy atmosphere, together with the dark gloomy characters in the film help make it even more unpleasant. We know something is going on, but there is no hint of it until the movie is over.Also, the principal character was unbelievable. The main character is said to have lost over 60 pounds for this part and he certainly looks skinny, but I have to wonder why it was necessary, except possibly publicity, since this film doesn't have much else going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great hitchcockian movie and one of the year's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Machinist Rated R (violence and disturbing images, sexuality, and language) ***1/2/out of 4Sitting through "The Machinist", you'll feel as if you're watching good, old-fashioned Hitchcock suspense. The story focuses around Christian Bale, who hasn't slept in a year, and who is extremely skinny. An accident occurs in the factory he works at and the whole movie he thinks that people are after him. He's paranoid as hell. So, the whole movie the viewer is thinking, "is this guy crazy?"...or, "was that real?" Anyway, without giving any spoilers away, the final payoff is very believable and truly satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminded me of "Memento"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Machinist" is a dark drama all about an unrecognizable Bale as a gaunt machinist who hasn't slept in a year and looks to be a sandwich away from the grave as we observe his daily activities which invariably include some peculiar and irreconcilable events. The film opens with the protagonist dumping a corpse and then flashes back where it spends the rest of the run working it's way back to it beginning in a series of interesting if not compelling and strange if not unsettling happenings. As the film wears on we get the notion it is either a well done work which is trying to get us to empathize with a likable but delusional man or a shoddy film which is trying to delve into the realm of the paranormal. Fortunately, it's the former and a solid watch for drama enthusiasts who like curious plots (ala "Memento") with protagonists who are suffering from them. (B+)</fullReview>

IMDb has never steered me wrong in the past, but this movie was just terrible. Horrible acting, horrible story that steals from every other movie ever made and is hard to follow, and it was just a terrible movie overall. I kept wanting to turn it off, but I thought to myself "this has to get interesting some time." I was wrong. I finally turned it off a little over and hour through it because I just couldn't take it anymore.Everything that happens in this movie never gets explained. I hated most of the characters.

		<shortDescription>Truly Awful (Watch Eternal Sunshine or Fight Club Instead)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is utterly, utterly dreadful! I urge you not to see it! It is chock full of plot holes and inaccuracies. The script is terrible, the dialogue is laboured and false sounding. I realise now that the film was originally produced in Spanish, however anyone with the remotest idea of how normal conversation works would have been able to spot some of the howlers within this film.As I have said in the title of this piece, two films which tell similar stories to this and which do so much more effectively are Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Fight Club. Now on the DVD case, there was emblazoned the tag: "Memento meets Fight Club". I have not seen Memento, but I adore Fight Club, it is splendidly disorientating, and plays the two people as one thing very effectively. It tries and fails also to pull off the "beginning at the end" trick that Eternal Sunshine does so well. In a sense this film is a bad (very, very bad) amalgamation of these two wonderful films and should be avoided at all costs.It literally throws its hat at Eternal Sunshine again in trying to set the whole film as a dream, but where Eternal Sunshine was able to be a dream but remain believable, this film is a nonsense from about ten minutes in until the end.It also did the same thing as that film Crash, which everyone raved about and which even won 3 Oscars (including Best Picture) in 2006. At the end of this film, in a desperate attempt to pull all the characters' stories together so that they were 'interlinked', the writer threw them all into the same situation. The Machinist does the same thing. Because the story tries to be so confusing throughout, all the loose ends are tied up in the last few minutes. I dislike films which do this because they assume that people who watch movies nowadays cannot cope with any kind of complexity.On the whole, after a promising first few minutes, this film is diabolical!</fullReview>

It feels like, just to get noticed by the cute girls and popular guys in the classroom, he decided to try making a 10 minute video into a 2 hour feature. It feels like, due to a complete lack of creativity or originality, he turned this 2 hour feature into a ripoff of every psychological thriller ever made. It feels like he told the actors to read their scripts off cue cards and give performances worthy of 2 A.M. soap operas. It feels like he wanted to be clever and witty by having a twist ending that he thought no one would see until the last 10 minutes.It feels like I've wasted 6 dollars and 2 hours of my life watching this.Till Batman Begins, Christian Bale.

		<fullReview>Like I have said in past comments, we watch 365+ movies a year at my house. This movie was the pits. I don't knock a movie just because I don't like an actor/actress, I try to write up a description as I would recommend a movie to a friend. I had never seen any of Christian Bale's acting before this. His acting was fine from what I saw, but the starvation bit was too much for me. All it did was depress the heck out of me and I could not pay attention to the plot for staring at his bag-of-bones body and stick-thin arms. It was borderline sickening. Why would you starve yourself and risk organ failure and/or heart attack like this? I have heard of suffering for your craft, but this was ridiculous. I would have turned it off, but my husband will always watch a movie to the bitter end. If it was up to me, it would not have lasted ten minutes. If you want to be grossed out by starvation, hey, rent the thing. The other actors and actresses he interacted with were fine and normal people. I noticed the "Year 2000" blue color we were all supposed to be using also. What was it, cerulean blue or something similar? If you remember, this was used heavily in "Joe Vs. The Volcano" to show us the depression of working in a lousy office job. In "Machinist" it's used to depress us in the tool and die factory. Please, I have to end this now and erase this movie from my memory.</fullReview>
