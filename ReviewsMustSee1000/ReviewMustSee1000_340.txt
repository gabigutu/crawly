		<fullReview>In a time when we are almost constantly barraged with goofy spoof films, it's amazing that no one had come out with a spoof of the James Bond films until 1997. Those movies have been coming out and just BEGGING to be spoofed since the early 60s, and Mike Meyers is the one who finally steps forward to do what simply has to be done, and he does a wonderful job at it.Fans of the James Bond films will have a blast looking for all of the allusions to the old Bond films and trying to determine which Bond film is being spoofed at any given time, but it's important to keep in mind that the film pokes fun at the Bond series in good taste. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is never disrespectful to the films that it makes fun of, which is probably the single most important thing about a spoof film that makes it good. This is why the Scary Movies, as just a couple of examples, were such dismal, hideous failures. They try to be funny by viciously making fun of all kinds of movies, and end up looking stupid because they have such a nonexistent right to do that. You can't make a stupid, stupid movie and make fun of a lot of great movies (and some not so great, admittedly) and try to pretend to be respectable at the end of it all. That's the recipe for a crapfest.While it's true that a lot of the comedy in the first Austin Powers film is slapstick and obviously contrived, I think it should be a testament to the quality of the film that it is still so funny! We see all of the traditional Bond clichés in this movie, such as the usual one-liners (which are made fun of extensively and with spectacular effect here), the fancy cars, the goofy cockiness, the teeth-grinding theme song, and the occasionally inexplicable popularity with the women (this allusion makes most sense when compared to those Bond films that starred Roger Moore).The plot involves a rivalry between Dr. Evil, an evil mastermind bent on world domination, and Austin Powers, a mockish caricature of James Bond, bent on stopping Dr. Evil's world domination schemes. Meyers portrays both characters with hilarious skill, making Austin an awkward womanizer with some serious dental problems, and Dr. Evil an evil schemer with a hilarious cutesy side. Neither character really seems like they belong in the role that they serve (as a spy and a doctor of evil), which is where a lot of the comedy comes in. There is also, of course the fact that they both spend most of the movie 30 years in their future, completely out of touch with the new world that they live in.This is not a movie to be taken seriously, and quite frankly, I can't understand all of these reviews that I've read on the IMDb that are constantly complaining that Austin Powers is so cheesy or so childish. I've heard this same complaint about lots of other movies that are also not meant to be taken seriously, but this one is especially confusing. I trust that all you people complaining about how childish Austin Powers is realize that it is a spoof based on a whole series of movies that are also not meant to be taken seriously, right? I mean, that would be a hell of an oversight to miss that little detail. Austin Powers is one of the most refreshing comedies to come along in years, and it's sad that there are so many people who completely missed the boat on this one just because they pretend that the movie is something that it's not and was never meant to be. It's true that the movie is immensely immature and that it has unfortunately little re-watch value (one of the biggest problems with the film), but the quality of the comedy is unmistakable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's A Fast-Moving 90 Minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers: Man of Mystery I'm embarrassed to admit this one-and-a-half hours of hedonistic humor was so enjoyable, but it was, and the two sequels weren't bad, either, but not as good as this one.This is stupid; this is corny; it has way too many sexual innuendos, particularly for the millions of teens who saw this film.....but it is undeniably funny. It's also extremely colorful and the '60s clothing is a hoot to see once again (yeah, I remember it well.) This is the like the TV-program "Laugh-In," but with a dumb story.I have no complaints looking at Elizabeth Hurley ("Vanessa Kensington") and Michael Myers ("Austin Powers"), with his crooked teeth, stupid grin and ridiculous sayings made me laugh. This is a very fast-moving film, a spoof of James Bond and a spoof of the crazy '60s. The 90 minutes go by quickly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Finest Spoof...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this hilarious spoof of 60's spy flicks, a swinging secret agent is thawed out of his cryogenic state in order to combat his old nemesis. The laughs never stop as Myers entertains in two pivotal roles. Hurley is sexy as Austin's partner and love interest. Robert Wagner finds ways to make fun of his "It Takes a Thief" character and is very entertaining in the process. A quickly paced film that generates constant laughs with each viewing. A sequel is soon to be released...Yeah, baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from it's overwhelmingly raunchy humor,I consider this to be a great spoof of the spy genre and 60's culture.Mike Myers has created yet two more endearing characters in Powers and his nemisis,Dr.Evil.When certain characters inspire imitation (and who hasn't at least heard imitations of these two,or perhaps even Robert Wagner's character, Number 2 and others),then you have done something right.This movie is good for it's amusing characters and good story line,but again I think it would have worked without so much vulgar humor.Worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a good Bond spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really a funny parody of the Bond movies. This is the best thing to watch if you've seen a typical by-the-numbers Bond movie, one of the old ones, for example, and thought it was ridiculous, or at the very least something other than great. The plot is directly spoofing the old Bond movies, with an evil villain trying to take over the world. The acting is pretty good, for a spoof movie; the characters are mostly caricatures and stereotypes, to further parody the Bond movies, but they add to the humor of the film. Mike Myers is great in this movie, pretty much anyone who likes him will probably enjoy him in this. I loved how it was spoofing the Bond movies, sometimes even mentioning the ludicrousness of the characters actions in details. If you're into 60's stereotypes, crude sexual humor and some great Bond-spoof action, you'll most likely enjoy this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys spoof movies, and who's seen at least one Bond movie and thought it was a bit ridiculous. It's filled to the brink with crude sexual innuendo and Bond-spoofing. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure how, but somehow I managed to miss the Austin Powers craze of the late 90's. I never went to see the flick, and then when it became a pop culture phenomenon, I didn't really feel like seeing it. Heck, since it was around everywhere and everyone thought they had an Austin Powers impersonation, I felt like I'd already seen it by extension. A few years ago, I managed to catch it on a bus trip, but I must've fallen asleep or was too busy talking because a lot of the movie felt unfamiliar. So this is a review from someone watching it in full for the first time a few days ago.Which is a bit unfair to the film, since it was such a huge part of pop culture when it came out, there's no way to view it unbiasedly now. To use the horribly tired phrase, this movie is so 1997. Like the title hero (and his nemesis), it's practically frozen in time itself, and watching it brings you back to the horrible time when everyone was saying "shagadelic, baby", or "one million dollars". *shudder* So, jokes that may have made me laugh were I to have seen it when it first came out make me roll my eyes now. I've seen so many clips of this flick that the jokes are already old. But, the thing is, I'm not sure if they would've been that great anyway. Mike Myers' style is to push a joke two or three (or four or five) beats past it being funny, in the hope that the pushing of the joke itself will be funny. It's a knowing wink to the audience that has made him a very successful man, but got old with me around the time of Wayne's World.In fact, pretty much all of Austin Powers' shtick got old for me very quickly. Like many films from Saturday Night Live, clever comedic premises (like the James Bond of the swinging-sixties parody) that would or have worked great in five minute segments fail to connect for a feature length film. The jokes are pretty obvious and juvenile, bodily humour jokes that I've never really enjoyed (well, not since making noises with my underarms stopped being the height of comedic genius). The parody of the film is clever, but the jokes fall flat.Well, I should say that most of the jokes fall flat. While Austin Powers himself does little for me, I do find Myers other character in the film, Dr. Evil, to be quite funny most of the time. Dr. Evil saved the movie for me, I loved his out-dated plans for world conquest, I loved his interactions with his son Scott (Seth Green), and loved the scene where he and Scott go to group therapy. That all made me laugh, even though I knew of most of the scenes.But, he wasn't funny enough for me to give the flick a passing grade. Again, who knows, if I had caught the movie back when it meant something, I may have thought more of it. But, that speaks to the staying power of the film, which is to say that there isn't much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shagadelic, baby, yeah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw "Austin Powers", I was on the floor laughing. This movie has every single memorable line you could possibly imagine. From "Yeah, baby!" to "Riiiiiight", Mike Myers is a genius when it comes to comedy! I think everyone could say that they laughed at least once to this film.Paroding of the James Bond flicks, Austin Powers is an international spy who is a lady's man. Dr. Evil, is Arch Nemesis, goes into the future of 1997 and now Austin must travel through time to find him. When he gets to 1997, he has a beautiful assistant, Vanessa, who happens to be the daughter of his former flame in the 60's. Vanessa resists Austin's charm and wants to stick to business while Austin is wasting no time to get to his "business" with her. Dr. Evil learns that he has a son, Scott played by Seth Green. When Scott isn't as excited to have Dr. Evil as a father, Dr. Evil tries anything he can to get Scott to love him, including a hilarious scene in a counseling group for father's and son's. But back into action, Austin must find Dr. Evil before he rules the world with his kitty, Mr. Bigglesworth. But can he do that and have Vanessa at the same time? You'll just have to see! My favorite characters that worked so well together was without a doubt Seth and Mike as Dr. Evil and Scott. They are just beyond hilarious and work so well together. I think a lot of the other Austin Powers fans would agree. There first scene together meeting is just really funny, "Give Daddy a hug! I'm down with the kids, ducka ducka ducka!" "No! Get away from me you psycho!". Classic! Like I said "Austin Powers" is just a great and funny movie that I think you can get into if you're looking for a decent comedy. Come on! We still say "Yeah, baby!" to this very day after all! Let's give Mike some credit here! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A shagadellic movie baby, yeah. This is one of Mike Myers' classic movies. Mike(Wayne's World) is the man playing Austin and Dr. Evil, Liz Hurley(Bedazzled) is excellent as Vanessa, and Seth Green(Rat Race) is funny as hell playing Scott. Some of the world's greatest celebrities also make cameo appearences in this classic including Tom Arnold(True Lies), Cindy Margolis(model), Will Ferrell(Saturday Night Live), Charles Napier(tough guy roles), and Mike Judge(Beavis and Butthead) as Beavis and Butthead, who all make this comedy even more funny. There is no way if anyone watches this movie, they will not laugh; and the series gets funnier by movie.For whoever is reading this and hasn't seen the movie: If you watch this movie, you will laugh your head off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dirty, funny spoof if you're in the mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1960's Austin Powers is one of the UK's best secret agents. He works as an international playboy who also fights international terrorists. However when Dr Evil tries fails to kill him, Dr Evil escapes into space where he is frozen until a time when he can return. Austin Powers also freezes himself to be defrosted later. In the late 90's Dr Evil returns to wreck havoc on the world and only a defrosted Powers can stop him ? if he can adapt to the new world order. Mike Myers is very much an acquired taste but he did seem to hit it big with this series of films. The original film set the tone with not very basic jokes but certainly plenty of crude ones. The main film is split between a fish out of water film, with Austin trying to come to terms with the 90's, and also a James Bond spoof with Dr Evil as a more frustrated Bond baddie (complete with cat and bald head). The fish out of water stuff works well as Austin is a funny swinger and the 60's stuff is cool, however the best bits for me all relate to Dr Evil ? whether it be his relationship with his son or the asides where the see the consequences of the death of his henchmen. The spoof on Bond movies gets the best laughs from me. Myers is good in both roles and clearly has fun with both. Hurley is OK but a bit wooden as Vanessa while Robert Wagner is good as number one. Michael York (whoooooo?) is good as control and there are some good cameos ? Rob Lowe is funny but I still don't understand why the whole Christian Slater bit was put in the final cut?! Overall it may be rude and slightly crude in places but there's still plenty to enjoy. It's 90 minutes long but it's very funny and rushes by. You may not remember much of the plot but at least you go away chuckling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forced Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great premise: 1960s hero and arch villain both frozen, then unfrozen after thirty years to resume their global fight for power. A satire of the James Bond series, "Austin Powers ..." (played by Mike Myers) is a real disappointment. I laughed a couple of times. Otherwise, I endured the crude gags, stilted gimmicks, and the repellent character of Powers, with that grimaced smile and those ugly teeth.The problem here is the writing. The script just isn't funny. The humor is all forced. And there's a lot of missed opportunities. For example, Austin opens up a laptop, a device that wasn't available in the 1960s. Yet, he has no problem using it to chatter with Number Two (Robert Wagner). What an ideal setup for some laughs about changes in technology. But no; the script passes over this opportunity for some real comparisons to the 60s. Instead, we get way too much time spent on Porky's style bathroom "humor" that has nothing to do with cultural changes.The film is certainly colorful, as was the style for much of the latter half of the 1960s. Cinematography dazzles with flashy, glitzy, glittering visuals. But for what purpose? Probably the best element is the music. At least they brought back a couple of pop songs from the 60s. And the score is quite reminiscent of the earlier era.Casting is what it is. If you like Mike Myers, you'll no doubt like the film, since "Austin Powers ..." is basically a Mike Myers vehicle. Otherwise, the casting is largely irrelevant. Performances, beyond Myers' silliness, are neither good nor bad, since they're all exaggerated.I had hoped for humor that was more natural, more organic, and some clever comparisons to the 1960s. I got neither. This film is a blunt, in-your-face cinematic example of shallow, puerile, trashy insignificance that I suppose Mike Myers has become known for. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An intermittently enjoyable spy spoof with Mike Myers as swinging secret agent Austin Powers, cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out decades later in order to do battle with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers), the gag being that their methods are hopelessly outdated. It's 'Demolition Man' with jokes at the expense of the Bond films.The problem I have with this movie, and it's a big one, is that the parts that are genuinely funny and inspired are run into the ground by constant repetition and explanation. There's a scene in which one of Dr. Evil's henchmen is run over by a steamroller, after which we see his family getting the phone call to break the bad news. It's very funny at first - but it goes on and on, milking the idea to the last drop, and then it's repeated later. It's a frustrating and irritating habit and it kills much of the movie.Many of the other gags shoot fish in a barrel - Bond villains concoct overly elaborate plans to kill him, well well - but it's fun some of the time and George Clinton's score bounces around with more zip than the screenplay can provide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery - Some Minor SpoilersSpy spoofs usually amount to zip. That's why the raunchy `Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery' was so popular upon its release. It accomplished its mission of successfully spoofing the James Bond phenomenon in almost every way. The two sequels didn't do quite as well, but I was quite pleased with the second film, especially.`Saturday Night Live' veteran Mike Myers plays Austin Powers, a groovy British spy in the swingin' sixties. 1967, to be exact. His looks resemble the orangutan-meets-human look that British are stereotyped with, and his clothes are fresh outta' 60's London.Mike Myers also plays Dr. Evil, Powers' arch-nemesis. After tracing Dr. Evil to the Psychedelic Pussycat club in London, Evil gets away in a Big Boy rocket and blasts into outer space, where he circles the world for thirty years, frozen with his cat.Myers 1 - err, Austin Powers - is cryogenically frozen immediately, to be thawed out upon return of Dr. Evil.Well, the thirty years pass, and eventually Dr. Evil returns to earth, with Mr. Bigglesworth, his cat. Number 2 (Robert Wagner), his evil assistant, fills him in on what has happened over the years, and soon Evil is planning another `Highjack some nuclear warheads and hold the world ransom' bit.Austin is thawed out and sent to find and defeat Evil, along with the monkey-eared Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley).`Austin Powers' has its hit and misses, but comes off with mostly hits. It is probably the best spy spoof to emerge out of Hollywood for years. One of the most interesting aspects is that it does not spoof James Bond film as openly as one might expect- there are tiny, minute details that you only pick up on after multiple viewing. I really expected every other gag to be a satire on Bond films, but alas! They were not! Yes, the film is a spoof on Bond, but not to a sick extreme. Just minute things that audiences may - or may not - pick up on, depending on how knowledgeable they are on the Bond movies.Powers is, of course, a spoof on James Bond. He's sex-obsessed like Bond, but does not come across with the same coolness and ease of James Bond. At least not in the nineties, anyway.Dr. Evil is a spoof on Blofield, Bond's arch-nemesis from the Bond films. He is shrouded in mystery and when revealed boasts a bald head, a big, crooked nose, and a cat like Blofield's which is unfortunately naked - without fur - because it didn't thaw out so well in the Big Boy rocket.Number 2 is a spoof on.well.Number 2 from `Thunderball' - from the name to the eye patch, which I only picked up on after viewing `Thunderball' recently.There are some very clever scenes in `Austin Powers.' Some of the gags spoof the spy genre very easily. Others fall flat, mainly because they try to get the audience to be sickened. Yes, the film needs to be raunchy to a certain degree - it is a Bond spoof - but they went a bit OTT on some of the jokes (the whole Jacuzzi scene got a bit prolonged.).Perhaps the greatest thing about this film is that it is not directly geared towards Bond geeks. We've seen satires that were targeted at a small audience range - like `Galaxy Quest.' I really disliked the film the first time I saw it because I do not watch `Star Trek' - but on second viewing I found it to be a clever satire on the Trekkies and equally so on the television show. I guess if I saw the film I would have enjoyed it more the first - and probably second - time. It was a good comedy, but if they had not geared it towards such a small range of audience, I feel they would have received more of a response to the film.But the exact opposite is the case with `Powers.' Bond geeks and regular moviegoers alike can enjoy this film. It brings two very different audiences together - they may laugh at different things, but they are still laughing together.Perhaps that is the film's biggest achievement. Sadly, it is its most overlooked, as well. I think that many people don't really understand WHY they like the film so much. I've heard people say, `Why do you like the film so much?' and the other person will say, `Well.umm.gee, I just do.' They themselves know the jokes are not always the greatest. Many of the gags DO fall short.But deep down they know that the cleverness of the film is what makes them like it so much - and they are either subconsciously afraid to admit that, or literally don't know how to.Be warned, `Powers' is not a film for everyone. If you don't like raunchy laughs, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you want to see a clever parody of the spy genre - well, I might as well say it: a clever parody of the James Bond genre (let's face it - there's no such thing as a spy genre anymore - James Bond has its own genre) - then I would recommend `Powers.' `Austin Powers.'4/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never understand, why is this movie so popular, this have to be one of the more stupid movies i have seen in my life( and i have seen a lot believe me). This film was made with a very low humor, and thats a shame because i think Mike Myers it's a good comedian, i personally enjoy Wayne's world 1 and 2. But Austin Powers, that movie it's not funny at all, it's completely dumb, the characters are dumb, the jokes are usually sexual jokes but very bad, anyway we can compare this movie with any cheap b comedy movie and there's not too much difference, it's as bad as them. This film it's so bad that i didn't want to see the second and third part. So this is my final conclusion: Austin Powers, a very bad movie with low humor and way over rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had to describe this movie in one word, I would say: Flat. Boredom interrupted by a few good lines. People calling it the 'funniest movie ever' should watch some really funny movies like 'The Party', 'Take the Money and Run', 'Play It Again, Sam', 'Airplane 1/2', 'Naked Gun' series, etc. Then come back and tell me where Austin Powers really belongs. This movie would have been a great one if it was shortened to 10 minutes. All in all, it is below average at best. Very much like Wayne's World 1/2 - all good punchlines fit nicely in the trailer.

		<shortDescription>The original Austin Powers movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the shorts to this movie my first thoughts were, "this looks stupid." and the more previews that I saw the more that I thought that it was stupid. Then my friends saw it and were telling me how good it was and quoting is constantly. I was slowly convinced that I might appreciate it. Then I said to my friends Gill and Nick Abbott that I wanted to see it and they said that it was horrid. Still, I hired it out and watched it deciding to form my own opinion. Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery would be a good movie if Mike Myers could act. I feel that his ability in this movie seriously undermines it. Now Mike Myers was in Wayne's World (playing I believe Wayne) and he played his role quite well, but Austin Powers just annoyed me. I thought that he tried too hard to create Austin Powers and it didn't come out well. Dr Evil (who went to Evil University for 6 years to get a PhD) was a little better (he was also played by Mike Myers) but I still think that it dragged the movie down. My friends quoted it much better than Myers delivered the lines. Another thing is that some of the jokes were overdone and were no longer funny. Whenever they had a henchman die they showed us that the death actually hurt people, but after a second time I was not really wanting to see another one. The toilet scene after Powers was defrosted went on too long and so was the penis enlarger joke. The joke about Danger being Austin Powers' middle name was clever but it was delivered so bad that it wasn't funny. Austin Powers is essentially a comedy which tries to poke fun at how 60's ideals are so out of date. Powers still wants to sleep around but in the 90's it has become somewhat frowned upon (according to the movie). Both Austin Powers and&nbsp; Dr Evil are in another time in which all of their ideals are unknown. In the 60's Powers is a sex symbol and Dr Evil is a master villain but in the 90's all of Powers' charisma has gone and Dr Evil's schemes are no longer viable. For some reason Dr Evil wants to destroy the world but where does that get him other than watching millions of people suffer. The movie also pokes fun at how spy movies has the good guys caught and slowly tortured to death in a way that they can escape from where the 90's kid is simply telling his father to kill them with a gun. But then a gun is boring while a swarm of mutated sea bats are interesting. Austin Power, international man of mystery has a lot of potential to be a good movie but it fails to live up to what it claims to be. The opening was cool yet it failed because it didn't come out that well on the screen. When you think back to the movie you can see how it could have come out but what you see on the screen is only a pale image.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neat, blasé comedy which gets the little things right on top of being a fun, energetic experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters, that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot.Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof, one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller; more specifically the James Bond franchise, although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer, another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voice-over in something like "The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!" are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's "Black Dynamite", wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug cover-up was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else.It isn't a well-kept secret that, at the worst of times, stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are, in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets, often mere B-movies dressed up as A-movies. "Powers" depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means, something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy, absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces, they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins: a ragtag bunch of Arabs, Latin Americans and paraplegics - none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street; a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty, you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a mid-shot being applied.After a skirmish at a local nightspot, Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future; Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man ? the plot is essentially "Demolition Man". Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997, as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication, there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past (speech, attitudes and even finger gestures) have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand, the film has things the wrong way around: people are far more prone to easy, anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago, where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm.Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to "International Man of Mystery" and it's quite hard not to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When he made Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery Mike Myers aspired to comic greatness, the kind we had not seen on the screen since Peter Sellers. Only Sellers and Alec Guinness could create so many believable characters in the same film and make them work the way Myers does with Austin Powers and his perennial nemesis Doctor Evil.Hard to believe, but back in the swinging London of the Sixties, the British kids really did dress like Austin Powers. The key to Powers character is that whether he's in the Sixties or the Nineties, he's still an overgrown kid.The film is like the old Batman TV series where the Gotham City Police Department is good enough at dealing with ordinary criminals. But when exotic types like the Joker or the Penguin threaten the law and order of Gotham City, Commissioner Gordon reaches for the Batphone and Adam West and Burt Ward start doing their thing in tights. Powers is on the verge of nabbing Doctor Evil back in the day when the doctor takes off in a rocketship and cryogenically freezes himself. It's also some rocketship if I do say so. Not to be outdone, British Intelligence cryogenically freezes Austin Powers because he's the only man capable of dealing with Evil in their service.Both men have to adapt to a culture shock. Doctor Evil has mixed feelings about the test tube baby son he fathered in Seth Green. As for Powers, he's not quite fathoming the fact that his Emma Peel like partner Mimi Rogers from back in the day has a daughter in Elizabeth Hurley doing her bit in the family spy business.Michael York as the M character and Powers boss and Robert Wagner as Number 2 in the Evil Empire both look like they're having a really good time hamming up their parts. There's also a nice unbilled part by Tom Arnold as a cowboy in the men's room with Powers when one of the Evil assassins tries to get him.A lot of good laughs in this first Austin Powers film, I do so hope Mike Myers does make still another one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>completely repugnant "comedy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Myers is a comedic genius. His writing and performance on Saturday Night Live is one of the best. I would even say he might (pound for pound) be as good, if not better, than Belushi, Akroyd, Murray, or Murphy. Waynes World and Sprockets was some of the funniest work I've seen on SNL. That is why it pains me to say that Austin Powers was such repugnant, puerile, adolescent horse crap that I have ever seen. Ther was so much to work with in this amazing concept. This could have been the best comedy of the 90's, but the writing and performances by everyone made this one of the worst comedys since Porkys. Tom Arnold has a cameo performance in Austin Powers, and I have to say that his scene with Myers in the bathroom repeating "who does #2 work for?" has got to be the least amusing and utterly repugnant things I have ever seen. Tom Arnold is a very funny man too, but that performance would drive a person to insanity. I have never even bothered with the lame sequels to this crap. Other SNL alum movies have never been that good, the only exception being "The Blues Brothers." But Austin Powers is such shrill adolescence that the only value I could find in this crap was that the DVD or VHS would find a good home in a landfill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is right up there with The Big Lebowski. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is actually funny, unlike its sequels. Its an excellent parody of the James Bond films, while adding an additional theme of the free love of the '60s, and how it would be received in the '90s. Its sweet, from the "Thats not a woman, that's a man, man", to "That looks just like Uranus". The soundtrack is sweet, the acting is superb, and that just translates into a masterpiece. What a work of art. I have never seen such a good comedy since "The Big Lebowski", but this is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silly and effortlessly humorous 90 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's surprising to think that the second of two inspired characters thought up by Mike Myers, the flamboyant, sex-crazed super-spy Austin Powers, took so long to catch on. A modest showing at the box-office soon led to rampant word-of-mouth with it's VHS release, and soon enough, around the early 2000's, everybody seemed to responding to questions with "yeah, baby!". While it's hook is a mixture of (very accurately) spoofing 60's kitsch spy movies and outright silliness, Myers' Powers is winning thanks to the puppy-dog appeal of it's creator.After seeing his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers) escape his clutches by cryogenically freezing himself and escaping in a Big Boy-shaped space rocket, Austin Danger Powers joins the likes of Evil Knievel and Vanilla Ice and freezes himself for 30 years. When Evil returns, planning on stealing the world's nuclear weapons, Powers is thawed out and is unleashed into a changed world. No longer are people experimenting with mind-altering drugs and having care-free, unprotected sex, and Powers gets lumped with his ex-partner's buzz-killing daughter Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley).Myers seems fully aware that the 1960's were camp enough already to raise laughs, so the film spends a lot of time paying homage to the likes of the hyperactive energy of A Hard Day's Night (1964), the big- boobed laden, pervy fun of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970), and even the ultra-chic photo-shoots of Antonioni's classic Blowup (1966). These scenes are surprisingly spot on, and Myers is in his element running away from an army of screaming girls to that now-iconic theme song. Of course, the film spends the majority of the film in the 1990's, and Powers seems incredibly out-dated, and people now notice his terrible teeth.Most of the laughs come from the clever observations made of the early James Bond movies. Anyone who remembers Honor Blackman's ridiculously named Pussy Galore from Goldfinger (1964), will get a laugh from the character named Alotta Fagina, or Dr. Evil's shoe-throwing henchman Random Task. Or for anyone who has seen any of the Sean Connery Bond's, will no doubt be amused at Dr. Evil's insistence on placing Powers in an easily-escapable and elaborate death device and refusing to even watch the deed, much to the annoyance of Evil's son (Seth Green). The rest of the laughs are hardly clever - they tend to derive from Myers gurning or daft innuendo - but this is a silly and effortlessly humorous 90 minutes, full of quotable lines that are no doubt as dated as Powers' outfits.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Hilarious But Ended Up Weak Instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was clearly meant to be a spoof of 1960's British culture and of James Bond movies. The beginning was energetic and promising. Unfortunately soon afterward the movie runs out of steam.The James Bond character in this movie was not like the well-dressed man of the Bond movies but rather a long-haired mod. Even then the concept could have worked. But there are too many "fish out of water" jokes and the others aren't really funny either. A long-haired cat becoming bald is hardly amusing. Nor are the other sexual or other gags very clever either.The sequels were supposed to be better, but I feel no compulsion to check them out. If you want good spy spoof comedy, I recommend watching old "Get Smart" episodes instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget "high art", and this silly, fun movie gets a solid "8" for entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this original Austin Powers movie until a year after I saw the sequel, "...The Spy Who Shagged Me." Both involve suspended animation through cryogenics, and set both in the 1960s and the 1990s. In each, Mike Myers plays both the British spy Austin Powers, a spoof of James Bond, and also plays the evil and funny Dr Evil. In both films, some of the funnier scenes are between Dr Evil and his back-talking son. This movie spoofs lots of different things, has many subtle sexual references, but in the hands (and delivery) of Mike Myers they always come out funny. One of the references, however is not a spoof. The "bad teeth" of the British. They really do have bad teeth! Otherwise, this is not a movie to be taken seriously, just silly entertainment, and there it succeeds almost perfectly.However, as pretty as she is, Elizabeth Hurley, in this film, is not nearly as entertaining as is Heather Graham in the latter Austin Powers film. Hurley just does not have the comic timing nor the natural "playfulness" that is demanded for the female role. Heather Graham does, and she is even prettier!!Some day, when they sell a two DVD set of Austin Powers films, I'd like to buy the set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Mike Myers. Having enjoyed Sprockets, Theater Stories and the such on SNL, I really liked the Wayne's World movies and even "Axe Murder" movie. However, I was really shocked when I viewed Austin Powers. First of all, I enjoyed Dr. Evil. I thought he was an excellent character. He was extremely weird and well conceived. However, I didn't care for Austin Powers himself and the never-ending sex-related humor. It ruined the movie for me. This movie could have been so much better without the sex-related humor. There were many other things about spy movies that they could have parodied. It was OK at first, the second time made me smile, but it went on and on and on and finally I was getting pretty upset! I don't know where the morals of America have gone, but for this movie to get a PG-13 rating is very surprising. It should have been an R. Mike Myers, shame on you! I give this film a D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started off great with an hilariously OTT psychedelic dance number, but steadily went down hill from there. The character of Austin Powers was certainly a very funny creation, but that was all this spy spoof offered. The jokes were predominantly predictable toilet humour. By the end I just wasn't laughing. A huge disappointment after the hilarious beginning.Myers is at his best as Austin and provides us with some wonderful sound bites. He's less successful however with the somewhat tiresome villain Dr Evil. Hurley is a good foil as the sexy sidekick Miss Kensington.Spoofs are most effective when played deadpan where the characters seem to be acting normal and unaware of the lunacy around them. See the Airplane! and Hot Shots series for examples of this. Myers however is plainly having a lot of fun, which strangely leads to less fun for the viewer (e.g his never ending "do you think I'm sexy" scenes).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are several very funny film actors in the World today but, unfortunately, Mike Myers is not among them. Perhaps it's a culture thing (in the UK we appreciate irony) or a generation thing (the humour is very childish) but, apart from a couple of belly laughs, I found this an irritating bore. The OTT (I know it's meant to be) "acting" of Myers and the wooden performance of Hurley (I'm sure she was wondering what she had got herself into) were excruciating. The Bond films (presumably it's a spoof of them?) are, generally, comical enough not to need "imitation". No doubt you will appreciate this if you are a teenager who loves "potty" humour but, if you prefer your comedy a little bit more adult, then avoid like the plague!</fullReview>

The jokes were also not terribly well-timed, the storyline was fractured to say the least, and the direction was scattershot. After reading others' glowing comments I keep thinking to myself "Did they see the same movie I saw?", "Am I becoming a stuffed shirt humorless old fart?".

		<fullReview>Most of the comments seem to cast this as a lowbrow vs highbrow humor issue. I like lowbrow humor as much as anyone--give me Benny Hill and toilet humor any day--but this movie is just badly done. The script needs a script doctor to tighten it up and the direction, editing, and pacing is way off key. The biggest problem is that they don't know when to stop and they let gags that are potentially funny just die by dragging them out. Austin says, "I like women of that calibre" after the go-go girls uses her bra gun ... but then he has to go on to explain the pun ... and then there's a long pause and a long giggle--by the time all this is over the joke has been completely killed. Austin announces his ransom demand to the UN, and then gives a parody of the evil villian's laugh--funny--and he laughs again--funny. By the time the punchline comes (everyone's laugh petering out) it's the 20th repitition, and the viewer doesn't care anymore. There was lots of potential here, but it was squandered. All the good parts are in the trailer--watch that and buy an Austin Powers promotional penis enlarger, but skip the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this with Borat. It didn't work for me. Neither comedy did; the reasons seem related.If you put distance between something and it's source, then you have opportunity for low humor. The closer you get to the original or the reference, the sharper you have to be on both sides of the screen.I thought "Wayne's World" was sharp stuff. It moved seamlessly from being in a genre to making fun of it, moving randomly.This is comparatively a safe and lazy project. The distance is great and the humor broad and repetitive. Yet it didn't work for me.The reason is that the humor depends on the thing being trashed being something that someone has valued. That "distance" I mentioned is usually distance between you and the people being made fun of.The joke is that someone actually thought the prototypes were worth investing in. "Escape" (as in escape movies) is a powerful thing and we do not choose our escapes casually. We define ourselves in significant degree this way.I never did with this genre. I was lucky enough to have escaped valuing the excesses of the 70s by being "stuck" in the 60s.There are only a few strokes in the references here anyway: an evil overload behind a threatening conspiracy; a strangely magnetic, privileged and successful agent; and a collection of style-related things from the 70s: fashion, phrases, music and a very few cinematic references.

That's right Doc, I've no idea why I didn't go and bang my head against a wall rather than carry on watching "Austin Powers".I sat through this film stony-faced, cringing inwardly at the obvious sexual innuendos, crude jokes about bodily functions and the looks of discomfort on some well-respected actors' faces.Taking what is essentially a James Bond plot and tacking on a lot of gags has been done before, in the original "Casino Royale" and "Carry On Spying". Neither of those films made me laugh much either.I enjoyed the daft 60s musical number where Austin parades through a Hollywood version of Swinging London, but there's about an hour and a half of celluloid gackass tacked onto it that I'd rather forget about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film suffers greatly because screenwriter/star Mike Myers is under the impression that a weak joke can be made hilarious one if you just stretch it out and repeat the punchline for sixty seconds or so. Slipping on a banana peel (say) is funny the first three times, but after that the laughs dry up. The film is only enjoyable as an exercise in spotting the homages to James Bond movies - and there are a lot. Unfortunately, like the jokes, the spoofs are cranked right up past the redline so that us dumb old viewers catch them. For example, Myers' charicature of Blofeld works better as an impersonation of the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz.The film lasts 90 minutes - usually this seems too short, but for this film it's an eternity. The alternative endings and cut footage on the DVD release show that they filmed more material - which they decided not to include even though there was plenty of time - what does this say about quality?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the movies in this series are pretty much the same, silly attempts at satire, tired sex jokes, puns instead of names,plots that get going and then veer off into something (or nothing else) and wasted talent. You've got to hand it to Mike, he'll do anything for a laugh, but unfortunately most of what he does, won't get one. Every so often, a funny line or situation pops up, such as when Dr. Evil demands a million dollars in international blackmail and his intended victims laugh their heads off, but there are far too few of these, and they're quickly pushed away to make room for some weak sex joke or pun. If only the effort that Mike put into his role of Austin would have gone into a coherent and competent script, there would have been a good movie here. Waste of talent and effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At 89 minutes long (including end credits) you cannot expect anything more than for us to be robbed in broad daylight. Mike Myers is no great writer that's for damn sure. Apart from Austin Powers, Wayne Campbell, Axe Murderer and 54 has he ever been in a good movie? No. Wayne's World is hardly a plot driven film. Neither are the Austin Powers movies. Or Axe Murderer. 54 is junk.He should not be a star. Or a Megastar (which some people think he is). For example...in this film he and Liz Hurley are underground in the Nevada desert. She is wearing this silver two-piece costume. 2 minutes later she is back at the Riviera hotel in a leather costume and another 2 minutes later she's back underground in the Nevada desert (?!). And another, there is no definitive version of this movie (not that I actually care) and almost every version has numerous added/deleted scenes. Why? All this film is is an excuse to throw up some stupid humor and this is proof of it.But the worst part is how people STILL TO THIS DAY go "yeah baby" and all that nonsense. Ugh! It makes me so mad. THAT is not comedy and it doesn't deserve to be treated so. When will it ever stop????? Never buy this or watch it. You have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers is the chalk to your cheese, the salt to your sweet. He can improve a mix, or outright destroy it. He's exploited James Bond's core attributes, ruining the stereotypes and the clichés we've grown use to, and come up with not one, but two egotistical maniacs that allow him to rein free and pretty much do as he pleases. The humour falls in to the slapstick category, and sometimes it scrapes the bottom of the comedy gene pool. It's clearly not for everyone. For every comedy gold there's a rusty, wooden pun. Austin Powers (Myers) is an English secret agent from the 60's whose charm, wit and stupidity gets him along in life. His evil nemesis, the aptly named Dr. Evil (also Myers), freezes himself in space and reappears 30 years later in the 90's. Powers follows in pursuit to once and for all bring Dr. Evil down. This crazy plot works because both hero and villain are out of their depth after missing so much from the last 3 decades. Dr. Evil threatens to destroy the world unless he receives $1m from the United Nations, and Austin realises he cannot sow his seed like he use to, thanks to a strong willed, sexy Elizabeth Hurley. If you can't stomach International Man of Mystery's first 5 minutes, don't bother with the rest. If you're a die-hard Bond fan, stay clear; Myers has duplicated Blofeld to shocking effect.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the zany trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Meyer's three Austin Powers flicks parody James Bond and the swinging 60s-70s. They are as follows: "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" (1997), "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" (1999) and "Austin Powers in Goldmember" (2002). What's interesting about these films is that Austin Powers (the character) is not a full spoof of 007 as he's his own character, just with Bond-like qualities.Anyway, I wasn't sure I wanted to review any these flicks because, by doing so, I'm admitting that I actually watched them (lol)! I say this because they're so goofy, juvenile, silly, sometimes raunchy (more verbally than pictorially) and filled with toilet humor. So I was never a fan and didn't even watch any of them until 2009. What turned me off? Besides the toilet humor and raunch, Powers (the character) seemed to have a gayish quality despite being a renowned ladies man in the stories. A good example is when he says, "Oh, beHAAAve," which never struck me as funny, just gay.I've since seen all three twice and, despite my reservations about Powers and distaste for toilet humor, I do enjoy the zaniness and stoo-pid humor. If you can catch a grip with these films they're laugh-out-loud funny about a third of the time, sometimes more depending on the movie.The first one is my least favorite simply because it's the least funny IMHO. It seems like Meyers and his team were experimenting and feeling out the possibilities. With its box office success, the two sequels brim with more confidence and creativity and are just plain funnier IMHO.Best quote: "Riiiiiiigggghhhttt."The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in Southern California and Nevada. GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, the parsing of the mockery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wildly inventive and accessible, Mike Myers creation of Austin Powers is both cunning satire and eternally sophomoric, and I loved it! The punning of the 60's is quick and inclusive, regardless of your stance on the social issues of the time, and the Bond/Foe bits play into the genre perfectly. Dr. Evil gets little credit for bringing the two together when he says to his son, "you just don't get it". If you feel the mike Myers character is infectious and continually out of place, then you'd have enjoyed this Bond send off. If not, then count the references, point out what is silly rather than inventive, talk about distance between the viewer and the object of ridicule and feel better about yourselves. That's what Austin would have wanted for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like the Austin Powers movies. Mike Meyers has an interesting sense of humor, and is not afraid to devote a large section of his work to toilet humor. But what really surprises me is how the Austin Powers trilogy is based rather heavily on Charles K. Feldman's Casino Royale (1967). Yes, while AP draws much from the Bond franchise movies, the campy-ness, Burt Bacharach and even Fat B***ard come from Casino Royale. I strongly suggest watching these movies back to back. Why the title? Look at Casino Royale, you'll know what I'm talking about, and probably think it doesn't make sense anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a succession of sex jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Austin Powers film has more substance than the two sequels would suggest. Forget the jokes- although they are indeed very funny- and focus on Mike Myers' twin creations, Dr Evil and Powers himself. These are beautifully created characters who don't rely on a succession of unfunny fart gags to amuse (unlike the lamentable Fat B*****d from the sequels). Instead, humour naturally arises from their pompousness. When either is on screen, they overshadow everything else, thanks to Myers' comic brilliance. It's easy to under-rate him, but he's easily more bearable than the increasingly desperate Jim Carrey. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is highly recommended, as is the sequel, but miss the third part, which botches everything constructed in the first two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers plays dual roles in this often uproarious spoof of hippie/spy films. After 60s swinger/British spy Austin Powers is unfrozen from the past, he learns his old nemesis Doctor Evil (what else would he have been named?) was also frozen, but was thawed out to take over the world. Powers is paired with lovely British Agent Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley), and endures some hilarious culture shock (as does his enemy) as he's introduced to a world where man has walked on the moon and Berlin is no longer divided. Myers offers side-splitting performances as both Powers and the equally bumbling Dr. Evil. A strong, hilarious script, although at some points, the jokes are just plain raunchy (and the toilet humor got worse in the two box office hit sequels). But overall, a highly entertaining and intelligent comedy. Recommended for Inspector Clouseau fans as well.</fullReview>

Mike Myers is truly a comic genius. Better than Jim Carrey, Eddie Murphey, ect. Out of his mind all together he's created four characters all different. Thats what makes him better then other comedians out there. Elizabeth was awesome as Austin's love interest. the rest of the cast is excellent! Everything about this movie is great. It was so funny.

		<fullReview>There are few films that have made me laugh as hard as 'Austin Powers'. When released in 1997, it was the perfect comedy for our young hip MTV generation but didn't exactly light up the box office. It became a major hit on video and is now a fully fledged movie franchise and nothing is going to change that, baby! The plot follows cooler than cool 60's spy Austin Powers (Mike Myers) and his partner Mrs. Kensington (Mimi Rogers) who, in 1967, try to stop maniac Dr. Evil (Mike Myers again) from his plots to hold the world ransom. When Dr. Evil freezes himself in space Austin cryogenically freezes himself to be awoken when Dr. Evil returns. Cut to 30 years later and Dr. Evil has returned to Nevada with some terrorist plotting and there's only one man that can save the world: Austin Powers! The only problem is, when Austin is awoken, he finds the world of 1997 very hard to deal with and what's even harder is trying not to bed Mrs. Kensington's beautiful daughter Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) who seems immune to Austin's charm. The stuff that was cool and hip in the 60's aren't the same in 1997. Austin's bad teeth are no longer fashionable but are disgusting, his clothes are no longer groovy but embarassing and the whole age of the swinging 60's has been lost to Corporate America. Although not everyone will like this film, there is at least bits to please everyone. Dr. Evil's failing relationship with his test tube baby son played by Seth Green is pure genius and Robert Wagner as Number 2 and Mindy Sterling as Frau are two performances not to be missed. Of course, Mike Myers is sensational in his dual role as the hero and the villain. It's Austin's stupidity and Dr. Evil's loony escapades that really put this film together. Then we have Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa, a surprisingly well developed love interest who carries her own through the movie. Mimi Rogers' cameo as her mother is quite amusing even if we she isn't as well developed as she should be. With cameo appearances by Tom Arnold (Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare), Carrie Fisher (Uh, Star Wars!) and Burt Bacarrach, the cast is sure to please most viewers. The script is a masterpiece slice of writing by star Mike Myers. Mainly inspired by his father, Mike put together this loving tribute to his old man. For a mad comedy (Althought not exactly a spoof) the script is surprisingly well written and put together and feels like a good film where not a second of celluloid is wasted. That has something, in part, to do with the direction of Jay Roach, who later directed 'Meet the Parents', who captures the feel of the 60's perfectly in the first 15 minutes then creates a very real 90's. He gives the movie it's mojo, man! So, that's pretty much all there is to say. Followed by the entertaining but lacking sequel 'The Spy Who Shagged Me' two years later in 1999 and then by the much superior 'Goldmember' in 2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can be said about a movie that re-launched a career, sparked a multi-million dollar franchise, and added so many new terms to our vocabulary? (Shagadelic!) Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery is already a classic comedy in many people's minds, and no doubt will become a treasured classic of lowbrow humor for years to come.Mike Meyers brilliantly plays two characters, swinging 60's super spy Austin Powers, and the diabolically distracted Dr. Evil. Both were at the height of their powers (pun intended) in the 60's, and, in this movie, find themselves experiencing a severe case of future shock in the 90's. And now that Dr. Evil has hijacked a nuclear probe and is holding the world hostage for... a certain amount of money, Austin had better unfreeze his bits and pieces quick.Austin Powers may be the lead, but his spotlight is stolen by two of his supporting characters. Firstly, Dr. Evil, with his quasi-Belgian accent and quasi-thoughtfully extended pinkie finger has become one of the most popular characters in recent film. And, Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington, Austin's sexy partner, steals the show with her exasperated bemusement of Austin's complete ignorance.Half a parody of James Bond and half an homage to Our Man Flint, International Man Of Mystery is a quick, easy, raucous spoof that is almost impossible to dislike. And better yet, it opened the door for an even funnier sequel...(***1/2/****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hilarious Mike Myers Is Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the box office disappointments of "So I Married An Axe Murderer" and "Wayne's World 2" along with his leaving the TV series "Saturday Night Live", Mike Myers took a career sabbatical for nearly four years reluctantly coming back to write and star in this spoof of spy films which did much better at the box office than anybody behind its making could've guessed. With this 1997 release (and its two even more profitable sequels), New Line Cinema had some of their all time greatest success ever. In the film, Myers has a dual role as the title character and his nemesis Dr. Evil. The two of them have been cyrogenically frozen since 1967 and have just been thawed out in order to resume their battle. The laughs come from the fact that neither one of them realize how much time has changed and so countless references to the 1960's are made. It's much funnier than it initially sounds with a genuine and well timed line or visual sight gag in practically every minute of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Back in the 1960's, there was a mastery spy by the name of Austin Powers. He worked tirelessly to nab the notorious super villain, Dr. Evil. Together, he and his partner, Mrs. Kensington, try to catch Dr. Evil at a club, but he got away and froze himself, so Austin Powers decided to freeze himself also and be thawed out when Dr. Evil was heard from again. Thirty years later, 1997, Dr. Evil sets up a lair outside of Las Vegas, where he rounds up his team of baddies: his number two man, Number Two, with Mustafa, Patty O'Brein, and Frau Farbissina. Dr. Evil proposed several world dominating plans, but they were carried out already, so he plotted to steal a nuclear warhead and have it sent to the center of the earth unless the world pays him the ammount of $1,000,000. Austin Powers is thawed and meets Mrs. Kensington's daughter, Vanessa. Throughout their mission, all Austin could think about was having sex, but Vanessa strictly stuck to the assignment; Austin does some brushing up on the '90s as well. Austin and Vanessa infiltrate Dr. Evil's lair and stop him from launching the warhead. Austin had to outshine several female cyborgs known as Fembots, who had machine gun jubblies. But the whole caper resulted in Dr. Evil escaping into space and freezing himself again and Austin and Vanessa living happily ever after. Pretty good movie. Though I think the sequel was a little better. But they're all good. Was followed by The Spy Who Shagged Me then Goldmember. You think there will be a fourth? I assume so.But what James Bond movie will it spoof? Man With the Golden Gun? Live and Let Die? Oh well, until then, we can enjoy these films and finally laugh at the world of secret agents.-</fullReview>

Two, Mike Myers performace as Dr. Evil, which outweighs his performance as Austin Powers in terms of sheer comic delights. Three, its spoofing of James Bond films, which in some bizarre form manages to be more interesting than the some of the films from the series it seems to be parodying. Austin Powers:International Man of Mystery(1997) is not a classic comedy, but is fun to due to a couple of memorable scenes. Probably the best performance, Liz Hurley has given in her film career. The moments where the film becomes annoying are during the moments of the sex jokes by Austin Powers and other cast of characters. Also, the film at times becomes too stupid for its own good. Robert Wagner shows a comic side that is full of subtle humor in his role of Dr. Evil's right hand man, Number Two.</fullReview>

I didn't think it was as great as everyone else, but I found that it was filled with in-jokes and references to the old spy-films and psychadellic age movies that kept me engrossed. However, what I found trite (the "nude" scenes), others loved, and few seemed to get the same jokes for the same reasons I did. My worst fears became realized when the next movie came out.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myers and Hurley get noticed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the film that put two actors in the top ten. Mike Myers was a familiar face from his SNL days. After Austin Powers, Myers would become a comic genius over night. Elizabeth Hurley had been around, like Myers, for years in movies in both America and abroad. It wasn't til her sexy British charm in Austin Powers that opened several doors and opportunity. This was a crazy film none-the-less, besides 90 minutes of laughter and some surprise performances, all Austin Powers did was make a film you can laugh at. And what a film, the story alone makes you question reality. Somewhat of a "black" comedy, its more no holds bar comedy that stretches the bar of good taste and how much you can make a person laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilarious spy spoof was the funniest movie of 1997. Mike Myers is great as Austin and even better as Dr. Evil. Elizabeth Hurly works as the love interest, and it just has solid laughs through out! With the great 60s tunes &amp; sexual puns, if u don't mind lowering your brow (most of you are already prolly well below Brow) you will love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a Mike Myers fan....until Austin Powers. A friend recommended That I rent this film 2 years ago and I was not disapointed! Myers is extremely funny and versatile as both the shamelessly egotistic Austin and the wily and over the top Dr. Evil. He has fine support from Lovely Elizabeth Hurley as a Bond Girl type with a twist and Robert Wagner as a pompous lackey to Dr. Evil's regime.The syle of the old time spy thrillers and the 1960s pop culture are both hysterically spoofed. If you like Bond films then you will find this a fun and irreverent spoof...even if you were/are not a Mike Myers fan. "Yeah Baby!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery is quite a funny movie. Mike Myers stars and also writes the script to the movie and as usual he does a great job. The movie has some funny scenes, but if you really want to see Austin Powers at his best than see the sequel, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Now, that is great. I give this movie a 6-7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed Spy Spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever saw any of the James Bond films of the 1960s, or any of the imitations thereof, you know the core elements of that genre: dashing spy, evil archvillians, car chases, high tech gadgets, beautiful but deadly women, and many special effects. As time went on the Bond flicks degenerated from good spy movies based on Ian Fleming's novels, like "From Russia With Love" to sappy, smug self-parodies, like "Casino Royale." "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" comes across as a funny but juvenile spoof of these movies.Mike Myers made Austin Powers the perfect caricature of the 1960's super-spy. He thought he was smooth and handsome, he thought he was a "chick magnet," and he did show some courage and some smarts. Many of the lines are spot-on send-ups of the spy movies and the 1960s in general. Austin's clothes were perfect 1960s Carnaby Street mod fashions. Dr. Evil was the perfect villian, complete with a conference table with chairs that he could drop any member of his entourage into the pits, just like in the Bond films.Unfortunately the film is flawed by too much bathroom humor. Many movies today, and Jim Carrey comes to mind immediately, are not suitable for anyone OVER 21. They're just too juvenile. Maybe Mike Myers thought he needed all the sick sight gags and jokes to capture the teen and pre-teen movegoers, but for those of us who are mature enough to have taste... oh, well, I guess we don't go to enough movies for producers to make money on good films.Actually, if you want to see a funny, sexy, but less offensive spy-spoof, I'd recommend Dean Martin's "Matt Helm" movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mike Meyers is pure genius.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Meyers portrays Austin Powers, a middle-aged secret agent with little physical sex appeal but the confidence of an Adonnis. This is not a one dimensional character like Mary Catherine Gallagher (Superstar). His personality is rich and somewhat complex.Austin is similar to Maxwell Smart in that he portrays a short, suave ladies man who at times is a pure square. He also resembles Max in the fact that sometimes he is shown up by his female crime-fighting partner on an intellectual basis, while at other times displays the skills of a crime-fighting genious.Virtually every supporting character is based on characters from 60's movies and television shows. Didn't you always wonder as a child why the Joker didn't kill Batman rather than constructing some elaborate torture device watched over by an inept security guard?? This movie isn't understandable and is somewhat childish if you didn't watch television or movies from the 60's. Otherwise the humour is pure genius and highly intellectual. So randy. Very very randy baby! Yeah!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Austin, it's a swinging shindig!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure why, but whenever I watch an Austin Powers film I'm always filled with a growing sense of disappointment. It's certainly not because of the two lead characters, who are destined to fuel many late night "who's the funniest?" drinking debates. I still can't make up my mind on that score. While the humour is occasionally near the knuckle (see the "Mama Cass" joke), it's usually affectionate, and Myer's cod English accent has me in stitches every time. I particularly love his use of antiquated Brit phrases ("Shut yer cakeole"; "on yer bike"), though if I wanted to be picky I'd point out no Englishman would ever say "carnies" or "popsicle". Dr.Evil is just as good, his description of his father - "made outrageous claims that he invented the question mark and had a penchant for buggery" - being particularly amusing.One of the ways in which this humour is successful is an almost "Carry On" style of audacity over cheese. So that Austin's answer to "how dare you break wind before me" being the ancient "I'm sorry baby, I didn't realise it was your turn" produces a laugh at the spirited lameness of it, rather than wincing. Lots of the jokes are like this, and though the "private parts covered by strategically placed inanimate objects" (one of the few things they did better in the sequel, using sillouettes) doesn't really work, most of them get by. The Bond gags are spot-on, too, and anyone citing them as unsophisticated is missing the point. Names like Basil Exposition, Patty O'Brien and Random Task are perfect mickey-takes, as well as Frau Farbissina's vocation as "founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army". Evil's plan of "let's just do what we always do, hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage" ably illustrates the agenda.However, while all these gags are pretty funny in a lovably juvenile way, I always find that the laughter stops after the first half an hour. I initially thought that this was because the films couldn't maintain their momentum, and while this is partly true, it's not wholly the case. I happened to catch a bit of this at the usually lacking half-way point and laughed just as loudly as I normally do at the start. It turns out that while the two leads have a very funny joke each, it IS just a single joke, and no film can survive on such a paltry supply. The budget-heavy sequel saw Michael McCullers join Myers as a co-writer, and it wasn't nearly as good. While some of the setpieces were inspired - Dr.Evil on Jerry Springer and a Thomas Crown Affair spoof - generally it was a flat retread. Quite amusing when watched alone, seen in conjunction with International Man of Mystery it's a reheated rehash. A quick example is the innuendo names for the villainous girls. The first gave us Alotta Fagina, the sequel Ivana Humpalot. The first is clearly the funnier version of the same joke, something that's symptomatic of the whole movie. The first was a likeable, knockabout parody of culture clashes and the Bond franchise. The Spy Who Shagged Me is a parody of Austin Power's own cult. Many of the jokes are reused wholesale, including multiple puns about a dead guard, the prolonged laughing gag and Mustafa still being alive, though out of sight. The only new additions to the formula fail to work. The only reason to watch So I Married An Axe Murderer was Myer's joint role as a drunken Scotsman, so it's rather odd that here the Scots "Fat B*****d" falls singularly flat. Mini-Me, Dr.Evil's clone, is also too vicious-looking to really appeal. A smugness pervades the whole piece, and the product placement of a certain lager (which reportedly increased sales by 15%) is as inappropriate as the unnecessary plugs for AOL in both films.This film, and its sequel, do make me laugh. Just never as much as I'd like them to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie in Brazil (in english) only a few hours before I was to board a plane and leave. It was very entertaining and very enjoyable. It can appeal to people of all ages (well not very young children) as some jokes are pure stupid-humor and some are more intelligent. Mike Myers did a brilliant job writing the script for this Bond spoof movie filled with laughs and spoofs from every direction. One of the funniest movies I have ever seen (keep in mind it's not a comedy to be taken seriously). Mike Myers in a double role of Austin Powers and Austin's enemy, Dr. Evil is hilariously funny and Elizabeth Hurley was well cast as the Bond-girl character. If you liked this movie you will most definitely enjoy the sequel- The Spy Who Shagged Me.Oh, and as for the person who said that eighth graders can't appreciate certain lines- I'm an eighth grader and have high respect for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rather enjoyed this movie, there were many funny moments, I especially liked watching the foolish characters (ie the easily fooled security guard)I was quite disappointed with the demanding role of the "easily fooled security guard". As someone who has been in contact with security guards, I find the performance rather stiff. He did not appear to be "easily" fooled, he appeared to be a fool. I was quite impressed with other demanding roles such as "friend of the easily fooled security guard" and the "Henchman flattened by steam roller". These people acted; one was a friend to a fool and the other was flattened rather nicely.Christian Slater is one of the worst actors you are likely to see on modern day films - and this role was possibly his best. Now that's saying something...However the movie itself was, as previously mentioned, quite good, especially the attention paid to the families of the poor poor henchmen - they are truly phenomenal!I commend you henchmen!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A swinging romp on the wild side!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like a unique talent for Mike Myers that he can make work a silly plot line, carry a dumb joke too far and basically get by on some extreme mugging for the camera. If it was in the hands of anyone else, perhaps Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery might not have worked.Myers relies on influences from his time spent in Britain, and perhaps a love for sixties spy films to bring us this film about a swinging spy for the British Secret Service who is frozen in order that he be around in case the dreaded Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) turns up in the future. In the late sixties, Evil escaped in a space ship with his cat, not to be heard from until the late nineties. The running gag in this effort is that these two sixties icons are now trying to carry on in the politically correct nineties. For Austin that means his sexual escapades are no longer acceptable. Here is an interesting commentary on male prowess as the sixties love machine is now striking out because he has bad teeth, flamboyant clothes and a tacky charm. Dr. Evil, meanwhile, tries to resume his plans to destroy the world, but he can't get past the fact that one million dollars is petty cash if you are going to hold the world hostage. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is not only filled with these decade versus decade gags, but Myers throws in a few of his old stand by bits as well. ("Look, I'm in an elevator" has been done a few times.) Myers has an appreciation for the old boys, making good use of folks like Robert Wagner, Michael York and Mimi Rogers. The film pokes fun at those old Bond flicks with characters like Alotta Fagina and Number Two. Dr. Evil ignores suggestions to simply shoot his prisoners, and instead chooses to put them in an 'easily escapable' scenario which he will decide not to watch. Bionic Man fans will of course remember the Fembots and fans of the sixties will love the Burt Bacharach cameo.Austin Powers works on a very basic level. It is funny (at least I thought so) however it is nothing more than that. The sophmoric humor is not too offensive, and while the plot seems to be a secondary concern for the film makers, I never found it to be boring. Fans of Mike Myers will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

Austin Powers is a unique film to say the least...it is going to be one that you either really like or truly find to be waste of your time...personally I found it to be entertaining.Quick story line... Austin Powers is a Not-so Secret Agent who is frozen in the 60's and is defrosted only when his counter-part Dr. Evil (who I think you will also recognize) defrosts and re-takes control of his underworld crime organization.Bottom line...Austin Powers is not James Bond, but he is definitely funnier than Bond has ever been.</fullReview>

Originally I didn't plan to see it at all, but with everyone constantly taking about how great it was, it was hard to resist taking a peek at it. After viewing it, I failed to understand what everyone was raving about. To me it was like a less funny and more perverted version of Ace Ventura. I got a few giggles out of it, but it was to cartoonish to really get into, and I have no desire to watch it again. I plan to see the sequel, but only out of pure curiosity. In conclusion I'd like to say: if you haven't seen it yet and you are under 14 knock yourself out!(see it)My rating: 7/10 Click on my link and see my other reviews!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Groovy! Smashing! Yay, Capitalism!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Swinging Sixties secret agent Austin Powers and his arch-rival, Doctor Evil, are both cryogenically frozen for thirty years. They emerge from hibernation in 1997 to do battle once more ... This is a funny film. The first of the Austin Powers comedies, it established the International Man Of Mystery as an instantly-recognizable comic persona, and paved the way for a shagtastic industry of endorsements and tie-ins. Capitalism really DID win the Cold War. It has often been said that the Bond films can't be parodied, because they are already parodies of themselves. Mike Myers proves the conventional wisdom wrong in this gagfest which he produced, co-wrote and starred in. He even wrote some of the 60's-pastiche songs in the closing credits. 'Austin' is a loving mickey-take of both the Bond movies and Swinging London, even down to split-screen jokes, trashy back-projections and cameo appearances by stars of the era (Burt Bacharach, Robert Wagner, Michael York ...). The 60's-style Vegas montage is particularly good. A comedy predicated on a single joke runs the risk of becoming tedious very quickly. 'Austin' is a success because Myers is able to interweave several comic techniques in one fabric. Brilliantly-executed visual gags (breakfast table and wedding suite) combine with nice satire (the guide showing tourists around Virtucon, played by Patrick Bristow) and plenty of other foolery, led by the amusing antics of Myers himself. From the effervescent show number in the opening title sequence to the (very good) hypnotised guard, the comic energy never lets up. Not all the gags work (the penis-enlarger is pumped too hard, if you'll forgive the pun). Liz Hurley and Fabiana Udineo, as Vanessa Kensington and Alotta Fagina respectively, provide good support, but the show belongs to Myers and the undentable ebullience of his creation, Austin Powers. Verdict - Shagadelic, baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is incredibly corny, but a great spoof of the James Bond films. I thought that Dr Evil with his cliche plans was the funniest part of the movie. It took a while but he made me laugh. The only thing it lacks is action, I know it's a comedy but if you're going to spoof James Bond movies, it could need some more action. Also the scene in Alotta Fagina's penthouse seemed a bit forced and unnecessary.Overall it's a good movie and maybe it will take some time but eventually you will laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all funny. A good idea wasted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of making a spoof spy thriller, based on a joke character from London's swinging, psychedelic sixties would be a good one, especially with the provision of an appropriate soundtrack to reflect the mood of the era.What a shame that such a good idea is so poorly realised in this unfunny and monotonous film. The jokes could have been so much better, and would have been much funnier and cleverer without the constant flow of direct sexual references and toilet humour.Despite its 15 certificate, this film is obviously aimed at the schoolboy mentality of those who are unable to appreciate the subtleties of innuendo or double-edged humour. Most of us like a bit of sexual humour, but there's nothing funny about that which is attempted in 'Austin Powers'. Even the producers of James Bond films make a better job of it, when it comes to humour. So much for 'Austin Powers' being a spoof movie.Unfortunately, there isn't even anything else in the way of good acting or characterisation to make up for the lack of funniness. It was a job to stay awake through the whole film, which I watched as a prelude to seeing the sequel 'The Spy Who Shagged Me'. However, if its anything like this first one I dont think I'll bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who says this is the funniest movie ever made? Stand up. Don't be afraid, just describe to me the funny scenes. The only two that were good was the scene in the bathroom stall and at the end when they censored out their naked bodies with certain objects. And that's IT. But calling this the funniest movie ever made is a bad idea. I hate to put it this way, but if this is a "funny movie", then so is "Howards End."Besides the two jokes that I mentioned, the rest fell flat. Mike Myers was obviously Mike Myers playing the characters, making it cheesy, not funny. (And don't give me that "it was supposed to be cheesy" Bull. I still didn't laugh.) Just a handful of pathetic attempts at humor (i.e. the 2 minute urination scene), none of them which hit the target. Unsurpisingly, this was a Hollywood movie aimed for the blockbuster Hollywood audience.It's a spy spoof with a different kind of plot. But just because a movie is "different" does not make it a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Movie is a great mix of "Wayne's World" and "Top Secret". There are lots of scenes that does not affect on anything, they've just put in there. Dr. Evil is really a corny version of the crock in the early 007 movies. He even has a similar cat, at first... Mike Myers has done a really great crazy comedy since Zucker brothers' and Abraham's "The Naked Gun" -movies. Austin Powers is not a toy boy look a like who makes women laugh... in the 90's. He is so OUTRAGEOUS with his habits and vocabulary that viewers enjoy his spirit of late 60's. I can't wait to see the next one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low comedy; decent spoof; good nostalgia; poor production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery is funny. It's not witty. It's none too smart. It could have been much, much funnier. However it is undeniably funny, if you like disjointed sketch comedy stretch out to its maximum degree and if you have seen the plethora of films being spoofed. It isn't just James Bond films (Connery only, Myers has some taste) being parodied, nor even the genre (Avengers, The Prisoner, Secret Agent, Our Man Flint), it is also the 'long-60's era' (The Graduate, The better Carry On films, Casino Royale, The Mouse That Roared, I Love You Alice B. Toklas, Smashing Time, Sleeper).The main problem here is that in Casino Royale, for instance, Peter Sellers - Myers' obvious template - already did a fantastic sendup of Bond. In that same film Ursula Andress was far more interesting and sexy than Alotta Fagina. Robert Wagner couldn't even begin to have the screen presence of Orson Welles as Le Chifre. In fact virtually nothing in Austin Powers is original. It's just a different person's vision of the same thing: parody revisited. In the best such parodies, however, the comedy is most effective when played straight. Austin Powers is intentionally camp and thus loses the edge it could have had, especially if it had been better written.Two things *are* original, or very nearly. The contextual juxtaposition of the 60's and the 90's is amusing and should have been taken much further. The character of Dr Evil - who in a reverse of the Bond norm is the only character *with* a character - is very interesting and could have been further explored. And this is exactly where the film shows its true character: half developed ideas lost in the attempt to spoof an era. This is just a long series of sketches welded together...vaguely. The production quality is also low. This may have been part of the parody, but I don't think it is.If you want to see hilarious, intelligent low-budget sketch comedy beautifully welded into a single story, see Monty Python and the Holy Grail. If you want a good giggle and someone else pays, Austin Powers is a good choice...if you've seen the right movies to get the jokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie. Mike Myers is great. He's really cool as Austin AND Dr. Evil.The plot of this movie that Austin and Vanessa are trying to stop Dr. Evil from destroying the world. But as you watch the movie, it becomes more and more evident that in this one they made the plot fit the jokes, not vice versa. They did a good job doing this, but you can still see that the movie is concentrating more on sex jokes than the plot. It makes it look like the crew wanted to get done with the plot as quickly as possible and get down to the jokes. But I(and I'm sure most other people) can deal with that, considering how funny the movie turned out. It really didn't need a plot, actually. The jokes would have made it so funny that they would have let it pass without one.This is not the type of movie that you sit down with popcorn and soda, put your feet up and put the lights out for. It's more of a movie that you watch at a party where you'll have something good to do afterwards, or where you have nothing else to do. But anyway, this is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to think of this movie as tons of little smilies put together with loose duct tape to make a bigger, but not so big, smily. Which in that case you only need to tap slightly in any place and it will collapse instantly.Synopsis for the social influentially impaired: Austin Powers is a '60s secret agent who was frozen in cryostate to be thawed when his great nemesis, Dr. Evil returns in another attempt to take over the world. He gets thawed out in 1997 and discovers the "Free love no longer rain and greed and corruption rule again."Austin Powers is what Mike Myers always wanted to do, and to say it simply, I hope he does better than dreams. I think this is a hasty movie, ending at 87 minutes and it still looks like it was done in the form "That's a good scene, I want it in, that's good too, put that in, that's...eh...not so good, but put it in also."Mike Myers did some other, greater films like "So I married an axe murderer" that was better and "Wayne's World" (Only the first) but that's about it from what I've seen.I didn't see the sequel and I don't intend paying 'A some of money equivalent to 6$ for it' and I don't even know if I'll add it to my video collection when, if ever, it will appear on video.To conclude, "If you see only one movie this year, go see The Matrix; If you see two movies, then go see Star Wars; if you see three, then still don't see Austin Powers, Go-Go see Inspector Gadget or Tarzan, I'm sure there are much better."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen all the hype for the sequel and so felt I had to see this film. Boy what a disappointment. Its been around 35 years since the release of the first Bond films and if this is the best spoof anyones been able to come up with in that time then we're all a very sorry bunch*. Mike Myers it has to be said is a very funny and talented guy but seems to have put almost no effort into driving the film. Scenes stagger from sketch to sketch and there is almost nothing to maintain interest once the punch of the schoolboy humour has lost its giggle value. The only reason I'd want to see the sequel is to try to work out why it has been received so well.The old adage that nobody ever lost money underestimating the intelligence of the buying public to me seems the only explanation. Hats off to Mike Myers, though, he's certainly going to be laughing a lot longer than his audiences.*It isn't. For a funnier Bond spoof check out David Niven in Casino Royale, released in the 60's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers strikes out on his own as a writer/producer in Austin Powers, and this is surely his best work to date (the sequel "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is, in ways, even better). Myers proves himself to be a hilarious character actor, playing both Austin Powers and his arch-nemesis, Dr. Evil. Myers imbues both characters with traits and characteristics that make them both modern-day cinematic legends. The script is fast and funny, director Jay Roach keeps it moving along nicely with an episodic feel, and everything just comes together perfectly. One of the best comedies in a long, long time.

It's obvious he idolizes Peter Sellers and his unique ability, but unfortunately he falls short.The Austin Powers role is good, and he has that role down just fine, but I don't think he put as much time into the Dr. Evil character. Aside from that, the movie was OK, but not as good as people make it out to be. I've heard mixed reviews about the sequel.

		<fullReview>Whether you liked the film or not, whether the jokes in this film made you laugh (as they did me) or cringe (as they did others), it is not, as some have stated, sloppy or stupid filmmaking by any means. I draw attention to the fact that the film spoofs not only James Bond (repeatedly), but both the Avengers (with the original Mrs. Kensington and her vinyl outfit, the female assassin who's "a man, baby") as well as "The Prisoner" (Austin's car, the repeated question, "Who does Number 2 work for?"). As a genre-spoof, it brought more to the table than just playing on the familiar jokes over and over again. Far from a missed opportunity, this was a rare gem of a film that attempted success on several levels. If it didn't always work, then that is a matter of taste. But whether the film was a worthy attempt at parody I think is beyond question.</fullReview>

He's a comic genius! This film obviously spoofs the cheesy James Bond flicks of the 60's, which I never thought were very good anyway. And the "groovy" hippie colors and endless sex talk all add up to make this one hell of a funny movie! Dr. Evil(also played by Myers) is hilarious as a stereotypical James Bond villain! I now know how to shut somebody up when I want. Just do what Dr. Evil did when his son desperately tried to talk. Remember, there is no plot and no point to this movie! Just pure laughs, which is what I feel a comedy is supposed to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the greatest movie ever!!! It is absolutely hilarious! I watch it over and over again and I die laughing every time. Mike Myers is fabulous as Austin and Dr. Evil. I love Dr. Evil and mr.Bigglesworth(the cat). They kill me! And Seth Green is so funny as Scott Evil. This is honestly one of the best "dumb" comedies I've seen. I love the British accents. I copy them all the time. I can't wait till the sequel comes out! I'll be the first in line to see it. It'll be 'groooovey baby'!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie maybe because I'm a big Bond fan and I got all the jokes but those of you who aren't Bond fans you should catch a Bond flik first (especially "you only live twice" and "thunderbolt"). This is Mike Myers' best work since Wanes World and So I married an ax-murderer (which are by the way great movies) he has a brilliant script and hilarious comments throughout the film. Liz Hurley is a terrible actress and if you watch closely you can see she is always laughing when she is on the screen with Mike, it doesn't matter though because the role is simply to look beautiful (and she does that better than anyone). I'll never grow tired of laughing at this movie and if you aren't a complete humorless b*****d you will laugh too. It really stands out because it leaves out the "crap" and "s***" humor so many comedies tend to focus on when they're trying to do something new. The movie also has the best one-liners I've heard in a long time.A must see over and over and over and.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the funniest movie that I have ever seen. The dialogue may seem a little callow at first, but there are so many hidden jokes that the movie needs to be watched over and over to catch. Everyone in my family loves this movie, from my six year old brother, to my middle-aged father. Mike Myers is, as always, great. He is such a versatile actor as displayed in his opposite portrayals of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil. After I watched the movie, I was asking myself who played Dr. Evil, until I realized that it was the same person, a fact that I was amazed by. There was no aspect of this movie that wasn't great, and I am extremely excited to see the much-hyped sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie simply cannot be judged by normal standards. When I first walked in on someone watching this movie, I thought 'What a load of B.S.'. Now, however, it seems that my first reaction seems to be just that: a first reaction. Enjoying 'Austin Powers' is about letting loose, getting off that intellectual high horse, and opening up to a brand of humour. The thing is, everyone creating Austin Powers KNOWS the jokes are farcical, overdone and lame; they know their material is widely associated with bad comedy. Yet, they take that fact and turn it 180 degrees to create a comedy style that offers more: a parody of itself almost. Most definitely, a love it or leave it movie. No; there IS a third option: Shag it, baby, yeah!To enjoy: lose pretentious aesthetic taste.</fullReview>

That should have given it an advantage, however, it fails to do anything with it.The whole 60's thing was ridiculous and Myers was basically tolerable - at best. I didn't give it a 5 or a 4 only because it was unique and had a big heart. As to laughs, it was a 5 or a 4 - no better..I realize the big majority of voters gave it a higher rating, but at one time the human race believed the earth to be flat.

		<fullReview>The Satire wins out, but it's a close call. Myers-as-Powers is incredibly repulsive in this movie (he's great as Dr. Evil). There's a lot of spoofing going on here, and it's a lot more focused than, say, your average Hot Shots or Police Squad movie. But a little bit of Myers goes a long, long, long way. The movie also runs out of steam a bit, so near the end we're reduced to watching Powers endlessly try to move his go-cart. The Dr. Evil scenes are hilarious though, and clearly the best part of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just the perfect spoof of the Bond movies and those old 60's TV series they repeat all the time. I could just about quote the whole film by now! Myers is the superspy who was frozen in the sixties and brought back to life in the nineties to stop his arch enemy Dr Evil (also Myers) from taking over the world. Myers as Austin is very funny at times but starts getting irritating about half way through the film. But Dr Evil steals the show, a send up of Donald Plesence in Dr No, he gets all the best situations (the way he holds the world to ransom for the ridiculously low sum of one million dollars and all the world leaders laugh at him) it's worth seeing this film just for him! Liz Hurly does a good job of sending herself up Powers sidekick and the unfortunate victim of his randiness. I recommend that you see this film because it is very fun and genuinely funny in places. It always has me in stitches!</fullReview>

This is his movie, everyone else pretty much sits in the sidelines (no big problem, it isn't like Elizabeth Hurley's character has any other characteristics besides being hot, just like most "Bond girls."). He even manages to outact himself under the guise of "Dr. Evil," the perfect stereotypical spy villain. He can become tiresome a bit as Austin Powers, but as Dr. Evil, Mike Myers shines.</fullReview>

Of all of the people I know who saw the movie, most loved it as the humorous slapstick comedy it was. A few (very few) people just absolutely hated it. For those who like good ol' slapstick humor, this movie is a must. It's definitely worth the $3.00 rental.

		<shortDescription>Not a very funny spoof.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedian Mike Myers stars as a 1960s hipster secret agent, who was cryonically frozen and released in the 1990's in order to battle his evil nemesis, Dr. Evil (Mike Myers). His goofy and flashy personality was out of place for the 1990s, but he seemed to hit it off with his partner-in-crime, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley).The plot of Dr. Evil and his mad plan of holding the world hostage was, unfortunately, not emphasized enough in the film, which made the story less intriguing. Much of the movie was centered toward Austin Powers trying to woo Vanessa, which resulted in goofy but boring chemistry and an awkward attempt at romance.The movie was an obvious spoof to James Bond, but it wasn't tastefully done - there was no suspense. The "hero" of the film, Austin Powers, didn't really do anything in the movie except showing off his awfully hairy chest and cheap moves on Vanessa; at least the Naked Gun movies delivered laugh-out-loud humor and actually had solid good guy vs. bad guy plot devices and action. What you got here were just obvious sexual innuendos, crude jokes, and adolescent stuff.You will get some chuckles here and there on some of the slapstick puns, but the movie is mostly boring, juvenile and low-humored which as a result, in my opinion, makes it overrated.Grade D--</fullReview>

Though the plots differ nominally, the three separate parts of the trilogy are essentially the same movie with the same jokes just put in different order. But they're good jokes, and it's just as funny watching Myers and company deliver the same punch line for the third time as it was the first.Grade: B for the whole series</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first film in what became a surprisingly successful trilogy for actor-writer-comedian Mike Myers, here concocting a knowing and often hilarious send-up of spy-and-sex spoofs from the Swinging '60s. Austin Powers, a super-cool ladies' man in 1960s London, has been frozen in a cryogenics lab, but is eventually thawed out in 1997 just in time to battle the nefarious Dr. Evil. Mike Myers' creation of fish-out-water Powers (as well as Dr. Evil, a Bondian villain, whom he also plays) is a deft, original human cartoon, invested with shameless, lascivious glee. Powers is not without a heart (and feelings), rare qualities in a mad-slapstick satire, though Myers is hardly a sentimentalist and, for the most part, the gags are aimed at the rafters. The world-takeover plot is just a sketch, and Dr. Evil does become gratuitous, but Myers is having so much fun that it's nearly impossible not to join him. The childish bad taste (on a locker room level) becomes a running joke, and the sniggering naughtiness is infectious (one laughs helplessly, as with some of Mel Brooks' better films). Followed next by 1999's "Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me". *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What this movie (as well as its sequel) needs is a good cutting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being not a very bad movie it lacks decency badly. "Gaudy trash" are the best words to describe this fest of "hits and misses". The movie gets from vulgar and embarrassing to quite funny and cute. What this movie (as well as its sequel) needs is a good cutting. If you cut all the bad and vulgar things out of the film and leave everything genuinely funny, you can get a very bright example of modern comedy. Unfortunately it has more misses than hits. Therefore only 4 out of 10 and I am very sad that such a brilliant concept and such a bright film went many wrong ways and made too many wrong turns.I don't think that I should name all the misses, do I. Maybe just one or two, or three for you just to understand what I mean. Dr Evil's speech during a kind of "psychological father-son rehabilitation seminar" is not funny but vulgar. All the fuss with the "Swedish gadget" is very annoying. The ways the evil characters are killed off leaves much to be desired: they don't have a chance to show off (it looks as if the filmmakers were short of ideas). The evil female character disappears without any noticeable performance, and so on and so forth.If it were only 50 minutes long but with the best excerpts included, it would be a very well made comedy.Mr Michael Myers, if you read this, take note that you do have talent but there is great responsibility for every talented comedian to put it right. If you make a comedy, you should make it in such a way that every child and adult could enjoy it without getting embarrassed and annoyed. Adult sexual humour often kills even smartest comedies while the permanent classics of Mr Charles Chaplin, Mr Buster Keaton, and Mr Norman Wisdom will remain immortal Art of comedy genre. Did these masters ever get vulgar in their classics? You know the answer.4 out of 10 with a sigh. Thanks for attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, I won't say I hated this movie. In fact I liked it a bit more then I expected. But I DO think it was severely over-hyped. Here is why I didn't like it much:Obvously-this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously AT ALL. It's a comedy. But the trouble is, I just didn't find it that funny. Maybe this just isn't my brand of humor. I like comedies as a genre-for instance Something about Mary is a great one. It is vulgar at times yet manages to be funny ALL the time! With Austin Powers, it just doesn't work. Or maybe it does-for about the first 30 minutes-after that, it just becomes overdone and overplayed. And somewhat obnoxious. But then again, there are some people who hate Something about Mary so who knows-everyone has their favorites...I think the acting was wonderful-but Austin Powers is the type of movie, I think, one will either adore or just not like at all. It's not a 1 or 2 for me, which I thought it would be but it Also didn't get above the average mark for me and I wouldn't see it again.I'd say this is watchable but a bit tedious after awhile and sometimes obnoxious without lacking the true hilarity necessary in an obnoxious comedy to make it great(though I did appreciate the ending.)But overall, this never really made me laugh that much nor did it leave a lasting impression on me. Another thing- I have not seen the sequels except for the first few minutes of number 2 which throughly ruined any enjoyment I got from this one anyway so I doubt I'll be watching any more Austin Powers sequels. I'd rate this a 5 at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea why this movie is so popular. There's some funny stuff in it, but most of the jokes fall flat. It's just a bunch of low humor and stupid characters. The movie tries to be smart and original, but isn't. It is hard to believe that such a great comedic actor like Mike Myers wrote such a mediocre screenplay, let alone starred in the flick. I was considering better from the man who created WAYNE'S WORLD. He gives it all he's got to try and make the movie work though in the end, that isn't enough. There's about 30-45 minutes of good material here that is stretched out to 90 minutes. Still, as I mentioned before, there are some funny scenes and Elizabeth Hurley makes great eye candy so it's somewhat recommendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blatant rip-off of "Get Smart"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this movie for the first time, back in 1998, I was shocked that it was such a big rip-off of the brilliant '60s spy spoof "Get Smart." Three years, a sequel, and hundreds of millions of dollars have passed, and my opinion still hasn't changed. In fact, it's gotten worse. If *anywhere* Mike Myers said that the movie was inspired by "Get Smart," my opinion of the film might be better. But, no, he hasn't.In the original "Austin Powers," I counted at least three big gags that were exact duplicates of gags seen in previous "Get Smart" episodes! What's more, Austin Powers himself is no more than a horny Maxwell Smart with bad teeth. There's virtually no distinction (except, of course, that "Get Smart" was much better written, and Don Adams is a much better actor than Mike Myers). And Elizabeth Hurley's character is nothing more than a female Agent 99. Towards the end of the movie, when the Fembots reveal that they have guns in their breasts, I found myself saying, in my best Maxwell Smart voice, "The old gun in the fake breast trick!"What bugs me is that people today, not familiar with "Get Smart," think "Austin Powers" is an intelligent spy spoof. It's really not. It's just a rip-off of a far more intelligent spy spoof. And not a very good one at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect James Bond Spoof!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the perfect spoof of any James Bond movie. Most parodies of James Bond make fun only of "The name is Bond, James Bond," and the fact that you don't see Blofeld's face in the movies. That gets extremely old after a while, and that is why Austin Powers is so good. It makes fun of other, funnier things, such as the bad jokes the hero makes when killing a villain, the villains' never killing the hero when he has the chance, and the hero's only wanting to have fun. If you're tired of all the James Bond movies' stupid points, or if you just want to laugh a whole lot, see Austin Powers. It's cool!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just finished reading the comments on this film and noticed two peculiar phenomena: 1) people either love it or hate it and 2) no matter what everybody seems to miss the point. the first statement is of course easily verifiable, so I'll only comment on the first one.everybody seems to be thinking this is either something like a Mel Brooks-type parody or just a comical film. It isn't. It's so much more than those. sure, it's got predictable gags and one-liners, but they aren't what's funny about the movie. neither are the direct James Bond inspired thingies (dr Evil? number 2? slow killing contraptions?) They are indeed predictable and mostly quite stupid. But simply saying that, and judging the movie by it is not doing it any justice. The point wasn't the joke, it was killing the joke over and over. The point wasn't the obvious spoof. it was the whole movie not the single parts. it was the subtle direction parody, not dr. evil. It was ... the fact that it's not a '60s or Bond parody, but a parody of the nineties. of our way of life. It was also a parody of every comical movie available by simply taking a joke and then making it ten times dumber, more obvious and generally unexpected because of this, and then repeating the joke ad nauseam and ultimately killing it. It's...oh, did I like it? of course I did. You could too. just try a little harder :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Freaked Out Groovy Happening, Baby. Yeah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it true this film bombed at the box office in 1997, and only achieved success when replayed on cable and home video? It had everyone laughing at the theater I saw this in. But it's not hard to imagine this film taking time to reach an audience, or latching on so well once it did."Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery" or AP1, as I will refer to it, is a repellant, stupid, sky-high-on-itself little comedy that grows on you like a tumor, albeit a very benign one. Mike Myers wrote his own starring vehicle to demonstrate he still had a film career after milking the "Wayne's World" franchise dry. His Austin Powers is a lecherous British toad who lives a life of superspy danger, impossibly beautiful women, and appalling velvet fashion statements.He might have been funny for about 10 minutes, 15 tops, but what keeps the movie going are two other things. One is Michael Myers' other character, Dr. Evil, a bizarrely low-key megavillain who really can sustain comedy for long stretches at a time, belittling his henchmen and waving his cat around like a pointing stick. The other is the look and feel of this movie, a very detailed and vibrant homage to a certain type of 1960s look, call it Swinging London, that is very spot-on and disciplined even in its surreal goofiness. Notice there are wide-waled corduroys, ridiculous hats, miniskirts, but no paisley in evidence. Paisley would make it late-1960s flower-power rather than what it is, mid-1960s Mary Quant. It's not like you have to know any of this. It's just there, eye candy that serves the message of the film.And what is the message? Austin throws up a statement at the end which is supposed to sum it all up, that freedom and responsibility together are a groovy thing and so on, but for me the purpose of this film is twofold. One is to make you laugh, which it does. Not all the time. The bathroom bits are overdone to be sure, and Myers' idea of comic genius at times is to beat a joke into the ground and then stomp on it a bit more for good measure. But the film is funny, in part because Myers is no snob about making you laugh. He sees something funny, he goes for it. He's one present-day comic not afraid of shtick.The other purpose is a homage to the spy movie, specifically the Sean Connery James Bond movies; Bond imitators Matt Helm (Dean Martin), Harry Palmer (Michael Caine), and Derek Flint (James Coburn); and the over-the-top 1960s Bond farce "Casino Royale," which was the cinematic equivalent of the Hindenburg but remains a film everyone should see once. Peter Sellers in that last film is clearly a model for Austin: There's even a scene where Austin strikes poses on a revolving bed much like Sellers did in a 'Casino' scene with Ursula Andress. Myers said one of the 'Flint' movies was his favorite growing up, and clearly he is having nostalgic fun sending it all up. Bad cinema is impervious to satire, but these films weren't bad, and the kind of satire doled out in AP1 is never less than affectionate.Great opening credit sequence especially. I love the scene where Michael York plays the circa-1960s Basil Exposition; he looks like Brian Jones. This was followed by one sequel that was a little funnier though less focused and soulful, and then another several cuts below in quality, but this remains the definite Austin Powers film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was never released in theaters down here in Brazil. I stumbled upon it on a video rental store, and got because I had always liked Mike Myers from his work at Saturday Night Live and the first Wayne´s World. I was delighted with the freshness of the spoofs and ideas, all the thousands of little jokes they placed all along. You can´t take your eyes away from the TV for a minute without missing a joke. I cried out of laughter at that meeting room sequence, when Dr. Evil punishes a reckless collaborator using all sorts of villain clichés in the book... it´s all fun. The sequel to it gave way to much more of Myers ego than his talent, and to me it was too nasty sometimes. The second sequel, Goldmember, is a lot better, but in the end they are very worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One has to realize that this film was pretty much a total failure. Sure, the film three times its budget, but one cannot look past the stale nature of the jokes and all of the inside jokes that only a few people could get (aptly known as the Dennis Miller ration). I commend Mike Myers for creating Austin Powers and giving my generation a great spoof character, but most of this film was quite a miss. Seth Green was great in his performance as the angry Scott Evil, and Mimi Rogers managed to look ravishing in her short role as Mrs. Kensington. Beyond that however, this film needed a little more work before it should have been released. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having grown up during the cold war, I love the James Bond movies. I always have. Although I liked Timothy Dalton the least, there wasn't a James Bond I didn't love. And, while Pierce Brosnan is by far my favorite, I grew up during the Roger Moore era.That having been said, the ability to laugh at the things we love (including ourselves) is a gift. That's exactly what Mike Meyers gives us with these movies; a gift.The disrespectful homage to a very successful run of movies is well done, and well received.I always laugh when I watch this one. It is an excellent parody and rates up there with "Spaceballs," in my book. This movie is far from "witty," but it is highly enjoyable.Top row, Mike Meyers!

		<fullReview>Like almost any other spoof, this film manages to make you make you laugh, but unlike most spoof's it does so quite frequently. Other differences with most spoofs are, that this film has a quite subtle form of humor (unlike for instance Scary Movie) and that this film does not get toot crazy and 'over the top' with it's jokes (like Hot Shots and any Leslie Nielsen film). This spoof, actually gets you involved in the characters and the story and never produces an awkward moment when a joke falls flat (which does not even happen if I remember it right for myself). All of this is the achievement of the great cast and the director who also did a splendid job (not to mention the casting people who provided the ?necessary' eye candy). International man of mystery is a good film in it's genre (spy-a-delic spoof), but no overall classic.7 out of 10P.S. Next week I'll comment on The Spy who Shagged me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Mike Meyers sure brings out his A-game in this one, both writing and double-starring as Austin Powers and Dr. Evil. Many comedies these days have problems of being funny but not very memorable. This is one that will definitely stick to you for maybe years.Yes, the humor is ridiculously stupid, but it's stupid in the way that it's clever. Some movies are funny, but the humor has nothing special about it. Austin Powers is a movie where it sticks out from most goofball comedies. I'm no James Bond fan, so that's why I love this movie, since it pokes fun at that franchise. It makes fun of spy clichés in every way. Austin Powers, who's considered the biggest hit of the sixties, is in today's society dim-witted, always thinks that everything he does is dashing when it's really humiliating, and has the world's worst teeth, in every way the opposite of Sir James Bond. But for some reason you like both Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, just because their personalities stick out from most goofball villains and heroes, in the sense that their personalities are in absolutely NO way acceptable today, on the good or bad side. It's hilarious seeing 60's humor clash with 90's humor clash with British Humor clash with teeth, something no other movie I've seen do.The only reason I gave an 8 out of 10 is because I will admit that it's not for people expecting a motion picture built on a grand scale. And I'll admit some parts were just a little too goofy. But it's one of those movies where if you're looking for a special goofball, Austin Powers is the guy you're looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1967 and famous British spy Austin Powers has defeated his nemesis Dr. Evil. Dr. Evil proceeds to do the only logical thing, escape in a rocket ship disguised as a Big Boy statue and cryogenically freeze himself (and his cat). Austin Powers volunteers to be frozen in case Dr. Evil returns to wreak havoc in the future. Thirty years pass. It's 1997 and Dr. Evil is back. Time to unfreeze Austin Powers who is about to find out the '90s aren't quite as groovy as the '60s.Dr. Evil plots to steal a nuclear weapon and hold the world hostage for one million dollars! Er, one hundred billion dollars! A million bucks just doesn't buy what it used to. Dr. Evil has got a lot to catch up on, as does Austin Powers, the product of the swinging '60s who is very much out of place in the more sedate '90s. This leads to some good laughs, many of which center around Austin's attempt to get his new partner, the stunningly beautiful Vanessa Kensington, to sleep with him. Sadly, Austin's tried-and-true '60s seduction techniques aren't going to work on Vanessa. Meanwhile, there's the small matter of foiling Dr. Evil's dastardly plan.The movie maybe never hits the heights of comedic genius. It's never uproariously funny but it is reasonably amusing. And charming too. Mike Myers does very well with the dual roles of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil though there is the nagging sense that the bad guy is funnier than the titular hero. There is little question the funniest moments come from Dr. Evil, the prototypical James Bond villain who knows he's the prototypical James Bond villain. Among other things this means he must have over-elaborate ways of doing everything when he knows darned well a simpler way would surely suffice. And it also of course means he is fated to be frustrated. What's a guy got to do to get some sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads? Dr. Evil is a hoot, Austin Powers sometimes less so but you root for him. He's charming in his own very unique way. Maybe Vanessa will even come to love him. Happily Elizabeth Hurley, playing Vanessa, proves to be a model who can actually act. She more than holds her own with Myers, the two work well together. There are other familiar faces in the cast, including Michael York, Robert Wagner and Seth Green, who all do well with their respective roles. But the movie obviously belongs to Myers, this is his baby. And he pulls it off well enough. Yes, the humor is hit and miss but there are enough hits to keep you smiling. This is the spoof James Bond deserved. Yeah, baby, yeah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is a brilliant movie with a very well written storyline and a fantastic comedic cast. It is certainly one of my favourite feel good comedies, it instantly makes me smile and puts me in a good mood every time I watch, it has many memorable quotes and strange, unrelatable, but very lovable characters. The only scenes that bother me in this movie is when they go way too far with a joke, such as the scene where Austin is urinating or the death of one of Dr. Evil's henchman, it dosen't suit the tone of humour that we see in the majority of the film and is more so annoying than funny. The performances are outstanding, they seemed very hard to do as they are very high energy and it seems as if the whole cast didn't deliver, the entire movie would stumble, but luckily they all did very well, Mike Myers is the highlight of the film of course, playing both the protagonist and the antagonist, he shines in both roles and it is very hard to believe that Austin Powers and Dr. Evil are the same person, they are simply iconic performances. Hilarious from start to finish with memorable quotes and lovable characters, I would recommend Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery to anyone looking for a good comedy. Special agent Austin Powers is defrosted after 30 years in a cryogenic freeze to match wits with his nemesis, Dr. Evil. Best Performance: Mike Myers Worst Performance: Paul Dillon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Robert Wagner, Seth Green, Mimi Rogers: They call him the international man of mystery perhaps for his ability to spellbind his female admirers. Satire of James Bond films beginning in 1967 where Austin Powers foils a world domination scheme by Dr. Evil who freezes himself and launches into space. Thirty years later Powers is thawed and given the task of stopping Dr. Evil again. Slapstick violence highlights the climax with use of a penis enlarger to tag on the double ending. Director Jay Roach exploits the Bond clichés with Dr. Evil making for a hilarious villain. Mike Myers embodies both Powers and Evil with great comic timing. Elizabeth Hurley plays an agent trying to maintain focus. Unfortunately the role is cardboard standard issue and never rises above being a simple sex tease. Her only real function is to be hit on by Powers. Robert Wagner steals scenes as agent Number Two in a role that also seems standard until he has a breakdown moment. Seth Green is terrific as Dr. Evil's son Scott who resents his dad and desires to be an animal vet. Mimi Rogers plays Austin's partner in the 1960's and Hurley turns out to be the product of their partnership. Highlighted with frozen images of celebrities past their prime resulting in a colourful laugh riot. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goofy, but Excels as a Parody of the 1960's Spy Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goofy, cheesy, and corny, but what did you expect? A lot of it was made up of dumb unsophisticated juvenile humor, but it was still funny enough to keep me entertained and interested. Some of it got a little old like turning every word into a sexual reference or making certain scenes too drawn out. It was also fun to see secondary characters being played by unknowns at the time like Will Ferrel, Brian George, and Seth Green. The appearance of the movie was also stylish, aesthetically pleasing and of course groovy. The most enjoyable part of the film was the spoof-like nature of it. It made fun of spy shows from the 60's and parodied (my favorite part) the beginning James Bond movies by including situations, lines, and similar characters straight from those overrated classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just say right here that Dr. Evil in the first AUSTIN POWERS is Mike Myers' greatest comedic contribution. His tics, his line delivery, his scenes with Seth Green; genuinely hilarious stuff. And on the whole, the first movie still stands head and shoulders above the others - if for no other reason than it doesn't topple over into overkill. Everything here is just right: the spoof of all the iconic OO7 elements (Dr. No, Blofeld's cat, Oddjob, Pussy Galore), Powers' goofy charm, even the odd DEMOLITION MAN gag thrown in. The idea of bringing the misogynistic '60s face-to-face with the PC '90s is brilliant, and makes for several great jokes. It tickles me that they got Robert Wagner and Michael York to do this movie. They even manage to wring some laugh out of Tom Arnold (no mean feat).Easily Myers' best movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an enjoyable experience. Mike Myers found a way to take a well-known spy icon and make him feeble-minded yet at the same time, gain our affection for him from start to finish. A very smart and original idea that would have backfired if the material was handed to someone else. The movie follows Austin Powers frozen from the 60s and thawed to resume his life in the contemporary 90s.Elizabeth Hurley joins him as the sexy sidekick and together, they must stop Dr. Evil from taking over the world through power &amp; extortion. Austin has to save the day while trying to blend into the modern world. There are plenty of great laughs and pop culture references that are similar to what Myers did in Wayne's World. Here, the jokes are fresh and the character is so memorable, even though he has his flaws.I can safely say that this is the best in the series yet. The other two sequels aren't as good, but they're all still a bunch of fun to watch. This was the era when Mike Myers was truly in the strongest position of his career. Before you see the other two, give this one a watch and have a few laughs with some friends!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lighter side of Dr No</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking back on it, it was amazing that no one thought of completely lampooning those old Sean Connery Bond films until 1997. They were pretty over-the-top, but I guess that's what we loved about them. And, I dare say that the writer/star of 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,' - Mike Myers - loves them as much as the rest of us. For he gives us a most loving take on the unspoken absurdities that we deliberately chose to overlook in the Bond films. He plays both hero and villain here as a swinging spy, frozen in the sixties and defrosted in the - rather more politically correct - nineties to do battle with the (Blofeld-like) Dr Evil.Despite being an American production, it has a very British feel to it. Everything is made fun of, but you never feel like they're being particularly cruel - it's all quite 'loving mockery' (if you know what I mean). It's not just a string of naughty jokes, but it also does go a little deeper in highlighting the change in attitudes from the 'free love' of the sixties to the more reserved nineties.There's nothing here that's particularly clever, just a stream of innuendos which seem like they've been taken straight out of the original Carry On films. But, if you're in the mood for some general silliness (and have a healthy knowledge of the old Bond films), you should enjoy the crazy ride and find you're spouting the several Powers/Evil catchphrases for some time to come.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" is a pretty funny spoof of the spy genre, especially making fun of the James Bond movies. I did thought this movie was hilariously funny, when I was young back then. Now by looking back at it, it was not as hilariously funny as I remember. Don't get me wrong I still think that this is a funny movie, but it wasn't as hilariously funny as I remember. When you have some dirty jokes in the movie like having our two lead actors getting naked, it just depends on whether is funny or not; at times it can be funny, and at times it can't. I just only wish if the jokes where funny if they would make me laugh the most. Nevertheless, the movie is still funny. Aside from the humor, some of the CG effects of the Big Boy weren't that good either, but it does not take me out of the movie as I am enjoying it. So those are the only parts where I have issues with, but they are not really a big deal. I thought Mike Myers has done a great job for not only writing the script, but playing two parts in the movie. Elizabeth Hurley is absolutely stunning in the movie, and she does manage to take on the role pretty well. The action scenes were done fine, but nothing spectacular about it. You do get some nice cameos like Will Ferrell, Tom Arnold, and such. The movie does hold up really well, but the jokes and the CG effects of the Big Boy could have been better. I still enjoy this movie and I am giving it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Who is cryogenically frozen in 1969 to do battle with the evil Blofeld Lookalike Dr.Evil (Also Myers). Austin is thawed out in 1997 to a very different world where Swingers are all but extinct. He is partnered up with the daughter of his original partner Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) to do battle with Dr.Evil and his hilarious Minions like Number 2 (Robert Wagner) and Frau Farbissina.Perfect film for James Bond fans; packed with lots of references to James Bond and the Spy Genre whilst also being able to be original. It has lots of quotable quotes like "Groovy". It also features parodies of Iconic James Bond scenes and great 60's costumes and locations. Great film and would highly recommend it- 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 90's iconic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery the first in the Austin Powers series, is a just about good film and make's for a comedy with all the trademarks you can expect from such a film. Quite funny and give's off some good laughs for you, but also provides a fairly good spy film as well just like a James Bond but with much funnier humour than even Roger Moore. I'll tell below why I think it is a good film.The story is solid and as I said a good spy film and with Dr Evil being one of the most famous and most funny villains in film, you can't help just feel good whilst watching it. The film has a slow start but get's into it quick enough and Powers is humorous throughout but it really is Dr Evil who steals the humour off him in this first instalment. Finally on the story it is actually a good Sci-Fi too which blends in well with the comedy and crime and also makes for some crazy sequences.I do like Mike Myers in this film but I felt he failed slightly at playing Austin Powers as his other portrayal of Dr Evil is much funnier and basically rules he comedy in this piece. Liz Hurley is a good performance as Power's agent helper and she guides the more serious side of agents which is then lampooned by Austin. Finally One great comedy part of this is with Dr Evil's table of evil people, and his son Scott who is just brilliant(Seth Green portraying) and the only person who isn't frightened of Dr Evil and constantly complains about little things.I think the set's and gadgets etc used are great because they optimise what James Bond uses but completely humour's them and makes for some funny joke set up's. It is well written comedy wise by Mike Myers who serve's as the main actor, producer and writer and he put's together a film that he truly owns, it also makes you want to see what he could write for the next instalments and that would test his skill that is seen in this film.The film can be unfunny and not that I think everyone will hate the jokes but some jokes just miss the mark and become just to crude, slightly less crude and this film could have been massively better but it is still a good comedy all around. I think also that the story is obviously not the strongest ever but what do you expect with a comedy, and don't think this film isn't funny because people say it isn't, just watch it first.I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good and crude comedy that can be tasteless at times but manages enough class to be funny but also sophisticated in it's jokes. If you don't enjoy a lot of sexual humour then this isn't for you as Powers is a sex addicted man from the 60's who tries it on with any female he see's it seems but though it isn't serious perverseness he is obviously making himself look stupid to make you laugh.Overall a just about good film, it only just scrapes out being good rather than just fairly good but I think many will agree with me, although some will be disappointed with this film as well so I expect mixed reviews from most who see it. Worth a watch and if you watch it purely for the comedy you can enjoy yourself, just don't open your mind too much or you may not enjoy it as much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first of the Austin Powers movies is also the best. A delightful spoof of the James Bond films and similar spy movies, Austin Powers is a top agent of the British Secret Service in the late 1960s, and also a world renowned fashion photographer, swinger and sex icon. When his nemesis Dr. Evil freezes himself and is shot into space, Austin also freezes himself to fight him again should he return. Both of them are thawed out in 1997, picking up where they left off, but both considerably out of place coping with the strange new world of the late nineties, with many hilarious consequences. Free love and carefree experimenting with mind expanding drugs are out of the question for Austin despite working with gorgeous female agent Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), while Dr. Evil has a hard time wrapping his mind around the fact that one million dollars just isn't enough money to ask for ransom any more, plus he also has to deal with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who was artificially created in his absence. Overall, Austin is funny, but it's Dr. Evil who gets all the really good jokes: since Mike Myers performs both characters, he gets out on top of both. The movie failed at the box office though, but turned out a surprise hit in video stores to such an extent, it nevertheless spawned two sequels, both of them good for a decent laugh but not nearly as much as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1960's British hipster secret agent Austin Powers is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his arch-enemy Dr. Evil into the 1990s. Austin is then released, and thawed back into action to once again battle Dr. Evil where he wakes up somewhere in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon to hold the world to ransom. After Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil he gets a new sidekick Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter.They go to Vegas to stop Dr. Evil's plot to control the world for 100 billion dollars.....It's clear that Myers has a love for England and the sixties, as this has so much intense referencing and in jokes, it commands you to watch it several times just to get all the jokes, and this is why it works so well.The plot is second fiddle to characters, its a perfunctory maguffin that showed up in most spy films of the sixties, Myers concentrates on the characters most of all, and they are fantastic.The titular character is a little tired thought to watch now, but its nothing to do with the film, its just pop culture has wrung the comedy out of Powers so much, you do cringe whenever he says one of his catchphrases.Dr Evil though is still timeless, because he is just so straight faced and the clumsiest character you'd ever likely to meet.It's pretty left field stuff, from surprising cameos, to in my opinion the funniest thing of the film, showing the personal life of a henchmen, brilliant and totally unexpected.Watch this and then watch Danger! Diabolik, the film it homages the most.Good stuff, but referenced within an inch of its life, which tarnishes it a little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 90s, Mike Myers was at the top of his game. He had a successful run on SNL and brought one of his most popular personas to the big screen in the ever-awesome WAYNE'S WORLD movies. In 1997, created an original character that was so popular it spawned it's own franchise: Austin Powers. The film is a spoof of the 60's spy genre and draws most of it's jokes by ripping on the James Bond series and it's quirks. Austin is a swinging bachelor in 1967, famed fashion photographer by day and daring secret agent by night. His arch-nemesis is Dr. Evil, a madman and total square who's bent on world domination. With Austin Powers constantly foiling his evil plans, Dr. Evil cryogenically freezes himself and launches into space to return in a future where Austin is no longer around to stop him. In 1997, Dr. Evil returns with plans to hold the world hostage with a subterranean nuclear missile. Austin, having anticipated Evil's return, had himself frozen and is thawed in '97 to battle his rival with the help of the beautiful Agent Kensington. That is, if he can adjust to life in a new era...This movie is hilarious and, if you're a fan of the 007 films, there's plenty of homages to keep you chuckling. A hidden underground layer, slow-moving easily-escapable traps, elaborate plans of world destruction, and a Swedish-made enlarger pump. Wait, how'd that get in there? It's got all the best elements of a spy film exaggerated to epic proportions with a colorful cast of characters. Evil has the expected menagerie of evil associates: head of his legitimate business front Number Two, founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army Frau Farbissina, Korean ex-wrestler Random Task, and the voluptuous seductress Alotta Fagina. The first film is a goofy 90 minutes of quasi-vulgarity and slapstick, but it's got some decent heart in there as Austin is hit with the realization that his swinging, free-loving, chauvinist style doesn't fly as well in the 90's. Thirty years have passed and Dr. Evil's lameness is practically the norm. Austin confronts the concept of personal responsibility and finds love in Vanessa Kensington, the beautiful daughter of his partner from the 60s.I used to love Mike Myers. He was great on SNL and I loved both the WAYNE'S WORLD and AUSTIN POWERS series. He hasn't quite seen the same success in the new millennium (with the exception of the SHREK franchise) but this movie came at his strong point and his mojo-oozing secret agent is just getting started here. Myers pulls a double role, also performing as Dr. Evil and doing a spot on impression of Ernst Stavro Blofeld from the 007 movies. Elizabeth Hurley is gorgeous as Vanessa and a perfect foil for Austin's libidinous obsessions. Rounding out the cast are Robert Wagner, Seth Green, Michael York, and Will Ferrell in a bit part. There's a lot to enjoy here and I've seen the movie countless times over the years; it never gets old. The spastic humor and campy style pay homage to the most obvious well-known elements of the classic spy movies and leave the viewer (in my case, anyway) waiting for Austin "Danger" Powers' next adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swinging. Like a man, man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He's the sexiest, swingingest secret agent ever to combat evil - DOCTOR Evil, that is.... mwohahaha ha ha ha....He's Austin Powers, arguably Mike Myers's greatest, most memorable, most embraced, most quoted icon - in the film that made it all shagadelic, baby. AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY is a hip skewering of the spy movie genre, taking especial aim at James Bond. The more you know James, the more you'll love Austin.Myers is Austin Powers: superspy, posh Brit accent, smashing fashion sense, a Byrds wig, unruly teeth, and a gigantic male... symbol draped around his neck. We meet him dancing in the streets of 1960s swinging London, and I think he's doing The Froog.Austin Powers's nemesis is Doctor Evil (also played by Myers), a marriage of Donald Pleasance's Blofeld (from YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) and apparently, as Myers confesses, Lorne Michaels (his producer on Saturday NIGHT LIVE). Myers whipcracks it out of the park with Dr. Evil, for as everyone knows, a hero is nothing without the villain who loves to hate him. And Myers immortalizes his hero and villain by imbuing them both with equal amounts of thunderball mojo.In the opening 1960s sequence, Dr. Evil escapes Powers by cryogenically freezing himself in an orbital rocket. So Powers volunteers to freeze himself as well, to combat Dr. Evil should he ever return to Earth. In the 1990s, Dr. Evil returns, sets up his underground lair in Nevada and tries to blackmail the world governments for "one MILLion DOLLars!" at which point his Number Two (Robert Wagner, brilliantly playing it straight) advises him that one million dollars isn't much these days. When he changes his ransom to "one HUNdred BILLion DOLLars," we start to twig to this movie's hook. It is part spy spoof, part fish-out-of-water, all Swedish-made penis enlarger.Meanwhile, Powers (unfrozen after 30 years, as the only man able to combat Dr. Evil) is having his own revelations - that the 90s are not as promiscuous as the 60s he left behind, and the slinky flirtations he engaged in with his previous spy partner, Mrs. Kensington (tightly leathered Mimi Rogers) are wasted on his current salubrious spy hard, Mrs. Kensington's daughter, Vanessa (achingly beautiful Elizabeth Hurley), a 90s woman, i.e. repressed and uptight about her sexuality. Which might explain Hugh's wayward thrust with that skank. (As Bill Maher has noted, "The most beautiful woman in the world ? somebody's sick of f-king her!") The innocence of both hero and villain in a world that has left them behind is this movie's greatest hook. Snappily written by Myers and directed by Jay Roach like a man, man.Mindy Sterling is Dr. Evil's loudmouth secretary, Will Ferrell is a skin-darkened evil henchman, Michael York gamely plays Austin's boss, Basil Exposition, Fabiana Udenio is evil siren, Alotta Fagina (Pussy Galore, anyone?), and Seth Green perfectly captures X-Gen angst as Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's estranged son, whose pragmatic solutions to Dr. Evil's "Bond Villain" snares are a constant source of vexation for Dr. Evil.Does that make you HORNY, baby, yeah?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers offers a comic turn on the over-hyped coolness of the 1960's against the equally clichéd spy-versus-master-criminal theme of 007 - also very much a product of the same decade.It's full of bright psychedelic colours and groovy fashions of the genre. For those who are too young to know; people did actually dress like him for a while. The sexual and sexist jokes are all par for the course and though politically-incorrect are still a great deal of fun.Myers plays both the hero and the villain - Dr Evil, and does each with a spoofy panache. All of the other characters do their adequate bit, including the seemingly ageless Robert Wagner.It's just a fun movie, but I have to say that I think it could have been a whole lot wittier with two such subjects to lampoon. Time and again I was expecting a far more comical result than the one I actually got.It maybe the 1960's just can't be spoofed. Like the saying goes; 'if you weren't there, you're square' and Mr Myers clearly wasn't. I think the decade was so iconic that it was its own self-parody. Check out 'Bedazzled' with Cooke and Moore and 'The Italian Job' with Micheal Caine. Both knock this into a cocked-hat.Still; it's worth a watch - I especially enjoyed the 'spontaneous' Dancing-In-The-Street sequence at the beginning, a hint at Martha Reese and The Mammas &amp; The Pappas, both of whom made the song a 60's hit.</fullReview>

His catchphrases such as " yeah baby " and " Do behave" are still being said after so many years. This film is filled with smart one liners. Mike Myers once quoted that he likes stupid jokes done smartly. This film is filed with these.Austin Powers is the complete opposite of James Bond. He repulsive to look at, doesn't have a hunky body, he way to horny and has terrible teeth. But he still contains that one special element that all special agents have and that's charm. Mike Myers is perfect as Austin Powers and let not forget Dr Evil. These characters are just brilliant.It very rare that a film can keep you laughing from start to end these days , it very rare that you see a good spoof today but luckily , this film is up there with great spoofs. All i can say is that i recommend you t go out and buy it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Is An Extremely Funny Movie Why Didn't Mike Myers Do Something Like This In 2008 Instead Of That Awful Love Guru Movie. The Plot Is That Austin Powers is a 60's spy who is cryonically frozen and released in the 1990's. The world is a very different place for Powers. Unfortunately for Austin, everyone is no longer sex-mad. Although he may be in a different decade, his mission is still the same. He has teamed up with Vanessa Kensington to stop the evil Dr. Evil, who was also frozen in the past. Dr. Evil stole a nuclear weapon and is demanding a payment of (when he realizes its the 90's) 100 billion dollars. Can Austin Powers stop this madman? or will he caught up with Evil's henchman, with names like Alotta Fagina and Random Task? Only time will tell. This Made Me Laugh Like I Never Have &amp; Now I Can Look At Bond Films &amp; Laugh. Note To Jay Roach: Thank You Jay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A James Bond spoof with its own groovy personality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are parody movies and then there are movies that stand out individually while parodying other movies, and that's where "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" comes in. Driven by the incredibly talented character actor Mike Myers, Austin Powers is meant to be a vulgarization of everything that is James Bond, but at the same time, Powers and the surrounding cast are so unique that "Austin Powers" is really a franchise all in its own, with or without the Bond references.Austin Powers (Myers) is a 1960s British spy in the model of James Bond only he's less talented with his fists, hornier and uglier than Bond. His nemesis is Dr. Evil, also played by Myers, a bastardization of Blofeld of the early Bond films. Evil's plan is to cryogenically freeze himself and then come back in the future to try and hold the world ransom. Powers does the same and both are reawakened in the year 1997. This time travel element is probably to not alienate younger viewers who have no sense of the 1960s.Myers really showcases his talent for the first time in this film. Both Powers and Dr. Evil are unique, funny and likable. The strength of Dr. Evil in particularly is his sensitive side that we don't see in many villains in comedic films. Powers is such a strong protagonist because he brings some catchy 60s British jargon that is largely unexposed at this point to American audiences and other countries. The raunchy humor is also quite genius at times, which is about as high of a compliment as you can give raunchy humor.The movies is best described as silly, but clever silly, and there's certainly a lovable aspect to it. It's certainly not supposed to be plot driven and you really can't fault it for flaws in that area. It's just very rich with jokes (it would take multiple viewings to catch them all, especially the Bond references) and primarily structured on little sketches. I wouldn't call them gags because they are more cleverly integrated into the plot. Overall, "Austin Powers" is a shagadelic good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997, Dir. Jay Roach)Story Mike Myers plays Austin Powers. A sex-mad spy who worked in the 60's along with Mrs. Kensington. He freezes himself and later released in the late 90's. Times are very different for Austin, who still believes that the sex lifestyles of the 1960's are still alive and well. He is assigned along with Mrs. Kensington's daughter, Vanessa, and must work together to stop Dr. Evil, who is also played by Mike Myers. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is a spy spoof which delivers many jokes and laughs and includes cameos from many including Carrie Fisher and Will Ferrell.Actors Let's start with the lead actor, Mike Myers. He being a Canadian born actor plays an English spy, and it's as convincing as it can be. His classic English accent is spot on and makes it seems as he has always been an English citizen. His costumes are amazing, and really stand out, especially in the scene where he is playing in a casino. Myers also plays the villain, Dr. Evil. You really have to study him, to see Myers behind the makeup. Although they are both played by the same actor, Austin Powers and Dr. Evil are two very different characters. All the other character are amazingly real, and although they mirror certain spy characters from other films, there are no direct copy of the character, such as Random Task. He is an obvious spoof of Odd Job from Goldfinger, but has a different personality than him. Elizabeth Hurley plays a wonderful 'Powers Girl' and the cameos are welcoming as they are not just cameos, but also fit in as part of the story. Will Ferrell is wonderful as Mustafa.Music The music in this film is very different to what you will find in modern films today. Like the films which are a parody of the old classic films, the soundtrack is identical to the type of music you find in a 60's film. George S. Clinton teams up with Burt Bacharach to bring a soundtrack very similar to the original Casino Royale spoof. Its theme is catchy and has become recognisable all over.Special Effects This is a film which is not particularly known for its special effects. There are some CGI (computer generate imagery) used, but this is very little. If you've seen many of the earlier James Bond films, you will understand how the special effects are used in this. There are many explosions during the confrontation, with stunt men bouncing over the rails. This is not bad though, and adds the feel of the film. The background used when Austin Powers is in the car are even similar to the early film. Watch an old film and you will notice how obvious the background image looks during shots inside are car. This is used here and can be hilarious to those who are aware of it.Conclusion Overall, 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery' is a hilarious film and different to a lot of movie spoofs we are encountering these days. It might not be for everyone, and you would find it a lot funnier if you have great knowledge of the spy genre, so you should brush up on your films if you're planning to watch this. As Austin would say, this film is simply shagtastic."Ooo, Behave!" ? Austin Powers (Mike Myers)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mike Myers at his best!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is probably the best film that Mike Myers has ever starred in over the course of his career. Definitely a must see if you like comedy. He stars as a British spy who must stop Dr.Evil(also played by Myers) from ultimately drilling a hole into the Earth's core, causing the Earth to flood with molten hot "Magma." The chemistry overall is excellent, the laughs are constant. The hilarious appearance of Will Ferrel as Moustafa was probably my favourite part. If you like this film I would like to also recommend Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Austin Powers in Goldmember, and if you like those, try watching the Shrek series. 8/10 overall</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough Hits To Be Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A generally hit-and-miss effort with enough hits to be fun. Mike Myers stars as the title character, a groovy 1960s spy who, after decades of being cryogenically frozen, is unthawed in modern times to thwart his old nemesis, Dr. Evil (also played by Myers). Along the way, the film takes plenty of pokes at pop culture, both past and present, and features no shortage of sex jokes.But the best moments come when the film takes aim at spy movies, particularly the earlier entries in the James Bond series. One henchman, for instance, throws his shoe at people when a pistol would obviously be more practical. There's also a memorable moment when our hero is finally captured. Rather than simply shooting him, Dr. Evil places him in an elaborate device that slowly lowers him into a pool of hungry alligators. Of course Dr. Evil (the best character in the movie) has better things to do than ensure the plot goes according to plan, and Austin escapes certain death. Scenes like that help make the movie fun even when it isn't particularly funny."Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" was not a huge box office success, but it built up a solid reputation on video. That spurred two (to date) highly-successful sequels, which squeezed whatever was left of the concept - and then some. If you still haven't seen the original, it's worth a look. Despite its silliness, there is a decent comedy here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, is a great comedic film by laugh-out funny comedian Mike Myers. Although the script is slightly anemic and some of the jokes not very funny, because Mike Myers is portraying not one but two characters (the title character Austin Powers and his nemesis Dr. Evil), it makes up for any weaknesses. In fact Mike Myers is so spot-on and properly cast, there's no way you couldn't like his performances in this film. Although this Austin Powers isn't the best of the trilogy (part 2 is the best in my opinion), this is a great introduction to this classic character. A must see at 7 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers stars as Austin Powers &amp; Dr. Evil for the first time in what would because I series of three films (thus far) that would get progressively more and more mentally retarded as time went on. If you've seen either of the other two films, first my condolences, but you won't miss anything by not seeing this one as the jokes are reused in all 3 films. If you only saw this first, that's a good thing for you as it saves you wasted time being as you won't have to sit through the other two travesties. I haven't gone into the plot thus far because EVERYone knows the silly plot by now. This is the most amusing of the three BY FAR and didn't cause all those inane sayings that every mongoloid spouted out at the drop of a hat that it's first sequel did.My Grade: C+ DVD Extras: Commentary by Mike Myers and director Jay Roach; 2 alternate endings; Deleted scenes; Jump to a cameo scene; Spy genre retrospective; original animated sequence; Cast biographies; Star highlights clips from "Dangerous Ground", "Wide Sargrasso Sea", "Rapture", &amp; "Monkey Trouble"; Theatrical trailer; and teaser trailer for "Lost in Space"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers is Austin Powers a British secret agent who was quick frozen at the end of the 1960's. He's thawed out 30 years later but acts, dresses and talks like it still was the 60s. Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers) plans to blackmail the world leaders for "1 million dollars" and Powers and his sidekick Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) team up to stop him. Austin Powers is an extremely clever parody of everything that had to do with the swinging 60s in England: the fashion, culture, movies, music, language and politics. It's a puerile encyclopedia of sight gags, movie references, in-jokes, puns and sexual double entendres. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery makes the Marx Brothers look like Shakespeare. But it is very funny. Kudos to Mike Myers for creating two of the most outrageous characters on film.</fullReview>

The story itself is quite simple, but this kind of movie isn't about story, it is about laughing. Mike Meyers is one of the funniest people in show business and he showed it with this movie. he takes his unique style of humour and plays it to the fullest by being more than one character. He is extremely convincing playing both Dr. Evil and Austin Powers and makes this movie a true treat to watch. I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh Look At British Intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of us who are too young to have experienced most of the James Bond movies, we've had to look to other British spies to grow up with. The British spy of our generation is the brain child of Saturday Night Live alum Mike Myers in the form of Austin Powers, who makes his debut in this film, Internation Man of Mystery. While recycling jokes and characters from the James Bond movie, there is a certain freshness to the spy, as he is a 60s swinger trying to make it in the politically correct days of the late 90s. Powers is brought out of cryogenic freezing in 1997 to take on his arch-enemy, Dr. Evil (also played by Myers), who himself is returning to Earth after 30 years and has trouble adapting to the new world. The best jokes come from Powers and Dr. Evil trying to catch up on the time they've missed, trying to use today's technology, and adjust for inflation of the dollar. One million dollars does not go as far as it used to, much to Dr. Evil's surprise. The Bond references are funny too, but the part I like best about this movie is how characters had to adapt to 30 years of civilization change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is utterly hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers is crammed full of some of the wittiest and most sophisticated humour ever seen on the silver screen. That blue suit Powers wears cracks me up, and every time he says 'Shagadelic baby' and 'Yeah baby' I think I am going to die laughing. Throw in the subtle sexual innuendo (you have to be a member of MENSA to spot it) and you have one of the greatest comedies ever written. Oh, and I've forgotten the evil bald bloke. You'll never guess what he does. He keeps putting his little finger to the corner of his mouth. You simply can't get much funnier than that. I'm creasing up thinking about it.I remember I literally had to be helped out of the cinema as all my strength had been sapped from laughing too much. I only wish Austin Powers had said 'Baby!' a few more times (I doubt he said it much more than 2 million times in the whole film). Mind you, that would have made me laugh so much I'd have had a heart attack.I love this film, but I can only give it nine out of ten as perhaps the humour is too subtle for many people. I am an adult whose IQ exceeds 15, so I just about get the jokes. Those who are not as mentally blessed as I am may struggle somewhat.The only disappointment to me is that I doubt there will be a sequel, because Hollywood never cashes in on a winning formula by re-hashing the same jokes to make even more money. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice entry in the spy spoof genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austn Powers is a nice send up of the spy genre, as well as an homage to the spy spoof. It blends the swinging cool of Derek Flint, John Steed, and Matt Helm, with the unglamorous look of Harry Palmer. It hits all the right notes, such as the fun attitude and the hokey nature of 60's spy films. It also serves as a great "fish-out-of-water" comedy. Too bad it degenerates into bad parody with each subsequent entry in the series.Mike Meyers has an obvious love of the period ad the genre. He is side-splittingly funny as both the unconventional hero, and the deranged villain. In fact, Dr Evil is so good, he dominates the other films. As Dr Evil, Meyers is one part Donald Pleasance's Bloefeld, and an equal part Lorne Michaels.Elizabeth Hurley makes for a good partner, making up for Mimi Rogers' rather mediocre Emma Peel. Hurley has a nice comedic charm, even if she does lack that Diana Rigg sparkle. She makes a nice counterpoint to Austin.The supporting characters are fun, with Seth Green stealing scenes as Scott Evil, and Robert Wagner having fun as Number 2. Mindi Sterling is a riot as Frau Farbissina and Michael York gets to ham it up as Basil Exposition. Throw in Will Ferrell as the inept, but hard-to-kill Mustafa for a nice icing on the comedic cake.The bright colors and way out designs give the film a nice underpinning, while the music evokes memories of 60's cool, with a 90's touch.Skip the third film completely, and watch the second for Dr Evil and Mini-me; but, don't miss this one. You'll have a ball. Just don't go around repeating the catch-phrases. Those get old real fast!</fullReview>

Some parts were really hilarious, but this spy spoof wasn't as witty or tongue-in-cheek as the next two in the series. The story is about Austin Powers, a dentally challenged spy from the 60s, who gets all the girls and always defeats his evil enemy, Dr. Evil. Soon, Dr. Evil and Austin freeze themselves, and wake up in the 90s. Soon, Austin learns that the 90s isn't all about style, sex, and partying. And Dr. Evil realizes that one million dollars isn't a lot of money. Soon, Dr. Evil threatens the crown of England, and Austin must stop him, and at the same time, get used to the 90s.

Austin then volunteers to be frozen in case Dr. Evil shows up again. 30 years later, Dr. Evil wakes up in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon and holds the world hostage for 1 Billion Dollars. Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil but gets Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), his ex-partner's daughter and goes to Las Vegas to look for Evil, but finds out there is no longer any free love in the 90's, or Swinging. Plus after Dr. Evil was being recapped about what had happened while he was frozen he discovers he has a son named Scott (Seth Green) and the one part that was funny was when Dr. Evil and Scott go to this social group and Scott says that when he grows up he doesn't want to be evil but Dr. Evil wants him to! Another funny part was when Austin Powers was beating Basil's mother and he is thinking it is a man in disguise! Another funny part was when Scott was telling what he thinks would be a better idea to do with Austin Powers and Vanessa and Dr. Evil keeps telling him to zip it! I wonder how Mike Myers was able to do Dr. Evil and Austin Powers at the same time when Austin Powers and Dr. Evil are in the scene? I don't have a clue on that part. One of my favorite comedy trilogies of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lewd, crude, lascivious, solacious, outrageous spoof of the James Bond franchise and the new trademark character for Mike Myers to escape his Wayne's World persona that tracks the title character being displaced in time to battle his old enemy, Dr. Evil.A tanker at the box office but a smash on video, the film spawned two sequels that were box office hits. Whether or not there'll be more remains to be seen.Myers is fun in his dual roles and Elizabeth Hurley is beautiful to look at, but the film does drag on after a while.Still, worth a look for crude gags, the shadow strip scene and seeing then 32 year old Elizabeth Hurley without any clothes on her 5'9" body during the last few minutes of the film as she covers her exposed self with fruit, racks, presents, flowers, and tea cups. Too bad she had to put the yellow robe on just before the credits roll, but hey, that's what video tapes are for, rewinding.</fullReview>

In this first entry, when everything was fresh, the toilet humor jokes are actually marginally amusing. The best aspect of this movie however was the comic and serious nature of the relationship between Austin and Vanessa. This chemistry was never recaptured in the sequels and they suffer for lack of it and the fact that the jokes were recycled. But the first installment rates a solid 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was about time a parody of the legendary Bond series and spy movies in general came out, and it came in the form of the Austin Powers trilogy. Of course, the first one is the best by far simply because it combines excellent parodys yet at the same time manages to inject some great humor of it's own. Mike Myers plays Austin Powers well, adding in the right amount of emotion and sillyness. As Austin's new partner, Elizabeth Hurley shines in her role by providing a performance that has the character be repelled by Austin instead of liking him. Mike Myers also plays Doctor Evil quite well, displaying a genuine sense of the somewhat absurdity of the bad guys in spy flicks. Also in support is Michael York as Basil Expedition, Austin's head of command. As the movies goes on it just gets funnier and funnier with amazing one- liners and hilarious moments. Unfortunately, sometimes the jokes get a bit old and the sexual overtones get too controlling of the movie. It seem as if after a while they kind of lost focus of the humor and just went into more and more jokes. Definitely the best Austin Powers movies yet, which only Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me can come close to. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can see in a few scenes that Liz Hurley is trying her best not to laugh and you can't blame her. This is one of the best comedies ever made. Mike Myers is an incredible guy playing both Austin Powers and Dr Evil. The main target is the Bond films but it also has a dig at those cheesy 1960s thriller series. Austin Powers' dress sense isn't too far removed from that of Jason King. I wonder if this film, together with that episode of Friends, created a demand for sphinx cats. Michael York will now be forever thought of as Basil Exposition just as Leslie Nielsen will never live down Frank Drebin. And these names! Where do they get them from! Alotta Fagina! Dr Evil is a relatively unimaginative name compared to some of the others but it still manages to be funny. The way Mike Myers hams up that role is great. I've seen The Spy Who Shagged Me but I've yet to see Goldmember. I'm looking forward to it. Mike Myers is the Peter Sellers of the 1990s and 21st century.</fullReview>

The flick sparkles (if that's the right word) with lame-o jokes and semi-sophisticated satire.Mike Myers wrote the script and stars as both Austin, the man of mystery (right, like the toe jam smell at the bottom of your closet is a mystery), and the cartoon villain Dr. Evil, who might be Dr. No cleaning his teeth with his pinkie. Speaking of teeth, he has the better teeth of our disjointed duo, speaking of which, notice that Hurley (would that Emma Peel had anything like her figure, but she too was English) doesn't actually soul kiss Austin. I mean, there are not only LIMITS, but contract clauses. I think Hurley was afraid that if she actually swapped tongues with him she would catch some horrid fungus amongus and THAT wouldn't be good for her career. However, check this out: for her next Austin Powers opus, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" she got $3-million up front.Look at it this way: if she could make flirty-flirty eyes with Rancid Teeth Man, she could conceivably, in your wildest dreams find YOU attractive, at least as the last man on earth. You and Elizabeth Hurley as the last two humans on earth! Eat your heart out, Sean Connery. Heck, all he had in Dr. No (1962) was Ursula Andress. (Come to recall: yummie, yum, yum.) And you too, Roger Moore. "Bond, James Bond," yourself.Myers makes himself as disgustingly nerdish as possible, but still the chicks swoon. There's some right-on satire here about the mystery of feminine desire. What DOES a woman want? The nerds never know but James Bond, Harrison Ford and (gulp) Mike Myers don't have to ask.All right, there is a plot to this Batman-like take off on the sixties become the nineties 007 spy diversion. But it's so familiar that I won't bother with it here. Some of the characters are interesting. There's Alotta Fagina played by Fabiana Udenio recalling Octopu**y and Pu**y Galore. (Well, she's not interesting, but her name is.) And think about this: Robert Wagner with the eye patch who was once a sophisticated ladies man--for example, The Pink Panther (1964)--is now a bloated old man having to wear extra large suit coats to hide his pot belly and sagging flesh. Now THAT evens the score for the old nerds who never got the girl, who, by the way, will like this as much as pimple-popping sixteen year olds.Myers knows what he's doing. There's a deep psychological seduction underneath the sixties garb and the nineties toilet humor that makes this strangely satisfying. For my part however I could only bear to watch it all the way to the very, very end in the hope that (PG-13 rating aside) that Hurley would disrobe a little and I could get a glimpse of that exquisite bod. But they teased me, especially in the matrimonial bed scene with the pineapples and the melons and the spice rack--whatta rack! Ha, ha, ha, ha.Remember as you watch this: it is not as bad as it looks. In fact, once you understand what Mike Myers is doing to your psyche, you might want to see it again.</fullReview>

It's hilarious script and clever puns make this comedy different from alot of recent ones. The two sequels never quite compared to the original as most of the jokes were borrowed. Mike Myers is excellent and Liz Hurley is quite good as well. It's fun for all of the family, though some film critics think it's a load of nonsense. Even if it is, it's entertaining nonsense, which is what it's all about. I reccomend this to anybody who is looking for light entertainment and a good old laugh.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will say right off that I am not a big James Bond fan, however, I have seen enough of those movies to be able to understand the brilliance behind Austin Powers. This movie is the perfect combination of sensible parody. Bond fans are sure to go crazy over this movie. As a matter of fact, Austin Powers may do for comedy/parody, what bond did for action/adventure. Hopefully, Austin Powers will follow the same trend as the Bond films have and make 50 or so of them. The characters are likeable and believable, all are fun to watch. Each joke is cleverly displayed, so as to not completely turn the audience off.However, I must note that although this film received a PG-13 rating, it does mess around with that fine line that separates PG-13 from R. So parents, this is probably not the wisest choice for family night.Disregarding that, this movie is fun and colorful and thus rates a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groovy spy Austin Powers is artificially frozen during the late 1960s. His arch nemesis Dr. Evil is also frozen and thawed out decades later during the 1990s, where he carries on with his plans for world domination. To thwart him, the government thaws out Powers hoping his skills will aid in the case but despite the changing times, Austin remains caught up in a time warp. Headlined by Myers this amusing comedy has a good cast, funny lines, and some sight gags that are completely over-the-top, but some of the gags just fall flat and keep this one from scoring a direct hit. Not your ideal comedy, but fans of star Myers will probably have a great time. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And this is the one that started it all, with each sequel making more than could possibly be imagined! AUSTIN POWERS is the under-achieving success. Cheaply made, cheesy in every pore and ridiculous in every sense of the word. But Austin has charm, and Dr. Evil was completely fresh at this time and had some serious jokes behind him.It's 1967. Dr. Evil constantly gets his plans thwarted, so he cryogenically freezes himself to wreak havoc 30 years later. Fortunate for us, Austin froze himself too, to be unfrozen for Evil's return.Novelty segments galore, but the spoofs of 60s films are the best. Scott Evil was clever as the lazy Gen-Xer. Everything was more or less boring except for Liz Hurley who is always the pleasure to watch once and a while. Let's hear it for mutated sea bass! Dull and lacking in many points, but still a pleasant renter.</fullReview>

The movie is hilarious. It's got some really hysterical parts.

		<shortDescription>Good First Movie in Austin Powers Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a starting movie in the Austin Powers Trilogy, I would have to say that this was pretty funny. It had a good cast. The actors and actresses seemed a little bit up-tight about their roles, but eventually they get more comfortable in the sequels "The Spy Who Shagged Me" &amp; "Goldmember."The plot is basically that back in 1967, Dr. Evil, who threatened the world, froze himself and the only person that was able to defeat him, Austin Powers, froze himself as well. Dr. Evil defrosted himself in 1997 and Austin was then defrosted too. Dr. Evil's latest plan is to steal a nuclear warhead and hold the world hostage for one million dollars...which was later changed to one hundred billion dollars. Austin, with the help of his new partner Vanessa, adapts to the '90s and together they eventually defeat Dr. Evil.There were many great laughs. The characters were creative like Alotta Fagina. I was cracking up the whole time that she was on screen or if Austin and Vanessa referred to her in some way. "She's the village bicycle. Everyone's had a ride."Great perfomances by Robert Wagner as Number Two, Mindy Sterling as Frau, and Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington really made the movie. Mike Myers plays Austin Powers and Dr. Evil really well. This movie was very well done. I would recommend anyone that is a spy movie fan or just someone looking for a good laugh to rent this movie. I highly recommend seeing the sequels if you like this and even if you don't like this, I would still recommend renting the sequels because the sequels seem to get better as the series goes on.I gave this movie a rating of 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Although the film is to make Austin the star of the show it's actually Dr. Evil that is funnier with his brilliant phrases such as when he explains who his parents are. The fun doesn't even stop there. Of course there are some faults and the film does wear some of the jokes thin but it doesn't stop Austin and the other weird and wonderful characters from making the whole thing a funny romp. ****</fullReview>

Mike Myers is responsible for 2 of the most funny characters ever on screen: Austin and Dr. Evil, the latter having a slight edge. It is tight, clever comedy and not at all stupid, unlike a lot of the other grossed out comedies that it may be grouped with. "Honestly, who fights with a shoe?"The best comedic film i've ever seen is The Princess Bride, then the Toy Story series. Austin takes third place, which is a huge compliment.

There are also some corny jokes that come across as funny, and a few lines that are so catchy they're addictive("Allow myself to introduce...myself.")

		<fullReview>This movie totally caught me off guard when I first saw it. I didn't expect it to have the wit or originality that it truly possesses. For some reason, the previews to this movie completely turned me off, and I dismissed it as mindless humor....but then I actually saw the movie. If you walk away from seeing "Austin Powers : International Man Of Mystery" thinking it had "childish humor", then you didn't catch the truly funny aspects of the film. Sometimes the best parts are the small discreet things that a character does/says.That's because "Austin Powers" essentially is a joke in itself. It is a joke inside of a joke. When I look at the grand perspective of it these days, I think it came just one step away from actually inventing a new "genre" of film. There are some other movies that, when you really think about it, kinda make a nod towards "Austin Powers" with their tongue-in-cheek humor.To start to name funny moments in this film would be an insult to the movie, since it is just filled with them throughout. Mike Myers did a fantastic job inventing this whole world that Austin Powers and Dr. Evil exist. The plot itself is beautifully outrageous.A truly breakthrough comedy in its own right - don't judge it on the very disappointing sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Does It Make You Horny?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to be honest. When I first saw the previews of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery (1997), the preview gave me the impression that this film was low-budget and made in England. I had no interest in seeing this film. It wasn't until the sequel Austin Powers: The Man Who Shagged Me(1999) was released and Verne Troyer was on a talk show talking about the film and they had more teasing film clips of Austin Powers: The Man Who Shagged Me, that I decided I must see the first film first. So at the library I rented for free Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery and here are my thoughts. First of all, Mike Myers as Austin Powers with bad yellow stained, crooked, buck teeth was not appealing to me at all. However since I am writing this review on February 2002, I can say I have fallen in love (sort of speak) with the character Mike Myers has created. Austin Powers is clearly a movie for ADULTS ONLY. The sexual situation and sexual innuendoes are really funny. One of the funniest bits was when Austin Powers was walking around full frontal nude (implied) and strategically placed objects obstructed the voyeuristic view for the audience. The FemBots walking to the Nancy Sinatra tune "These Boots Were Made For Walkin'" was a hoot and the FemBot with the guns extending out of the bra cups was funny too. In case you haven't figured it out by now, this film is a spoof of those "In Like Flint" films, 007 James Bond films, and a Vincent Price film that comes to mind. Nothing wrong with that. All movies come from an idea and ideas come from anywhere. The ensembled cast is the funniest I have seen in years. Elizabeth Hurley as Miss Kensington, the no-sex-on-the-job sidekick is wonderful in her role. Very professional and good acting. Robert Wagner is likeable in every role we see him in, even if he plays a bad guy. In this role he brings his charm, debonair and wit. Mindy Sterling as "Frau Farbissina" is very fun to watch. Her delivery and comedic talent is brilliant. I wish their were more scenes of her. I throughly enjoy the 1960's flavor of the film. The music, the flowers (flower power), the fashion, the psychedelic colors, those little "Laugh-In"-like spots, Burt Bacharach "The Look Of Love", the models and mostly the spy spoof of it all. And I especially like the jokes that are personal to men only. Those kind of jokes and gags that only men would understand. The song "BBC" that Mike Myers wrote and performed in the end credits is a real catchy tune. I like it. Mike Myers has written a genius story and I am glad it was made into a motion picture. If you are feeling depressed, this film might be therapeutic to you. I enjoyed it and had many laughs.</fullReview>

If you are a fan of James Bond campiness then you will probably appreciate this film.As with most watchable films, it's the casting that makes it - Mike Myers is a GENIUS-even at his worst he's still at least good (and he's at his best in this film), the rest of the cast do their job perfectly. Tom Arnold is just great and though I might be biased as a Buffy fan, they could not have cast a better Scott Evil :-)So to the people who have flamed this film - yeah it's not going to be regarded as the new Citizen Kane, but it's still a damn funny film and if you don't "get it" then I suggest you obtain a sense of humour before you watch any more films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers shines as the secret agent desperately needing dental work in this lighthearted spoof of things shagadelic. Austin was a swinging international spy for British intelligence (?) in the 1960s. He was cryogenically frozen along with his archenemy, Dr. Evil (also Myers). After 30 years, Powers is thawed, and he's in for a few '90s surprises. Stewardesses are now flight attendants. Carnaby Street is no longer the center of the world. Dancing has gone way beyond the Frug, the Jerk and the Monkey. Crushed velvet is a fashion "don't," and free love costs a lot.A somewhat shell-shocked Austin quickly teams up with Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley), the daughter of his former Mrs. Peel-like sidekick, Mrs. Kensington. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil is having problems at home. He has a test-tube slacker son, Scott Evil, who can't relate to Daddy's desire for world domination. Myers is a total delight no matter which part he's tour-de-forcing. Hurley appears game, but doesn't seem to possess a natural flair for comedy. Robert Wagner, Carrie Fisher, Mimi Rogers and Burt Bacharach make cameos. Sure, it sometimes stoops to third-grade witticisms, but much of Austin Powers is movie-wise funny. What was once Wayne's world is now Powers' planet.</fullReview>

There's a lot of toilet and genital based humour, and a little bit of it made me kind of cringe. On the whole however, I found 90% of this movie completely hilarious. Mike Myers is perfect in both the roles of Austin Powers and his foe, Doctor Evil. In my personal opinion, the film (and especially the sequel) could have been called "Dr. Evil".If you appreciate parody, and parody of spy films like Bond movies, simple humour orientating around sex mostly, and Mike Myers' incredible freedom of expression with his ENTIRE body (which is even more exposed in the sequel), than check out this film. From the beginning, right to the end credits with the little vignette and the Austin rock video, it's a hilarious laugh riot.But as I said, don't expect any Earth shattering statements on the meaning of life.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD... Mike Myers reminds me of the annoying geek kids at school. There was one in every class, cracking his silly, pointless, smutty jokes, then gazing around the room with a smug grin on his face, searching for a reaction that isn't there. This film is the cinematic equivalent of sitting next to that kid for a whole 89 minutes.The jokes, if you can call them that, are so predictable (mostly because they've all been done a million times before, and better) that they provoke huge groans rather than laughs from the audience. For sheer cringe-making awfulness, check out the "Danger is my middle name" bit (after which Myers gurns and twitches like a demented hillbilly as he hopefully leaves a pause for the viewer's reaction - ha, some hope), the part where Myers attempts to play a CD on an ordinary record player (which makes me think the script wasactually written in crayon by eight-year-olds, and Myers just put his name at the top) and the part where Myers kills a man in a toilet cubicle. That would have seemed crude and misplaced in a mid-eighties Police Academy film; what the hell Myers is doing rehashing a long-dead genre of 'comedy' (him and the Farrelly Brothers deserve each other) is anyone's guess. Maybe he wants this style of coarse, braindead humour to make a comeback so he can aim for an even lower common denominator. Who knows? Who cares?The film is full of continuity errors (the golden cup that vanishes from Hurley's hand is a classic of its kind) and Jay Roach's direction completely lacks the firm hand and fast pace needed to make this kind of film work. There are so many halfway promising gags slaughtered through bad timing or overexposure - Powers taking a very long pee after his thirty-year spell in cryogenic suspension, one of Evil's henchmen stubbornly refusing to die, Evil's failure to comprehend the changes that have happened in society and the world since 1967 - it's downright embarrassing. The 'Ming Tea' sequences are pretty good, as Myers leads a spookily convincing flower power band (including Roach's wife, the beautiful Susanna Hoffs) complete with 'Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In' type visuals, but even this is an old idea - check out 1984's THIS IS SPINAL TAP.In short, this is an unappealing feast of leftovers and burnt offerings that inexplicably gained a cult following amongst smug, self-obsessed trendies who just love quoting the (excruciating) dialogue ad nauseam. Grow up, people. Someday, Myers will have to do the same thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers (Wayne's World) dons a British accent to become Austin Powers, a shagedelic 'superhero', who, in 1967 is chrynogenically frozen, until 30 years later, when he is 'thawed' to help stop his arch nemesis, Dr. Evil from taking over the world.Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) plans to hold the world ransom for $100 billion, or else he'll blow the world up with nuclear warhead-type explosives, while Austin must do everything in his power to stop him.Enter Vanessa Kensington ('Bedazzled's' Elizabeth Hurley), an FBI agent who must help Austin become accustomed to the nineties.There is plenty of slapstick humour in here, with Austin taking the most jokes (Dr. Evil, a close 2nd) and Seth Green ('Buffy The Vampire Slayer') is also good as Dr. Evil's estranged son.All in all, a good movie for a laugh, it's not hard to follow, and you'll find a legion of immature adult men, who have it on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY is a funny, original parody of every spy movies the 60's. Good comedies are not that frequent these days and this IS a good one. Myers is hilarious. He is incredibly talented when creating characters (DIETER and SIMON the kid in the bath on SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE were some of the best in the tv show) and Austin Powers/Doctor Evil is maybe his best routine ever. Hurley has the kind of rare sex-appeal that we don't see in any current leading ladies today. The sequel is VERY bad, a rehash of gags from this movie and a drop of a few notches in the vulgarity level of the humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers, part 1, is a movie that has his jokes during the first 30 minutes. Afterwards it is all going down. I mean, most movies have an OK-beginning , a good centre part and a good ending. This one does it the other way round. I think ( spoiler warning ) the best part is the beginning, when the guys dance in the streets ( that is very funny ). But then it goes the whole way down, from 9/10 to 3/10. I rated this movie a 7/10 , I think, because of the funny beginning. But the sequel is much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Meyers is Mike Meyers in Austin Powers (played by Mike Meyers), International Man of Mystery, a film by Mike Meyers.I managed to miss this film at the cinema, on video and premium channels. Yes, I was *that* guy, sorry Mike, but at least that's one less tax dollar for your accountant to avoise. Having finally seen Austin Power IMoM on network, I was frankly astonished by how utterly bland and stilted it is.This is the kind of shameless vehicle that even puts Barbra Streisand's self love-ins to shame. Meyers needed to spend a lot more time on the writing and a lot less time on practicing his allegedly endearing grimaces in a mirror. A little accent coaching wouldn't have hurt either. Or perhaps the wild accent swings were intended to show that Austin is unhinged. Who knows?Yes, there are genuinely funny lines, but there's actually surprisingly few scenes in there, padded out with a lot of drawn out mugging, tired sight gags, overdone jokes and pointless banter to bring it up to the modest 90 minute runtime.Regarding the writing, Meyers really could have used some help, if only to force him to clarify just exactly what it is that's going on in his head. Is Austin a tragic dinosaur, or an evergreen rebel? Meyers can't make his mind up, and if he doesn't know, how are we supposed to work it out? And why does Miss Kensington suddenly find this repulsive, abusive little reptile attractive, when his behaviour never changes? Mike, what are you trying to *say*? Speak up, we can't hear you at the back.Meyers tries hard (yes, he's *very* trying) but just can't carry it on the acting front either, lacking the energy and manic streak of Peter Sellers or Eddie Murphy. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast are only there to fawn over Meyers, feed him his lines and stroke his ego. Dr Evil's "flame dump" chairs sum up the role of the supporting cast perfectly.A strange and rather sad little film that should have been written off as a flawed curiosity rather than spawning an overblown and pointless sequel. I'm yet again left feeling that Mike Meyers' films should be better than they are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery was probably the funniest movie of 1997. Its jokes are very well-crafted and laugh-out-loud hilarious and the film's script is original and impressively likeable. Mike Myer's effort in this film was outstanding, he played 2 characters, wrote the script and basically directed the movie. Liz Hurley is also a sparkling gem of this flick, her performance was great.Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is a film that is extremely hard to dislike, and it may sound lame, but in years to come, I reckon it will be a classic.Rating: 9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly in parts, but quite entertaining overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The preview to this movie is misleading. They describe Austin as 'the coolest secret agent' of his time in the 1960s, but not fitting in in the 1990s. This last bit is perfectly true, but as to the rest...Austin is out of place because he's a complete sleaze. According to the 1960 situation, it was commonplace then but he can't expect to do the same now, especially with the woman he teams up with, Vanessa Kensington, who has high principiles.Indeed, the 'secret agent' component of Austin's character plays second fiddle to his womanising, which gets him into trouble at least once. Basil Expostion quite rightly warned him to 'be careful'. Austin is actually quite careless when he's not being a secret agent and at times he comes across as plain silly.But Powers is also funny. There's a lot of slapstick humour through the plot, many of it coming straight from the cat's (ie Powers') mouth. Dr Evil is a very suitable bad-guy (a take off of a past villain so I hear) and different in every way from powers, so I never guessed that he was played also by Mike Myers. A very good job done.The introduction is very colourful and a solid start. A less believeable part is that all the characters, apart from Austin and Dr Evil, are supposed to have aged 30 years into the 90s, but they don't look much older. Austin may as well not bothered to have frozen himself if he too aged so slightly.Austin is also a professional photographer. His antics sort of put the main plot of the story (stopping Dr Evil blowing up the world) into the background. But it doesn't matter particularly. There's a lost of funny original segments (which are unfortunately repeated in the sequel). For these reasons, this movie can be watched times over and still a lot gotten out of it. Mike Myers has done a decent job overall. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers is a masterpiece of parody comedy. And it proves that when given the chance, Mike Myers can be a true comic genius. He has created a silly story (funny for both kids and adults) which contains to equally hilarious characters (both played by Myers) about a shagadelic secret agent named Austin Powers who has to stop the world from nuclear war (one of the things Austin is scarred of other than carnies) from the diabolical Dr. Evil, who happens to be the best villain in decades. Along the way, we see the merry mix-ups that occur for Austin as he finds himself in a new time (he was frozen for 30 years from 1967-1997) and for Dr. Evil and as he tries to control his quasi-evil son. Along with great characters, a great script and all elements in place, this film is one of the best of 97 and of humor. Very Shagadelic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie advertised, I had no interest whatsoever in seeing it. I was a Mike Myers fan, but AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY looked like the stupidest and least creative movie of the year. But after hearing of a few of the hilarious scenes of the movie, I decided to test my faith in Myers and give it a try. It turned out to be one of the funniest movies I'd seen in a long time.The swinging hipster from the 60's, Austin Powers (Mike Myers), puts himself in deep freeze for thirty years to pursue his archenemy, Dr. Evil (Mike Myers). He is thawed out in the 90's when Dr. Evil finally reappears and plans to drill a missile to the center of the earth and destroy the planet core, and then the world. Austin Powers, with the help of his true love Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), must find a way to stop Dr. Evil and shag Vanessa. But Dr. Evil has some very dangerous customers working for him, such as Number Two (Robert Wagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Mustafa (Will Ferrell) and his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who thinks his father should just kill Austin rather than make a complicated plan to get rid of him.The plot of this movie is a big spoof of movies such as the JAMES BOND films, so it's not expected to be anything but funny, which it certainly is. Don't listen to people who say this is for middle-school kids, people of all ages can enjoy this movie. It should also be said that Dr. Evil is a terrific character because, in addition to being very funny, is the stereotype spy-movie bad guy.The acting in this movie is pretty good. Mike Myers plays both Austin Power and Dr. Evil, two very different characters, very well. Elizabeth Hurley does a very good job as Austin's girlfriend. Both Seth Green, who I think has a long, successful career ahead of him, and Mindy Sterling are very funny. Robert Wagner and Michael York, two Hollywood veterans, do good jobs with the small parts they have. Will Farrell is underplayed in this movie, but it very funny in the scene he is in. The Fembots, by the way, are terrific.This movie is destined to become a movie classic, and "Yeah baby!" will be a catch phrase that will be remembered years from now. Austin Power and Dr. Evil are both stereotype symbols of past movies. Basically, these two guys are symbols of American film, at least for that particular genre. Don't expect much out of this movie except for a good laugh and a good time and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great, great comedy. Hilarious ride from beginning to end. The acting is good, Myers' accent is rather amusing. There are many reasons this movie is so great. The main is that it's just flat out funny. Seth Green is hilarious to me, I think he did a great job in this movie. Ultimately this is probably one of the best comedies of the last five years, and well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute film; could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well. The spy genre spoof is pretty good. Elizabeth Hurley is such a babe, and a good actress to boot. She got right into the fun of the role. Way too much bathroom humor, though. I'm not a prude, but this was just too overdone in this film. I would like to think that Myers can come up with better jokes. Haven't seen TSWSM though, so we'll see if he did. The best parts were the hotel room scenes, where the naked actors were always strategically behind various objects, melons, cream pitchers, sausages, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People think that this movie appeals only to kids and adolescents due to basic jokes and toilet humor. But the truth is, that this movie is downright hilarious! Not only do you have all the James-Bondish in-jokes, but you also get Austin in his full 60's Barnaby street apparel. So basically people of all ages get a kick out of it. Very original, totally entertaining, and it only gets better with each time you watch it!The sequel is just as good, so you know that there is more on the way. Shagadellic baby! Yeh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hilarious parody of James Bond movies. Austin Powers is a brilliant film with noting bad in it. I don't care if most of the jokes are toilet humor and something you'd hear on the Howard Stern Show. The reason these jokes are so funny is because Mike Myers is very funny. Speaking of Mike Myers, he really shows off his talent by playing two roles at once. Pure genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best spoof movie since The Naked Gun. Austin Powers played by Mike Myers is unfrozen to face his archenemy Dr. Evil also played by Mike Myers. The concept of someone from the 60's being brought into the 90's isn't original. The Brady Bunch used this idea first but that movie gave us a new definition of corny. The 60's was very much an age of change and social revolution making the time period easy to pick on. The James Bond movie Austin Powers spoofs the most is Gold Finger the second movie in the Bond series. Mike Myers knows well what can make people and what will become popular. The movie's 60's dialogue will catch on with the teen generation. The movie is clever and hilarious even more then once. The bottom line is the movie is fun, funny and totally groovy baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers shined far brighter before his Mojo was stolen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Myers created a memorable, hilarious character for the first "Austin Powers" film for a number of reasons. One was a tribute to his late father, a memorabilia of things that his father loved. Secondly, and to be sure I'm presuming here, for the rich, ample supply of great comic material. The idea of a sexually liberated 60s swinger adjusting to the more reserved 90s is quite amusing and what chiefly drew me in.When I saw "Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery" in theaters, I thought it was fantastic fun. I also found myself having to defend the film as many nay-sayers proclaimed the film moronic and lame. Many of said individuals would also recite memorable dialogue as though it was their favourite film at a later date. I also feel that the opening dance sequence was worth the price of admission alone. Soon enough, most people came round.The "Austin Powers" DVD is also quite an impressive example of the benefits of the new medium. Whenever I wish to show off the features of a DVD player to the uninitiated, I usually pop in Austin. It has everything from an audio commentary to deleted scenes and much more. And with repeated viewings, I can safely proclaim that yes, the humour is quite base at times, but it is fun, and after frequent showings, most of the scenes still have me laughing.Suffice it to say, I'm a fan. That is why it was so disappointing to take in the sequel to this fine satire. Going in to a sequel, your expectations are (usually) lowered. I had heard talk of a sequel not long after the first offering had completed it's run, and I'll admit that even then, I was dubious of their chances to recapture the same magic of the first film. In this case, I had been assured by a couple of people that it was good, and the trailer preview looked promising. I couldn't believe how much regurgitation was going on. But more importantly than that, the comic timing was way off. Every so-called punch line felt like a simple warm-up to a bigger punch that never came. An inappropriately long pause after each "joke" only drew more attention to it's ineffectiveness and lack of uniqueness. I hate to say it, but it seems as though the filmmakers weren't sure what made the first one popular, and kind of missed it on this second go.To be sure, there were enjoyable moments, but it seemed as though everything was off kilter. The story line which interested me enough to see it, involves time traveling back to the 60s to retrieve Austin's stolen "Mojo". But this comic potential opportunity was passed up. It seems they could've come up with a lot more comic material on that angle, but didn't bother to explore it. And as silly as the story was, the pace of the whole film seemed transparently formulaic. Like a shopping list of what was popular in the first film, thrown in to the bag without much consideration for originality or appropriate placement.I'll admit that part of my experience for the sequel was hampered by a pack of sixteen year old girls who laughed maybe a little too much at the ultra-mildly amusing bits to the point of annoyance. But I can't say they bothered me too much, I was literally tempted to walk out on it, but I suspect Heather Graham's "Felicity Shagwell" stopped me. Quite ironically, Austin's quest to recover his "Mojo" mirrors the effort to recapture the magic of the first installment, and sadly fails. I sincerely hope it won't taint my affinity for the first film next time I watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absoloutely wonderful movie. Mike Myers plays a superb double part - each character with his own way of talking and mannerisms. Many times during the movie you forget that they are played by the same person, they are so brilliantly played. Amazing. Characterization down to a tee. As for the gags, I can't fault them - Mike Myers' writing skills are great and very funny - even more so as he is prepared to play the 2 main characters himself. Just take a look at the memorable quotes section if you're in any doubt. The inclusion of Scott, Dr. Evil's teenage son, is absolutely side-splitting, especially the "sh" routine. Yeah, baby! As for Liz Hurley, well, she's a babe. Also a very good actress, though. Anyway, I love the film. I have been going round with my little finger to my lips for the past week since I saw it, it's so funny and compelling that you can't help but be picked up in this wonderful pschycadelic James Bond spoof that is Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (cue that extremely annoying theme song) 10 out of 10!

Why couldn't the movie have been about AP trying to find his mojo -- only because his true love's "train has sailed"? (and why would British Intelligence screw over their best man? "Yes, Austin ... we knew it all along," says Basil Exposition).Finally, in AP: IMOM, -that- Austin would not have called himself a "sexy bitch" over and over and over. Yeah, it was amusing the first time, but the other four or five lost their luster FAST. This guy is waaayyy too much into himself and shows us nothing of the vulnerable yet shagadelic AP from the first film.The film's laugh were huge (Frau spraying Mini Me with the water was a huge hit with me), but not as witty or constant as in the first film of this franchise.I work at movie theatre, so I can see this film for free until my eyes bleed... but I'll only go to it again because I don't have to pay.Let's send good wishes (and a few prayers!) to Myers and Roach before they get started on AP3.</fullReview>

Or at least those scenes could be reduced to minimum.I really think those scenes somehow destroy a bit of the genius ideas behind the scripts.

This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies of the 1990s, and while some of the jokes may be lost on those who don't know the original references (believe me, I was the only guy in the cinema laughing hard at a lot of the gags, at midday on the first day of the school holidays), it still comes out as hugely entertaining. Most of my colleagues here still say, 'Oh, behave,' 'My name is Richie Cunningham, and this is my wife, Oprah,' and 'Yeah, baby!' close to 18 months after the film showed.Myers is fabulous and Robert Wagner gives one of his most enjoyable performances. Elizabeth Hurley is only so-so when you compare her performances in dramatic films and TV, but what a tiny (and nearly inconsequential) complaint!My only complaint was the release date here in New Zealand. Can you believe we got it in December 1997? The sequel had better not take half a year to get here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers undoubtedly has great comedic talent, but sometimes it wears thin, especially in the WAYNE'S WORLD movies. This time, he takes on the swinging 60's mod scene, as well as early James Bond. Everyone knows the basic gimmick, freezing the shag-hero until 1997 so he can take on the evil Dr. Evil (also Myers). The world has changed: no free love, no more-mind freeing drugs. Some people have talked about the picture as "slapstick" with a message. The Austin Powers character must adapt to the drastic change and un-idealistic 90's. The thing is, Austin Powers is not all that funny (except the rotting teeth and hilarious shagadelic dance). Dr. Evil is the one to watch.If you are not familiar with Mod, or any Bond movies, you may find yourself turning this flick off. Most of the jokes are inside ones with these topics in mind. However, the Dr. Evil character has you laughing all the way to the end. It is truly funny seeing an arch-criminal going to family therapy with his son. He tells the group his son is "quite astute", and not easliy killed. Evil steals the movie by partaking in every cliche the spy genre is comprised of and his cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, is the most important thing to him besides world domination.There are some great sight gags, especially when Austin and the beautiful Elizabeth Hurley strut around naked. With careful choreography, their privates are never exposed. Again, while Powers shags on, baby, you have to say this is Dr. Evil's film. No doubt he and Mr. Bigglesworth will be back for the sequel, and perhaps his son has started that evil petting zoo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers is highly inventive, one of the most creative comedies in decades - Myers is at his best. Wayne's World was good, but pales in comparison to this shagadelic flick. It pays homage to the 60's and James Bond Movies with a wink rather than a stab. Yes, it's overblown, and yes parts are ridiculous, but that is part of the fun. The opening sequence and titles made me cry I was laughing so hard. I think some of the ones who don't like the flick may not pick up on a lot of the references to other films or fads. Can't wait for the sequel - it's in the top three of my summer must see's, behind Episode One and Eyes Wide Shut. Notice how this flick opened up a whole new door for slang and vocabulary -- smashing baby - shagadelic - yeah, baby --- people who've seen the movie know exactly what you're saying. Now that's funny --- a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another outstanding film by Mike Myers. In this one, he is completely confused by the 90's culture after being frozen in the 60's. The situation alone would've made this movie funny but Myers went the extra step and made it one of the funniest movies of all time. There are jokes every 5 minutes and moments that will leave you laughing for hours. Almost every joke and comment is original so the movie is entirely unpredictable and incredibly funny. Dr. Evil is played flawlessly as a villain from the 60's who is also very outdated on just about everything. This movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mimi Rogers, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green and Will Ferrell star in this 1997 comedy. This begins in 1967, where we meet suave, secret agent, Austin Powers (Myers) and his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers). After a failed attempt on Austin's life, Dr. Evil escapes and freezes himself. Austin also freezes himself in case Dr. Evil comes back. After 30 years, Dr. Evil threatens the United Nations for money and soon, Austin is thawed to capture him while adjusting to living in the 90's. Hurley plays Austin's partner, Vanessa Kensington who falls for him, Rogers plays her mother, Mrs. Kensington, York plays Austin's boss, Basil, Wagner plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Number 2, Sterling plays Dr. Evil's associate, Frau, Green plays Dr. Evil's son, Scott and Ferrell plays henchman, Mustafa who also appears in the sequel. This is a good spy spoof, Myers is great as both characters and he and Hurley have good chemistry. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers is back and this time, he's a spy. What kind of spy, an International Man Of Mystery. Hey, doesn't that sound a little like the title of a James Bond movie? Well, yes in fact it's a spoof of the spy genre and yes the sensational 60s. Myers plays Austin Powers and his arch-evil nemesis Dr. Evil, two different men, Austin wants to save the world, while Dr. Evil would rather destroy it. Seth Green plays Dr. Evil's son Scott Evil, who was artificially inseminated, and he doesn't want anything to do with taking over the world, will his dad convince him otherwise? This movie is great, one of the things that makes it that way, is because it's got a great story, funny memorable characters, a hero who has yellow teeth (and he's stuck in the 60s), a woman side-kick, an evil villain, and some action. The only thing that might turn people off of this movie is the raunchy humor.Me, I thought it was very funny, enjoyable, and it's definitely my favourite Mike Myers movie. When I saw Wayne's World, I thought OMG...Mike Myers is so hilarious, ya, this movie blew Wayne's World, out of the water by far and that's why I gave this movie 10 out of a possible 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main joke of all recent parodies is to point out that the movie that is beng mocked was not realistic. This is told over and over again in different ways such as saying "use a gun instead of sharks" etc. etc. etc.. The film also uses a lot of gross out humor. It was extremely well marketed to make everyone think they have to see it and have to like it.The main premise is to make anything that is cool seem uncool. Otherwise to keep telling us that James Bond or Flint were unrealistic just does not make me laugh. In fact in a sense every film is unrealistic the moment we walk in a theater we see a screen we know it is not real. Imagination is needed to enjoy most any film. Films today that show people vomiting or using a washroom convey no more sense of realism than any other films.Hopefully real comedy like The Odd Couple will someday come back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty funny - Mike Myers is great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery I was actually disappointed. I hadn't seen many of the Bond films at that time so I really didn't get that many of the jokes. Some time ago I bought the DVD don't ask me why but I did and being older and having seen quite a few of the Bond films I really grew to appreciate the humor and the general mood of the film. Mike Myers is undoubtedly the best man who could ever spoof James Bond because he is pretty much the complete opposite of Bond. He is unattractive (especially with the fake teeth he uses in this film) and he doesn't come off as being sophisticated or any good in a fight so for him to play an irresistible swinger is immensely funny in itself.Mike Myers does a good job with the character(s) and brings a certain charm to both Austin Powers and Doctor Evil. It is obvious that Myers is inspired by Peter Sellers in the fact that he plays more than one character (something he will bring even further in the following films) and he does a very good job. He also pulls off a semi-believable British accent giving the character of Austin Powers an extra level of credibility. Austin Powers is the most interesting character in the film and his chemistry with Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) Makes their scenes together the most interesting and funny in the film. Doctor Evil is funny the first time but quite frankly isn't as interesting as Powers making his scenes less reviewable. Elizabeth Hurley is hot and thus works great as a love interest for Austin. She is the best of Austin's girls in any of the films. The supporting cast is decent as well. Michael York, Robert Wagner and Mindy Sterling all do great jobs.There are a lot of references and spoofs of the original Bond films that work great. A few examples are a Chinese henchman called Random Task an obvious reference to the greatest of the Bond films where there was a similar Chinese henchman called Oddjob, a woman called Alotta Fagina referencing the fact that many Bond girls had names you could read differently. Dr. Evil looks a lot like Ernst Stavro Blofeld the only recurring super villain of the Bond films as we saw him in You Only Live Twice (I wouldn't call Jaws a super villain as he is a henchman).The film is, however, lacking an interesting story. There is a story but it isn't that interesting. I found the story in the second film to be much more original and fresh and this drags down a bit. It doesn't change the fact that Austin Powers is a funny film that deserves at least one viewing.All in all 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly, but a great parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Myers is quite the character, and I mean that literally. He's undoubtedly great at coming up with over the top and eccentric characters and Austin 'Danger' Powers is probably his most famous. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the first film in the Austin Powers series where Meyers stars as the suave British secret agent, as well as his nemesis, the pasty white Dr. Evil. The film opens in the 60's where promiscuous sex and drugs are the essence of popular culture and Powers is living it up, womanizing left and right as the sex symbol of all of Britain. But while Powers is foiling a plot of Dr. Evil's, Evil cryofreezes himself to escape. Powers has no other option but to cryofreeze himself so that he may be unfrozen if Dr. Evil ever decides to return. Thus we are thrown into present day, which in this case is the 90's, where Powers must foil Dr. Evil's plot to take over the world. Utter goofiness ensues, some of it completely idiotic, some of it completely hilarious.Austin Powers is a perfect poster child for parody films, and it does a hilariously great job at parodying the rampant sexual innuendos, overly cheesy plot lines, and stereotypically flat characters of 1960's spy films. Thus, the entire film is spent making fun of other films, thus any inconsistency, continuity error, or plot hole exists only to perpetuate the parody theme of the film. Thus, you can't judge Austin Powers on its plot, characters, or most things that you normally would judge a film for. You can really only judge it on its humor. The film has one goal and one goal only, to make the audience laugh. So basically if it makes you laugh it passes, if it doesn't it fails. In my case, I laughed so there... the film passes in my book.There's not much else to say. I'm not really the biggest fan of goofy humor, but I laughed out loud more than once during this film. And while it is mostly silly antics riddled with fart and poop jokes, there's a baseline of cleverness that runs through the film that makes it a lot of fun to watch. You can only enjoy this film for exactly what it is on the surface, and I most certainly did. It's just one of those comedies you will like or you won't, and I luckily did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even today, fifteen years after its launch timer reached zero, Mike Myers's first romp as the gregarious gentleman spy with a heinous grill is mercilessly funny, shockingly well-written and every bit as entertaining as it was on day one. It's impressive enough for a film of this age to still retain so much of its initial charm, but to do so with the added weight of two derivative sequels, aping the original's best jokes at every turn, is borderline miraculous. Myers is at his rapid-fire best throughout this picture, setting up punchlines like dramatic authors might dangle plot threads, while somehow keeping the simple, delightful, central storyline in sight at all times. A biting satire of 60's culture and, naturally, the James Bond flicks that primarily celebrated it, there's no shortage of ammunition for the SNL alum's comic WMDs, but amidst so many presses of that red button there's also a sweet, tangible thought at its core. Clever, side-splitting comedy that might just stay fresh for decades to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is a comedy/science fiction film by definition. This is the first installment of the Austin Powers series. Austin Powers was premiered in 1997. Directed by Jay Roach and written by Mike Myers, who stars a dual role in the film. The Austin Powers films were intended be a parody off of the James Bond movies. The film starts out in 1967, with Austin Powers a British spy who attempts to assassinate his nemesis Dr. Evil. Dr. Evil successfully escapes, launching himself in a space rocket disguised as a Big Boy's statue. From there the movie jumps forward, 30 years in time to 1997. The film stars Mike Myers as Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington, and Will Ferrell as Mustafa among other talented actors and actresses. The theme of the film parodies numerous James Bond, Derek Flint, Jason King, and Matt Helm films, characters, and video games. These films are incorporated with other elements of pop culture and they follow the British spy's heroic quest to bring the villain Doctor Evil to justice. The films poke fun at the outrageous plots, rampant sexual innuendo, and one-dimensional stock characters associated with 1960s spy films, as well as the cliché of the ultra-suave male super spy. Contrary to the handsome, super-smooth leading men of the James Bond genre, Austin Powers is not characterized as being conventionally attractive (he is especially known for his bad teeth), although female characters in the films seem to find him irresistible. The general theme of the films is that the arch-villain Dr. Evil plots to extort large sums of money from governments or international bodies but is constantly thrown off by British super-spy Austin Powers, and (to a degree) his own inexperience with life and culture in the 1990s.There's a lot of lighting effects that are used in the film. All the explosions and fire are effects that are used to enhance the film. For example, when Dr. Evil is escaping from Austin in his "space ship" disguised as the Big Boy statue, it appears as if he is traveling through space, all lighting effects. The angels that are used in the film are pretty much a standard, straight on, clear cut shot. The director uses some close ups to enhance the features of The Man of Mystery, for example his teeth. These techniques are two of the most important in my opinion, when it comes to a film we all want to be entertained. It's funny how a simple flashing light or a camera angle can affect how we watch a film and how much we enjoy the actual film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am somewhat late...not like Frau Farbissina...but late getting around to the Austin Powers films. Oh well...better late than never. I find myself not only on the floor laughing at these bad jokes done well ( and bad jokes sometimes done not so well) that I must confess I have become a Mike Myers fan as a result. Reality and sensibility are totally suspended, and it becomes pure entertainment and real fun. I will not generally go in for bad language or obscenity....but what there is of these in the Austin Powers films is done in such a deliberately comedic way that I find it easy to force myself to overlook it in most instances. One thing that is not forced is these films is the humor. The situations and the characters are truly funny, and I have found myself viewing this film repeatedly. Culturally literate baby-boomers who were around in these days will get a big kick out of it. I do not recommend this for children---but they probably will watch it anyway--just hope there's some adult supervision there to explain to them what was happening, and to help them along with the terminology and the groups of the era. Austin Powers is an absolute riot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until last years dreadful Love Guru, Mike Myers used to be a genius. His first comedy, I think was So I married an ax murderer. To me, I think that was probably his best film. His next big hits were Waynes World and Waynes World 2. Which, I loved both of those. A few years after Wayne's World, Myers came up with one of the most memorable characters ever. Austin Powers was a success with critics but not quite at the box office. But after the first one, the series got more and more successful. Austin Powers: International man of mystery is the first film in the series. And by far the best. Austin Powers: International Man of mystery is so stupid that it's funny. In case you don't know, Austin Powers, the entire trilogy, is making fun of James Bond. If you've seen some of the Bond films, then you will know. For instance, instead of Pussy Galore, there's a character named Alotta Vagina. I won't spoil anymore of Austin Powers's fun. If you haven't seen Austin Powers, you should wake up and smell the roses. Austin Powers: International Man of mystery is hilarious. It's obvious that you should see it. It's a classic.The Plot: A spy named Austin Powers decided to freeze himself in 1967 so then he could defeat his life long nemesis Dr. Evil in the future. Dr. Evil also froze himself. So thirty years later, both Austin and Dr. Evil are unfrozen. Austin teams up with Vanessa Kensington, who's mother was his old partner and together, Austin and Vanessa try to stop Dr. Evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually funny, unlike certain other James Bond spoofs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was eleven years old around the time this hit comedy came into stores, so I was perhaps a little too young to see it. When I was sixteen, all three of the Austin Powers movies were out in stores, and I finally watched them all in reverse order. I have now seen each of them several times, and recently watched this one, the original "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery", for the first time in a couple years (back when I last watched the entire trilogy). It was my first time seeing it after watching all the James Bond movies in order, so I now understand some of the parodies, and I think my latest viewing of this 1997 comedy was a lot like the one before it. I may not like it as much as I did as a teenager, but I still laughed, you can be sure about that. It's definitely more watchable than the 1967 version of "Casino Royale", and probably certain other lacklustre Bond spoofs as well.In 1967, Austin Powers is a British secret agent and a stereotypical 60's womanizer. His archenemy is Dr. Evil, a man with plans for world domination! One night, while the agent chases after his foe, the evil doctor manages to get away in a rocket, where he cryogenically freezes himself, and plans to return sometime in the future! Powers is then cryogenically frozen so he will be available to continue his battles against the madman whenever he happens to come back. Dr. Evil finally returns from suspended animation thirty years later, in 1997, and immediately reunites with his colleagues to figure out new ways to try and take over the world! So, Powers is unfrozen and sent with Vanessa Kensington, the daughter of a woman he worked with in the 60's, to once again try and foil his archenemy's plans. Unfortunately for Powers, a lot has changed in thirty years, and his womanizing ways will no longer be tolerated.Comedian Mike Myers, who wrote the story, plays two characters in the film, Austin Powers and Dr. Evil. He does a good job with both, playing a likable, charming fool and goofy parody of James Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Both of these characters can still make me laugh with their antics. The washroom stall gag, Powers mistaking the mother of his boss, Basil Exposition, for a man in disguise, and the conflict between Dr. Evil and his son, Scott, are three things I can point out as comic highlights, but those aren't the only ones. Certain other characters can be quite funny as well, such as Frau Farbissina, a villain played by Mindy Sterling, with her screech, and Mustafa, Dr. Evil's henchman played by Will Ferrell, even though this chararacter isn't in the film for long. Yes, this is a raunchy comedy, with sex, nudity, and some language, which I don't have a problem with, as long as it's funny, but if this type of dirty humour bothers you, and/or you don't care for Mike Myers as a comedian, then "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" is not for you. However, if you like Myers' sense of humour and want to laugh, this James Bond spoof could be your kind of comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember being terribly excited when Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery was first released. I couldn't wait to see it. And for one of the few times in my life, a movie not only lived-up to the hype, but actually exceeded my expectations. At the time, I considered it a real winner and would have most likely rated it a 9/10 (if I had been rating movies at the time).I re-watched Austin Powers: IMoM this weekend for the first time in something like 5 or 6 years. How would it hold up? This is the portion of most user comments where I write something about being disappointed by an old favorite I haven't seen in years. Well, I'm happy to report that that's not the case here. The comedy in Austin Powers: IMoM works as well today as it did 12 years ago. The movie really is Mike Myers' baby from start to finish and he was never better or funnier. The writing is sensational. Myers' understanding and parody of James Bond, the 60s, and general pop culture is spot on. The notion of Dr. Evil's outdated plans for taking over the world through force in contrast with No. 2's ability to do even better and be more successful in the world of business is s small point, but very cleverly written. Myers is laugh out loud funny whether in the guise of Austin Powers or Dr. Evil. It's brilliant! And there are some truly inspired set-pieces that work flawlessly. The sea bass with lasers scenes, the Fembots, and Dr. Evil's therapy sessions are all plain old funny. For my money, comedy doesn't get much better than this.With so much of the film focusing on Myers, it's almost surprising that the often underutilized supporting cast are nonetheless excellent. Elizabeth Hurley, Mimi Rogers, and even Seth Green (who normally gets on my nerves) give fine performances. But it's Robert Wagner as No. 2 who actually upstages even Myers on occasion that I find the best. Wagner's No. 2 is a scream! Wagner is so dead-pan serious that its amazing. It's a very nice piece of acting.In the end, Austin Powers: IMoM is as fresh today as ever. I'm still more than comfortable with my initial assessment and have now "officially" rated it a 9/10. Good job by all involved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the best spy comedy ever. All the best known James Bond are spoofed here pretty well and it's not some kind of a cheap parody. It's also in my opinion the best Austin Powers film, though it's sequels where made on a bigger budget, but still this film was the funniest. What else did I like was the atmosphere of the 60's in this film. The idea of hippie being a spy is quite an original idea. I think this movie is more Sean Connery's Bond films parody, because even most of the bad guys were from Sean Connery's Bond movies like from Goldfinger or Thunderball, though I noticed that one scene was a spoof of Live and Let Die with Roger Moore.</fullReview>

But from the beginning the wonderful color and humor of this movie won me over quickly.The plot of the film unlike most comedies was not shown immediately but like all good spy movies it unraveled itself, but It won't keep you on the edge of you're seat like spy movies, because you'll be to busy falling backwards laughing! And one of the best parts is almost all types of humor are used in this, slapstick, plot goofs, spoofs, modern-day-references, and others! But be warned: There are a lot of sexual references, so I do not suggest this to anyone under 11.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swingin' 60's Baby... yeah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Definitely one of the funniest spy movie spoof ever.One is a the hottest spy of the 60's. Even with bad teeth, he has a way with the women (in the 60's that is). The other one is a megalomaniac, reminiscence of James Bond's mortal enemy Ernst Blofeld. All he wants is to rule the world, and is the worst enemy of that super-spy. That spy your sure to love is Austin Powers, and that megalomaniac is the "sinister" Dr. Evil, and both are played by Mike Myers, and when they were frozen in the 60's and reawakened during the 90's, their fish-out-of-water.All this and so much more are in AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, an immensely enjoyable and funny spoof of the classic James Bond movies, an idea that proved to be some failure in 1967's CASINO ROYALE parody. Although not every joke in this movie will make you laugh like a fool, all the jokes are right on timing, as they are quite relevant. And the film's biggest long-running joke, wherein two 60's inhabitants try to blend in to the much-changed 90's atmosphere, is slick and cleverly idealistic.The plot in a nutshell concerns Austin Powers and Dr. Evil (both played by Myers) confronting each other once again in the 90's. Evil's plan is to gain profit from world leaders and, after a number of bad and dated ideas (Framing Prince Charles to divorce and putting a hole in the atmosphere which all supposedly happened), he finally comes up with a plan to use a warhead to terrorize the world for 100 billion dollars. Elizabeth Hurley co-stars as Vanessa, Austin's fellow agent not attracted by Austin's approach to sex ("Do I make you horny, baby?", Michael York also co-stars as Basil Exposition, Austin's boss and Robert Wagner as Number 2, Dr. Evil's "cycloptic" colleague (he wears an eye-patch).There are a few uneven jokes that fall short of the point, but majority are really great jokes, like ones that exceed upon the PG-13 rating it was limited to. Myers is a natural, carrying two roles in one film, making them both very hilarious and interesting. Director Jay Roach is very energetic and fun-loving in his work. The script, co-written by Myers, is filled with jokes we thought will never work. Turns out they will, if given to the right hands.A very funny comedy, surprisingly holds up very memorably.Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers is a funny comedy that is my favourite Mike Myers movie to date. The movie is about Austin Powers who is frozen in the year 1967 and unfrozen in 1997 to save the world from the evil Doctor Evil. The movie is very funny and is the perfect spoof to all action movies(particularly James Bond movies) as it has lots of the aspects that James Bond movies do(for example the cards,babes and all that). I have never met a person who does not like this movie and I have met quite a few people that have seen it. Overall if you have not seen this movie then you must go and see it now as it is funny and just overall awesome. I rate it 86% and look for Will Ferrells character as he is hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny first entry that spoofs Bond movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted there was a movie with Leslie Nielson called "Spy Hard" that sort of made fun of Bond movies, but not really. In the end it spoofed to much stuff and the only part clearly making fun of a Bond movie was the title song. This movie, the first in the set of three was a very good spoof of James Bond, though it was probably a bit better in making fun of his villains because for me the funniest thing about the movie was Dr. Evil. Austin Powers himself was somewhat funny for most of the flick with flashes of being really funny. However, I was dying laughing when Dr. Evil torched one of his men, but said man didn't die. I also like the overly complicated trap when he could have shot Austin and been done with it. The story, Dr. Evil makes a narrow escape at the beginning, freezing himself so he can wreck havoc again in the future. Austin Powers does the same so he can once again stop his foe. Of course, there are jokes involving Austin's long layoff and returning to a new decade and his adjustment to the times. There are also father son issues involving Dr. Evil and his clone son. Though there are times this movie just kind of drifts off for me and the jokes don't hit on all cylinders, but for the most part it is a very funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers,in interviews when asked about the genesis of the Austin Powers,said that it was inspired at least in part to the sort of Avengers/JAmes Bond movies that were a favorite of his father's,for whom he was was very close to. Judging by the enthusiasm and walloping energy he infused into writing,producing and(of course)acting in the films,I'd say that there is definitely a lot of love and personal investment in it.Myers plays both the title character and his arch-nemesis,Dr.Evil,as they are both products of the deep Cold WAr 1960s and the swanky,kitchy era that framed it. Both have been deep-frozen,and when Dr.Evil is unthawed in 1997,British Intelligence goes and unthaws POwers,who is sent to(big surprise)thwart Dr. Evil's plans. Along for the mission is Powers' one-time affiliate's daughter,the fetching Vanessa Kenzington(Elizabeth Hurley,never better fit for a film than here). Meanwhile,Dr.Evil(Ernst Blofeld look and all)has personal revelations of his own:namely,a genetically produced offspring that is an angry,back-talking son named Scott(Seth Green,full-froth). An ensuance of sight gags,pratfalls,an attempt at seduction(simultaneously done by Powers and an Italian vixen/spy(FAbiana Udenio),a romantic interlude(fostered along by Mr.Burt Bacharach!)in LAs Vegas,and a showdown in Evil's mountain lair all come into play before the film's fitful conclusion.Directed with transparency by JAy Roach,Myers ups the ante from his Wayne's World movies by giving these films as retro and kitchy as possible,replete with musical numbers,full-on Birtish slang and a cheekiness factor of ten! I--like many people--saw this film first on video,and it was a film that,FYI,was actually much more successfully in second release for home vid than it was in theatrical first release. Somewhat ironic,since the ensuing Austin POwers equals were probably,in my opinion,descending(though not bad any a one,really)in quality,yet did considerably better each in box office. No matter,it's quite the comedic gas,full of good clean naughtiness! Behave,indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Austin Powers is really the creation of Mike Myers, Saturday Night Live alumni. He plays multiple roles as the sex-crazed hairy gap-toothed Austin Powers who was frozen in time in the 1960s while Dr. Evil, his complete opposite and enemy also was frozen in time. Now they're both back and at each other's throats again. Austin is trying to save the world while Dr. Evil is bald and truly evil. My favorite scenes include Dr. Evil and his minions including the wonderful Mindy Sterling and Robert Wagner. I love Dr. Evil's relationship with his newfound son, Scott Evil, played by Seth Green. Those are my favorite scenes in the film as Dr. Evil tries to get a hug from his son. One of the funniest scenes in the movie is when Dr. Evil and Scott go into family therapy lead by Carrie Fisher.</fullReview>

Trained by the British Spy Infantry, Austin looks to set off to find Dr. Evil. After finding him in a 70s swingers club, Dr. Evil escapes with his cat Mr. Bigglesworth. He cryogenically freezes himself in a Big Boy shaped space rocket. Austin has no other choice to be frozen himself.Dr. Evil makes his return to Earth in the 90's. His evil henchmen are all still loyal and there are some new faces. After the British Government hears of this, Austin is also brought out of his frozen coma. Problem for Austin, its not the 70's. No more swinging or promiscuous sex with other partners. He also seems to have a thing for his partner in crime, Ms. Kenzington. Dr. Evil thought up of a new evil plan and once again holds the world hostage. Our only hope is Austin Powers.</fullReview>

Elizibeth Hurley plays Vanessa Kensington, Austin's new partner in spying and Mimi Rogers plays her mother. This, in my opinion, is a career starter for several people, and you should see it.

		<shortDescription>An Antidote For A Rainy Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a Mike Myers fan, and I avoided this film--and its sequels--like the plague when they were on the big screen. But I now know the error of my ways: AUSTIN POWERS is one of the freshest bits of purely entertaining, mindless fluff to come along in quite a while, the perfect antidote to an overcast and bad-mood sort of day.The story is an amalgamation of the more excessive plot ideas of such films as DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and OUR MAN FLINT. Fashion photographer by day and swinging spy by night, Austin Powers is the toast of psychedelic London--and more than a match for Dr. Evil. But when Dr. Evil has himself frozen, Powers does the same, and the two defrost some thirty years later and resume their battle in the much more up-tight 1990s. The most obvious target of the spoof is the James Bond films, but fans of 1960s film will have a field day spotting the film's take offs on such characters as Matt Helm, Derek Flint, Emma Peel, celebrities like The Beatles and Andy Warhol, and such diverse films as THE TENTH VICTIM and the camp classic DR. GOLDFOOT AND THE GIRL BOMB. And dare we mention the sixties' own classic swinging spy spoof, the infamous CASINO ROYALE? Myers is greatly amusing in the double role of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, both of whom have considerable difficulty adjusting to everything from safe sex to inflation, and Elizabeth Hurley is quite good in the Diana Rigg-ish role of sidekick Vanessa Kensington. But the real fun here is in the details--and the details include every one from Michael York to Robert Wagner to Burt Bacharach to Carrie Fisher, "Fembots" with killer pasties, and Italian sexpot Fabiana Udenio as a character with the most devastating name since Honor Blackman hit the screen in GOLDFINGER. The soundtrack is just as swinging as it gets, with blasts of everything from "These Boots Are Made For Walking" and "I Touch Myself." And look for a hilarious spoof of Bob Fosse-inspired choreography during the main credits! You won't find any deep thoughts in AUSTIN POWERS, and thank heaven for it: giggles and grins are the order of the day, and the film delivers them in abundance. The DVD is a nice one as well, offering your choice of widescreen or pan-and-scan, some entertaining notes and deleted scenes, and amusing commentary. Buy it and keep on your shelf for that rainy day.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers does a fantastic job of taking a movie genre - that I'm sure he enjoyed watching as a young man - and exploiting it for the purposes of his comic genius. I especially enjoy that he used so many elements from many different movies to bring together the plot and develop it for the character of Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Watch the second movie "Austin Powers, the Spy who Shagged Me" once you have seen this one - and not before. This is what great comedians do. They take what they know &amp; love and point out the laughs that can be had from it. Ironically, I just saw an interview with Mike Myers in which he admitted that his family, particularly his mother, were of the opinion - and may still be - that Mike was/is not funny. His mother, a Liverpool, England native, has always told him, "your brothers are funny - but not you Michael" ??? BRAVO, Mr Myers, you proved mum wrong. We just have to sit back and enjoy.

		<fullReview>Personally, I like the Austin Powers movies. The only problem with them is that in order to get real laughs, you have to be in a silly mood. If you're not in a silly mood, then you probably won't think it is anything funny. Most of the people who said this had no humor probably watched it when they weren't in that mood.There are several good things about this movie. Such as the way it spoofs 007, and other spy movies of the '60's. The beginning of this movie takes place during the '60's, but then it jumps ahead to the late '90's. This movie mixes the culture of the '60's into the '90's, and does it very well.There is a lot of sexual humor in this movie, but anyone who is in elementary school probably won't pick up on any of it.In many ways, this is just as good as the sequels, but in many ways I prefer the sequels. It probably has something to do with how the sequels have more characters, and in many ways better humor. This is worth watching, but only if you're tired or in a silly mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far, this is easily the best of the three Austin Powers movies. It has no precedent, so it's standard of humor was what to expect, rather than what to live up to, and it was a unique, dynamic humorous take on the genre. the sequels fed off the success of this one, so they lack in certain places where this one excels, especially with originality. Mike Myers is ever the funnyman, playing on rarely but occasionally witty humor, and mostly pandering to the 13 year old boy audience with the crude humor. The vulgarities will be perceived by some people as inappropriate, but you still have to remember - it's intended for kids around 13. And, if it's a rainy Friday night, you'll watch it and you'll find it's funny, even if it offends you. There is one big element of the humor, and that is that it's not really timeless humor. Thus, I find I often have to put at least a few months between each time I watch a Mike Myers or Jim Carrey movie.But, Austin Powers is cool, campy, and funny. Give it a chance, and you'll find a laugh or two.</fullReview>

He delivers one of the funniest villains ever captured in cinematic form. Austin Powers is also best on a lot of 60's spoofs such as James Bond, and a lot of 60's trends. It uses those trend in the correct way.Austin Powers is one of the funniest comedies of 1997.</fullReview>

Mike Myers has given us a group of characters so likable, that we even look for the henchman in the film's two sequels. While I think the original idea of spoofing James Bond movies encouraged Myers initial plan for Austin Powers, the charm and originality of the story and hero took on a life of its own. There's no doubt about it, this film is its own beast, and can be viewed after any Bond film without drawing a comparison (unless one is comparing how much more entertaining the Austin Powers film is, of course). Recommended for everyone regardless of gender, nationality, or age (well 50+ might want to look elsewhere). By far my favorite comedy ever.

		<fullReview>austin powers. what a great idea for a money making success. i mean, since the sexual jokes are always there, and if not the sexual jokes, then the laughter that comes from the eviliest dr. evil. dr. evil, i give you kudos to whomever came up with the ideas of giving you one line wonders that will drag you along movie history as the weirdiest and funniest guys around. what an awesome idea for the saturday night legend mike myers to take on more than one character and be able to balance both the crazy teethed austin and the evil doctor. with laughs that can carry you back to timbuktu, this movie was a must see for that year, and is still a must see for those who want to watch the other movies that are followups to the first one. so, if you ever skip a day without brushing your teeth or flossing them, remember austin powers and man oh man go into that bathroom and brush like you never brushed before!

		<fullReview>When I first saw the movie, I thought it was funny to a point. Crude humor, and weird charcters made it funny. Mike Myers takes on many unusual characters, with unusual names. I have to say that this movie is not for everyone. Not everyone like these kind of humor, but it is a great movie just to sit back relax, and have a good time. There are a few flaws, but they are all made up for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Myers showed his talent and versatility in "Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery". Austin Powers is a very likeable character, and the the swinging sixties are brought back in a combination of "Rowen &amp; Martin's Laugh-In" and "In Like Flint" Austin Powers counterpart, Dr Evil is pleasant enough, and their battles never sink to a violent level. Austin's accent, his word play and his personality keep the movie entertaining. It is a fun movie for audiences of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious fresh rendition of the aging spy genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is without a doubt one of the funniest, most thought-provoking, and humorous comedies to debut since Blazing Saddles hit theatres. This movie can be called a spoof of other spy movies, i.e. James Bond, however it is more of its own movie than just a spoof. Most run-offs don't have much of a plot, instead mainly focus on the comedic aspects of the movie it steals from. Austin Powers has both, and more. It has an entertaining, enjoyable plot, interesting characters, beautiful women, and of course Clint Howard as 'Johnson Ritter'. After plenty of movie flops and no really big picture since Wayne's World, many people considered Mike Myers washed up beyond salvation. But he has proved us all wrong in an absolutely breathtaking rendition of comedic genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" is another in the long line of sorry films that somehow generates enough revenue to warrant sequels. The film is not very good. Mike Myers stars as the titled character and is frozen in the 1960s, only to be unfrozen in the 1990s to fight the diabolical Dr. Evil (also Myers). Basically a parody of the James Bond group of films, but does not even come close to working the way it should. Sub-par. 2 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie the other day for the first time in a long time, and I think this is one of the funniest movies! It's got an absurd plot of course, but I thought it was funny as all hell. Mike Myers has got one crazy mind to come up with this. His movies are the best!This is most definitely one of those movies that if you liked what you saw in the trailer, you'll probably like the movie. If you don't like what you saw in the trailer, there is no way you're going to like the movie.This film does a GREAT job of parading other films, and I'm very sure that I'm not getting all the references. But, that's what makes this film so great, cause every time you watch it you'll notice or learn something new about it. I sincerely hope that you like(d) this movie as much as I do.

		<fullReview>AP1 is an excellent spoof of all the cheesy 60's British spy movies. Myers humor and timing is excellent, and portrays two hilarious characters Dr. Evil and of course Austin Powers. I'm not sure what grade level the other person needs for a comedy to be enjoyable though. College humor? Mid-life crisis humor? Senile dementia humor? Oh well, all in good fun. The first is definitely much better than the second, where the jokes are rehashed, much like Myer's former SNL, and Myers seems to have forgotten why he wrote the first script in the first place. It wasn't out of inspiration for a film with midgets and fat bastards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is possibly the most classic of comedies for the 90s. Ridiculous storyline satirising the 'formula' of a spy movie, gags, allusions, clever visual humour and a wacky Mike Myers complete the whole movie. Never have I watched a movie so many times and found it as refreshingly humorous the first time as I did the fifth. "Austin Powers" stays beyond the screen as well. People have picked up "Shagadelic, baby!", "It's freedom, baby - yeah!" and "Oh behaaave..." and one time a friend spontaneously did the Dr Evil 'dance' (when he's showing Scott that he's 'hip' and 'with it'). Who else bites the knuckle on their pinky? This movie is truly, truly a classic and will be a foundation on which others will build on for time to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening scene to the hilariously over the top finale, this is Mike Myers at the top of his game. This is more than just a clever pastiche of the James Bond franchise (and a host of other films), but a standalone piece of comedy genius. Every scene is perfectly crafted but in a way that seems effortless. And the cast are clearly having a whale of a time.The cuts away from the main narrative to the otherwise unfeatured family and friends of the henchmen that die along the way are inspired - and has become an often-imitated device in comedy (e.g. South Park).The dialogue is unforgettable and hilarious throughout, but the biggest coup the film pulls off is that it can be watched over and over again and the jokes don't get tired. I watched it six times at the cinema, introducing a host of friends to the film's charms - it is the only movie that has ever had that effect on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is Mike Myers the most incredible actor of all time or what? How can you play 2 roles (3 in or 4 in the 2nd and 3rd movies) and play them that well. That must be so hard having to change all those things to turn himself into Dr Evil and then acting at his best and then turning back into Austin Powers and again acting at his best. Elizabeth Hurley was excellent in the film as well while she just lacked the unseriousness to be funny. Michael York was OK, nothing special. Mindy Sterling was definitely the best after Mike Myers of course. Seth Green would have come in next playing his role extremely well and Robert Wagner played it very well when he was getting frustrated by Dr Evil. Not only was Mike Myers acting superb, but his writing was even better and that's saying something. This movie was the funniest made for absolutely ages after it went to the big screen.

		<fullReview>"Groovy, Baby!" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did.Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four.We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to "today's times" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas.I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before.And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies.This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting.Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.</fullReview>

It is that good. The category this movie falls in is the so stupid it's funny category. Mike Myers is a very good at making people laugh so hard. One of the best comedy actors around. He did an amazing job playing both Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.

Just then right next to it was a huge big boy on the building and there was a song called Incense and Peppermints by Strawberry Alarm clock. Just then there was a woman so Austin Powers Punch's the woman and then sees a man in disguise from Dr. Evil just then he use a gun to shoot with a dart and it killed him so Dr. Evil escape from the Pussy Cat swingers club he was in a flying Big Boy. So just then Austin Powers was frozen in 1960s and defrosted in the 1990 to defeat Dr. Evil. There are more parts in this movie so you can watch the rest of the movie to see what happens.

		<fullReview>When "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" came out, no one saw it coming (although in retrospect, we should have, given Mike Myers's characterizations of English people on "Saturday Night Live"). The plot of course has hip Austin trying to stop dastardly Dr. Evil from taking over the world. But of course, the whole movie's an excuse to be crazy, making fun of the James Bond movies every step of the way. I don't know how they came up with some of that stuff (such as a certain Swedish-made product), but they did. All in all, it shows why the '60s were groovy, baby. And of course, the sequels got progressively sillier. Truly a modern classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Mike Meyers at his finest. It's not that the film sports witty or straight-out jokes or situations - it's all in the timing, the expressions - it's just plain cheekey baby! Ironic that it's an American (OK Meyers is Canadian) poking harmless fun at the English, yet the average American just can't appreciate it because they don't understand the English 60's-style humor that's used throughout the film. The English who can't laugh at themselves (myself not included) don't like it because they take the brunt of most of the jokes.If you watch this film and thought it was 'OK' - watch it again a few days later - then again and again. It get's funnier every time. I've lost count how many times (at least 70!) I've seen it and it still makes me laugh out loud, but the first time I watched it I didn't know really what to make of it all.There's something magical about this movie that was missing from the sequel - I hope that magic returns in Austin Powers III.10/10 - go buy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot describe how wonderful this film was. The story is admittedly daft, but the film itself is witty, sophisticated and hysterically stupid, while being fast, furious and fun as well. The humour is hilarious to the point of sides splitting, from the mocking of the fashion and musical style of the Swinging Sixties period, to countless references to 007, Matt Helm and Our Man Flint. And Austin's catchphrases?... groovy! The film looks amazing, with bright colourful sets and great costumes, and the soundtrack is funky. Then we have Mike Myers brilliant as Austin Powers(better than he was in Cat in the Hat anyway, the less said about that travesty the better), and hysterically over-the-top as the arch-nemesis Dr Evil, and Elizabeth Hurley fabulously sexy as Vanessa Kensington. Overall, wonderful film, better than I thought it would be. Shagadelic, baby! 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Intelligent Intelligence Spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has gained wide popular appeal, leading some to dismiss it as a lowbrow, sophomoric attempt; to be lumped in with Sandler and his ilk. But this is not the case.While Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery does contain it's fair share of (genuinely funny) sight gags and rude humour, it also succeeds comedically on a much higher level. The precision with which Myers simultaneously both satirizes and pays homage to the spy films of the sixties (including, but not limited to, the classic Bonds) and '60s swinger culture is uncanny. In both Dr. Evil and Austin, Myers creates rich, highly memorable characters whose personalities give rise to the film's humour; as opposed to the flat, one-dimensional characters that comedies are so often saddled with. As a screenwriter, Myers is both highly literate and well-read. His dialogue (both in its writing and its delivery) is classic: well-scripted, well-phrased and well-timed. While Myers undeniably carries the film, the supporting cast is also terrific. Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York and Robert Wagner all successfully bring their respective characters to life, and sparkle in their relationships with Austin and Dr. Evil, respectively.The pacing and direction are top-notch. Never does a scene drag on to the point of annoying the viewer, and the plot barely gives you time to catch your breath. The cinematography is above-average for a comedy; the special effects are a terrific mix of competent modern technology and perfectly understated vintage sixties film techniques (rear-projection, pasted-on gun flashes, etc.). The sets and costumes, similarly, are self-consciously true to the genre ("Do you like your quasi-futuristic clothes, Mr. Powers? I designed them myself."), which only adds to the movie's humour.All in all, this is a brilliant film, mixing in exactly the right proportions belly-laugh gags with a genuinely sly, subtle level of satire. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best spy spoofs ever made. Mike Myers stars as Austin Powers, a secret agent from the 1960s brought into 1997. He has been brought back to fight Dr. Evil (Myers again) who plans to take over the world. He uses Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) to help him. A very funny film with some good gags. Seth Green hardly does much, but he will later in the next two films. Austin Powers is stupid, but then again, so Dr. Evil. I can't decide who's funnier of the two. Austin's funniest moment is discovering the future, e.g. crossing off deceased people he admired, and testing at CDs and trainers. Dr. Evil's funniest moment is telling Scott (Green) to shh. Also starring Mimi Rogers as Mrs. Kensington, Robert Wagner as Number Two, Fabiana Udenio as Alotta Fagina (kinda like Pussy Galore) and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina. Look out for Burt Bacharach, True Lies' Tom Arnold, Christian Slater, Star Wars' Carrie Fisher and Rob Lowe! Mike Myers was number 46 on The Comedians' Comedian, and the film was number 4 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8th grade humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few real laughs. I smiled quite a few times, but most of the attempts at humor are so obvious that they are painful to watch. I can see junior high school boys thinking this to be a great movie, but adults? Come on. I certainly hope that this is not the best Mike Meyers can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Preferred The Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME . It was the first film in the series I saw which may possibly explain why I enjoyed the original a lot less . THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME cuts to the chase very quickly while AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY is held by the very obvious and necessary need to explain who the eponymous hero is . Of course it's silly to criticise the other aspects like " Oh there's no Fat Bastard in this movie etc " because it's my own fault for watching the franchise in the wrong order I can't help thinking however that the jokes are somewhat weaker here . I watched the movie on Sunday night and I'm having some difficulty in trying to remember the gags . There's two that stick out in my mind , one is the scene with Dr Evil's cat which will upset cat lovers everywhere ( I laughed out loud at this scene ) and the other is a visual gag that stands out in its unoriginality of a man walking about naked thatI first saw done in THE BENNY HILL SHOW thirty years ago and has been done to death since then Not a bad effort from Mike Myers but my gut instinct is that THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is the funniest movie in the series</fullReview>
