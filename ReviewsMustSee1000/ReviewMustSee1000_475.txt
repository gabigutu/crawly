		<shortDescription>The best underwater action film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the rarest of action films - one that engages your intellect not just your senses.On the seabed in mid-ocean a huge vessel is discovered. A team is dispatched to investigate - and what they find is beyond belief.Admittedly there were a couple of scenes which I felt missed the intended realism of the film, and occasionally it seemed far too obvious what was going on, but the ending resolved everything beautifully.I suspect that fans of action films will feel let down by the thought necessary to follow this film, and fans of science fiction may well feel that after the first half hour there is a lack of a traditional sci-fi element. Many people I'm sure will feel that too little is explained, but the point of the film is that it doesn't need to be - the message of the ending is strong enough that we don't need explanation.I'd particularly recommend this film to anyone who likes psychological thrillers. I was fairly impressed by the action integrated in The Abyss, but Sphere far surpasses it in terms of plot. Most of all, if you like films that simply entertain, this is not for you. It's more about the reactions it causes in you when you follow the story. If you come away from this film unchanged, you've missed the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly decent Crichton flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading many users' mixed comments on the movie..i can't help but feel that a majority have underrated the film. True it could have been better, especially in the latter half, but having read the book first, i did not feel it actually falling off midway like the way other viewers have described it. People who have read the novel will acknowledge that the movie does follow the novel fairly closely. Thus comments about Hoffman's role and the ending are unfair, since i feel they are the closest big-screen reproductions of one of Crichton's best works. I feel Stone's character was the role followed the weakest.Definitely the giant squid thrills are insufficient (note that Crichton devoted a good part of his novel describing encounters with 'the monster'). I guess animation artists were short budgeted...though the film as a whole still is a visual treat...and the atmosphere is rightly captured, with nice music.Overall, I think the movie is worth watching and is definitely of a much higher caliber than 'The Lost World'. It follows a psychological-cum-sci-fi thriller theme and i feel is better than the similar flick 'Abyss'. As from the novel's point-of-view...it could have been done better though. 8/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sphere ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sphere represents a new standard in science fiction. With a solid plot and good acting, it proves itself to be better than the stereotypical childish effects films. Director Barry Levinson provides great visuals that make the spooky underwater environment come alive. The film is a psycological mystery thriller that keeps you guessing to the very end. It has good dialogue and is more concerned with characters and their development than with cool looking ways of killing them off. Based on Michael Crichton's book, Sphere is a breath of fresh air in a genre that really needs it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First half is really good ? but quickly becomes a load of `spheres'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the military discover what they believe to be a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean they bring in Dr Norman Goodman who had once written a report on the protocol for an alien encounter. His report had named a team of experts ? this team is also assembled. The team descend to the craft and begin to find some astonishing things about the craft. However when they find a huge golden sphere they begin to experience problems. Problems that become worse when a storm traps them at the bottom of the ocean.With a cast like this ? you gotta have high hopes. With a director and a writer to match you deserve something fantastic! And for the most part this delivers. The build up is dark, mysterious and exciting. However once the sphere is found it goes downhill. It still has some really good moments ? the jellyfish bit is scary and other actions bits are cool. But it gets all muddled up in what the sphere is and who is doing what on the base. It almost manages to hold together until the final half hour then it all just collapses like a flan in a cupboard! It's a shame because for the most part it felt like it was building to something much better, but no.The cast promised much but didn't deliver. Jackson was great, but I don't think he can be bad ? even in a bad movie. Hoffman stutters around like he doesn't know what he's doing. I know he's meant to be playing a character that isn't used to heroics, but he doesn't bring anything. Stone is OK but at times looks like she reading her lines off a board. Coyote is OK and Schreiber is understated by his own hammy standards. It's also cool to see Queen Latifah in a role.Overall this is worth watching as for the majority it's real good. However you notice that the film has got 30 minutes left to go ? make your excuses and leave, by then you've seen the best it has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strangely disappointing adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel that comes off to a smashing good start but very quickly approaches a precipitous downhill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sphere is a science fiction film that starts off with a tremendously fascinating story and ignores all of the possibilities that it entails. Four people (you know the drill ? a psychologist (Dustin Hoffman), a mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), a biochemist (Sharon Stone) and an astrophysicist (Liev Schreiber)) are flown out to the middle of the ocean on a top-secret missions (even they don't know where they're going). We would be just as confused as they were about the details of their mission if we had never seen the previews, but even though we already know what they're going to find out there, it's just as interesting to learn about the details of this ship that has been found on the bottom of the ocean, and that appears to have been sitting there for 300 years (well, okay, 288). The story keeps getting better and better as we learn that there is a hum coming from the ship, indicating that there is still something running inside it, and then even more fascinating revelations once we are taken inside the ship. There can be no doubt that Sphere contains some truly interesting and entertaining elements, and that things like the acting are just as superb as we would expect from such a spectacular cast, but as the movie progresses, we begin to realize how little the film is going to reveal. I can't say that I wasn't completely enraptured for at the least the first hour of the film, but there were just as many bitterly disappointing things about it as there were good things. Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson, in particular, delivered absolutely brilliant performances in this film, delivering some of the best entertainment in the entire film by themselves. There is a mildly interesting but completely unconvincing ex-romantic tension between Sharon Stone's character, Dr. Beth Halperin, and Dustin Hoffman's character, Dr. Norman Goodman, that is there for little other reason than to complicate the lives of the characters as they try to solve the mystery of this undersea ship. (spoilers) It's really too bad that the movie completely falls on its face in the second half, because the first half of the film is excellent and undeniably entertaining. There's nothing like a bit of time travel and the suggestion of extraterrestrial life to keep you entertained, and it is definitely a great scene when we find out that the ship is a human ship. This is one of the many things in the film that really makes you think. The thing that makes a great film is that it inspires thought. This is probably the one thing that all of the great films have in common with each other. There are surely a lot of things about Sphere that really make you think, which is another reason that the first half of the film is so good. We see that it's a human ship, which opens a whole new area of possibilities for the film. Harry (Samuel L. Jackson) speculates on the fact that the last entry in the ship's log is an entry into an `Unknown entry event,' indicating that they will never reach the surface to reveal what they've found. There is also a possibly over-extensive excursion into the realm of the psychological element in the film, as the characters are all made to face their fears, some of which are not just your average fears, such as Harry's strange fear of finishing 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. The special effects are definitely nothing to brag about, but there are some interesting scenes that take place in the deep ocean, such as the death of Teeny Fletcher (hey, she's black, she had it coming, right?) in the midst of a mass of strange sea creatures, as well as the scene with the thousands of squid eggs. Weird looking things, I've wondered since I saw the film what kind of props they used for that scene. The conversation with `Jerry' is unfittingly childish, but there is definitely a significant element of tension introduced when Jerry gets mad, as well as the scene where Norman contemplated the implications of Jerry's expression of emotions, indicating his ability to get mad. There are undeniably a lot of interesting things about Sphere, and it surely has the power to entertain, but it goes off the track later in the film, maybe because it tried to answer too many of its questions. There are some unanswerable things in the film, and the movie deals with them by having the characters have a weakly-written discussion about their fears and questions, and their ultimate decision to `forget' what they know using the power that they seem to have gained from the sphere. While this answers the question of how it could have been an unknown entry event when they all made it to the surface, it's probably the weakest ending that the film could possibly have had. As a strange twist on the science fiction genre, Sphere succeeds, although only in the first half. Like Hollow Man, Sphere could have and should have been a much better film. The unfortunate fact about the film is that it contains a lot of very interesting and very entertaining things that are surely worth watching, but the disappointing ending almost makes them not even worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent! I went into the film thinking it would be bad, since that is what I had heard from someone before watching it.However, I was pleasantly surprised at what a terrific film this actually was. The only downfall to the film, was Dustin Hoffman. With all due respect to one of the best actors ever, he just wasn't suited for this particular role. He was good in it, but just not the right person for the job.The film begins with Dustin Hoffman flying over the Pacific Ocean in a helicopter, going to a Submarine investigating a plane crash. As a psychologist, he is impatiently waiting to speak to the survivors, and after having been on the sub for over 3 hours, is upset with the Capatain. However, the Captain informs him there was no plane crash, but rather an arrival of some sort not quite 300 years ago, under the Ocean.Sharon Stone, Leive Shreiber and Samuael L. Jackson join Hoffman as apart of his team, to go beneath the surface to discover and determine what it is exactly that they have found under the Pacific.With complete intensity and excitement non-stop throughout the entire film, it will leave you feeling a little disturbed at times, and perhaps a bit paranoid, also.I would advice anyone who does not have a liking to intense sci-fi type films...this is not going to be your cup of tea, but for those enjoy good horror, intensity and a great story line, you will definitely enjoy this flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy, sizzling horror sci-fi with excellent claustrophobic suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fourth Michael Crichton adaptation in line is quite a good one. After the blockbuster success of `Jurassic Park' and minor hits `Congo' and `The Lost World', `Sphere' matches up to theses levels. And with so much talent in store, it certainly is appealing. Academy Award winners Barry Levinson and Dustin Hoffman (who coincidentally won Oscars for the same film) and Oscar Nominees Sharon Stone and Samuel L. Jackson all headline the movie.The end result is relatively good, but with so much talent on board it could have been a bit better. However, the film succeeds in what attempts to do. There are ample scarifying chills along with a high enjoyability factor. The haunting suspense is soon followed by an equally chilling action. This is good because other chillers such as `The Sixth Sense' built up the suspense, but no action followed. For that film, the scares lost all their quality the second time round. But in `Sphere's' case, the suspense keeps its intensity every time.The film starts out very well whilst on the surface, but gradually it gets worse only to amount to a satisfying conclusion. The middle scenes aren't bad, but they're a bit too gloomy and eerie. Another quibble is the obvious lack of originality. The main plot of `Event Horizon', which was made the year before that, is quite similar to the plot of this. There are also bits and pieces of other science fictions such as `Alien' taken here and there. Luckily it takes the bests bits and leaves you on the edge of your seat. But the finished product isn't as nourishing as it should be. The plot can get complicated at times, but for the most part it's actually quite clever.And the glamorous cast of familiar faces insures that the movie never drags on. Dustin Hoffman is well cast as the calm, stable psychiatrist and makes a suitable lead. It's not her most challenging role, but Sharon Stone s believable as the kooky biochemist. She still hasn't received any tough roles after `Casino' though. The most complex character in the film, Samuel L. Jackson drops the usual machismo for some convincing scepticism and abnormal goofiness. The supporting cast including Leiv Shreiber, Queen Latifah and Peter Coyote do their parts adequately, not that they can do much with them.The directing is good as expected by a great director. Levinson beautifully creates the required intensity and the visuals are very impressive aswell. The glistering shimmer of the huge golden sphere of the title is a delight to gaze at.The stars flash and the plot sizzles. There are a few plot-holes that it falls into along with a bit of a sag in the middle. Nevertheless, `Sphere' is an impressive sci-fi horror that succeeds on almost every other level. My IMDb Rating: 6.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best movie I have seen in a long time. I first saw `Sphere' on the big screen when it first came out and I have rented it a few times and then went out and bought it on VHS. A little bit of the story for you-Dustin Hoffman plays the part of a psychologist and thinks he is going to counsel the survivors of a plane wreck in the ocean. There is more to the situation than Hoffman knows. At the supposed crash sight Hoffman teams up with Sharon Stone and Samuel Jackson as part of a top team of scientists assembled in high-priority situations. While under water the team finds the unexpected and their worst fears become reality. This movie is perfectly intriguing and very well written. The twists and turns in the movie fit together like puzzle pieces that paint the best psychological thriller that I have seen. Hoffman is of course at his best and Stone and Jackson are right there beside him the whole way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been a Great Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes (Peter Coyote) to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin (Sharon Stone); the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson); and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher (Queen Latifah) and Jane Edmunds (Marga Gómez). Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days, they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere?I saw "Sphere" on the late 90's but I did not like it. Yesterday I saw it again, now on DVD, and this time I found it a sci-fi with an intelligent story but with a terrible direction. The greatest problem are the characters that are unpleasant, unlikable and emotionally detached and without feelings. The situation of the fleet leaving the area due to a storm but without leaving a submarine in the area to give support to the group is also a great flaw in the story. This screenplay in the hands of Spielberg or James Cameron could have been a great film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Esfera" ("Sphere")</fullReview>

So often I watch movies and can easily predict everything that is going on, and how it is going to turn out. This movie is not that way. Great suspense from beginning to end, and it will leave you thinking when it is over.If the writers/producers were to tell all about the plot, the best part of the movie (not being exactly sure what is going on) would be ruined.As they talk to the ''unknown'' creature through the computer, this gives the movie a much more eerie feel.A must watch for anyone who likes movies.Rent it or buy it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great potential falls flatter and flatter as it goes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sphere (1998)Barry Levinson is one of those directors who has no interest in art, or in invention, or in pretension, either. And so his films sometimes hit a popular strain that makes them take off. He has some terrible misfires, for sure, but his best films ("Rain Man," "Sleepers") have people who you relate to, and who have to confront something extraordinary.That was the idea here, based on a Michael Crichton novel (that should have been a heads up). The cast is headliner stuff. Dustin Hoffman is particularly convincing, Samuel Jackson plays a great type, and Liev Schreiber is sharp. Sharon Stone is a dull fourth. They bond, and realize they have things in common, in the first minutes of the film as they converge and go under water to check out an alien spaceship. Even after they are deep below the surface and beginning their unlikely exploration they make a viewer connect. As much as it borrows from "Alien" and "Aliens" this could have been a good film on its own terms. Even the talking computer/alien has its own edge compared to HAL.What goes wrong is the plot itself, and not acting, or even directing, can overcome that. As it gets hairier, we need it to be more plausible, not less. Events get increasingly chaotic, so that action and loud noise drive some of the scenes. Subplots are continued but seem increasingly meaningless (at one point, Hoffman and Stone are rushing into the water in an absolute emergency and they start to chitchat about their distant failed love affair). And finally, as people die off and the menace becomes more ambiguous, the movie becomes completely ambiguous, and as a kind of escape valve, announces that any number of crazy thing we have been watching may or may not have been imagined by one character or another.But what does that mean about the camera? Isn't there still a differentiation between cinema reality and one character's delusion? Or if these are global delusions including the viewer, shouldn't they do more than simply disorient us? Well, don't hang on for answers. Just hang on. An explosion (of course) caps it all off (why they didn't hit the disarm button isn't explained), and a final logical wrap up that avoids the time travel paradox is warm and fuzzy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad dialogue, bad plot, bad filmography, awful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't bother.The writing is terrible - the characters' motives and actions make no sense whatsoever. As a viewer we are asked to accept so much incredibly bad stuff . . . yeah, it makes perfect sense that an 'alien' would communicate by mapping a keyboard onto a sphere and numbering the keys in a spiral fashion starting from the center. Perfect sense. Or that you could mistranslate 'My name is Harry' into 'My name is Jerry' but not mistranslate anything else that he was saying.Or how about the 'inevitable' conclusion that the fact nobody knows what happens in the future means that everyone died? I'd say it's a lot more likely that information of that nature would at the least be kept confidential, or (as they weakly wrapped up the plot) simply not spread beyond the surviving crew members Don't get me started on the other plot holes. What the hell happened to the dark-haired woman? Oh there's a noise outside. Huh, it's her dead body. What could have done this to her? NOBODY EVER KNOWS OR BOTHERS TO FIND OUT.And the dialogue was really awful too. 'You know me. I believe everything'. There were very few lines in this movie that sounded like a real person would ever speak them. Samuel Jackson's character was a mishmash of weirdness - he spent far too much of the movie seeming like some sort of evil agent of the sphere, when it turns out that he's just a raging idiot. Well played.What really bothers me is that underneath all this crap, is a halfway decent idea. I have not read Crighton's novel, for all I know it is tolerable or even decent. But whatever it is, this adaptation is absolutely godawful. I feel stupider for having watched it; I feel stupider for being a member of a race which has other individuals who would rate this miscarriage of filmography as anything other than utter dreck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplistic movie posing as an intellectual thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like a children's story. Full of illogical plot twists and the necessity for the audience to take ridiculous leaps of faith to justify what appears on the screen and the reactions of the character to the situations. There is no stimulus to think anywhere beyond the confines of the film... Other than the thought "what the heck is going on?". And in this case, that question arises for the wrong reasons. It simply fails to stay believable within the boundaries of the universe built for the story. Yes, there are suspenseful moments and some terrifying images, but even those moments are diffused by the knowledge presented in the film that 'all is not what it seems'. And this is the same story told many times before going all the way back to 'Forbidden Planet' and the 'monsters of the id'.The take-away from the movie is... your perception is your reality. And sometimes it's scary. Or is it: 'your perception is EVERYONES reality?" OMG that really make you think! ... NOT. I take offense to the reviews that suggest people who did not like this movie are intellectually challenged. If you found this movie to be stimulating to you intellectually.. may I also recommend 'The Berenstain Bear's and the Spooky Old Tree'... I'm sure that one will will have you on your toes the whole time and weeping for it's beauty at your next book club meeting.I know it's difficult to make a movie... and there was a great effort and much skill and intelligence put in to making 'Sphere'... It simply doesn't deliver on the entertainment nor intellectual fronts.</fullReview>

It was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen in relation to the cast. The script was written full of unnecessary dialogue and expressions, the sub-plots are horrible and far from believable, and the ending was absolutely miserable and anti-climactic. I have not read the book, and can only pray that this movie did it little to no justice. The only thing that brought me out of my misery after watching this was watching the film Dead Snow. Again, considering it stars Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson, I feel this film has no redeeming qualities, as it is not even worth watching to make fun of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, sadly miscast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have written about this film in the past under another moniker, and decided to give it another go under my current name. "Sphere," which tanked at the box office, is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a mysterious object found in a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean. Dustin Hoffman plays a shrink who is enlisted by the government, in the form of Peter Coyote, to lead a team to examine the spaceship. Once inside, they find the stranger artifact, a simple sphere. What they find in time is that the thing allows those who come into contact with it to manifest their thoughts into reality. Nuff said about the plot. The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining, as we only know what the shrink and his team know. The second half is an utter dog. Looks like they rushed production, scrimped on the special effects, and generally made a mess of what might been another "2001." Hoffman is all wrong for his role, and Sharon Stone as his ex-wife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's "Event Horizon," which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's "The Abyss" over this, as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let fear get to you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of the movie Sphere is about the power that the human subconscious holds over us. The subconscious controls what we fear and what we think. Your fears can become reality is you really believe they exist. The Law of Attraction is that we create our own realities. Positive thoughts bring positive results and negative thought bring negative results. The new movie Green Lantern with Ryan Reynolds, which is due to come out soon, shares the same theme about fear. Your fear will ultimately get you so get it together and get past your fears. The movie Sphere is a science fiction movie. It is about the discovery of a 300 year old space craft that crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The space craft was found lying on the ocean's bottom, still fully intact and sonar is picking up a humming sound coming from it. A crew is sent down to investigate. The crew consists of a psychologist, Norman (Dustin Hoffman), a biochemist, Beth (Sharon Stone), the captain of the ship, Harold (Peter Coyote), a mathematician, Harry (Samuel Jackson) and an astrophysicist, Ted (Live Schreiber). The crew makes its way inside the spacecraft and finds a decomposed human body and the electronics in the space craft were still working so hence the humming sound. They also encounter a metal sphere. I believe the sphere is supposed to represent the human subconscious. Norman, Beth and Harry enter the permeable metal sphere at various times. The theme was evident in the scenes were after the three had been in the sphere there were attacks from the creatures that each of the three feared. Harry who was afraid of squid was attacked by a giant squid. Beth who was afraid of jelly fish was attacked and stung by jelly fish. Norman who was afraid of snakes was attacked by a giant snake. Sphere, being a science fiction movie, had numerous special effects throughout with explosions, and fires. The movie, which is supposed to be set mostly under water used special lighting effects to make the audience feel like they were in a dark sub. Camera angles during the attacks were good and took the viewer into the action when the Norman, Beth and Harry were being attacked by the creatures they feared. When Norman, Beth and Harry exited the sphere they exited with special powers. At the end they chose to get rid of those special powers in order to live normal lives. Watch the movie to find out what the special powers were that they got from the sphere. And in the meantime "imagine what you will and you can have it," even fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sphere is another film adapted from author Michael Crichton. His previous novels that have turned into films are Jurassic Park, Disclosure and The Lost World. Sphere would sit somewhere in the middle of the films in terms of watching a good film. Granted Jurassic Park would be the best, but the other three would be depending on what mood I was in at the time.Sphere has a decent premise, but also one that we have all seen before. It begins with a psychologist Norman Goodman (Hoffman) being flown out to sea for a so-called airplane crash. However when he gets there he is greeted by military sergeant Barnes (Coyote), who informs him that it isn't an airplane but a spaceship that has been buried in the coral of the sea for three hundred years. Norman has been brought on board after a report he wrote years ago regarding the possibility and what to do upon meeting an alien being. This report was taken seriously and the military are using it as their bible, so they felt it was necessary to bring the people Norman recommended in his report to be part of a first contact team. This team are biochemist Beth Halperin (Stone), mathematician Harry Adams (Jackson) and astrophysicist Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber), all people Norman has known from the past through being patients, students or lovers. Hint Stone was his lover he was not homosexual.The crew are sent out to the depths of the ocean to investigate this space craft, but it turns out that Norman has no idea what he should be doing as in fact his report was a fake and he simply added the names of people he knew. It was a job he couldn't turn down as it was worth a lot of money. Upon telling a few of the team it becomes aware to him that he will have to wing his way through this expedition and get himself back up to the surface as fast as he can.The team enter the spaceship and upon exploring they realise that it is an American spaceship and the only conclusion is that it was in space collecting alien artefacts and was sucked into a black hole, propelling them into the past. It is a ship from the future. Also on board is a giant, gold sphere; the artefact that the astronauts' brought back from space. As they begin to investigate the sphere they realise that it has a strange effect on them all and their worst fears begin to come to life. To make matters worse a storm has begun on the surface and it is unsafe for them to resurface so they are stuck, a thousand feet below the sea facing an alien sphere that can manifest their greatest fears.The film probably sounds a lot more interesting than it actually is. I was quite interested in it and the first half of the film really had me hooked and I was intrigued into what was going on. Unfortunately though the film suddenly descended into predictability and stupidity. The entire script wasn't great but the second half was as if someone new entirely had written it. I was suddenly frustrated at it as we had repetitive lines between the leads as they accused the others of going in the sphere. It was overlong and should have been nipped in the bud a lot earlier. Also the ending is such a copout it is frustrating. I was expecting a nice twist ending to wrap up the poor second half but it never happened, and what we got was a cheesy, poor CGI mess. After a strong start the film really did nose dive.The acting is erratic. I can't really decide if it was good or not. At some points I thought yes and at others I was completely negative. Stone doesn't have the most interesting character or performance, considering she has an interesting back story that never really gets explored. Jackson starts poor, gets better, than has three, maybe four changes of character and then returns to poor and Hoffman seemed to want to do more but couldn't. All I could see was his character from Rain Man and I was surprised when he spoke normally. The acting front seemed very lethargic and it was as if they were trying to make sense of the plot in the second half as much as we were.I did enjoy the first half of the film, but it completely lost me in the second half and I'm a little disappointed at the end product. By all accounts Hoffman himself believed that the film wasn't delivered at its full potential when it was released and criticised it for this. Dustin, I can see where you are coming from. It was an alright film that plummeted quickly, but if it had kept up with the suspense from the first half it could have been an even better watch. Oh and don't worry I was also frustrated by the chapter headings that came up every now and again. Something that was very unneeded. 2.5 / 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts well then ... a pale imitation of something, but I don't know what</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What caught my eye was seeing Dustin Hoffman's face starring at me from the DVD cover of a film which was obviously along the lines of a blockbuster. Well, I have a great deal of respect for Mr Hoffman and can't remember seeing a bad will in which he starred, so Sphere got the nod. And for the first half of the film, it still got the nod. It was intriguing, some great amusing lines which promised quite a bit and there's was suspense galore, and I really did want to find out what was going on. And then - what? What on earth were they thinking? It just nose-dived into a heap of confused, confusing, low-budget, faux philosophical codswallop you could ever hope not to see. Was this not apparent to anyone before it was released. The intriguing mystery wasn't sold but merely allowed to dribble away like so much used bathwater. This is really not worth your while unless you don't mind being disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many things can be put up with while watching a mediocre movie. The storyline can be weak, the acting can be poor etc. etc....But besides that a movie must be able to tell a story by cinematic methods. This movie lacks this basic virtue: - We don't see any details that will make us feel surrounded by the environment and the events (and I don't mean the film set which is very good)It feels like some machinist in an open summer theater cut off some burned parts and aired it still... - The sphere which gives the movie its name is totally irrelevant and dim as an entity, rather than mysterious. We rarely see it, hardly feel it, its existence is not cinematographical but based on people's dull conversations. People don't really analyze it and when they do, it feels like the song "We are the world" - Conversations are so bad that the 3 big actors don't have the space to act. I also kinda felt that during the shootings they were kinda uneasy about something; I don't think they committed themselves. - Although the effects were nice, the camera failed to focus on them properly. I don't care about the budget: this is totally unacceptable in a SF movie. There are artistic ways of evading expensive scenes! - Despite the 2-hour length of the movie, the depth of characters or their backgrounds is not conveyed sufficiently. - SF is often about trying to find reasons/explanations for what the hell is happening in general or in a specific scene. You can forget this privilege in this movie.One last thing: If anyone is comparing this movie with "The Abyss", I suggest him to get a life.........in a far away land where there is no internet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Sphere centers around a sphere of unknown origins and presents the possibilities no sci-fi has ever thought of. What if we whatever we dreamed came true? That is basically what the movie is about. But what is really awesome about Sphere is that it leaves a lot to the imagination, which movies now never do. The actors could not have been chosen any better. Dustin Hoffman is the best out of him, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L. Jackson. They all did great but Dustin Hoffman proves himself once again that even in his older years he can do action and science fiction. I really liked this movie and it couldn't have been any better. The only flaw I could tell was that the movie strayed from the book a little each time. But overall this movie is great and everyone should see it in my opinion.love,me Carolyn</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I would comment on this one, because I thought it was one of the most God-awful movies to come out in 1998. It is by far the worst Michael Crichton-based movie yet. Perhaps it's because I had high hopes (the book is one of my favorites), but I cannot remember the last time I saw a movie as jarbled, disorganized, and ultimately non-interesting as this one.This is a special effects movie with no special effects. The most high-tech shots are the opening credits, for God's sake! The plot requires (spoiler warning) an underwater habitat, a gigantic submerged spaceship, a humongous alien sphere, several underwater creatures and finally a giant squid attack. All of these elements are handled with incredible incompetence. The habitat is filled entirely with grey---the navy is smart enough to put color in habitats like this, to keep people from going crazy. Nobody wants to spend much time in a place like this, especially a movie audience. The squid attack is so bad its laughable---we never see the squid! Imagine the T-Rex scene in Jurrasic Park if it began with a tree shaking and then stopped. In Sphere, we basically get a blip on the radar screen, then the camera moves around a lot.The writers try to remain faithful to the plot, but get so many critical points wrong that the whole things falls apart long before we see any squids. Its almost as if they read certain chapters of the book, then tried to guess what the rest was about. The final act, when all is explained, made perfect sense to me in the book, but in hopelessly incomprehensible in the movie. And the ending takes a *major* turn from the book---what was that about! I have no trouble when movies make intelligent changes from their inspirations, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.Barry Levinson is a good director, and I'm sure he will make a better movie some day. Perhaps he should stick to comedy. Or perhaps he thought he would need to do a big-budget movie to go along with the indie hit Wag the Dog. Either way, he gets a crucial point wrong here: What made the book Sphere so compelling to read wasn't squids or jellyfish, but our fascination with the Sphere itself---Where did it come from? What is its purpose? Neither the book nor the movie answers those questions completely, but the difference is the movie never seems to care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the hell did this flop?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not your average dumb popcorn movie, so audiences stayed away, apparently. Making them think gets them nervous - that's my only explanation, because Sphere is a great psychological sci-fi thriller.SPOILERS!!Not everything fits together (why exactly does Sharon Stone decide to go in the Sphere? And if they have this great power why can't they magic themselves top-side or stop the explosives?) but the story remains suitably grounded and tense throughout, with some nice FX work that doesn't rub your face in CGI.The time-travel stretch may alienate some viewers (no pun intended) but I thought it a nice little joke that something circular (the Sphere) comes back around to the beginning of the story, creating a time loop. Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean. Underrated and flawed, Sphere is still a decent sci-fi with some nice performances from Stone and Hoffman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was good for coming from a book because hardly anyone ever stays with the book. Levinson did a great job of leaving some of the creatures to our imaginations as Crichton did in his book. I think everyone acted superbly, well except for Sharon Stone who couldn't act her way out of a bag. Dustin Hoffman was awesome as usual and so was Samuel L Jackson. (Can you tell I am little bias towards Dustin Hoffman but hey I think he's the best actor to appear on the big screen or any screen for that fact). The movie has funny parts and some scary parts that still make me jump. I like science fiction and this movie ranked very high with me. Rather it be because of Dustin Hoffman of Michael Crichton's book. It's still a cool movie anyone can see. I liked it.love,me Carolyn</fullReview>

When you want to go out and become an actor, or spend months creating and directing a film, then I will gladly accept your critiscisms. But, if you're like me (Come on, admit it), you're not stupid, but you spend all your time in front of your computer. Some of you are worse than me. You all need to get out more.Anyway, about the film. This was an AMAZING book. The premise is terrifying. It was well crafted, well writen, and the only book that I have ever HAD to finish. The film was GOOD. I'm not saying it wasn't. But it really didn't follow the book as well as some people say. Sure, the premise was the same, but the book had many additional sequences and plot-hole fillers. When I watched this movie, I had already read the book, but that didn't make it any worse. I was on the edge of my seat. It was like a whole different experience.The acting was NOT bad! The acting was very good. They're SUPPOSED TO BE DEADPAN! That's part of the plot.Overall, a very good movie! But don't take my word for it! Go out and rent this movie. Make your own judgement. Don't let these spoil sports ruin a good, FUN, night for you. And get it on DVD, if you can. The underwater sequences are amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book sphere, by Michael Crichton, is excellent. The movie on the other hand, falls short. The film of course, doesn't follow the book exactly, like all book-to-movies, however, it does follow pretty closely, considering. Dustin Hoffman fits into PERFECT character. He plays his character just like the book plays him. Quiet. Not very excitable. Samuel L. Jackson, was also good. However, my casting flaw would be Sharon Stone. She's horrible, not playing her character at all well. However, for some reason people don't like this movie, even despite Sharon Stone and some other flaws. I watched this before the book, so I don't like it because I read the book. I like this film before I read the book. So, I don't get why people don't like SPHERE. I mean, sure it's not great, but it's entertaining enough on a friday/saturday night to watch along with some popcorn. Give this film a break. Rent it.....I'm sure you won't be too dissapointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It will have your attention but it's too psychological for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Crichton, a science-fiction novelist and screenplay writer for several of his own adaptations has had many of his ideas become successful and iconic pieces in cinema. The best of Mr. Crichton's work is by far everyone's favorite prehistoric predator film, Jurassic Park (1993). That and Westworld (1973) twenty years before. There's something about Crichton's work that has many of the same motifs that show up in a lot of his other written works. One of the most notable elements is the discovery of a new science by humans and it ends up becoming more than humanity can handle. Re-emphasizing this again is in this Crichton adaptation that went largely unnoticed. Was it because it was bad? No but as a final product, there's a lot left to be desired with this sci- fi thriller.The story to this movie is about a group of doctors in different fields that travel to the bottom of the ocean to analyze a UFO that has something mysterious inside. The mysterious plot device that's inside the ship is a giant perfectly shaped golden sphere. After visiting it, strange things begin occurring on the ship and it's up to the small crew to figure it out. Directed by Barry Levinson (who has produced other Crichton adaptations) shows that he has competent direction in how he wanted the story to play out. Yet his pair of writers didn't seem to know how to make it work to the fullest extent. The writers on board for this production were Stephen Hauser (which was his only credit) and Paul Attanasio. Both of which flesh out the characters and do create some high-strung tension scenes with minor psychological elements but when it comes to explaining the orb, they miss it almost entirely.The underwater crew is made up of Dustin Hoffman (a psychiatrist), Sharon Stone (a biochemist), Samuel L. Jackson (a mathematician) and Liev Schreiber (a doctor in physics) and two operators; Peter Coyote and Queen Latifah. Of these characters, only Latifah (who has a minor role) seemed slightly out of place; all the rest act fine in their roles. That means distinctive personalities and charms. The actor who viewers would probably find the most likable is Hoffman who has a knack for being mostly nonchalant through each situation he's put into. I guess shrinks are supposed to be this calm? Not sure, but it gives him the right amount of charm. The connection these characters have is that they were all associated with Hoffman's role. Funny how popular 80s singer Huey Lewis even had a small scene stealing moment at the beginning of the movie. Random but a treat.The sphere plot device is also a treat when things start rolling (pardon the pun). However, this is exactly when the problems begin to arise. In order for strange events to happen, there's got to be reasons to back up and justify these moments. For this case, there is only one explanation given amongst a slew of other questions that go unanswered. One thing that really threw me off was when Hoffman's character discovers a cabinet worth of a specific item. Who stocked that thing? I could see if it was a mind game or hallucination but it was for real. Tell me who had the time to do that? I have to admit, moments like those will keep its audience guessing and with Hoffman's character being a shrink, the psychological aspect to the film does help make the tenseness quite intellectual. The only problem is that parts of it only theorized possible reasons but never gave definitive solutions. These of which were all based on observation.The only other negative part to the presentation of this movie is how it deliberately splits up its acts into chapters. There is no need, for two reasons. One being that, the audience will figure out when the next act is because each "chapter" if you want to call it that fades out to black. The other reason is that giving a title for the next sequence can somewhat spoil the upcoming surprising scene that audiences may not see coming. Instead, audiences are presented with giant bold print stating exactly what's headed their way. Why go through the trouble of shooting yourself in the foot like that? But enough on that, the last bits of the film still work in its favor. This belongs to the cinematography shot by Adam Greenberg (The Terminator (1984) and Rush Hour (1998)) and the music composed by Elliot Goldenthal. Since Greenberg has been the director of photography before for bigger projects, he shows that can effectively conceal the illusion during the underwater scenes. As for music, Goldenthal who isn't always the most memorable actually surprises this time. That means creating themes for certain aspects of the film, which includes creepy piano keys and quite wondrous sounding strings. It really stuck.The film has competent acting, cinematography, music, interesting psychological elements thrown in and some tense thrills. However, the writing sorely lacks in clearing up much of the plot device that is directly involved in the story other than giving a small assumption only based on observation. That and the chapter segments are a bit unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power to actualize your thoughts and fears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sphere" (1998) is about the discovery of a huge spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean and the humming, maybe living, sphere found inside. A team of scientists are sent down to investigate ? a psychologist (Dustin Hoffman), a mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), a biochemist (Sharon Stone) and an astrophysicist (Liev Schreiber). Two notable characters at the station on the ocean floor are played by Peter Coyote and Queen Latifah. Mystery and (some) horror ensue.Based on Michael Crichton's novel, "Sphere" intermixes elements of other scif-fi flicks, like "Forbidden Planet" (1956), "Solaris" (1972), "Alien" (1979) and "The Abyss" (1989). Like those movies, the plot involves a small group of people who are isolated from society and encounter the unknown. The theme is the actualization of one's thoughts and fears and the potential for good or, more likely, bad that comes with it. Are we mature enough as a species to handle such power? Of course, we already have this power, just not to the degree depicted in the story (seemingly). Anything important that we do, whether productive or destructive, is formulated within first and then manifests without, like a song or a book or a loving relationship. If we truly knew the power at our disposal we'd hardly be able to sleep at night we'd be so excited! The first hour or so is quite good because the film definitely makes you feel like you're at the bottom of the ocean. The mystery is engaging and the actors formidable. Unfortunately, some parts of the second half don't work so well. The sea snake scene, for instance, is really weak, particularly the way Stone's character responds to the situation. It seemed more like a dream than reality and maybe that's what the director (Barry Levinson) was shooting for, a cross between reality and nightmare, but it comes across wrong. Lame parts like this destroy the illusion of the movie. As far as the ending goes, it features tricky material that's not easy to pull off and the movie's only half-successful with it. The fact that it's somewhat successful is largely due to having great actors. They pulled it off.Despite the rushed vibe of parts of the second half, the theme is great. This isn't a slasher-film-in-space, like "Alien," but is more thought-provoking, which isn't to say it's as good. However, there are some harrowing and creative aspects, like the jelly fish sequence.While many lambaste "Sphere," it wasn't the box office dog you might think in light of the bad press. It made $37 million (in 1999 dollars) in the USA alone, which is hardly a clunker. The problem was that it cost twice that to make.The film runs 132 minutes.GRADE: B- QUESTIONS ON THE THEME (***Don't read further unless you've seen the film***) Why is it that the dark side of the human subconscious is empowered by the alien technology/entity? Why not the positive side? The four scientists (and the others) strike me as quality souls who pretty much have it together. While not perfect human specimens, they're strong people who have their phobias and destructive emotions under control. So why aren't their GOOD, PRODUCTIVE thoughts &amp; desires manifested rather than the bad? I could see if the story took place in a prison and the characters were pieces of sheet, but that's not the case.Also, who or what does the sphere represent? The Fountain of Life (Psalm 36:9)?</fullReview>

That's not what Belcher's sea snakes look like. That's a lot like what caecilians look like. Belcher's sea snakes are beautiful blue and black or blue and silver snakes. But those look very creepy in the movie. Maybe that's why or partly why they had them look like that. I don't think the time travel idea makes any sense but that doesn't ruin the effectiveness of the movie on an entertainment level. The music is very good in it too. I wonder why that woman looked at those jellyfish and said this isn't one of God's creatures. That's a great line but if that were real I think she would have just assumed it was an unknown to science species. They looked like Pacific sea nettles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: this review is of the movie, not the novel. The novel is pretty good; you can add it to your to-read list. The movie? well, its not something I'd put on your to-watch list.)In the (original) Andromeda Strain, a group of scientists, lead by Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill), a wise, brilliant bacteriologist -- who thought up and oversaw the "Wildfire" facility and the recruitment of the other members -- try to puzzle out an alien threat.Now imagine that Jeremy Stone was a moron. He might write a plan like "Wildfire" for the government that was absurd in its premises, procedures, and selection of people. For mankind's first contact with aliens, he selects an astrophysicist, a biologist, mathematician, and a psychologist. Let's never mind that those are pretty terrible selections (a human psychologist to deal with an alien intelligence? An astrophysicist *and* a mathematician? How about, I don't know, a materials specialist? Or maybe more than just four people?), let's move on to the idea that the government would, in the midst of greatest event of the millennium, dust off this lame brained plan and follow it to the letter (including his example personnel), because they didn't have any better ideas.Beyond that, we have very similar items - disparate people brought together in secret, working cut off from the outside world, mysterious deaths, alien menace, explosive ending danger to all the survivors, slam-bang discovery of the threat from an unexpected quarter. Its Andromeda Strain, but with Larry, Moe, Curly and Shemp.In the DVD commentary, Hoffman and Jackson make a lot of reference to how the director and actors improvised a lot of what was going on (for instance the whole Beth/Norman thing being made up on the spot.) Pretty much every deviation from the novel is awful, and builds to a horrendous, shouting, incomprehensible mess where characters pretty much literally just thrash around screaming to crashing music -- to make sure the audience knows to start collecting their stuff, because the credits are coming soon.? and by the way, if they were gonna forget everything and the power, so nobody would ever know what was down there (the whole "unknown event" thing) -- what about them tapes in the mini sub?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the kind of film that has a very interesting topic and a very original idea, but leaves us with a certain feeling of disappointment and that we wished more. The way it is filmed, the dialogues, the characters and the actors are pretty much standard, not original. I'd say the first half of the movie is even uninteresting. Another bad point is the music I'd say, which is just omnipresent in the movie. And this is one of the aspects of the movies (especially American ones) that annoys me. When it looks like they try to control our emotions by putting dramatic music in the action scenes and quiet tunes in love scenes. I hesitated a long moment if I would put a six or a seven on this movie. Because I just love the plot and the second half of the movie. At this point the story gets so much interesting and mysterious. I think they could have done a way, way better film with this plot. Oh and by the way the ending is just ridiculous, when they hold their hands and kinda 'pray', I was like: oh my god, this is just WRONG..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sphere is a science-fiction/horror film based on the book by Michael Crichton of the same title. Now, I have not read the book, but in my opinion films based on books or vice versa should not be compared to the source material. Reading the book makes you prejudiced against the picture. It's either better or worse than the book, you don't judge the film as an independent work.Sphere is about a team of scientists who are gathered by the US government to investigate a mysterious spaceship found at the bottom of the pacific ocean. It soon transpires that the ship has been there for more than 300 years. As they explore it they discover a mysterious sphere, and as they study it strange things start to happen.I won't spoil the story too much, but there is a really interesting concept here involving time travel and first contact with alien technology, and they completely ruined it. Soon after they discover the sphere the plot descends into complete nonsense and remains that way until the end.The acting on the other hand is superb, not that you could expect any less from an all star cast with Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone. The characters are well developed and the drama is believable.Sphere is a tense film, and despite the dissatisfying plot it keeps you watching and there are some good jump moments. The editing is done well and the underwater cinematography is great.All in all sphere is a film that, in my opinion, has a plot with a lot of potential that gets lost halfway through, but remains enjoyable though good direction and solid acting. If you like sci-fi horror and are looking for something a little different I suggest you give this a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that Barry Levinson succeeds where others have failed. For instance, he has succeeded in making Sharon Stone appear to have no sex appeal. Even more impressive he has succeeded in making Samuel L Jackson appear anaemic. This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first.The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens.On the other hand?.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it?Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers??.So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally? DOH! And then, how come they take precisely 1 second to crack the conceptually difficult code? One critic I read suggested that this film is a cheap rate version of Solaris. He (or she) was wrong. This film is actually a cheap rate version of Forbidden Planet. Solaris was a very subtle exploration of how human psychology can be affected by alien intelligence. Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the ending of the movie Sphere says to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I'll have to read the original novel to see what some of the other writers are talking about. As far are a si-fi movie goes I think Sphere was average, nothing really great. By the end of the film I was wondering, as apparently many others were, how the characters were going to resolve the key (to me)comments by the character Harry that none of them were going to survive. I think the ending does answer this, however, in a way totally different than I thought of. As I reflect on the dialog I recall a question from Harry to Norman about whether he believes in God. Norman says something about being a "functional atheist". The end of this film says to me what the creation story in the bible says, basically, that we are to trust the creator and not to assume the creator's role because we haven't the stuff to handle the job. Perhaps a bit like the Jim Cary movie Bruce Almighty. Beth, Harry and Norman are allowed to go free because they are willing to admit that they have gotten into something they can't handle. The sphere also is freed by their decision because they have renounced the ability to "play God". Finally, whatever they might tell the "authorities" is of no real consequence because the authorities won't believe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I concur with Mr. Flaxman that the movie does not live up to one side of the book (Dustin Hoffman was too nice, actually). Another side, however, the scenery, was astonishingly close to what I created in my mind when reading the book. That doesn't happen very often. Obviously this is impossible to describe, but for starters the terror was always kept out of view making them much more exciting than if they had been computer rendered all over the place. Exciting, stunning yet somehow unresolved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating build right to the last second... in the nature of great SF.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie only got better as it went along. Rather than collapsing at the last half hour, I thought it went beyond what a normal Hollywood film would do, explaining each detail, paying off all the mysterious and horrific plants earlier in the film, raising questions all the way about human nature and our own fears and dreams. Like great SF novels, it dove into human morality and presented its own answer to the intriguing premise.I accidentally started watching this movie on TV starting midnight, and it kept me up till three. The story overwhelmed the picture for me, but that doesn't mean the visuals aren't great. Even with a 4:3 TV presentation, the grandeur of the giant fin of the spaceship and the utter perfection and awe of the sphere come across beautifully, with the help of a decent score. The maturity of the look and effects of the film actually surprised me, as I was expecting a spoiled version of what one could only imagine. Yet, as a smart director, he chose to keep everything very subtle, showing only glimpses of radar and dark mystified environments.Even if it's only because I'm a great fan of science fiction, this is a film to be seen again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie some years back and while most of the things I had heard about this movie were negative, it was interesting in parts. Unfortunately, the film goes from being interesting to becoming one big letdown as things are revealed and much discussions abound. The film stars Dustin Hoffman, Samuel Jackson and Sharon Stone...three fine actors who add to this film. However, the film features just about no one else after a certain point in the movie and that is the beginning of the big letdown. The story has a discovery of a ship of some sort down rather far underwater. Well a team of scientist and that sort are sent to investigate. Well they board the ship at some point and discover the sphere of the title and soon after many strange things begin to happen and at times it seems like a horror movie, or a less horror filled movie than "Event Horizon" though I am not sure which of the two films was released first. Some good effects here and there as well as some bad ones. Good dialog here and there, but a lot of lame stuff as well. I am guessing the book had a bit more depth than this film, but I would have hated to read the book if it kind of became a bore near the end like this film became.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sphere : The Problems !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Expectation" OK, when I hear that Renny Harlin, Tony Scott, or John McTiernan is making a sci-fi thriller then I'll wait for one well-made flick to entertain. But when Barry Levinson is mentioned ! Then, I'll feel strange at first, then craving, because it might be hot movie yet with meaning this time. Though, after watching Sphere, your high expectation must go down, feeling the bad irony between what you were thinking, and what ? whatever ? they were thinking !! "The Casting"Simply Hoffman, Jackson, and Stone got nothing to do with each other. There is absolutely No chemistry between the 3 of them. That was ideal to define disharmony in a movie's cast. "The Shooting" It was a troubled location for sure. Stone told in a TV show that Hoffman came one day with pages he wrote about rewriting the story and he shared them out (attitude suits leftist in manifestation). So, it's obvious how the things were tense enough there ! "This Script !"Firstly the clarification : it was a spaceship from the year 2043, then it traveled accidentally through time to end up into the ocean in 1709. Then they discovered it after 288 years in 1997. Ahhh ! I just wanted to clear that up, at least for me ! Well, the movie confines itself in this labyrinth of vagueness for lengthy detailed time, and then becomes a weird slasher movie for the rest ! This is classic example for the dominion of the vague and thrilling events over the meaning, any meaning, these events could have or lead to. So it was strange when at only the last 3 minutes the whole thing transformed (really forced) into a movie about facing your fear and the power to forget and starting over (and maybe needing the others to complete that too). That seemed eventually like a philosophical hocus pocus to tell you the truth !"The Regret"We have a proverb in Egypt that says "the one who's afraid of the demon, is the one who meets him". Actually this movie could've been a great story about what'd happen when all of us get to meet our inner demons, so the other's as well, all at once ! That could be great basis for original movie. But sorry. This movie was original but not great. "The Remains"The good psychoanalysis of the characters (things you wouldn't find in any typical sci-fi movie). Some serious thought provoking tattle "if they didn't tell about that in the future, then we didn't tell about it !". The movie's solid vagueness; it's the movie's main goods, representing good mystery indeed (however for too long time to uninteresting extent !). A slight parody of the famous dinner's scene of (Alien ? 1979). Watching Hoffman in a sci-fi thriller and seeing Sharon's bob hair-do; she was exceptionally cute in this! "The Horror"At that phase it was common that seeing a Sharon Stone's movie means seeing her naked! In fact, and in one of the most awful ironies ever, all what I've got was seeing Samuel L. Jackson naked..UGH !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously limp, big-budget dud. Want to watch five people shout at each other on the ocean floor? Anyone who claims this is intelligent science fiction is unaware that anything thoughtful in this movie was stolen from 2001 (when it's not stealing from The Shining). The unthoughtful parts (most of the movie) are the same as every other shallow blockbuster. It's second half is howlingly bad, as no one involved knows how or why to keep the balls in play once they've been tossed. Sphere has no answers for the questions it keeps asking, joining a long line of similar movies (Flatliners, Event Horizon, The Black Hole, Hellraiser etc). At the ninety minute mark, by which point any other movie has successfully involved you and is concluding, this movie still hasn't even engaged you.It's depressing to consider the thousands of people who took home very good paychecks making this movie. All those dollars didn't purchase enough thought to produce two minutes worth filming. I can only imagine that major actors were willing to sign on to a project like this because, since this brand of sci-fi has nothing to show us, it gave them major screen time to admire themselves. Half the actors can't even pronounce the word "sphere," instead going with 'spear.' Nothing will prepare you for the meaninglessness of this flop. Sphere just doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible written and acted sci fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a train wreck. Despite the heavy weight actors, this Sci Fi "thriller" is anything but thrilling. Dustin Hoffman offers one of the worst performances of his career; mumbling his lines with an emotionless, bored expression the entire movie. He appears to be almost sleep walking through his scenes. I like Hoffman, but the only reason I can see why he wasn't fired one week into production, is that the studio was banking on his name to draw unfortunate victims to this sad excuse for entertainment.While Stone is perhaps the weakest actor in the group, she at least shows a little life here and there. However, it is laughable how she often appears to be making up her lines on the spot during many scenes; literal stuttering to find the works to say. Hoffman also appears to be rambling and ad-libbing many times in the movie.Jackson's character is just plain stupid. He sleeps and reads through most of the movie, even while everyone is about to be killed by some unknown evil. While the rest of the actors stumble through there silly lines, he sleeps and reads on and on. When he wakes up from his many naps, someone new is dead, but he could hardly care less. No explanation is ever giving for his strange behavior (which his crew mates hardly notice). His odd behavior suddenly disappears at the end of the movie, since at that point we all know that his strangeness was just a bad red herring.So, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the special effects are rather amateurish. However, the real culprit in this stupid movie is the script; one of the worst ever written. At times I wondered if there even was a script, because as mentioned before, the actors appear to be making it up as they go, and doing a poor job of it at that.Here is an example of the scary action in this taut thriller - Hoffman, after swimming through water so cold he would be in a hypothermic coma in real life, he shuffles listlessly to a door - attempts to open the door once, twice, three times. Hummm, door won't open. Blank look on his face as he and us stare at the nonworking door. Oh, what's that? We hear Stone screaming from a manhole on the other side of the room - Does Hoffman spring into action to save his friend from the terror? No, he slowly turns from the door and shuffles over to the manhole, where he stares down the hole with his typical blank look on his face. Next scene, there is Stone, no longer screaming. No, we are never told why she was screaming (and Hoffman is apparently so bored that he forgets to ask).Later in the film Hoffman asks Stone an important question. She doesn't answer, so he asks again. No response at all, so he asks again (mumbling his lines like he does through the whole movie). Finally she just flips him off and leaves the scene. Maybe the middle fingers weren't in the script and Stone was just expressing her frustration at Hoffman's poor acting.This movie does have one major highlight in that it has perhaps the most ironic event ever to be put on film - At the movies end, the survivors decide to use some special powers to erase their memories of what occurs to them during the movie. If only the movie's audience had the same power to forget that they wasted two hours on this trash.Why can't Hollywood make good Sci Fi? Do the studios believe that Sci Fi fans are such geeks that anything will do? Sci Fi is my favorite genre, yet in a DVD collection of over 300 disk, I only manage to have about 20 or so Sci Fi movies that I have felt were worth owning.2001, Matrix, Gattica, Solaris, 12 Monkeys, Planet of the Apes (old version), Dark City, Contact - a few of the worthwhile Sci Fi movies.</fullReview>

Acting by the cast was way below par. The crews' actions and reactions were insipid. Stone was unconvincing and boring, Hoffman was a complete laugh (see him running around shrieking like a girl!) When he wasn't screaming he was muttering incoherently. SMALL SPOILERS SHOWING ON RADAR! We have a scene where Fletcher is eaten alive by jellyfish. Not one of the dead boring crew on the dead boring research facility bothers to help her. The brain dead captain simply says "Fletcher, get back to the habitat now!" His tone is oh-so-disinterested while the rest of his crew just sit around like stunned mullets acting as detached as the watching audience!We have a giant squid that never shows itself. We have a computer called Hal -oops- Jerry. We have a plot device seemingly borrowed from an even worse flick called Event Horizon. We even have the 'underwater research facility destroyed by monster/bad weather/bomb/take your pick' cliche.The reactions displayed by everyone in this film was confusing to say the least. The story line, although not as bad as EH was so muddled you soon couldn't care whether the crew lived or died. Just about nothing made sense - and boy was Hoffman bad in this!CONCLUSION? Yawn.

		<fullReview>The one thing required for me to fully enjoy a movie is some level of plausibility. This can be achieved through acting or dialogue, both of which leave much to be desired in "Sphere". The actors sleep-walked through this and the director didn't help. Doesn't he know that when someone is being killed, witnesses tend to freak out, not raise their eyebrows while drinking a cup of coffee (as Dustin Hoffman did quite well, but out of context). The situations as laid out by the director were potentially suspenseful, but without support from the actors there is no believability; this was the weakest point of the movie for me.Any good dialogue that there was to be had was all given to Jackson. What was left could have been performed as believably by a high school drama team. The holes in the acting and dialogue combined with the HUGE hole of unrealistic interaction made the movie very unrealistic/implausible and therefore it didn't catch or keep my attention; it didn't draw me in. I couldn't like it and I tried.I don't usually write comments on movies, but I had to go through any hassle necessary to register so that I could warn people.</fullReview>

The plot, which was originally rich and deep, has been watered down and condensed to fit in the low budget action scenes and lame dialogue. Jerry, a character who shows the ironic, and very funny, side of Crichton, gets air time for roughly 2.13 seconds. Even the twists that ultimately made me love the novel are pulled off poorly and can be anticipated early in the film. The one good point I can make is that the casting was very well done: all the actors seemed fit their characters like a second skin. But casting is not enough, and so I urge you: do not see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy, sizzling horror sci-fi with excellent claustrophobic suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fourth Michael Crichton adaptation in line is quite a good one. After the blockbuster success of `Jurassic Park' and minor hits `Congo' and `The Lost World', `Sphere' matches up to theses levels. And with so much talent in store, it certainly is appealing. Academy Award winners Barry Levinson and Dustin Hoffman (who coincidentally won Oscars for the same film) and Oscar Nominees Sharon Stone and Samuel L. Jackson all headline the movie.The end result is relatively good, but with so much talent on board it could have been a bit better. However, the film succeeds in what attempts to do. There are ample scarifying chills along with a high enjoyability factor. The haunting suspense is soon followed by an equally chilling action. This is good because other chillers such as `The Sixth Sense' built up the suspense, but no action followed. For that film, the scares lost all their quality the second time round. But in `Sphere's' case, the suspense keeps its intensity every time.The film starts out very well whilst on the surface, but gradually it gets worse only to amount to a satisfying conclusion. The middle scenes aren't bad, but they're a bit too gloomy and eerie. Another quibble is the obvious lack of originality. The main plot of `Event Horizon', which was made the year before that, is quite similar to the plot of this. There are also bits and pieces of other science fictions such as `Alien' taken here and there. Luckily it takes the bests bits and leaves you on the edge of your seat. But the finished product isn't as nourishing as it should be. The plot can get complicated at times, but for the most part it's actually quite clever.And the glamorous cast of familiar faces insures that the movie never drags on. Dustin Hoffman is well cast as the calm, stable psychiatrist and makes a suitable lead. It's not her most challenging role, but Sharon Stone s believable as the kooky biochemist. She still hasn't received any tough roles after `Casino' though. The most complex character in the film, Samuel L. Jackson drops the usual machismo for some convincing scepticism and abnormal goofiness. The supporting cast including Leiv Shreiber, Queen Latifah and Peter Coyote do their parts adequately, not that they can do much with them.The directing is good as expected by a great director. Levinson beautifully creates the required intensity and the visuals are very impressive aswell. The glistering shimmer of the huge golden sphere of the title is a delight to gaze at.The stars flash and the plot sizzles. There are a few plot-holes that it falls into along with a bit of a sag in the middle. Nevertheless, `Sphere' is an impressive sci-fi horror that succeeds on almost every other level. My IMDb Rating: 6.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi masterpiece (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I haven 't read the book and I understand if the ones who have may hate it because they were expecting something else . So my review is addressed mainly to those who want to have not read the book. This is definitely a must-see for any sci-fi fan . I cannot understand the bad comments . This is a classic . FORGET the overrated c**ppy, boring , stupid and empty R.Scott 's " Alien " . This is horror at its best .STORY SYNOPSIS: A group of scientists including a mathematician, an astrophysist, a biochemist and a psychologis , go underwater to investigate an American wrecked spaceship. They find out that the ship is 300 years old ( so it suppoosedly travelled through time from the future ) . They also find a huge alien golden sphere which reflects the environment . Soon strange things start happening . I won 't give away more because the less you know the more you will enjoy.The direction is very good and so are the actors . But the best part is probably the editing . There are a lot of flashbacks which are brilliantly added . As for the script ? Before I watched it I said " Oh well probably I will see the tired rehashed recipe of underwater Alien " I was wrong . Of course there ARE some of the eternal sci - fi cliches ****SPOILER ALERT**** The supporting cast end up only as expendable crew members . There is some of them who are probably related to the deaths . And yes , you guessed right : there is a big explosion at the end . ********* . But the originality here is that there are few action scenes since the suspence here is 75% PSYCHOLOGICAL. In the beginning there is a prophecy that " We are all going to die down here and no-one will survive to tell what happened. " With a few clever (and cheap!!) little tricks, the writers managed to maintain this prophecy until the last minute . It is an inevitable doom very chilling and menacing . On top of that the atmosphere is realistically nightmarish . There are a lot of doubts and lack of trust not only between the crew members but even for OUR thoughts . None of us (and them ) can certify exactly what is causing the deaths . All these facts may be dreams or delusions . Also , throughout the movie there are many revelations since the Sphere unfolds its secrets slowly . The mystery factor is great and towards the end you are afraid of what will come next .Of course there ARE plot holes . First of all the heroes are WAY too cool tempered if you consider the continuous deaths . OK they are professionals and must not panic in order to survive but even if my dog died I would feel more sad . ********SPOILER******* If Norman realised that the translational code was wrong then ALL the messages should be wrong . Another frequent complaint is how come they did not have good fantasies ? (like "chicks in bikini" as someone said ) . My opinion is that when the environment is kilometres underwater , dark , menacing, threatening , depressing and in a word hostile and nightmarish it can't provoke pleasant situations **********The best part of the movie is the message : Stop being xenophobic . Don 't blame the aliens .SPHERE 9 /10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has an interesting premise. What happens when humans contact an alien golden sphere that manifests their dreams? Apparently people dream about killer jellyfish and killer deep sea fish with huge spiny jaws, pickled worms that look like feces, invisible giant squids and hordes of killer pillows.The movie takes place mostly in the dark so it very hard to keep track of where you are, who is present, and what anyone is doing. This movie does not work at all on the small screen.When reality takes off on a tangent morphing like an acid trip, it felt like being trapped on a merry go round. I felt dizzy and wanted to get off, but the movie kept going and going and going repeating the same chaos, squirting water and loud noises in endless theme and variation. I was SO glad when the movie finally ended.The acting is so wooden, and the characters so sullen, you don't care if any of the characters survive the ordeal other than Norman, the Dustin Hofmann character who holds the movie together single handedly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most times when a novel is made into a film, you can follow the story without having to read the book. Sphere has a very strange and complex story. If you haven't read the book first, the movie will be hard to follow.The movie follows the book pretty closely. Barry Levinson directs his 2nd Crichton adaptation, following Disclosure. There is a terrific superstar cast. Dustin Hoffman is a legend and has made several great movies with Levinson. Samuel L. Jackson, always fun to watch, is one of the top actors of today. The sexy Sharon Stone here continues to prove how good of an actress she is. Sphere is a very strange, but entertaining movie. I do reccomend reading the book beforehand, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You need to put the remote down and step away from it. Do not press play. An absolutely appalling movie. The story line is weak. The special effects are non existent. The only reason you continue watching is in the hope that this movie cannot be that bad and something is going to happen. Looks like it was shot in a back yard pool with models purloined from a five year old's collection. Lacks realism - sending untrained people 1000ft under water coupled with juvenile helium voice giggles does makes you think you are watching a comedy - but no one is laughing. The only thing that would draw you to this movie is the cast. But even Oscar winners cannot salvage this movie. It should lie where they found the "spacecraft".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film blew me away when I first saw it. Unfortunately, 18 years later, it is just embarrassing. I'm not sure why I didn't notice back then that it is just crammed with unnecessary hysterics and over-the-top drama. Most of the characters are just plain annoying, and the story just doesn't seem to make sense. Did it make sense 18 years ago? Probably not, but the effects must have been dazzling enough to mask the lack of a cohesive plot. And to allow it to run for what is now obviously an excessively long time.One of the worst, yet most often committed mistakes in any film that involves spacesuits/diving suits is the inclusion of a bright lamp INSIDE the helmet. Obviously, this is done to improve the lighting for the camera. You don't need to be very intelligent to know that this light inside the helmet will absolutely destroy all visibility for the wearer. All he/she will see is glare. And yet, nearly every filmmaker does it. Here is no exception, although I will admit it's not the worst. But use of this lame lighting trick reflects either stupidity or bare contempt for the viewer. I can't help it, it ruins the whole film for me, no matter what other merits it might have.But this one ruined itself, it didn't need the helmet light to do that. It's unfortunate; I anticipated a very rewarding experience going into this viewing so many years later. I now wish I hadn't bothered. My memory of the film is now also ruined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking a major creative sci fi movie theme originated in the 1950s, Michael Crichton's novel brought to the big screen offers up a dazzling cerebral mind field of pscyho-action. The presentation of the actors, the set designs, and the script are fully realized for mainstream audiences and yet retain a still fresh, believable hard core sci fi experience. Instead of pervasive, constant action-packed explosions like Independence Day (1996), the audience gets to experience a more emotionally wrought, exploration of a tense filled, ominous, scary trip through the unknown like Alien (1979). This movie is a nice, taut balance of intriguing dialogue, suspense, and activity that is haunting and compelling and redeeming at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A spaceship is discovered under three hundred years' worth of coral growth at the bottom of the ocean.Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 12% based on 50 reviews, with the critical consensus that "Sphere features an A-level cast working with B-grade material, with a story seen previously in superior science-fiction films." Indeed, one wonders what Sharon Stone and Dustin Hoffman were doing in this. Hoffman, of course, was brought on by the director, his friend Barry Levinson. But Stone should have had better projects.Some aspects of this are interesting, and even though it was a flop at the time, I could see people today (2015) going back and really giving it a second chance. It has not become a better film with age, but it has something to say about science fiction films of the 1990s. (Most, it seems, were dystopian, so this is something of a fresh change.)</fullReview>

Barnes (Peter Coyote) tells the team of a possible spacecraft that crash landed 300 years ago. They discover a perfect liquid sphere in a ship possibly build by humans in the future. Along with sailor Fletcher (Queen Latifah) among others, the group is stranded on the bottom of the ocean.It's too slow and too long. The action has no thrills. The horror elements are lackluster. The cast may be superior but their work here is mediocre. The only good scene is Jackson fake out the Alien chocking scene. The rest is a long meandering sci-fi adventure without much adventure.

		<fullReview>Sphere (1998): Dir: Barry Levinson / Cast: Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, Queen Latifah, Liev Schreiber: Dazzling visual effects cannot hide the failing screenplay. A small crew is sent underwater to the site of a plane crash where they discover a giant sphere. If a person is sucked inside it will operate upon their worst nightmares such as viewing this film. They communicate with an alien named Jerry by computer but learn that it came about as a result of a crew member being sucked into the sphere. Havoc erupts as crew die by fire and jellyfish. The reality and fantasy elements become too confusing. Director Barry Levinson and Dustin Hoffman have worked together through superior films such as Rain Man, Wag the Dog, and Sleepers. This is a major setback for both careers. Hoffman is joined by Samuel L. Jackson, Queen Latifah and an overacting Sharon Stone but it doesn't matter. Nobody in this dog show should be expecting any award recognition here. The screenplay is paced on extremely slow speed leaving the actors to wait patiently for something to happen. The special effects are the only area of compliment and at that, the film creates a stunning underwater world. Unfortunately the cast doesn't look to be having as much fun. They are all lifeless but not as dead as the screenplay, which amounts to a big ball of nothing. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book was awesome, but the film left out some very important parts, and even changed how certain crew members died.but,its still perfect.I was a little surprised by Jeff Shannon's trouncing of this movie above. Sphere is not a seamless yarn from stern to aft; but, other than Contact and Gattaca, it's perhaps the only sci-fi movie of recent vintage to have anything intelligent to say about anything. Though it has its moments, Sphere does not serve up the special effects smörg?sbord we've been conditioned to expect from this genre. What it offers instead is an intelligent, suspenseful ride in the isolation of the ocean floor. There a team of very human scientists attempts to make sense of a series of dangerous and bazaar happenings following their contact with a sunken object of alien origin. Sphere has a bit of a who- done-it element and throws enough twists and turns at you to keep you guessing. The story could have benefited from some fleshing out in places. I suspect the book does a better job of this, as books usually do. The ending is more thought provoking than eye popping, although nothing too terribly profound. A few important questions are left unanswered. The acting, however, is solid overall, led by Dustin Hoffman's fine performance. Despite a few shortcomings, Sphere is an intelligent, well-paced thriller and creates a suspenseful atmosphere that carries you right up to the end. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING - SPOILERSWho on earth managed to talk Hoffman, Stone and Jackson into taking part in this dreadful hogwash? I can only assume the cheques were mighty indeed.The story seems to be a clumsy mash-up of almost every sci-fi or horror film you can think of: Event Horizon, 2001, Andromida Strain, The Shining, The Abyss, Alien - even the TV series Red Dwarf (Back to Reality &amp; Better Than Life) gets shoehorned in. The list just goes on and on. In fact, this film could have a decent second life as a board game. Contestants simply spot yet another cinematic reference to get their next roll of the dice.The film's jarringly episodic editing and the lack of any coherent narrative flow makes me suspect a great deal of this clunker was left on the cutting room floor; and that, trust me, is a good thing. I just wish they'd left a great deal more of it there.The plot is trite, the action is dull, the dialogue is dreadful, the characterisations are poor, the direction is ham-fisted and the entire thing is badly miscast. The cast seem to be improvising quite a bit, and although I have seen this work very well in other settings, I'm afraid here it just looked like a bad night at the your local amateur dramatic society. And then, just when you think this film couldn't possibly get any worse - WARNING! MAJOR SPOILER ALERT! - they simply use their shiny new super powers to make everything OK. I mean, jeez, c'mon guys! It's a dreadful clunker; it really is. Best avoided.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can feel the potential for a great film here, but there are sadly a few issues holding "Sphere" back from being anything more than "ok."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic performances from some true talent. Wonderful direction from a great artist. Some well executed sequences of horror and suspense. An interesting first-act. Wonderful music and design. And a fairly good piece of source material in the form of a Michael Crichton novel.I just don't get how "Sphere" wasn't a wonderful film!You can feel so much potential in that opening half-hour. And there are so many good elements at play. But it just sort-of falls apart at times. It feels unfinished. (A sentiment also echoed by one of its stars, Dustin Hoffman.) It feels like it could use some tightening in some spots, some additional scenes in other places, some more work with the pacing and maybe a re-shoot or two. Then it could be a great, wonderful film. As it is now, it's merely "ok."When a team consisting of a psychologist, mathematician, biologist and an astrophysicist are sent 1,000 feet below the surface of the ocean to investigate what could be an crashed alien spaceship, things take a bizarre turn when two revelations are unveiled. First, the ship might actually be human in origin, and second... a mysterious spherical object is found in storage on the ship, and it's influence could lead to the brink of disaster.The performances are almost universally incredible in this film. Featuring the aforementioned Dustin Hoffman, we are also treated to the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Sharon Stone, Liev Schreiber, Queen Latifah and Peter Coyote. And all are able to make a good impact, even when the script and storyline don't give them too much development as characters. The talent elevates the experience.Director Barry Levinson does some incredible work here as well. Levinson (responsible for some great films) really treats the audience with a combination of intimacy and spectacle from scene to scene. His sense of storytelling, like the acting, elevates the entire feature. (Particularly admirable are some great scenes of horror and suspense. Levinson makes some interesting choices as to what he chooses to show and what he chooses to hide.)And many other aspects of the production are equally high in quality. Elliot Goldenthal's score is magnificent and haunting. The cinematography of Adam Greenberg is perfect and gives a great aesthetic. Visual and practical effects are almost uniformly excellent. (Save for one or two "gory" effects that don't quite work.) Everything here just seems to work.The problem, as said above, is that the film sadly doesn't feel finished. And I can't place my finger on any specific aspect of it that fails. It just needs... more work. Some parts of the film feel overlong and in need of trimming. Other parts are abrupt and feel like scenes and shots are missing. Some moments feel contrived and out of context. The pacing is all over the map. And it betrays everything that works so well. It's just a bit too sloppy in its current form.I honestly think that if the film was given another month or so of time for post-production and editing (and maybe a week or two of re-shoots), it would have been infinitely better. Heck, it might have even been great.But as is, the film's troubled storytelling and inconsistent pacing all but ruin the experience. Although I will contend that there is enough good here to make "Sphere" worth checking out. Even if only once for the sake of curiosity.I give it about an average 6 out of 10. I'd say check it out if you see it on cable or available to rent. You just might like it.</fullReview>

They will be staying in deep sea habitats, and upon arrival, find that inside the ship is a sphere that seems to have affected their minds, making their fears come true. It turns out that it is a semi-sentient being that the human mind cannot fully control or comprehend, and the dilemma of what to do about it forms the basis of the plot. Good acting and direction, but story, while intelligent and even logical, paints itself in a corner dramatically, and viewer will either be intrigued or infuriated by the outcome.

I feel bad for Michael Crichton, who's one of my favorite writers -- but "Sphere" was not one of his better efforts. I actually sort of cringed when I heard they were making a movie out of it.But turning the so-so book into a not-half-bad movie meant getting some decent stars and making the story believable. I'm telling you, the special effects made this movie fun to watch. I could watch more sci-fi flicks if they were as fun as "Sphere" but I don't think the credit goes to Crichton for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thinking man's atmospheric sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie again, some 12 years since it came out. Given the amount of thrashing this movie has received since the release, I was always a bit hesitant to declare my love for it, but now that I know I am not alone in my appreciation, all that shame is out of the window.People often mention a 14% or-so rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a disastrous box office as they roast this movie, but I think that merely indicates how misunderstood this movie was by critics and the general public alike. It happened to a certain Blade Runner and The Thing before, and although Sphere never got that amount of appreciating and cult-following after the fact, I see enough people warming up to it nowadays.The effort to give a science fiction thriller a bit of weight and thought apparently didn't excite much viewers back in 1998. I wonder, now that Christopher Nolan has given us 'Inception' and showed that you can watch action-science fiction movies without leaving your brain at home, if more people could warm up to 'Sphere'. However, it doesn't have Leonardo in it. This movie has Dustin Hoffman, who focused on more action-oriented parts in the nineties, which is something Oscar-winners are often crucified for. It had Sharon Stone in it as a scientist. Sam Raimi once tried her as a cowgirl in the excellent 'Quick and the Dead', another movie largely ignored by a public unwilling to embrace Stone as a serious lead (despite some thrown-in nudity). Samuel L. Jackson is a wonderful actor, but hardly a box-office magnet either. I admit that Stone may not have been the best choice, but the other actors are in the right spot, since they are playing scientists in the first place, and unwilling action heroes in the second.It is rare to see a movie that has its characters theorizing out loud and using their expertise when faced with a submerged spaceship at the bottom of the see. The first half of the movie is a true gem that elaborately explores the scientific implications of such a find, and how a first contact with alien intelligence could turn out. The origin of the ship, the titular object and its consequences forms another basic question that is satisfactorily explored in the remainder of the movie. It is probably what made the movie too slow-paced for those who'd like to cut to the part where discoveries are made, aliens are found, guns are pulled out and people start dying, which, admittedly, takes a while, and not all of it happens in this movie.The second half is where the dark side of the discovery starts to show. If I had one major complaint about the movie, it would be that at this point, we leave the intelligent 'Solaris' part of the movie and enter some kind of underwater 'Shining', when the frequent scares start to pound the viewer with the intensity of a 'Halloween' movie. Although creepy and tense, and effectively underlining the final conclusion of the movie, it is also a bit of a break in style that makes this movie strangely bipolar. It would go to far to compare it to the crazy twist in 'From Dusk Till Dawn', but is a bit unfortunate that the subtlety of the first half is not continued, and we basically end up in another movie from this point. But as good science fiction goes, this is also where the movie makes its inevitable and valid point about the state of humanity. Though the second half and climax are somewhat formulaic, the science and the emotion come together in a very good epilogue, which is actually one of the few science-fiction endings that doesn't sacrifice one over the other, but it is guaranteed to be another bummer for the adrenalin-junkies.All in all, I appreciated this movie when it came out and frankly, that feeling hardly changed over the years. It is not a perfect movie, but one that has since captured the attention of more and more moviegoers for its sheer willingness to trade fast pace and little green men for atmosphere and hard-core science fiction substance. Movies like this don't come too often, but there definitely is a public for them, even if they don't pass the 100 million mark.</fullReview>

I'm just selective about the reality I accept." - Bill Watterson "Sphere" is a tedious rip-off of scifi classic "Forbidden Planet", which takes the 1956 film's monsters-from-the-id gimmick and transplants it underwater, before going off on a tangent reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky's "Solaris", Ursula Le Guin's "The Lathe of Heaven" and James Cameron's "The Abyss".Still, the film plays fairly well as pulpy science fiction tale, and contains at least 2 interesting ideas. The first is the idea of having a psychologist struggling to psychoanalyse a fickle alien. In this regard the film plays like a bizarre therapy session in which the psychologist not only has to figure the alien creature out, but has to tread carefully lest he upset this strange, powerful being.The film's second interesting idea is this: the "sphere" of the film's title refers to an alien device which itself travels to planets in order to psychoanalyse and assess alien life forms. Once creatures touch the sphere, the sphere then manifests their unconscious thoughts, desires and feelings. If these feelings are "negative", calamity ensues. In short, the sphere becomes a "test" for a kind of evolutionary and emotional maturity. End result: a psychological thriller in which a psychologist psychoanalyses a giant ball that psychoanalyses humans.The human psychologist in the film is played by Dustin Hoffman. His alien opposite is a giant, golden, extraterrestrial ball, which slowly forces the film's human cast to confront themselves. The film's final scene is excellent. Here, the film's cast wipe their own memories and deny the lessons learnt in their therapy sessions. In other words, rather than confront itself, humanity adopts a regressive stance, one of denial and wilful ignorance. Deeming human beings idiots, the alien sphere then leaves the planet, presumably to psychoanalyse some other species.7/10 ? "Sphere" is interesting for its possibilities rather than its execution. Based on a novel by Michael Crichton, it was directed by Barry Levinson, an actor centric director who here gets terrible performances from almost his entire cast. Samuel L. Jackson steals the show as a wise-cracking mathematician. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that seems really great, feels really great, and is really great, but when you look back on it, it just doesn't add up. You kind of have this, "so what" feeling. Don't get me wrong. It was enjoyable, creepy and tense, with appropriate character development. There was acceptable acting, and a neat script with some clever hocus pocus elements, but they all tied together like a flat soda. There just wasn't any fizz. Actually I recommend watching this movie, and the book would probably fill you in on the rest of it that wasn't filmed quite nicely. Spoilers forthcoming: So the ship was from the future, ooooh ahhhh, and? So the sphere had some kind of psychological impact on them. What this was or why we don't know. Was the sphere alive? Who knowns, we come to find out that the only talking it does is actually another character talking through the sphere, and the sphere itself. Where does it come from? Another mystery. Again, I liked it, and I understand and appreciate the ambiguity of the concept, but it was just too much. In the end you didn't know anything that you didn't already know in the first 20 minutes. It's like the movie says, "Hey, what's going on here?" and then answers itself, "fooled you, there's nothing going on at all! We really had you going there." Watch the Abyss. It's a far superior film. Either version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Dustin Hoffman's defense! :-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>hehe I'm beginning to think something's wrong with me because I liked this movie! I thought it was awesome! The thing is, this movie wasn't made to give us some action-packed fighting scenes. The movie industry has enough of those! hehe The suspense in this movie was created by the in-depth thoughts and the fact that everything was so commonplace. Personally, I love movies like this where the main object is something as ordinary as a sphere, which makes it extraordinary. The mystery was the name of the game, not necessarily how in suspense the movie put us in. That just happens to be the type of movie I like. I mean, they could have walked into the space-ship and had to fight off aliens and all that, but that's already been done, over 100 times. I mean, this movie, made you think. They were fighting their own fears and imaginations. Now that's something you don't see everyday, and keeps me in way more suspense than it would have if Dustin Hoffman had been doing slow-motion back-flips to fight off aliens who look like....well, I wouldn't have nightmares about any aliens I've seen so far in movies. :-)Also, most of the comments I've read say Dustin Hoffman acted poorly and uninterested and all that. Well, the thing is, that was his character. He was a middle-aged psychologist. It would have been extremely unbelievable if he had acted as some gung-ho, courageous, James Bon. He was a psychologist. In my opinion, Dustin Hoffman created his character with talent and prowess I didn't even notice until watching the movie a second time.We all have different opinions, but I just wanna say that mine is that I loved this movie!!! :-) If yours is that you hated it, than that's cool for you too! Happy day to everyone!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Book. Good Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sphere starts out as quite a good movie. It has everything needed for a good movie, great cast, good storyline etc.I have read the book, and frankly, that is much better and scarier than this movie. I have to give credit to the director, he has followed the book very closely(reasonably enough). One of the things most irritating about movies is when they bend the facts. The book was excellent, the movie, of course, can't be compared to the book(like most books which are turned into movies).The story of the book and the movie is extremely interesting and I feel the author could have added more to it, as it was too short(I finished it in about 6 hours, straight). But some of the things not explained in the movie AND the book are where the sphere came from, what EXACTLY was its purpose(though there is a lot of speculation in the book, they don't reach any fixed conclusion), WAS there any alien force? **SPOILERS(OF THE BOOK)**And one more thing, where were the mysterious Navy men who come from nowhere in the book?? They gave me quite a scare, and I think my worst in the book, and I wanted to see them in the movie. But they weren't there. Probably time was short in the movie.Good movie. Worth seeing. Once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have stuck to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I can't understand is why Hollywood takes a perfectly good book, and likes it so much that they make a movie of it, and then changes it so that the story then suffers. Admittedly, it is difficult to find ways to include the thoughts of the characters in the book as lines of dialogue in the movie, so there are some forced lines here and there, but was it necessary for Norman and Beth to have had an affair, and for Beth to be borderline suicidal? In the book she subconsciously wanted to die, but adding in the tortured past was pretty unnecessary. They could have stood to make the movie longer, too, instead of skipping over essential parts of the plot development. Even aside from the fact that it was a remake that was not too faithful to the story that inspired it, it was poorly made. Hoffman spends too much time muttering, and frankly, doesn't seem convincing at all as a psychologist. And what was this hokey stuff with the sphere not reflecting people? Was that just so Hollywood could make a cool special effect of moving reflections? The direction of the movie was also terrible. It was annoying to have the camera jumping around like it did, and to have the repeat movement and dialogue shots. Oooooh, I'm unsettled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good start, but poor ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone else mentioned I can't believe anyone would say that this is the best movie ever or even the worst.I bought film on DVD as a gamble and didn't really know anything about it. The film started very well, in my opinion, created a good atmosphere and style, in some ways similar to the shinning. The idea that a ship from the future crashes in the past creates great interest.Unfortunately then the film started to get worse, you realise slowly the build up was for nothing and in fact the film becomes a silly low-grade Twilight Zone episode. When you get to the very poor ending (one of the worst ever) you find yourself taking the film apart.I think Hoffman and Stone were mis-cast and weren't very believable. The bizarre use of the Jackson character, who seemed, completely impervious to everything going on around him, until the end.Overall not great, but not that bad. It starts very well and looks like a classic, but then goes down hill very quickly.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Undoubtedly, some other reviwers on this page will question my sanity after reading me state that this is one my favs, well, to hell with them. I found it a faithful adaption of the Michael Crichton novel, well-acted by some, e.g. Samuel L.Jackson as usual, well-written and with the exception of the beginning, very entertaining and suspenseful.A team of scientists (Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Jackson, Liev Schreiber) are called to an underwater bunker to examine what the military believes is a spaceship that apparently crashed three centuries ago. When they enter the craft is when the chills begin. I thought this one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, I don't think I knew the meaning of "Psychological Suspense" until viewing this particuliar film. It had me guessing and thinking the whole time, and to me that's the best kind of movie. For me, there was a general feeling of creepiness throughout the film, and it didn't let up until the very end, which by the way, made perfect sense to me. The only thing which didn't seem to jibe well with the rest of the film were the sub-headings from the book which appeared every two seconds; they seemed useless. I would've awarded it four stars, but I guess I'm more than a little bit disillusioned upon reading several negative reviews of this film. Why is everyone trashing it??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sphere is an underwater movie, it's based on a book I've not read so I really cant comment anything about how the movie is vs. the book, but normally it's pretty straight just a few twists to make the movie unique.My first opinion was that this was a great move, at least that's what my friends told me. I saw this with a home cinema system in a completely dark room alone... So I really created the atmosphere to match the movie. I was positive to this movie most of all because it had several great actors in it. Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone are names you know.I gotta say, you'll notice the first chill when they're down there entering the so-called spaceship. And they just keep coming! Only bad thing is that they skip some scenes to make the movie a bit shorter... but my opinion is that this movie is worth seeing! Absolutely!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd read and heard that this movie is sub-par, but I still expected more. I thought, with Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson how bad could it be? Notice that I don't mention Sharon Stone, because I thought she was SO out of place in this film. What were the casting directors thinking? But anyway, I thought with such great actors, the movie couldn't be too bad. But I again learned what it is to have good actors and crappy direction or whatever it was that was crappy. I completely agree with the people who said that it lacked suspense. I remember reading the book and being glued to my chair, not being able to put it down. The movie, on the contrary, made me yawn. It seemed so rushed for some reason. There seemed to be such great stuff in the book that wasn't used and so the movie seemed rushed and choppy. There were some great shots though and some good editing at parts. Like the scene where Dustin Hoffman sees that all the cabinets in the galley are filled with copies of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. That was a great, great scene and there needed to be more like it! The whole movie just seemed flat and a poor adaptation of an amazing novel. To see a good one, try The Andromeda Strain. It's an oldie, but a goodie.</fullReview>

If you have the DVD (which I do now) you will learn that Samuel L. Jackson thought he was acting in front of a silver sphere, and not a gold one...interesting thought. But overall, I think Jackson gave the best performance, and Dustin Hoffman did a good job talking to "Jerry," but I don't know what was up with Sharon Stone, because I thought that was the worst performance in the movie. That downgraded my rating to a 9. All in all, the movie is excellent, and is very thrilling. (some camera shots will freak you out!) Own the movie on DVD if you can!!!</fullReview>

And than BOOOOM. Disaster. I read and heard all bad reviews. Movie plunged at box office. So I joined the stream and didn't go to theater to see it. That is not what I usually do and I like to be my own critic. Now when it is released on video I decided to take a look. I liked the movie. It isn't really that bad as critics say and it reminds me of Cameron's Abyss. Maybe the reason why I feel that way is because I didn't read the book. I've heard it is so good but somehow I never laid my hands on it which is the first thing I'll do now. I'm really curious to see where the movie went wrong. Probably some books are to good for big screen. There is just no movie that can be better than our imagination. Maybe than I'll change my review but for now I think it is a good movie. Far better than Armageddon, for example, which earned 200 million.</fullReview>

Being unfamiliar with the book (other than its basic theme) I didn't really know what to expect, and the film kept the tension up admirably and kept me guessing to the end. I actually felt that all the main players did a good job, and even though the dialogue did occasionally sway towards being wisecracks, there was enough substance for you to actually care.

It drops to the "floor" of the ocean, in plain sight (lots of light down there), he swims down, pushes it on his face, breathes deeply, and swims to safety.

		<shortDescription>Starts well, gets good, dissipates.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I *had* read the original novel before I had seen Sphere, and, to be frank, I thought that it was the best thing Michael Crichton had (and has) ever done. It was brilliantly thought out, was creepy enough to slide underneath your skin, and contained a multitude of exciting and original ideas.The *film*....well, the film is O.K., i.e. a disappointment. As a previous user pointed out, the credits sequence is absolutely brilliant. The combination of stroboscopic editing of the images of old woodcut sea maps and sea monsters picked up on the book's theme of the unknown and the imagined. The mixture of straightforward text and words that had been manipulated so as to appear as if they were moving through a spherical glass was genius, because that is EXACTLY what the sphere does; alters and distorts perception and reality and the line between the two.Furthermore on the plus side is the score, which is far and away the best thing about the film. The bit that really sticks out is when Beth (Shazza) opens a door, and all the dead crewmen's body bags burst out of the flooded compartment. Instead of giving us *chun chun chun chun CHAAAA*, and hysterical editing (I spit on your grave, Michael Bay), the shot moves into slow motion, and an eerie piano melody starts up in the background. The suggestion is that all is not what it seems (as if ever it is in these films...), and the effect is, well, emphatically unsettling.But these are points in the film's favour (and you can add some top performances if you like-I would). The arguments against the film are a bit meatier. Firstly, some of the effects are shoddy, e.g., when you are meant to share the crew's gasps of astonishment upon their first sighting of the ship, and all we get is a very murky shot of what looks like the side of an industrial chimney. Gee, wow. Secondly, while I think Barry Levinson is good, even excellent, at drama and psychology, he can't direct action for diddly squat, and, while the emphasis IS on suspense, there were parts of the movie that needed an action director's flair (especially the ''climax'' , which was shot in such a half-arsed way I almost laughed). I don't like Adam Greenberg as a cinematographer, and I thought the photography was murky and dull. It was to Sphere's detriment that it decided to *suggest* a monster, rather than give us the white-knuckle fight against the squid that occurs in the book. The middle section of the film, in which my knees were under my chin, and my hands wandering towards my eyes, (the snakes shooting up Norman's trouser legs! Urgh!) was fantastic, but then, as the film drew on, the chapter markers (interesting decision to retain those-perhaps an acknowledgement that the film is adapted from a book?) began to break up the film's narrative fluidity, and it began to feel episodic and disjointed... Basically, by the end, it's not that you've lost interest-the film has that going for it-but that you can no longer follow the story, and the ending only JUST about makes sense. See if it if you have to....but I say read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orb or not to Orb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a truly bad movie, SPHERE seems to pop up on TV almost as often as the far superior and somewhat similar THE ABYSS. But then, so did the atrocious David Lynch version of DUNE at one time. Psychologist Dustin Hoffman and a bunch of other name stars (including Sam Jackson) descend into the ocean depths to examine what they think is a crashed plane but actually is an object of quite a different color that has been lying on the ocean floor for a very long time. It turns out to be a U.S. spacecraft, clearly from the future, and it holds a mysterious black orb that may be organic in nature. The orb starts having unpleasant effects on individual members of the crew, and soon enough people start dying. Barry Levinson was not the right director for this sci-fi tall tale, Dustin Hoffman and costar Sharon Stone as his ex-wife are both woefully miscast and the lack of the much-anticipated giant squid (except on radar) kills off any hope for the film. The ending leaves something to be desired as well. I'd say remake it, but this one probably has poisoned any hope of a remake, at least in this decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Giving it a '7' is probably a little generous. However, it was suspenseful the first time I saw it, and the production values are too good to be a "B" flick. The lighting was a little dark, even for trying to evoke a scary environment... I want to see some of that technology, even if it is fake! Nice to see some big cameos... Queen Latifa, Huey Lewis, Liev Schreiber. Peter Coyote should stick to narrating Nature documentaries... as an actor, he has only two emotions; sullen, and over-the-top irate. And I was a little puzzled about the design of the craft that brought the sphere to Earth... why did it look like (sonar image) the tail section of a giant airplane? Wouldn't that have gotten torn to shreds when it went through the black hole? And how can a craft that withstands going thru a black hole get blown up by a mere liquid hydrogen explosion?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid underrated thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the star power of Sphere may be somewhat superfluous (if not downright distracting), the film is nonetheless an entertaining romp that probably deserves more credit that it gets (at least in terms of its current IMDb score).Levinson pulls together a tight and compelling story that stays true to the original novel while adding a few new story elements as well (the implied romantic history between Dustin Hoffman's character and Sharon Stone's, for example).While none of the film's moments are overly spectacular, the film maintains a constant level of suspense and intrigue, which, in some ways, is more difficult to accomplish. Overall, a worthy sci-fi with replay value to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your looking for a well acted, and entertaining horror, then this is perfect. But lets get one thing straight - this film is a 12, and therefore there are no 'gorey' scenes. This more of a phycological horror, as you will find out when you watch the film.In brief, the small crew of an underwater base are left without contact to the water surface due to bad weather. Upon discovering what appears to be an old spacecraft on the ocean floor, they look inside to find an odd sphere. The rest? Well that would be telling! The plot is great and the film keeps getting better as it goes an, and really proves you don't need lots of violence and gore to create a good horror film - such parts in this film being when a crew member gets killed by deadly jelly fish. I know, it sounds stupid, but when you watch it it really does set your heart racing.I've given this 8/10, as its all round a good film. The star performer is Samuel L Jackson, who is brilliant. The special effects are nice as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course this is not one of the greatest 100 movies of all time, but telling this is a sorry film is missing the whole point. More, I believe the ending is the best part. It gives a meaning to the whole thing. I would give more money to see this movie again, that I would do to watch Lord of the Rings. Cinema is the place where we can build bridges between the world of fantasy and illusion (which is what a movie really is), and the real world in which we live in, and that means giving you a message. The message that I can read from this movie is simple: "We could make the world a better place, but, we're just not ready...yet." It's something that makes me think and I believe that's what a movie should do. If you watch movies just for the fun of it than probably this is not the best movie. Even so, it is quite entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER Who is responsible this film? They ought to be shot. What an amazing opportunity was lost! This book could have made an excellent film. I'm also really disappointed with Dustin Hoffman, who is one of my all-time favorite actors. The beginning wasn't bad, I can even overlook the problems with the Beth situation (the psychosis and the whole once-dated-Norman thing) because it helped to explain things in a limited amount of time. They cut out some characters, which I can also understand. But the movie goes downhill from there. My biggest gripe with the movie is the limiting of "Jerry's" character. In the book, he was a major force and a complex character. Without Jerry, Norman would never have figured it all out. And Jerry is cut down to, what, 3 sentences? There is also a complex plot that was almost completely skipped over in the movie. They covered this up with things that were easier to deal with - namely, screaming. The end of the movie completely missed the mark. Just because it's meant for the masses doesn't mean it needs to be dumbed down. I was very disappointed with the movie. It was confusing and watered down. I would not recommend it to anyone, especially not if they've read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD: Watch SPHERE at your peril. I believe I have reviewed this before. But I have just watched the special edition DVD. So here we go again. Sort of. SPHERE has been done before and since, as TOMB RAIDER, EVENT HORIZON, FORBIDDEN PLANET and even CONTACT. The plot is basically about finding out what lies beyond the pale. Unfortunately, this movie has very poor casting (Dustin Hoffman screams like a girl as snakes climb up his pants legs and Sam Jackson sleeps through two thirds of the movie), poor direction (Barry Levinson of all people doing a sci-fi movie), lousy special effects, NO monster even though one is promised, and truly bad editing. The bad editing may be blamed on the confused state of mind of the characters after they encounter the alien sphere. But I think it is just confused editing. The ending --with the characters standing around in a circle, looking more confused than ever -- is an absolute howler, worse than the ending of the worst-ended movie of all time, DONNIE DARKO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. government has discovered a spacecraft covered in coral that could not have been where it is for as long as it apparently has been. Coyote calls in a special team to determine its nature and help handle the situation. Unfortunately, the team is practically the worst possible choice for the job! Hoffman is an ill-experienced psychologist who is completely out of his area of knowledge, Stone is a neurotic former lover and patient of Hoffman's who has attempted suicide, Jackson is a hot-head who doesn't like to follow orders and Schreiber is a bookworm who doesn't share the government's point of view. Before too long, things get nasty as the ship's interior reveals an otherworldly sphere which has unheard-of power. The film has some truly terrific special effects and a striking production design, but that is very nearly the only saving grace. The underwater scenes are poorly lit, the characters make very little sense, the pace of the film is excruciating, it's overlong and the ending is ridiculous. Stumpy Hoffman is completely wrong for this type of heroic role. He and the rest of the cast all start off well, but deteriorate very quickly. Jackson gives a highly annoying performance that is very difficult to rationalize. Stone looks terrific, but runs hot and cold. Sometimes she's radiantly energetic, other times blank and wooden. The others have little to do which makes this almost a three character movie with no strong characterizations to enjoy. It was based on an old best-seller of Michael Crichton's and the translation to film was apparently not a strong one. There are a few scenes of genuine shock and tension, but they seem derivative of better films like "Alien". Director Levinson is pretty far out of his element here and it shows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not totally sure what to make of Sphere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was part sci-fi adventure, part psychological thriller. Dustin Hoffman as Norman, Sharon Stone as Beth, and Samuel L. Jackson as Harry, lead the all-star film, directed by Levinson, based on the novel by Michael Crichton. Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted are all called to somewhere in the Pacific, for a reason no one tells them. It turns out the navy has found a spaceship buried in the ocean, and it seems as if something is alive inside. So, based on a paper Norman wrote for the Bush administration, this military type group that no one knows about calls together these four people (a marine biologist, a mathematician, an astrophysicist, and a psychologist) to try and make contact. What they find inside, including the titular Sphere, leaves them wondering what they got themselves into, and how they're going to get out of it. Now, I don't want to ruin the story by telling you what was inside the ship, and all the other stuff, I'll leave that for you to find out. But I can tell you what I thought of the movie.It seemed like the film didn't know what it wanted to be. Was it a sci-fi adventure? It took place under water, there were aliens involved, there was certainly some action, and some scary moments, so maybe it was a sci-fi adventure. But then again, were there really aliens? The last half of the film seemed more like they were trying to make you afraid of what you didn't see, trying to get into your mind and play around a little bit. So maybe it was a psychological thriller. I still haven't figured it out. The first half I thought it would be more like Aliens. A bunch of people caught inside (or around) an alien life form, battling to save the universe from destruction. I know that's been done before, but this one seemed to have a more psychological edge to it. It would be the action you've seen before, but combined with the psychological side you haven't. But the second half left the action behind, and it became a very slow film. I checked my watch 3 or 4 times, something I very rarely do. The movie seemed way too long; I thought they could have cut out a lot in the middle, instead of trying to pound your head with all the mind games. And I also managed to figure out the big secret they were trying to hide until the big climax. I don't know if it's because I've seen too many movies in my life, or if it's because it was so damn obvious. And the other thing I noticed in while in movies like Titanic, or Braveheart, the music was an addition to the film, something that supplemented the images on screen, the music in Sphere took over the film, and overpowered the action at times.So overall, if you're in the mood for mind games, and some action, I'd go see Sphere, but just don't go in thinking that a movie with Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, and directed by Barry Levinson means that it's going to be good, because its not. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly, the worst movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I have to say is that this is the most gross misuse of an abundance of talent, that I have ever seen.I'll begin with Barry Levinson. I know that 'Sleepers' isn't HIS finest movie, but it's my favourite, and 'Sphere' does not compare on any level whatsoever. Levinson appears to have directed this movie using the 'How To Direct A Blockbuster' handbook. For me, Levinson is normally a safe director to place at the helm, especially with a cast of talented actors. Here however, he fails to achieve either tension or depth in the story, and uses his actors (noteably Stone) as window dressing for the true 'star', the effects.Then there's the story. I haven't read the book, but I pray that Crichton's novel isn't nearly as ludicrous as the movie is. I can imagine (as with Jurassic Park) that 'Sphere' on screen, misses out vital intricacies and details that are present in the 'Sphere' on paper. However, 'Jurassic Park' still had a decent script, and unlike this movie, the ideas in the novel were magically created on screen.When I see a cast presenting Samuel L. Jackson, Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone and the impressive Liev Schreiber (his turn in RKO was superb), I think great things. They are all seasoned pros at this game, yet each one of them disappoints here. Jackson tries to be too flashy, Hoffman does what he can with some awful 'smartarse' dialogue, Stone moves away from her fabulous turn in 'Casino', and closer to her 'make me a leading lady' turn in 'The Specialist'. My 6 year old niece could deliver lines more convincingly than her in this film. And Screiber just tries to be a mixture of Hoffman and Jackson. Witty AND intense, neither works for him. It truly is an astonishing waste of four reliable actors.The effects are nothing to be excited about. Some of the underwater cinematography is good, but 'The Abyss' can cover that area in a much more satisfying manner. There's no splendour here, just a huge ball that appears to make people a little demented. If you want an underwater thriller, watch 'The Abyss'. If you want to see Hoffman in a role worthy of his talents, watch just about every other of his movies other than 'Outbreak'. The worst thing was, I actually looked forward to seeing this film. How wrong can a film fan be??!! And to top it all off, Huey Lewis is in it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out okay, but sorta crumbles after about 30 minutes. It manages to hold you in suspense, but that's not really a great achievement in and of itself.Too many things just didn't make sense or were never explained.****SPOILERS****For such an ensemble of brilliant, phd-wielding experts, they sure were stupid and slow to act. In disaster after disaster, most of the characters just stood around and scratched their heads.Other times, they are so smart that the movie doesn't even make sense. As always, there are puzzles and codes that are bizarrely complex, yet are solved in one try or with a surprisingly simplistic solution. I'm thinking mainly about the translation of the alien code. The logic to solve the code went something like: "Well, the alien is a ball... so if we take a keyboard and wrap it around a ball....tada!" Huh?!? Very scientific. Plus, if they were mistranslating "Harry" as "Jerry" all along, then wouldn't "Jerry" have come out as something else everytime the "alien" said "Don't call me Jerry"?Was Dustin Hoffman's character supposed to be some super-psychologist or psychiatrist? Cause he really needed to take some anger-management and team-building classes. Throughout the whole movie, he just points fingers and pisses off other people, often making unstable situations even worse.Also, if they determined that the wild creations were coming from their own thoughts and dreams, then why would putting them under with drugs solve anything? Wouldn't that just make things worse?The ending shows the ball flying up into the sky and off into space. Ah,yes... that explains EVERYTHING. NOW it all makes sense.****END SPOILERs****Ultimately, this becomes a "haunted house" sci-fi movie, often compared to Event Horizon, a more purely horror movie. If you like undersea sci-fi, watch the Abyss, which is overall a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of Sphere, psychologist Dustin Hoffman is piloted to a mysterious ocean plane crash. He wonders what's going on, but pilot Huey Lewis isn't forthcoming. By the end of the movie, I felt like Hoffman: I was still wondering what was going on.And that is why Sphere is a bad movie. A good suspense flick drops hints along the way, and then explains them in the end. But Sphere doesn't do that. It is riddled with clues as to the movie's secret, but in the end, none are explained. In the original Psycho, many critics blasted psychiatrist Simon Oakland's closing speech as being too pat and convenient. But at least it explained what had happened in the movie; after Sphere, I was still left wondering what had happened. The plot concerns the discovery of a strange spacecraft at the bottom of the Pacific. Scientists Hoffman, Sharon Stone and Samuel L. Jackson are flown in to make contact with any aliens aboard. Inside, they encounter a gigantic golden sphere; the plot then surrounds the deleterious effects their contact with the sphere has on their minds. Expendable crew members get knocked off one by one by a crazy computer named Jerry until Hoffman, the resident psychiatrist, gives Jerry some therapy sessions and discovers the secret of the sphere.The movie contains poor acting and awful dialogue. Given the talents of the three actors, I feel it's a matter of their being miscast, rather than professional failing on their part; nobody could make this dialogue good. When Stone observes some dust on the spacecraft floor, she suspects they are not alone:  "Somebody's been here. There's footsteps and they ain't ours." Not only is this sappy, but it's incorrect: she sees footprints, not footsteps. Footsteps are what you hear; footprints are what you see.Sample these gems when expendable crew member Queen Latifah, as Fletcher, ventures out in her scuba: "Wow. It's so beautiful down here. So... tranquil." "Edmunds, come down here. Something... happened to Fletcher." "She had an unfortunate accident, Harry. She was killed. Jellyfish." "Jellyfish like this are unheard of. I don't know what this is, but it isn't God's creation."And after Hoffman's first shrink session with Jerry: "I wish Jerry wasn't happy. Jerry's been cooped up for 300 years. What happens if Jerry gets mad?"Here are some of the many unanswered questions in the movie:?When they first try to enter the craft, they're able to chip off pieces of the body with their hammer, despite the fact it's made out of titanium steel. The significance of this is never explained.?The sphere' s surface reflects everything but the crew. This is never explained. ?For no given reason, the boat monitoring their activity from the ocean's surface suddenly pulls away, leaving them stranded. ?After contacting the sphere, Jackson suddenly loves eggs and hates calamari. Why? (We then see Stone drawing on her pad, showing how "Egg" equals "Sphere." But as a scientist she should know that an egg is an oval, not a sphere.)?Jackson becomes mysteriously enamored with the book "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." Hoffman then discovers piles and piles of the book in his ship's cabinets. This is supposed to be a breathtaking, dramatic moment, but falls flat because it is never explained. ?An obvious error occurs when Hoffman is decoding a message that reveals the name of the killer. He discovers that it was incorrectly decoded before; every time the number "1" appears, it should not have been decoded as "E," but as "A." But this messes up the rest of the message which begins "My name is ..." Using the film's logic, the message would now read "My nama is..." The acting mystified me. Why, when the door to the spacecraft and the elevator operate all by themselves, did the cast not act surprised? Often, the characters acted like they did not care what was happening, including when their fellow scientists are dying. Peter Coyote, as the project's commander, is excruciatingly bad. His character never decides who he is. One moment he is mysterious; the next he is disconnected. Only Liev Schreiber is able to insert any humanity into his role; unfortunately, he turns out to be an expendable crew member.In a film that wins my vote for not making sense most of the time, the ending does not disappoint. Hoffman, Stone and Jackson decide they can overcome the sphere's influence by using a uniquely human power. But why should this necessarily be able to override the power of the sphere? And the sphere's actions at the end are not explained. I have a hunch that the book, which I did not read, explains most of these non-sequiturs. It seems that when a blockbuster novel is adapted to film these days, a lot of corners are cut in explaining why something is happening. By the end of Sphere, I was bored out of my mind. When people ask me what the worst movie is that I have ever seen, unfortunately I have to say it's Sphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best trash movie I've ever seen! It made me cry, fall from chair, and almost die laughing! Have you ever expected that UFOs, aliens, jellyfishes-killers and giant squid can be gathered in one film, and this film is not a parody? "Sphere" authors prove that it's possible, and try to do it in as "sci-fi" way, as it is possible. Result is worth seeing in 2 cases: 1) this is your first sci-fi movie, and basic physics laws seem like something too difficult for you to understand - then you will enjoy "Sphere" as very dynamic action film with great actors.2) you like to watch trash movies sometimes - this is your choice #1! There's no a minute in "Sphere" where you don't find stupid moment.Everything - plot, characters, scenery - is idiotic. Do you know how to decipher a message from unknown creature? Morpheus says: "It's so simple!" Just translate it to binary code(should spectator be impressed by this complex word?). Still don't understand? Just project "qwerty" keyboard layout onto sphere, and set every letter into accordance to number in spiral order, starting from "g". Don't you understand why aliens keyboard is spheric, the layout is qwerty, and the language is English? Because it's not alien, it's just Morpheus' imagination that turned into reality! Too many red pills, I suppose :-) Some hardware works wrong? You know, it's because of saturation effect - helium reacts with hardware.Submarine starts to sink, and water floods into it? Let Morpheus sleep, while other people are trying to press a red lever, which will stop the flood, but start a fire (then a fire is turned off by a green button %-) ) What is water pressure? Nobody in the movie ever heard of it, moreover - it seems like it doesn't exist at all.The end is just brilliant - to prevent other people of asking them of what happened, they just decided to forget everything! AND THEY DID!!!1 Few words about actors: Hoffman doesn't play his role - he just reads his text. For example, when he talks about jellyfishes, that killed his comrade, it looks like he tells a fairy tale. No emotions on his face thru the entire movie were noticed. Other actors are not very bad here, still it's too far for their best.I give an Excellent mark - I can't remember laughing so much for few years; and I recommend "Sphere" to all lovers of trash movies! Trust me, you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

Especially from Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson. There were times when the dialogue was so interesting, and deep (no pun intended), that I couldn't help but rewind the video. I have read the book, and after seeing the movie, I can say (for once), that the movie was just as accurate, and entertaining as the book.There was probably nothing that I could say bad about this. Which, in turn, makes me wonder why people would have gave it such a low rating. Everything was good, if not excellent! The casting, the acting, the score, the sets, everything! Absolutely terrific!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one whom has spent nearly 30 years trying to "break in" to the movie business, when I see films as bad as SPHERE, I have to ask "Why?" How do such incredible wastes of talent and money take place, when this industry is so "discriminating?" Maybe, it is because, once one has "connections" and "clout," it is TOO easy to sell "bean counters" on financing garbage. The primary problem with SPHERE can be summarized in one word, "story." In my 45 years of viewing films, I have seen many very good films with bad acting (almost any female role directed by Cecil B. DeMille) or poor production values (IN HARMS WAY and AIRPORT come immediately to mind). However, in my 45 years of evaluating films, I have NEVER seen a good film with a poor script. SPHERE is baffling, confusing, obscure, boring and pointless. The story adds up to NADA. Were it not for the production values and the actors, this would be an even worse film than VIRUS. Thinking about the worthwhile projects talented (but unconnected) film makers could have made with the money wasted on these two turkeys almost makes one weep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the preview for Sphere over and over again, I should've known that something bad was up. The preview had no tension in it at all! At the end, I wanted to shout "Gimmmie an S!" and so on. Undaunted by my doubting self I went to see the movie anyway. I think I should've stayed home and reread the book. The film lacked any tension that being several thousand feet below the Pacific should provide. The title cards placed in the film threw it off balance. It reminded me of "Frasier," but on that show, they work! Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson were game enough to go along with this soggy mess, and Sharon Stone hasn't made a decent movie since Casino. The usually talented Barry Levinson was out of his element here. The film should've been handled by someone who knew the intricacies of working in a wet for wet environment. Maybe someone like, James Cameron? He would've been a fine choice, but he was too busy making a ship sink. If you want a good underwater adventure from Michael Crichton, read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess there just weren't enough Dinosaurs. Or Squid. Or whatever. The fact is, people go into Sphere expecting a plain and simple suspense flick, and the fact Sphere is, well...something MORE...that has a lot to do with the critical reception.It's very difficult to talk about Sphere without revealing crucial elements of the plot, but the most important parts can all be summed up very simply; as a fresh take on the old theme of the self-destructive nature of man. Sphere is not "The Abyss". Sphere is not "The Andromeda Strain". Sphere is half Terminal Man and half Lord of the Flies; one of the movie's defining moments occurs in an argument over whether or not food has been stolen. There's some gadgetry and a fair bit of suspense and action, but it's not the ultimate drive.The acting is excellent. Hoffman almost seems typecast (you can typecast Dustin Hoffman?), but Stone is excellent, and Jackson's detached and surreal performance is quite different from his usual machismo. It doesn't take a lot to make you feel sorry for for Ted (the script does that well enough) but Schieber's one of those guys you point to and say "Hey, I've seen him!" (most likely in Scream) so the role is well covered. Also, one of the supporting members, Peter Coyote, injects quite a bit of life into one of the duller characters, Harold Barners, who Chrichton didn't give a whole lot of attention to in the book, as I recall. The score is very moody and additive, and very well done: but it's not of the kind that you can seperate the two and still have an excellent soundtrack, which is unfortunate.Sphere is not faultless. As I and just about everyone else in the world has said, this isn't exactly the apex of Hoffman's career, though he's done worse...don't even get me started on Outbreak. In playing with Chrichton's storyline, a minor inconsistency has been introduced into the movie's continuity; that is, all the complicated theory involed doesn't entirely make sense anymore (Chrichton is EXTREMELY careful about this sort of thing in his books). Still, you ultimately have to put entertainment before miniscule points of credibility; and you're not likely to notice it unless you're really searching.All in all, though, Sphere is a very good movie with not much going against it. I would encourage anyone disuaded by critical response to pay attention to the facts: an all-star cast, an excellent director and basis on a Chrichton novel that does NOT involve Dinosaurs gotta be worth at least a 99 cent rental, eh? Here, you get to keep them for a week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film basically covers 'The Abyss' territory, minus that film's awe. Here Sharon Stone poses and tries hard to show emotion, but nothing comes through. Dustin Hoffman extends his 'Outbreak' performance, while Samuel L. Jackson at least has a showy role. The Sci-Fi plot, if you do follow, is intriguing. But this film is way too complicated for it's own good. How Barry 'Rain Man' Levinson ended up directing this is anyone's guess. I gave it an IMDb '5', for decent Sci-Fi + good effects - so so acting and plot. Is this one of Sharon Stone's worst performances?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This would be one of those Crichton novel-based flicks that takes you a little by surprise. Similar to "The Andromeda Strain" and "The Jurassic Park", "Sphere" provides that strange irritability I usually get when I realize how 10 minutes of Hollywood's mass-market imagination can override your own painstakingly detailed interpretation of character and setting. That being said, I do think Levinson et al. did a good job with the time constraints of a normal movie. If you've read the book (especially if it's been awhile, and you forget what happens next :) then I would recommend this one. The two aspects I really loved about the book, and thankfully the movie are the extreme subtleties that flash on the screen for a few seconds, but will prove plot-twisting later in the story and, of course, the ending. I think this movie offers a nicely grounded sci-fi story with interesting possibilities. Hopefully you aren't looking for a purely edge-of-your-seat special effects thriller because, like Crichton's books and _some_ films, if you like to think you'll enjoy the whole film.</fullReview>

Yapping on the intercom is not an effective way to help someone.I can forgive the lack of believability in deciphering the computer gibberish - unfortunately, that's stock-common in sci-fi movies nowadays (but why can't movie makers figure out that aside from being ridiculous, it's just plain boring watching people noodle around in front of a computer monitor?) But, why can none of these uber-PhD's figure out that Jackson has been seriously affected by the sphere? How can a prominent psychologist not see that he's being manipulated? And the lame resolution at the ending was just garbage; after displaying a complete lack of ability to effectively deal with the phenomenon at the bottom of the ocean, how would they have had any capacity to suddenly deal with it topside? Not to mention that it was just a letdown, plain and simple.</fullReview>

Granted, "Sphere" isn't a movie for those who prefer to plop their brain on the chair next to them while sucking in a dazzling visual charade devoid of plot, but for those of us who like to get involved in a story, it's hard to do better than this. Talk about sharp dialect, and plot twists. And then there's the tension, the tightness of the whole setting. Just like when Samuel L. Jackson says, "we're going to die down here, yo know." so matter-of-factly. Yikes... if that's not what you're into, fine, go check out "Spiceworld". But don't slam a movie for aspiring to be something more. "Sphere" is a movie for those of us who love a good story. And it's hard to do better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface of the water, a huge vessel rests on the ocean floor. Rushed to the scene is a group of American scientists who descend to the depths of the sea to investigate this astonishing discovery. What they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a massive spaceship, undamaged from it's fall from the sky-and at least three hundred years old.....Three great stars, a wonderful director, and an interesting concept with a sort of Event Horizon and Solaris hybrid, sounded wonderful.And while its watchable for its lengthy duration, it never really hits the heights it aims for. Everybody is influenced by the Sphere, and they start to manipulate the environment, with Sea Serpents, Jellyfish, and even books.Now the main problem with this movie is that it was released too soon after Event Horizon, and instead of going all deep and mystical, also known as catering for the masses, and going for the scares instead, and makes a mockery of itself.So instead of it being an enthralling thriller with brains, we get a half hearted science fiction horror with a wonderful cast, which makes it strangely watchable.Any film that has Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L Jackson talking science versus religion one minute, and then fighting their imaginations the next, has to be watched.And the ending is ridiculous, the three stars literally hold hands and forget the whole movie. They actually do that.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I watched this movie last night and I couldn't leave the room or turn of the TV (although I was very sleepy) until it was over. The thing is, it kept me up and I kept it in my head even after it was over.For me, the action was predictable here and there. In the first part, I could swear it would turn into that kind of a movie where a group of people start a journey together and, one by one, they get killed, in the end to remain only the main characters, that find a way to survive miraculously, get rescued and go back to their lives. Also, one thing I could predict was when Norman discovers that the "alien" was actually named "Harry", not "Jerry". Then, my guessing came true, Harry was the one who created the disasters. Remember those cartoons where someone created monsters during sleep and had to be kept awake, or the ones in which they faced monsters that weren't actually real, but were made by their imagination? I used to love those cartoons. Just the way I love this movie. What's to love about them is the thing that it explores the human mind, the power of imagination, the thing that happens when people face their fears. Everyone has a fear, even if they don't admit it. What would happen if everyone could bring their fear to life? Scary thought, huh? Another thing I liked about it was the logic it worked on, the suspense, and the way that action is combined every now and then are funny lines which relax the situation like " Interviewer: I see you have a scar on your neck. Beth: Car accident. Interviewer: Were you drinking? Beth: Yeah - but I wasn't driving." or "Barnes: Ask him for his last name. Harry: What? Barnes: I want a full name for my report. I'm not putting in my report that I lost a crew member on a deep-sat expedition to find an alien named "Jerry." " Overall, it's not an Oscar nominee, but it's watchable, not only for the SciFi lovers, but for any viewer who wants that kind of movie that keeps him in front of the screen.</fullReview>

I wish they took us inside the sphere for once but they didn't... And that i would say scuffed a little.

		<fullReview>'Sphere' is gripping, chilling watch that presents an interesting idea laced with dark dread.The movie's setting 1000ft below sea level immediately gives it an otherworldly feel and a eerie foreboding. The film-making compliments and enhances the feel of the movie and an excellent main cast present a set of believable characters. Given that the movie is based on a book, ('Sphere' by Michael Crichton) the script is decent and it would interesting to see how the movie compares to the book, particularly with other decent adaptations of Crichtons books, e.g. Jurassic Park, in the ether.Pleasingly, initial impressions of alien encounters and time travel are squashed as the movie develops into a psychological thriller/horror that presents the ever-interesting investigation into the human psyche. The slightly more faint of heart may just find themselves switching on lights, locking doors, and cuddling up with a child-hood comfort after watching this and some will definitely be unnerved. I must confess that even after a few viewings I still come away from this feeling slightly edgy and that almost never happens with me.This gripping and chilling movie is a worthy addition to the ranks of other sci-fi horrors like 'Event Horizon' that I personally feel has been under-rated. It keeps you thoroughly interested and firmly in your seat throughout and for a few minutes after for fear of your own fears.It is a definite watch for all those who like their moves tense, eerie, and chilling.</fullReview>

I do agree though that the 'action sequences' in the second part of the film where a little 'over the top' and that they could have been done better. Also, I agree that the ending could have been better too.However, all things considered, I found the claustrophobic atmosphere created during the film and the very interesting premise to be enough to produce a very entertaining motion picture.

		<fullReview>Here's finally a sci-fi movie that doesn't include the classic "guts-slime-snot-drool" combination that makes movies like "Alien" unwatchable to me. Atmospheric, suspenseful and claustrophobic, "Sphere" is based on a good idea, although not entirely original. CGI is used sparingly to a greater effect, and I always appreciate a movie that I can watch safely after having eaten. An unseen enemy is always far more frightening and intriguing than? let's say, a computer generated monster or an insect-like alien drooling all over the place. You get my point. Now, for the bad parts? The acting is mediocre at best, with the exception of Samuel L. Jackson, who delivers some genuinely creepy moments. Sharon Stone, who strikes me as the strong, independent type, is terribly miscast as the vulnerable woman who got dumped by her boyfriend. Another thing is the complete lack of chemistry between her and Dustin Hoffman, which makes their relationship feel contrived. And then, there is Queen Latifah, who's from another movie, and acts like it. The dialogues are pretty bad, sometimes downright laughable. The astrophysicist's lines always sound painfully dull and clichéd, so the actor has nothing to work with. "Sphere" is not in the league of the Russian "Solaris" or "2001- A Space Odyssey" by any means, and it doesn't attempt to place itself in that category. But it's one of the better Sci-Fi movies out there, much better then a lot of the over-CGI-ed, over-hyped "blockbusters" featuring brave American presidents saving human kind from nasty aliens. Thanks to Samuel L. Jackson and some good suspense, particularly one scene involving a Jules Verne novel, "Sphere" is still entertaining, despite its flaws.</fullReview>

What they get down in the depths are not what they expected.The actors are what saved this movie pretty much even though some of the dialog was terrible. I can pretty much watch Jackson in every movie he's in.I thought this movie is a bore. I wanted to fall asleep in some scenes. I don't do that in many movies at all. This may be a first actually.

I suspect much of the negative criticism is to do with expectations unfulfilled, or confusion over genre ?part science-fiction, part psychological thriller, part action drama, but a little too intensely each of these things. Not having seen it when it first came out, I viewed the film on DVD yesterday, with no expectations or prejudices. I found it to be quite a fascinating film, and certainly excellently made in all departments. Its one major flaw is one of construction, which gives thought-provoking arguments precisely at the time one wants action and dramatic resolution. There are also some character issues that do not quite work, or are muddled, but the performances themselves are actually as fine as the script allows, and the atmosphere is wonderfully claustrophobic. There is really a bit of everything in this film, (shades of "Alien", "The Abyss", "Forbidden Planet", "2001") and the underwater effects and the sound-mixing are especially superb. A film that so very nearly works on all levels.</fullReview>

Honestly, I believe it was a pretty good movie, and more could have been done with it. Some of the scenes weren't quite that great, like the montages of the panicking towards the end with the bomb, but it was really actually alright.It was insightful, and...fake. But that's okay, because I was quite intrigued for some time, and I know others would be as well.I have one concern, however. I'd like to know why/how when Norman figured out the correct code, revealing Harry to be Jerry, the 'e' in "name" didn't change to an 'a' but the one in Jerry did. That's really one of the main things with the computer transmissions that got me. There are a ton of other things like the "copout" ending and the unbelievable astrophysics that are claimed by the characters to have taken place, but those, for me, were somewhat easily ignored. It was the transmissions thing that got me.Plus, throughout the movie, I was hoping to see a giant squid. Disappointing....</fullReview>

Aliens of course, but at the bottom of some ocean abyss and some spacecraft that got buried deep down there and that can only liberate itself with the psychic energy of some humans who it attracts into a sphere and then suck up dry: it feeds and regenerates on the fears of three human beings that it has been able to invite inside that living sphere. Stephen King's Tommyknockers are not very far. And the black hole in the cosmos, the force that takes over the computers and machine of the submarine of course recalls the Space Odyssey to our minds. And the deep sea abyss, the monstrous octopus, the submarines ring many bells that summon Jules Verne in a nearly obsessive way. But there is something missing in this complex fabric. It is too contradictory to be satisfactory. How come this force that can only liberate itself from its wrecked position will use the three people it manages to invade to destroy all the others and then one another? That living sphere can only take off if these three human beings join their minds to erase their memory of what happened and donate their mental power to the sphere. If they succeeded in destroying one another the sphere would be trapped forever. So why manipulate them into that kind of an ending that liberates the sphere for sure but that is absurd like some kind of divine power that comes like a streak of out of place absurdity? What's more the woman of the trio has been manipulated into setting so powerful a bomb that everything will get destroyed miles away and around, including of course the three humans trapped down under the water. All that is illogical too. It is not enough to say that this poor being, but is it a being, has been trapped under the water for three centuries to explain these discrepancies. A better job could have been devised more in the line of Jules Verne or Stephen King or Kubrick, but probably not the three without counting the aliens and their eggs. That makes things slightly too labyrinthine and sibylline, enigmatic and mysterious and it destroys the utter pleasure we expect: to be confronted to something inescapable, something so logical that it takes a stronger, hence human logic to defeat it, and yet only for some kind of short resting interlude.

It's ridiculous, and considering that the team's ability to withstand psychological stress was paramount to the plot, even more so. I got so tired of Hoffman's "underacting" on this thing, the way he mumbled most of his lines and moved his mouth as if his teeth were wired together, that I'd really had it with him by the time he freaked out and became an hysterical idiot. I'm really surprised that so few people got a similar impression. It was most unfortunate that the movie relied so heavily on Hoffman's character because his performance was seriously flawed. He was completely incompetent as a psychologist and actually provoked "Jerry" in his lame attempts to humor and control him. As another commenter pointed out, "Jerry" kept telling him to, "stop calling me Jerry," and "the brilliant psychologist" couldn't understand even that much. By the way, that blow-dried hairstyle of his is the pits. Whatever happened to Benjamin Braddock and Ratso Rizzo? Stone irked me at one point, when she was convinced Coyote was messing with their heads and counseled Hoffman to ignore his orders, but by the end, her distrust of authority figures is explained (Hoffman was once her therapist and had taken advantage of her sexually). Otherwise, she was OK, except that she wasn't nearly as glamorous or as sexy as in most of her roles. Jackson probably did the best acting job of the four so-called doctors, although he was asleep much of the time (the "astrophysicist" who was burned alive when the giant squid attacked was another pain in the tail, not as annoying as Hoffman but almost). As for the plot, I thought a thorough exploration of the buried ship would have been quite interesting, especially considering the nifty surround video recorder they encountered in the cockpit, but the filmmakers basically ignored that possibility and concentrated on the sphere instead. The idea that going into the sphere made their thoughts, dreams, and fantasies become reality was an interesting idea and led to some real chaos aboard the undersea habitat, especially near the end of the movie when they became utterly confused and unable to escape the explosion that was about to destroy everything. I have to admit that this movie was good enough to engage me to some degree, despite its annoying aspects, and for that, I give it four stars and concede that it could rate even five. Of course, I want to like it because I bought the VHS at Hastings for three bucks, so I'm stuck with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like sci-fi films. I like Michael Crichton. I hate sphere. Great idea, but a terrible film. And the SPOIER part now: It turns out the code is wrong and alien's name is Harry, not Jerry. Surely that would have been obvious every time the alien used the letter "a". Example: "I am happy" would have read "I em heppy". The team were all supposed to have multiple PHDs and none of them noticed this! Also: the screenplay was very poor. No exact quotes here, but it went something like "What is this thing?" "I don't know what this thing is" "Well, whoever built this thing did a great job on the thing". Very annoying. They knew it was a ship... I sometimes try to watch Sphere, because it SHOULD be good. But it just cuts too many credibility corners (and good sci-fi doesn't have too!). Positives; Peter Coyote was a good character and the space navigation displays were nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why Crichton stories seldom make good movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sphere certainly has its moments, and the high caliber cast enhances the film's overall quality quite a bit. the beginning of the movie is quite engaging, and the highpoint in terms of suspense is reached when the alien intelligence reveals itself and turns out to have the mind of a vengeful child. however, thereafter it all goes a bit downhill, as others have remarked. i've noticed that this observation is made with astonishing frequency in connection with films based on Crichton novels. it's always 'it started out good, but then...' or 'it had potential, but...' or 'it could have been so much better'. i have in the meantime read several of Crichton's novels and come to the conclusion that this phenomenon has probably little to do with the inability of film makers to do his books justice. it is the stories themselves that harbor this weakness. they're all full of promise that remains unfulfilled. i can't even put my finger on it with any precision...what is missing is a certain 'je-ne-sais-quoi'. apparently, this gets transported to movies that are based on Crichton novels quite flawlessly...they all leave you with a sense of what could have been, but wasn't. all that said, Sphere is certainly watchable, and at times quite suspenseful. it joins a long list of 'hard' sci-fi movies with an interesting premise that failed to attain their full potential ('Event Horizon' and 'Abyss' being other examples).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two versions: which one did you see?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to give a spoiler warning but I promise to make it light. I'm writing this review because I saw two different cuts of this movie, and one was definitely better than the other.The first half the movie seems the same in both versions, so I won't comment on it. But the climax and ending is very different. Just so you can identify which one you saw, without me spoiling too much, try to remember if you saw the sphere at the very end of the movie. If you didn't, you saw the crappy version. The climax of them trying to escape near the end is cut down to barely there, and it seems like although this was done to put more time on the plot, I find it suffers because you don't really understand the full impact of their "powers". For those who saw the bigger, better ending, you know what these "powers" start to do while they try to escape.While both versions of this movie are average and don't really deserve a viewing unless you're a fan of the genre, I have to admit one version definitely lacks thrill near the end. If you didn't see the cut where you see the sphere in the end (and it would be obvious), it might explain why it wasn't quite as enjoyable as it could have been. I give the dull cut a 5/10, and the sphere cut a 7/10 - so I'll vote halfway at 6/10.</fullReview>

It also seemed like the effects were blah as well, not that they have to be super cgi polished... just effective. One thing that really was not carried over in the film was the visceral feeling of the book. What the book portrayed as a echoy, cold, claustrophobic phonebooth of a ship was filmed as a brightly lit medical center. Whats frustrating is seeing content from the same author go into one movie making machine and come out as a timeless piece of cinema that people plan owning the DVD in the future AS the leave the theater, thank Mr. Speilburg.

The three major stars survive, and everyone else dye! I wonder why? If all the actors would had been unkown the end would had been more surprising. But is obvious, just obvious! Not a good movie.

Having seen in on HBO, I can say it was not FULLY predictable, and that the characters ARE engaging.The movie is, like a lot of science fiction movies, about the mind. It's, essentially, summed up by Jackson's line: "We have the power to forget." We have the power to decide what is important and what is not.It's not a great movie -- but it's interesting and involving. Give it a shot. There isn't any suspense, unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All star cast including Dustin Hoffman(Hook), Sharon Stone(Basic Instinct), Samuel L Jackson(Star Wars:The Phantom Menace) and Liev Schreiber(Scream).I have never seen a film that made me think that Hoffman was a brilliant actor. He was adequate in Mad City, but not excellent. Stone is another doubtful one. Jackson is always on top form as he is in this, but even he cannot hold up the other disappointing leads. And finally Schreiber. One of my favourite actors. Creepy in Scream, Scream 2 and Phantoms, and amazing in Ransom, he is one of the greatest supporting actors of his time. I recommend everything he is in. But enough about the actors and more about the film. There is hardly any plot, except their sub marine is subject to unknown attacks and each crew member starts to 'freak out' and blame the others. The audience thinks Jackson is the baddie, Stone blames Hoffman, Schreiber blames Jackson and Hoffman wonders around going'"I can't explain it...sorry". But despite it's flaws, Sphere may appeal heavily to some sci-fi fans. Hoffman and Stone stink, but the rest of the cast are outstanding and some of the film is truly scary. Rating=3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a movie that seemed to have everything going for it....great cast, great director, big budget and an intriguing premise from yet another Michael Crichton novel....so what went wrong??? It all starts out promisingly enough, building our interest nicely. But by the midway point, the story is turning circles and we start to get very impatient waiting for the payoff...when it finally arrives, it's such a complete fizzle that it pretty much destroys what little goodwill we felt for the film. Some movies can get away with not fully explaining what went on and why (the aforementioned "Event Horizon" is a great example....it had a fantastically creepy atmosphere and the ability to make us feel something dreadfully evil could happen at any minute...so we forgave it its sometimes confusing structure) "Sphere" has all the ingredients of a classy production, but the execution is so stiff and sterile that there's not much tension generated and at 130 minutes, it's a long ride to nowhere. Do yourself a favor if you want to see a truly scary film....rent "Event Horizon" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the book when I first read it a few years back, and I always wanted to see a movie made from it. I remember thinking when I saw " The ABYSS ", that it would be great if JAMES CAMERON made a film out of " THE SPHERE " novel.Now the movie has finally come out. Unfortunately not by James C.This turned out to be a very strange movie, because although technically there is nothing wrong with it, somehow it doesn´t have the atmosphere and suspense of the novel. We don´t even care too much for the characters either.It could have been made more suspenseful because the book has excellent dialogue suspense situations wich look a bit forgotten in the movie. Maybe that´s the trouble in adapting a book like this.Anyway, if we put the book aside for a moment, " SPHERE ", the movie isn´t bad at all. At least is different from the rest. It might not be for every one, but if you like science fiction there are much worse things you can watch. It might not be a spectacular blockbuster movie, but it´s a good sci-fi one.The casting is a bit diferent from what I imagined it would be, but all do a good job with their characters, particularly SHARON STONE, which I'm sure will surprise many people yet.The special effects are a bit discrete. But maybe that´s a good thing. Most of the times we don´t remember they´re there. This is clearly not the usual Hollywood special effects movie.At first look, you might be disappointed with the locations too, because they don´t look much imaginative if you´re expecting visuals like those in " THE ABYSS ", but that only contributes for the realistic look of this movie.One annoying thing are the underwater scenes. Most of the time we can´t see a thing of what´s happenning because the water is always so dark and murky. I have seen this movie three times and I still can´t figure out the shape either of the underwater base or the alien ship. We can´t see a thing! This was a rather strange production design choice to say the least. Maybe they had no budget for better special effects.Anyway, is this a bad sci-fi movie ? Not at all, but it could have been great.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, part of what made the book great was the interaction between the minds of the characters and the action. The movie does not convey that same sense of intensity of the inner workings of each character. Perhaps that could have been improved by better acting, but the acting was on the whole not bad. I thought Dustin Hoffman was great, but miscast. The same could be said of Sharon Stone. Jackson was probably the best character, and he fit the role as well. On the whole, though, the film portrayal of a primarily psychological book seemed too slow and confusing (at least as far as why things were happening).

There turns out to be an influential "sphere" on board. Exactly what it is, and why and how it got there was not adequately explained. But I guess if we just accept it at face value we're OK. Watch it when you have enough peace and quiet to follow the dialogue. One thing I came away with was a greater appreciation of Sharon Stone's acting ability. Never liked her much in the past, but she was pretty decent in a role that was not too demanding. Actually, none of the roles were too demanding. Either that or else the actors were just going through the motions for whatever reason, but the performances seemed uninspired at best.</fullReview>

That said, I have to say that I LOVED the scenes where the crew are watching the "alien" ship's holographic log entries. Very cool. I also like the whole concept of "the sphere", but was disappointed that we didn't really see much of it apart from the few scenes where some of the crew are absorbed into it. Actually, the sphere, conceptually, reminded me of the black monolith in 2001, especially since the movie never really goes into much detail as to its true nature. Sam Jackson was good, as usual. Bottom line, while not perfect, it's an entertaining sci-fi movie that's worth a try.</fullReview>

So when there's a rip-off of a rip-off I think there's some serious problems. The only interesting people were Hoffman and Jackson. Stone sucks and Liev Schreiber was boring. This movie stinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the Sphere?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing to me that with all the talent associated with this movie, they NEVER explained WHAT the Sphere was. I forced myself to watch it twice to see if I missed something the first time but the only thing I miss is 4 hours of my life. Maybe Michael Crichton explained it in the book which I didn't read. I don't know, and still haven't figured it out. Sphere is the kind of sci-fi movie that gives the genre a bad reputation. I was EXTREMELY dissappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising start, quickly degenerates.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started out fairly promising, with an interesting time travel twist, but quickly degenerated into a standard horror / suspense thriller. I think they tried to get too much into it (particularly the whole manifestation angle) and got lost. The twists and turns begin to overwhelm each other and the viewer and leaves the viewer scratching their heads trying to sort it all out. Finally, the ending was a little too pat. I really wanted to like this movie, but it became a chore to watch, just waiting for it to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I began watching this movie, the first thing I thought was: " Oh, no not another Event Horizon" But after a while, the movie started getting more and more interesting, specially when the team discovers that the "alien" spaceship is not so alien. It thought: "Wow. Cool!! That original", but then it turned into your typical claustrophobic-alien clone where all of the characters but the hero(es) begin to get killed one by one. Yawn. That "manifestation" power the characters aquire is just plain dumb, and the plot has more holes than a gruyere( how do you spell that??) cheese.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good book, bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About twenty minutes into Sphere, it occurred to me that the movie was being fairly faithful to the book. This surprised me, as most movies vary at least a bit (Jurassic Park, for example, has any number of large differences) from the details of the book. The only problem was that while the movie was being done faithfully, it was not being done well.Samuel L. Jackson delivered yet another great performance. I'm used to that. What surprised me was how flat everyone else was. Dustin Hoffman, one of the best actors ever, appeared trapped behind insipid dialogue and Sharon Stone sounded like she was reading a speech as a hostage taker pointed a gun at her head. Liev Schrieber often seemed to be "doing" Hoffman.The movie does have some genuine chills (the water snake comes to mind) although the giant squid sequence lacked the same intensity it had in the book. Jackson was fabulous and almost saved this movie. Unfortunately, he couldn't. I give Sphere a D and can't say I'd recommend it to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old School Scifi Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sphere" is a film for fans of the old scifi genre before special effects took over the screen. Don't get me wrong; the special effects are amazing, but the story doesn't base itself exclusively on them. Instead, most of the thrill comes from the tense atmosphere and the slowly unraveling mystery of the unknown.Visually it's much like "Alien", "Outland" and even the recent remake of "Solaris". It's dark, cold and tight. But, as with the other movies I mentioned, we never get a feeling of total claustrophobia since the sets are enormous. Instead, we get a feeling of crushing weight from the vastness that surrounds. What better place to achieve this feeling than the bottom of the sea?I won't talk about plot, since that's half the fun. I think it's best that you piece it together slowly as it's intended. But just in case you have preconceived notions, it's not about sea monsters, it's not about space ships, and it's not about aliens, although all of these elements figure in. So don't expect the story to center around any one of them or you'll be disappointed. Instead, I'd say to keep your eye on the personalities of each individual and the character development, superbly acted in each case by Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Samuel Jackson and Liev Schreiber. They're not your standard action heroes; they have faults, quirks and weaknesses. But this is precisely what the movie is about.Like I said earlier, the special effects are fantastic, but I could just as easily imagine this movie with all the special effects cut out. It could practically be done as a play, and that, to me, is the mark of a great movie.Last but definitely not least, I have to mention the amazing musical score by Elliot Goldenthal. At times majestic, eerie, serene or spastic, it's the perfect compliment to this complex thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the vague beginning of this, I could not help but be attracted to it. The gradual revealing of what exactly it was all about had me instantly interested, and that did not fade at any point. Frankly, it's engaging throughout the two hour, ten minute running time. The pacing is spot-on, neither boring nor overwhelming the viewer. It also *needs* to be said... this is utterly hilarious. Not a single attempt at being funny falls flat or seems forced, and I was laughing a good deal of the time during my viewing, and there's not a shadow of a doubt in my mind as to the fact that they were all intentional. This is entertaining and exciting, and numerous scenes will have you glued to your seat, and your eyes constantly on the screen. It masterfully builds a claustrophobic atmosphere, not to mention one of strong paranoia. The plot is well-written and compelling, with unexpected twists and a lot of originality to it. Every acting performance is convincing, and, for anyone who's worried, no, Latifah does not do her shctick(honestly, I think this precedes her doing that in movie roles), and she's genuinely not at all annoying. The five leads are all talented, and they do excellent work here. Hoffman's dry delivery of the jokes written for him is *golden*. The characters are credible and reasonably fleshed out. Production values leave little to be desired, and the special effects hold up well enough. The editing and cinematography are great. There is relatively frequent mild to moderate language, as well as some disturbing/frightening content. Most people will be able to watch this. I recommend this to any fan of those who took part in making it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I encourage people to see this film. When I first saw this movie, I was about 7 yrs old, and was so scared by certain scenes that i hid behind my mom with my ears plugged for the rest of the film praying it would end fast so i could go to bed (no lie, the entire time). The only reason I bother to mention this is because the memory of those brief scenes kept me from watching this movie and many others like it for years. And I know many people who are the same way. But "The Sphere" was on TV recently and I was amazed at how it seemed like a completely different genre and how interesting it was. I encourage people (especially the ones like me) to not let specific scenes ruin a movie for you because you could be missing out on something great. If you've seen this movie at a young age and didn't like it - give it another go.</fullReview>

This film is excellent in every aspect, and if you're going to compare a film to it's book of course it's not going to be same because you're dealing with two different mediums. If one forget's the book and watches the film then you will enjoy this film a lot more. OK the performances are fantastic, the story is amazing,the pace of the film is perfect, the film soundtrack is also excellent and really adds to the depth of the film, the plot is amazing. I pretty much enjoyed every aspect of this film, it kept me thoroughly interested, with not one boring aspect. The great thing about this film is it makes you think, it's one of those films that gets you and and never lets go, the director certainly knows how to tell a story. I also really enjoyed the dialogue between the character's and the fact that as the characters connect the dots the audience is there doing the same. Overall a great film, and if you haven't checked it out yet I suggest you do so, I give it 10/10, because I couldn't find one thing I disliked about this film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie for a couple reasons, the first of which is the constant dialogue between characters about space travel(physics of, when it will happen, how its possible), and the "sphere" (what it is, and its intelligence). The second reason I love this movie, is because of its dry humor. For instance, When the crew is getting ready to go down to the spacecraft all of the crew members are trying as hard as they can, to go, by telling the doctor how they're fine . All except Jackson's character who is telling the doctor how he had reconstructive knee surgery.I also love the time travel plot, "If it's from the future why is it an unknown event?"All around a great movie to think about, and to spark your imagination.I know it's listed under horror, but it's not scary at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent but surprisingly underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I saw Barry Levinson's 'Sphere' I have been unable to understand why it has received so little critical acclaim, especially with such great start like Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone and Samuel Jackson. Sure, the touch of surrealism in the script makes the film unusual but the story, direction and acting are good enough to give it more accolades than it has received so far. I could not help but compare it to Ridley Scott's 'Alien' which has a similar claustrophobic feel but with a clearly defined aggressor in shape of the creature. With 'Sphere' the antagonist is less obvious and there is a touch of Shakespeare's 'Tempest' in the overall ethos of the film. The outcome at the end is left to the imagination of the viewer to some extent and that is probably why many critics were disappointed. But for me, it remains a highly unusual, well made science fiction film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. Being a Crichton hollywoodization, there are quite a few logical holes, but these fail to break the seamless flow of the plot. Actually this is the part I really liked because despite the length of the novel, the directors didn't push anything in and allowed for the viewer to process the facts along with the characters. However this goes away in the final scene when the three quickly put together more pieces of the puzzle to take the final decision. Of the cast, Hoffman is pretty good as a scientist under pressure and Jackson does his cool part while Shneiber is there too. Stone fails to make her character believable though, which is a shame and frankly by the end I wished she was one of those who die. Oh well. Maybe next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mysterious spaceship over 300 years old is found at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. A team of different scientists are called in to investigate it. The scientists include an arrogant mathematician (Jackson), an astrophysicist who tries to get all the credit (Screiber), an unstable biologist (Stone), a short-tempered military commander (Coyote) and a psychologist (Hoffman) who maintains order. These scientist are put in an underwater habitat and investigate the spaceship where they discover a sphere, which soon after their discovery, strange events occur...Great mix of characters, interesting environment in which eerie and strange things happen, spontaneous and unexpected action sequences, good acting from a great cast, chilling (and startling) atmosphere and a good story though some scenes are confusing and don't make sense but I recommend to read the book by Michael Crichton by the same name on which the movie is based which will help to clear some points.I recommend this movie to whoever enjoys sci-fi thrillers and it won't let down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somewhere along the line, Hollywood started making a lot of movies no one wanted to see. Maybe in the 1990s... '80s, maybe. That's the predicament in which the American movie industry finds itself today: People have finally REALIZED the studios are making tons of movies no one wants to see. So, nobody goes to see them."Sphere" doesn't really fall into that category, although by 1998 movies were already headed down the slippery stinker slope. A lot of people wanted to see "Sphere." It was AFTER they saw it that they realized they didn't want to see it.It's filled with a bunch of deep-middle-age stars in a maritime setting, bumbling through a script that makes them look like over-indulged 12-year-olds. I know what you're thinking: "Love Boat," right? Well... "Sphere" is cut from the same cloth, but it has none of the poetic sensibility or mature introspection of "Love Boat." Somebody should have called Red Buttons' agent.For a science fiction movie with horror overtones, there is no suspense. None! My favorite scene is Peter Coyote and Liev Schreiber watching Queen Latifa get gummed alive by jellyfish. They just pile around a monitor and... watch. They don't jump into wetsuits and rush to help her, they don't try to alert the rest of the crew. Coyote comes off particularly lame, like he's thinking, "Yeah, maybe I could do something... but it would be dangerous... and let's face it: she's FAT." Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone are all in there, giving their performances all the zip of stewed carrots. They all play geniuses - GENIUSES - sent deep in the ocean to investigate an alien craft containing a big, slurpy ball. Big budget, no bounce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the movie on TV and it didn't seem so poorly written. Actually the plot develops in a simple, gradual and logical way. There's no point in trying to classify it as a sci-fi adventure or psychological thriller: it's just a story, and a good one, with a complex plot that keeps you hooked. Only, some developments are not spelled out and you have to read between the lines. There is a point in which there seem to be a missing scene (when Beth return from the starship) but there are not too many questions left unanswered. The story focuses on the "contact team" and on what is happening today, not so much on the starship, the sphere and the time-travel story line. Acting is good, realistic, and doesn't get in the way of storytelling. In some scenes, Sharon Stone is reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver in Alien.</fullReview>

This film is a waste of great talent. Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone are in this movie and why they would agree to do this stupid film is beyond me. The movie is some sort of silly science fiction about some alien space ship that crashes in the ocean, sound like The Abyss? Queen Latifah is in this movie, and like almost all African-Americans in Hollywood films she is killed of early. The movie starts out so good, but why did it get so bad? Could they not afford good writers halfway through production? I am baffled to be perfectly honest. Anyway Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson have done some great films, this is not one of them, watch something else, it can't be anywhere half as bad as this one. (unless it is one of those stupid teen movies) </fullReview>

Just on that moment a sea storm begins and they can't get of their underwatercenter for a time. In the center people get killed and it becomes a weird psychological kind of movie. Than it starts to be scary, the killer is unknown, most attention goes to the guy who's been in the ball who's acting weird, and it's scary too because of the fact that they have nowhere to go.

		<fullReview>Where to begin? I know! How about:This movie sucked.You know a movie is bad when you are actually GLAD people die painfully in the film.One huge deficiency in this movie (and others like it) is this: retarded writers, directors and producers conveniently abuse, distort and contradict proven technology to resolve and support ridiculous plot lines in stories they present to us as a possible present or near future. They must be under the delusion 99% of their audience are Intuit luddites from Canada's Arctic who still use whale oil to light their igloos. It is tantamount to ignoring physical and chemical laws and properties and have us believe water will freeze by increasing rather than decreasing its temperature.Idiocy. And I'm sick of it.The movie is loaded, start to finish, with bad acting, inconsistencies and technical flaws that are just plain stupid. For instance, as the communication "code" - numbers - from the sphere is being displayed on a computer screen and the computer technician and Samuel L. Jacson magically decode it in about 5 seconds, this viewer was left to wonder:** Look - don't read on if you are offended by spoliers and actually want to invest time watching this movie. But don't blame me - how can one talk about trash without digging around in it?- How did the stream of numbers get from the sphere into the lab's computer(s) and magically to the screen directly in front of our venerable lab crew? Some Wi-Fi interface somewhere? I don't think 802.11b was even a RFC pre-IEEE standard in 1998!- Once in the computer, what program magically manifested itself to display streaming real time numbers across the screen? Of course! The wonder-alien in the sphere quickly "rewrote" a low level operating system device driver to spew the characters on the screen!- Now, once spewing and after coverted to binary (yeah - binary is easier to analyze than base 10 numbers), Samuel notices a "pattern" in the code. If we are truly to believe this cyphertext is from an advanced entity, we must conclude the entity's civilization would have quickly mastered the ability to *eliminate* patterns in cyphertext. Afterall, we (the human race) displayed certain levels of this ability early in the 20th century! Now, we use advanced cryptographic algorithms to easily do this. Why - because the first thing a cryptoanalyst seeks in cyphertext is a pattern to help to decode it! Duh!- And now, the translation. The patternized binary values, of course, are letters of the alphabet (no doubt Samuel did a quick binary to ASCII hex conversion in his mind - any boy scout can do that) arranged by superimposing a keyboard onto an opaque sphere! And this stands for that and this for that and viola! Cracked! Righhhttt! But if the dumb whatever in the sphere wanted us to understand it why go through all this convoluted crap in the first place?- The first cracked plaintext "sentence" turns out to be "My name is Jerry." Hell, for a second my spirits perked up when I thought Jerry Seinfeld could be in the sphere and this would turn into at least a decent comedy! That didn't happen. Towards the end of the movie, Hoffman uses a pencil and paper (apparently he, being a mental midget, isn't as capable of analyzing binary streams in his brain as is Samuel) to conclude the cyphertext was decoded wrong - the mappings between the cypher alphabet and English are wrong (i.e. the cyphertext that was thought to mean 'e', Dustin discovers, is really 'a'!) Samuel, you dumb-ass! It turns out the message was "My name is Harry." Well, okay, so if the 'J' and 'e' are wrong what about the previous 'e' in "name." How was that CORRECT and the 'e' in "Jerry" wrong along with all the subsequent uses! Dustin's translation should be "My nama is Harry."Ok, I know I am analyzing this to death but educated viewers can't but help notice things like this and this film was stocked full of these inconsistencies and abuses of technology.Instead of "Sphere," do yourself a favor and read a good book by Issac Asimov from the "Foundation" or "Robot" series. I wouldn't even go near the Crichton book b/c I would suspect a lot of the tripe came from there.</fullReview>

The movie seems like its a bit dumbed down, but a bit more complicated then it should've been. It shows in the movie how their reflection goes into the Sphere, rather then the door opening. I would've liked to have seen what Norman Johnson (Dustin Hoffman) saw when he entered the Sphere, as he did in the book and Crichton did a good job describing the foam and whatnot, but it was misdone when adapted. Other then The Lost World, this is the worst Crichton adaption I've seen.</fullReview>

The movie succeeds greatly on these fronts. Hoffman is understated, yes, but so is his character. Unfortunately, if Hoffman always played the same dynamic guys, we'd really get tired of it. Norman Reynolds' fine production design really captures the sophisticated, yet claustrophobic setting. Sphere's adaptation is wonderfully faithful, even going so far as to include the titles that segue into each section. I'll say this much: I'd rather watch this Crichton adaptation than Spielberg's "Lost World," which has nothing more than a title in common with it's excellent source.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was too long. If about 20 to 30 minutes of maudlin dramatics were cut out and maybe some clues given about who or why the alien entity is there at all it would have been a better movie. The acting is well done though it can't overcome the lack of script. I especially liked Peter Coyote as the tight lipped bureacrate and Hoffman as the down to earth phychologist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Sphere defently should be seen if you are a Crichton fan. I do suggest that you read the book first so the movie does not limit your imagination. The cast is superb and could not get any better. The movie is about a team of people sent under water to examine a spaceship under the water. During their trip inside the ship they find a giant gold sphere. What does it do? Why does a giant squid attack the people? and what does a homicidal alien named Jerry have to do with it? Find out by watching SPHERE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intriguing but dense and poorly-plotted sci-fi thriller. A mysterious spacecraft is discovered at the bottom of the ocean floor and a group of scientists from different fields are brought in to study its capability and significance. Among them: a psychologist (Hoffman), a biochemist (Stone), and a mathematician (Jackson). What begins as an engrossing sci-fi odyssey gradually diminishes into a not so bright horror movie where good actors clumsily run around making the wrong decisions. It works if you enjoy that sort of thing, but by the finale you don't know any more than you did when the film started. A script that's actually informative would have added a big boost here, but that's just wishful thinking. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is probably not what everyone expected, thinking it would be an all action movie and not the tense thriller that it actually turned out to be. It really is very hard to know who to trust from one moment to the next, although by necessity it is always made clear that Hoffman can be trusted, otherwise the movie would make no sense at all. First you think Jackson us going to die, then he is possessed, then he is bad, the Sharon Stone becomes bad, then mad, until you finally realise that no-one is bad really. One part of the story which I found completely pointless was having a past history between Hoffman and Stone. this adds nothing whatever to the story but instead leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Unfairly criticised, it's good if you know what to expect.</fullReview>

If I think of a good underwater action movie, I think of suspense like Deep Blue Sea or The Abyss or a cheesy Leviathan or Deep Star Six. The movie felt too quiet like a library. It was the most agonizing feeling of boredom I have ever felt. I got up thinking I just served a prison sentence in solitary confinement. I understand the nature of the story, needing to be an intellectual thriller. But it failed to impress me for any visual value or any intriguing plot, let alone the dull action in the movie. I was anticipating a good ending because it was the only reason why I sat through a boring film such as this one. I sat and saw looking for the light at the end of the tunnel, and what the surviving monotonous intellectuals Hoffman, Stone, and Jackson wanted to do is to forget that the sphere ordeal ever happened, never mind that it was responsible for the death of part of the underwater crew. Ever since, I just pray every night I get my 90 something minutes back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you've read the book, this movie sucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based off a book by Michael Chrichton. He's the author of Jurrasic Park, Lost World, Congo, Timeline, 13th Warrior, and many more that haven't been made into movies. Jurrasic Park is a rare exception in that it is the only one of his books that made an excellent movie. The rest were just OK or bad, which is sad because the books are really good.My two favorite books of his are Sphere, and Prey, followed by Timeline, then Jurrasic Park. I haven't seen Timeline, but neither the movies, Jurrasic Park or Sphere follow the books. Yet, Jurrasic Park is great, sphere is not.The book, Sphere adds so much that is not seen in the movie, but that is not why the movie sucks. The depth of the book, and the suspense in there is so well written, that it makes the movie seem childish. The acting was sub-par, and the actors chosen for the parts were horrible.In the book, Captain Barns was supposed to be a gruff ex-military commander. He was the worst of the casting. Norman was a 50+ yr old psychiatrist that didn't always know the scientific happenings, but knew the emotional happenings of everyone.They never show the inside of the sphere, or how Beth became more beautiful as time went on, or Normal being shocked with 400+ volts, or Ted playing with the squid, using a flashlight, or Beth dissecting an animal and not finding any stomach, or Norman being trapped in a section of the underwater habitat and the oxygen and heat was shut off, requiring him to leave through the emergency exit and swim to the opening, or the large tornado that Beth created using the sphere.Then there's the cheesy special effects. When Ted and Barns died, it looked more appropriate to a Monty Python skit. I laughed. The sphere being forgotten made no sense in the movie, and I already knew what happened. It looked cheesy too.Ya, I know LOTR fans tell you to read the book, cause it's better than the already great movie. I tell you to read the book cause it's actually good, unlike this movie.Go see Jurrasic Park, or find a copy of this book. You'll be happy you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a good cast, a writer with a pedigree and a neat idea, this film really should be a good one, sadly the cast didn't perform well enough and the plot was contrived to achieve its end, and it pi**ed me off.Let me explain - SPOILERS WARNING Jerry, the being that it causing the trouble, is named Jerry after the crew decipher the code into English, OK, no problem, clearly they'v deciphered it correctly, after all the messages all make sense don't they. e.g. - HELLO. HOW ARE YOU. I AM FINE. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? MY NAME IS JERRY (this was the first contact) Yet later in the film they then realise that they have messed up the code and it's actually Harry not Jerry (This means that what they thought was J is now H and E is Now A) So lets look at that message again - JALLO. JOW ERA YOU. I EM FINA. WJET IS YOUR NEMA? MY NEMA IS HARRY.It's not right is it? However, even with this, the film isn't terrible, it just could have been so much more. It does have some good moments, although not enough to make me ignore this flaw.5/10 sorry if i ruined it for you.</fullReview>

We do not care for the characters, they have nothing to do. The picture starts off well, the first 3 minutes are good, but the characters don't have any meat. The screenplay is disappointing, it never gets out of 2nd gear. You start with a bang and end with an earthquake, not this one.The performances are dull, there was a lack of direction. What was the director doing? Did he motivate them? Nope.The photography is excellent, kept my interest going. The camera work was a little shoddy, uninspired.

		<fullReview>Since today is Dustin Hoffman's 70th birthday, I wanted to talk about one of his movies. When "Sphere" first got released, the critics totally trashed it, and it bombed (maybe a number of people considered it an embarrassment because Dustin Hoffman and Barry Levinson had just collaborated on the very clever "Wag the Dog").Well, some friends and I went to see "Sphere" when it came out. I agree that it's a pretty screwed up movie, but not as bad as the critics said. I interpreted the movie as saying that the most fascinating and perplexing thing of all is the human mind, as the title object manifests the characters' fears. Still, the inappropriate sexual barbs and the psychiatrist/psychologist goof-up do make this movie a disappointment after "Wag the Dog". It's probably worth seeing once. Also starring Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Coyote, Queen Latifah, Huey Lewis and Ralph Tabakin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Michael Chricton's "Sphere," I personally think it's his best novel. But what makes a Chricton novel so good is the intricacy of plot and character, both of which were not present in the film adaptation. Dustin Hoffman is whiny, Sharon Stone unmotivated, and Samuel Jackson indifferent. So many things were changed (i.e. a complete lack of physical presence of the giant squid, the entire storyline of the back half of the movie) that you might just as well skip renting this altogether and read the book instead. I say that because if you see the movie you might not want to read the book, so don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, where should I start off... I am a kid, and have read the book by Micheal Crichton. A few days ago I rented the movie (having been clueless to the existence of which until that moment) and, yesterday, sat down to watch it, great expectations.Boy, was I disappointed. Having thought the book was amazing, I went to the video store thinking, "They'd better not have changed a THING," even though I knew that it couldn't be done. But honestly, the movie took my expectations and buried them in the middle of nowhere!First of all, some MAJOR inconsistencies to the book! I know, as a complete book-to-movie viewer, that you can't keep everything true to the book, but REALLY. I don't want to bore you with all my nitpicking, so you might as well skip the next paragraph. Thank you.*****WARNING: HERE BE SPOILERS!!DON'T READ THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK/SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!*****Okay, first of all, Norman's (Hoffman) last name is Johnson, NOT Goodman. It's Beth HALPERN, not HALPERIN. I understand if for some reason, Mr Crichton wanted the names changed, but otherwise, the people should at LEAST be able to keep the names right! Two of the characters, Tina Chan and Levy (if you've ever read the book, you know who I mean), are missing ENTIRELY. Teeny Fletcher did not die first due to jellyfish, it was Jane Edmunds. Levy was found where Edmunds is in the movie, and Fletcher just off and disappeared along with Barnes. Of course, they were both dead too. Tina died during the fire, Ted was dragged into the ocean by the giant squid.Okay, sorry I just had to lecture you all there, but honestly, I see no reason that they couldn't have kept those little consistencies. I mean, TWO MISSING CHARACTERS?? Come on.Anyway, that put aside, the acting was so-so. I think Sharon Stone was great as Beth; She was just as I had imagined from the book (Although I was disappointed that they didn't include her slightly deranged "Norman, don't get near the habitat!! I have explosives rigged up all around here, Norman, don't come any closer! You'll die, Norman!! Die!!" speech at the end.). Dustin Hoffman was okay as Norman JOHNSON (But I guess that rating is from my imagining him before as something like my old science teacher, especially with all the psychology speeches) The character of Harry was great, Samuel L. Jackson did a great job.Overall, I had a good time with this movie, although it didn't NEARLY live up to my expectations. If you haven't read the book, you might find it interesting; if you've read the book, don't bother; it will be a disappointment.</fullReview>

The actual story is OK. A bunch of scientist go inside some type of Alien Sphere which gives them the power to manifest their dreams. Such a power is too much for man's imagination and they end up nearly killing each other.Much of the film's appeal is dependent upon whether a person finds Dustin Hoffman annoying or endearing, as it his character who receives the most camera time.Overall, this movie works, but it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It looks more egg-shaped to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One advantage of watching movies on TV is that you can put up the text subtitles to make sure you follow the dialogue. This is especially helpful with some films where the sound quality is dodgy, and even more so when they have method-type actors in them, like Dustin Hoffman, who have a tendency to mutter. When I first saw Sphere at the cinema, I thought it rather confused and incoherent; now I have seen it on TV with subtitles, I am certain it is confused and incoherent! The pity is that, with a little more effort by the director and writers, it could have been better.For example, much of the dialogue is extremely irritating, with the characters constantly questioning each other, and failing to communicate effectively. At other times, the dialogue falls into triteness, such as the discussion about the supposed rivalry between Harry Adams (Samuel L Jackson) and Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) over which of them is the most brilliant scientist (though they work in quite different fields); and the recriminations over a past affair between Norman Goodman (Hoffman) and Beth Halperin (Sharon Stone), with one terrible line when Goodman apologises for his "inappropriate" behaviour. SPOILERS As for the main plot-line about the acquired "power" to manifest things, this would have been more convincing (a) if it had been shown to be a real power, which its holders had some control over, rather than wholly unconscious; and (b) if there had been some hint that the power could be used to manifest benign, as well as evil, things. The ending is stupid, with the characters deliberately and genuinely forgetting - not simply pretending to forget - everything that has happened; and the sphere projecting itself back whence it came. On a more positive note, I loved the twist at the outset of the movie, when Goodman reveals that his report, which Captain Barnes (Peter Coyote) regards as a "Bible" on making contact with possible aliens, was largely a spoof. SPOILERS END And more crucially, the special effects, particularly the horror elements, are excellent.However, even with crisper dialogue, a more credible plot, and the best SFX ever, the movie would remain yet another exercise in American fears of being taken over by aliens. It's been a long time since Close Encounters, and it would be nice to have another sci-fi movie with a more positive take on extra-terrestrials (but without the religious mumbo-jumbo of Contact).  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a novel, "Sphere" was great. It had a good science-fiction idea, tension, complex characters and everything. Of course, all to be expected from Michael Crichton, who, even if he isn't a SF author, has come up with pretty good thrillers.The movie was really very bad. It didn't manage to create the atmosphere and the feeling of the book, and those were the most important things about "Sphere". While the book keeps you on edge (almost) all the time, the movie is boring. It is also a perfect example of bad casting. Both Dustin Hoffman and Sharon Stone are good actors, I don't know what happened to them here. I suppose they chose Hoffman in order NOT to have an action hero (imagine Bruce Willis in the role :) and the character called for that indeed. But he just didn't make his acting appear convincing.*** SPOILERS ***And what ruined everything was the ending. The book has a GREAT ending (if you have read it you know what I'm talking about, if you haven't I'll just say that it leaves you wondering about whether Beth has indeed given up the power or not) which they didn't include in the movie. Instead they replaced it with a silly and sweet special effect of the alien sphere rising up from the water which I suppose was meant to be some kind of inter-species message coming from the superior aliens. The idea is very common and very predictable. It just sweetens the movie for the audience fond of happy endings. Not that I don't like happy endings, but in this case it was simply uncalled for.</fullReview>

I must admit, the beginning was kind of interesting, especially when the aspect of time travel enters into it. There was also some suspenseful moments in the film, most notably the one where Hoffman opens the kitchen cabinets to find them filled with "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and starts to freak out, while Samuel L. just goes on reading his book like nothing's happening. That scene was VERY creepy. Samuel L.'s character begins to get very disturbing at this point. But what happened?!?! This aspect of his character never gets resolved! Why is it that Jackson's character is the only one that acts abnormally? Was he just born that way? Also, when we discover how the Sphere is affecting the crew, I was like: "Doi" To top it all off, the ending was even more disappointing, talk about your fairy-tale endings... The thing that struck me the most about the whole plot was the lack of development of this "power" that the crew develops. Yeah, ok, so all their thoughts come true and they become omnipotent.

		<fullReview>Although there were superb actors here, I found that this movie is awfully similar to "Event Horizon." Though this time it isn't a ship that disappeared, it's an alien ship. The ship knows about the characters fears and uses them to haunt the crew, just like in Event Horizon. Other than that, I thought it was a great movie and I look forward to reading the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sci-fi movie for intelligent minds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie gives me a lot of thinking, with a cast of great actors who maces contrast between each other. Through the movie I enjoy listening scientifically smart and intelligent dialogs that lead me to think about paradoxes and events happening in this movie. My favorite phrase is "What if Jerry gets Mad?" I really like how director decided to break movie storyboard into series of chapters naming Deep, Monster, Further Analysis it definitely, when I see chapter name I already started thinking ahead as per name of chapter. This movie has a great story and exiting storyboard that makes my mind follow through unexplainable events and characters personalities, there is a great psychological thinking performed by Dustin Hofman, vs Captain Harold who does everything as it written, great performance by Sharon Stone and Samuel LJ, Liev was good too. There is many of unexplainable events that happening throughout the entire movie that finally answered by using psychological thinking, and still remain open for other points of views. I think concept design was a bit simple but good Sphere and habitat created from smaller spheres, I really like the idea of the look of the sphere only part I wish cold be better is spacecraft interior design, but I do like a lot how they did main computer design. Title sequence design was absolutely great too. And please bear in mind, that I writing this review in 2008 and movie still looking good after 10 years since it came out in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film shows great promise with an A-list acting, writing, and directing team at the helm. And it starts out great. A 300-year old spacecraft has been discovered on the bottom of the Pacific. In a super top-secret operation, a diverse team of specialists is assembled to make first contact with whatever is making those noises from inside the ship. A 'habitat' is created on the ocean floor outside the ship, a typhoon approaches topside, and the team has issues.... Is this another Abyss, Contact, maybe Alien?Then at about the one-hour mark a scene ends in a laugh when the intent was to ratchet up the tension. Is this a fluke? No, scene after scene careen and crash and soon the film gives a great shutter and falls to pieces. The final scenes verge on incomprehensibility. It's almost like two different sets of people wrote the screenplay. It's a crying shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tying Up Loose Ends Ruins Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Possible Spoilers** This movie started off with great promise. When a spaceship was discovered beneath the sea and which was found to be of human origin from the future, the story invited exploration of a lot of interesting sub-plots - such as time travel, for example. All were unfortunately ignored for a poor quality baseline which involved the interplay of relationships and trust within the scientific team of experts sent to investigate - some of whom were very weakly drawn. But from around the halfway mark, the director seems to lose the plot (strange, as the author, Michael Crichton was himself producing the movie, as well) and the whole shebang steadily goes from bad to worse. Towards the end, everyone seems to run out of ideas in relation to finishing the story which results in a cobbled-together last minute pact by the surviving 'heroes', full of unconvincing drivel of what happened before (thereby not letting the movie speak for itself) and more garbage as to what to do from now on. It was a total cop-out, in the end. Surely the first rule of science fiction is that a storyline should be capable of persuading the audience to suspend disbelief. When that fails, the plot fails and no amount of attempting to tie up loose ends - or to play catch-up on what should have been made clear in the first place - can revive, what is fundamentally, a damp squib.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because ONE of Michael Crichton's books translated into a decent movie ("Jurassic Park"), that doesn't mean that ALL of his books will make for fine cinema.Case in point:"Sphere" is based upon one of Crichton's better novels (for what that may or may not be worth-- this is a forum for film discussion, not literary criticism, otherwise I'd go off at this point...), but this is a TERRIBLE movie.It's absolutely painful to watch such an obviously talented cast (even Queen Latifah has, of late, proven that she's a respectable actress...) thrash about in such a poorly written screenplay. Not even Dustin Hoffman or Samuel L. Jackson can salvage this drivel.Other grievances: The 'scares' are all ridiculously contrived. The characters are completely one-dimensional (each is supposed to be good at something-- only no one can ever figure out what exactly Sharon Stone's field of expertise is supposed to be. My guess is 'tacked-on romantic interest,' but that wouldn't really mesh with a mathematician or a psychologist...) and BORING. The dialogue is patronizing, both to the characters and to the audience. The plot twists could not be more predictable. The conclusion provides NO semblance of closure.And it's generally NOT a sign of high-caliber direction when a film is divided into distinct sections by 'title slides.' It's also too ungodly long-- this film could've been wrapped up in about an hour and 15 minutes. I'm not saying that it would've been any BETTER or even more PLAUSIBLE, but it would've been SHORTER, and when a movie is as bad as this one, that's pretty much all that matters.Rating: 2 out of 10. This could have been a decent movie... if there had been a better screenplay, a better director, better f/x... It's every bit as insulting as "Congo."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If all of the characters where such outstanding scholars, they should have realised that they were in a movie that wasn't going anywhere and got out. It seems as if it was slapped together in a rush to make a deadline. The edict from the producer: "Just make sure you have enough exciting images for deceptive trailer material." Why even bother putting this film out. If I was Michael Crichton, I would be apalled. Well, I might feel a little better with a wad of money in my pocket. Throw some money to a famous writer, a notable director and some world class actors and hope for the best. That is what was done here.I usually feel bad for good actors when they get into something like this, but Dustin Hoffman was just getting on my nerves. If he said "Jerry?" in his pensive, nasaly, attempt at a sophisticated analyst voice one more time I thought I would.......wait, I think that IS when I changed the channel to avoid complete disgust with myself for allowing "Spear(tiny one to the eyeball)" to come between me and a replay of the 1975 World's Strongest Man competition. His character was so worried about upsetting the sphere that when the sphere says: "don't call me Jerry," of course Hoffman just can't stop saying "Jerry?" "Jerry?" "Jerry?" "What do you want me to call you, Jerry?" Help!!!! Hey, I just thought of another name for the movie: "Jerry's Kids."Thanks to all the others out there that cracked me up with their reviews.

		<fullReview>The saddest thing you will ever find in the entertainment industry is a film that seems to have all the right things going for it, from the cast all the way down to the crew. The movie itself might start off good, but then it is horribly disfigured by a few small things that add up to one big Failure. Such is the case for Sphere, a potentially great film that eventually falls flat.Why does Sphere lose it? It's directed by Barry Levinson, it stars 3 high-caliber actors, and it's based on a book by Michael Crichton, a master of sci-fi writing. As I said, the movie starts off promising enough, providing us with some mystery about a 300 year old spacecraft buried underwater. From here, SO much could be done in the story, and the suspense factor could go even higher from this point. Sadly, after the actual sphere is discovered(and I won't reveal what it can do), everything just falls apart.When the break in quality occurs, it seems instantly noticeable. The scenes of suspense become poorly edited and make little sense(why is that person outside of the sea-station??). Also, Levinson seems too confident that his A-list actors can carry the rest of the movie, but all of their conversations in the second half are poorly written and mean almost nothing. This wastes a LOT of time, folks. So what is good about Sphere? Well, the music, for one. Elliot Goldenthal's score is very good and he barely saves some of the latter suspense scenes(the music during the "squid eggs" sequence comes to mind). The visuals, while somewhat decent, are nothing spectacular, considering this was made in 1998. I can recall a strikingly similar, yet far superior underwater movie called The Abyss that came out almost 10 years before this and sported more inspiring visuals than Sphere.Sphere holds its water, so to speak, for the first hour or so, but then it falls apart and drags on and on until it reaches its extremely poor resolution. In all, Sphere seems to be over 3 hours long, and that is not a good thing if more than half of that time is just wasted film. Sphere could have been so much better.

		<shortDescription>Barry Levinson creates a Sci-Fi masterpiece. Outstanding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen and loved The Abyss (1989) directed by James Cameron, you'll absolutely be delighted with what Barry Levinson has done. This film was made 7 years after the Abyss and it uses outstanding C.G.I.(Computer-generated imagery).Sphere was based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton, author of Jurassic Park and The Lost World.An amazing cast of characters: Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Peter Coyote, Liev Schreiber, Samuel Jackson and Queen Latifah. Plot: In the middle of the southern Pacific Ocean, a thousand feet below the surface, what is believed to be an alien spacecraft is discovered after a ship laying transoceanic cable has its cable cut and the United States Navy investigates the cause. The thickness of coral growth on the spaceship suggests that it has been there for almost 300 years. A team made up of marine biologist Dr. Beth Halperin (Sharon Stone), mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson), astrophysicist Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber), psychologist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman), and a member of the U.S. Navy (Peter Coyote) are tasked with investigating the spaceship. The team (along with two navy technicians) are housed in a state-of-the-art underwater living environment called the Habitat during their stay on the ocean floor. Upon entering the spaceship, the team makes two discoveries. The first is that the ship is from the future, specifically America. The last date in the ship's log, 06/21/43, does not indicate the specific century. The last entry in the log details an "Unknown (Entry) Event", which depicts the ship apparently falling into a black hole, resulting in its trip through time. The ship's mission involved gathering objects from around the galaxy to bring back to Earth. An item of particular interest is a large, perfect sphere in the cargo hold. It hovers a few feet above the ground and has an impenetrable fluid surface which reflects its surroundings but not people.Harry concludes from the classification of the event which sent the ship back that the Habitat crew is fated to die: it would not have been an "unknown event" if they had lived to report about it, he reasons. Harry soon sneaks back to the spaceship, and finds a way to enter the sphere. Soon after, a series of binary-encoded messages begins to show up on the habitat's computer screens, and Harry and Ted are able to decipher the messages and converse with what appears to be an alien (which calls itself "Jerry"), which has been trapped in the sphere. They soon discover that "Jerry" can hear everything they are saying aboard the Habitat. Harry's entry into the sphere prevents the team from evacuating before the arrival of a powerful typhoon on the surface, forcing them to stay below for almost a week. A series of tragedies then befalls the crew: Fletcher, the navy technician, is killed by aggressive jellyfish; a giant squid attacks and damages the station, killing Edmunds by completely destroying her body, Ted by blasting him with a large fire blast, and Barnes by slicing him in half with a computer-operated door in the ensuing chaos; and sea snakes attack Norman. Jerry is the cause of these incidents.Eventually, only Harry, Norman, and Beth remain. At this point, they realize that they have all entered the world of the perfect sphere, which has given them the power to manifest their thoughts into reality. As such, all of the disasters that had been plaguing them are the result of manifestations of the worst parts of their own minds. The name "Jerry" turns out to have been erroneously decoded and is actually spelled "Harry"; it is Harry's subconscious communicating with them through their computer system whenever he is asleep. At that point, Beth's suicidal thoughts manifest themselves as triggering a countdown to trigger the explosives that were brought along to clear away the coral. They abandon the Habitat for the mini-sub, but their fears manifest an illusion of the spacecraft around them. Norman finally sees through the illusion, and punches the mini-sub's emergency surfacing button. The explosives destroy the habitat and the spaceship, but (unknown to them) the sphere itself remains undamaged. As the explosives detonate and create a huge blast wave below it, the mini-sub rises to the surface, to be quickly retrieved by the returning surface ships, permitting the survivors to begin safe decompression once on board a navy ship.The film ends with the three deciding to use their powers to erase their own memories before being debriefed, in order to prevent the knowledge about the sphere from falling into the wrong hands. Thus, Harry's paradox, in which they are alive yet no one has learned about the "unknown event," is resolved. As they erase their own memories of the "unknown event," the sphere is seen emerging from the ocean and flying off into space.10/10 points. Add this one to your DVD collection. Levinson has a talent for the Sci-Fi genre and why he hasn't directed more of the sort, I don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sphere has a lot going for it. It is a gorgeous film about a group of scientists going under water to the bottom of the sea where an "alien" ship is and within its confines is a huge alien golden sphere that makes those that pass through it live their dreams - along with everyone else. I didn't read the Crichton book, but I am very impressed with the creativity. Director Barry Levinson does a real good job pacing the film and is adept at painting quite a landscape with technology, etc... The first half of the film is attention getting as we follow Dustin Hoffman, Liev Scriber, Samuel Jackson, and Sharon Stone as they discover what the ship is and the sphere itself. The story starts to break up a bit in the middle and , I think, really falls apart in the final third. While the acting is generally very good, I wasn't buying Hoffman's lead nor Samuel Jackson's performance wholeheartedly. Nonetheless, Sphere is an interesting film if nothing else. Michael Crichton deserves most of the credit for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the genre of psychological thrillers, sphere is at the top of the list. i don't understand why so many people thought the second half was bad. in my opinion, the movie is solid the whole way through. so far, everyone has complained, but no one has given a specific reason for their dislike. was it because you found out that it was all an illusion? i thought that was one of the STRONGEST aspects of the movie. the defining theme of the movie is fear. everything in sphere (plot, characters, cinematography, hell even the editing) is meant to SCARE you. someone complained that the movie never showed the giant squid. did you completely miss the point of the film? THE SQUID WAS NEVER REAL. it was supposed to build up your fear and make you terrified of something that you've never actually seen. what was weak about the ending? obviously killing everyone off would have sent the wrong message. so what would you suggest? that they live happily ever after and end world hunger with their new powers? no way. they had to get rid of their powers, and forgetting about them was the only possible way. am i the only one that understood this movie? i feel like im taking crazy pills.</fullReview>

When I first saw this movie I hoped that I had merely experienced a temporary psychosis or a stroke or a seizure or something, but when I recently reviewed it on the telly I had to concede to myself that it was all due to an incredibly weak script and direction.And to make things even more disappointing, they ripped off "The Abyss" (marital conflict punctuated by War-Of-The-Worlds in deep-sea "habitat") and "Alien" (rescued guy eating hearty meal) to boot.</fullReview>

It seemed the actors, who have done very respectable work, got a little lazy on this one, and the directing was terrible. Once the big secret is figured out, and you'll figure it out before they do, the actors keep repeating it just to make sure you 'get it'. Throughout the movie, the director overemphasized self-evident points, which was just annoying. Such as the explosives being set, he shoots the bomb and zooms up close on the word 'explosives'. At one point, Sharon Stone says 'i gotta get to the minisub, you know because we have to reset it every twelve hours'. OK, we got it the first 5 times! this was after a few scenes had already made that point very clear.just in general, this seems like it could have been done a lot better--altogether just a poor effort on all parts. as interesting as it could have been, the end result is a badly acted, poorly directed mess.</fullReview>

The most interesting thing about the story is the fact that the characters are smart enough to know they have to be prepared for everything. Why assume that aliens would be even remotely like us? What if they don't have brains and hearts like ours? Wouldn't they lack concepts of life and death like ours? And if that's the case, why would it have any moral significance to them whether our hearts keep beating or not? Obviously, the story is full of holes I won't be discussing since I don't want to spoil it, but at least its original and philosophically interesting. And, I have to say, I never really saw the ending coming. It was exciting, and well made. Michael Crighton takes a lot of interesting ideas and shuffles them into a story that isn't exactly waterproof. Which is a shame really. Especially on the bottom of the ocean.</fullReview>

The beginning promises at least a decent cousin of 'Alien' but then it changes into pseudo-si-fi packed with poor acting , boring dialogues , silly intrigue and most of all Goodman's psychological garbage ,which makes anyone who decided to go to a museum of aviation instead of watching this crap count his blessings. The final scenes ,with three survivals talking about the mankind not being ready to handle the responsibility etc, were an agonizing pain to my ears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sinks without trace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts off quite well, and has some amusing touches - like Dustin Hoffman's revelation of how he cam to write his 'expert' report, which sounds all too realistic - but about 20 minutes in it not only seems to lose the plot it also seems to lose its scriptwriter. It has a halfway decent cast who battle valiantly but vainly to give it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it fades rapidly into vapid dialogue where the characters argue with each other and tell each other (a) that they don't know what's going on and (b) not to do things that they promptly go off and do. (What's the matter with these people? Don't they ever go to the movies? Haven't they ever seen 'Alien'?) Being brought up on Star Trek I can swallow the imbecilities of the plot, but when it gets to the point where the commercial breaks are better than the movie that's the cue to switch off. So I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious fake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story a is not bad. But the directing is rather weak. I could feel the attempt of the makers to create something like intellectual science fiction of sixties-seventies, but the attempt is not the succesful one. The film also lacked the stylishness of ScFi-s of that period.The Sphere just makes the impression to be more serious than Independence Day, but still is just a fake. Acting is rather weak, and this concerns not just Sheron Stone (who proved that she can act quite well only when the director is good, here she overacts terribly) but all the rest of the famous and talanted cast.Its very interesting to see that a very similar screenplays can transform both into the mediocre movie (as it is in the case of the Sphere) and into the masterpiece of not just science fiction genre, but even the jewel of the world art of cinema (Solaris of Andrei Tarkovsky ? if you have not seen this film you know nothing about science fiction).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very poor. It seems like quite a good idea and I personally love this sort of sci-fi chiller stuff but it just doesn't work. The Sphere itself is simply not scary enough in design or in execution and I frankly didn't think that it's effect on the crew members was either pronounced enough or, again, particularly terrifying. Being very similar to Event Horizon I now realise just how much better that film is. I admit that they are aiming at different audiences age-wise but the idea itself, a freaky alien device having a dangerous and maddening effect on mere mortals, is pretty much the same. Jackson, Hoffman and Stone all deliver quite atrocious performances as the 'distinguished' scientists and do little other than put on diving suits and act alternatively calm and terrified. The revelation of what the craft is and where it came from are quite interesting but not well enough delivered and after Jackson decides to go awol the film rapidly descends into yawn city. Why does the Sphere do what it does? What does it do exactly?! How come weird things were manifested and who was doing what and why? All good questions but sadly not answered in this made-for-children movie. Look elsewhere for good sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>starts out good but crumbles into a complete disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>on paper this movie looks like a sure thing. Director Barry Sonnenfield--hot off the succeses of Men In Black and Get Shortya cast including Sharon Stone, Samuel Jackson, and Dustin Hoffman. and a script based off a Michael Chrichton novel.all i have to say is that it's been awhile since i've seen a movie start out so good and turn into a complete disaster only about 1/3 of the way through it.the acting is genuinely solid but some of the situations and character motivations in the later scenes are so goofy and odd that i find it hard to believe they weren't smirking through all the scenes. the not so special effects don't help out much either. the jellyfish attack in particular is really cheesy. the sphere itself is kind of cool though.the funny thing is that the movie Even Horizon has practically the exact same plot except that it's played more in a horror sense and it's set in space instead of the ocean.disappointingrating:3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd rate this movie about two steps below Giant Hair Lice And The Revenge Of The Dodos.Of course that movie was never made. The would-be producers were against abortions.I thought watching two elevators go up and down on a surveillance camera was the most inaction I've ever seen on screen. This was like watching one elevator go up and down.The level of acting reminded me of an amateur stage group reading a script for the first time in a group. By the second time the amateur group would have left the Sphere cast far behind.I actually came to believe that the scriptwriter experienced this in real life. He entered the sphere and what we are seeing is his nightmare of what might happen if he tried to bring the experience to film.I think is the worst movie ever made by a big studio in the sci-fi category. I've been trying so far without success to think of one that would beat it out in the general category.This film may have a value though. The Saturday Night Live producers should piece together some clips. Then if one day a power failure knocks their studio off the air, they could run this and no one would know it had happened. This is as funny as it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sphere had so much promise when it began. But the giant ship of boredom sank in and drowned everyone. I can't believe actors of the caliber of Hoffman and Jacksoff...err i mean Jackson would lend their names to such a farce. This movie isn't really worthy of a review but it was so bad i decided it would be hard to pass up a chance to trash it. SO...This movie stunk! There, i got it out of my system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is about as tense as an episode of Scooby Doo, and not as well scripted. Crichton's book is probably a lot better than this mish-mash of The Abyss, 2001, Event Horizon and many other, better films. I have never seen a film with so many loose ends. Clumsy, cliched and stupid. Did I mention boring? Even Mission To Mars was better than this.Particularly annoying was the episodic editing which felt like reading a book and then skipping 8 pages for no apparent reason.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the talented efforts of Hoffman, Stone and Jackson(all of whom looked like they were longing in their hearts for this sucker to wrap), this directorial misfire from veteran Levinson is an overwhelming mess. With no suspense, incoherent(and early in the film, inaudible)dialogue plus a total lack of story-telling, this is the worst film I've seen in a LONG time. As I watched this disaster, I kept wishing that I was still in the chopper with early cameo Huey Lewis and was flying away from this underwater sleep-inducer. In a word: HORRIBLE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>on every serious 100 worst films of all time list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is listed a science fiction. It involves an ocean underwater search for the meaning behind a vessel found there. It attempts, weakly, a discussion about time-space continuim, which is a science fiction writer's way of saying he doesn't know what he's talking about. Tragically, the film had a large budget, don't be fooled. Dustin Hoffman isn't cheap, and a lot of time, effort, and expensive film and equipment is used here. And for what? The plot is terribly written. It is supposed to be a revelation, but fails miserably, even worse than the Space Odyssey bomb that potheads still rave about in their ramblings. The director and writer seem to be congratulating themselves on a "think piece" throughout the film. You can actually feel it, which makes the viewer laugh at them throughout. It ends with as poorly logical an ending as "Wishmaster." These people are supposed to be smart, but their end game not only wouldn't work in the poorly written situation, it could have been handled much easier, simpler, and with better results by a moron. So we've got a director and writer, who added together have a lower IQ than people they would probably laugh at and consider inferior. How ironic. Therein lies the real problem here. Neither of them could rate higher than a 1 on a scale of 1-10. It can't be done. The film has no appeal. It will, of course, appeal to the neo Nazi American viewers who love to see contrived deaths of every dark haired women in a film and every blonde woman safe, as if chosen by God. The film was obviously intended for this large audience whose motives I don't understand, and don't care to understand. They are not worth understanding. With crap like this, no wonder everyone you work with keeps their TVs tuned into History, Sports, and other non fiction. Any critic who doesn't have this in the one worst films of all time, cannot be telling the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Barry Levinson and written by Michael Crichton this Sci-Fi adventure entertains and at times thrills. Very good F/X, but no great shakes. A supposedly "in-the-know" team goes a thousand feet beneath the sea's surface to study a spacecraft believed to be over three hundred years old. The story line holds your attention until the later half of the movie becomes a mess of physiological babble. The high dollar cast stars:Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone and Samuel L. Jackson. In support are Peter Coyote and rapper Queen Latifah. And yes the helicopter pilot is rocker Huey Lewis. The bigger the screen the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the success of 'Jackie Brown', Jackson was teamed up alongside Sharon Stone in this disappointing film titled 'Sphere'. Although he got to act alongside Dustin Hoffmann in the same way that Cuba Gooding jr and Morgan Freeman did in 1995 in a Wolfgang Peterssen film. What was more disappointing was that Jackson didn't get to snog or shag Stone in the same way that Michael Douglas did in 'Basic Instinct'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never watch a movie named after a geometric solid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>eye-roll...This film, like it's cousin "Cube", is pseudo-intellectual garbage.Dustin Hoffman and Samuel Jackson are exquisitely miscast (although how you would cast this script is a mystery) and don't seem to have any idea what they're supposed to. Hoffman bimbles about aimlessly, obviously uncertain as to how to go about "humanising" the subject matter, but all he ends up doing is Hoffmanising it. Jackson does the "Look! I'm Samuel Jackson!" dance admirably, obviously caring not one sausage about this stupid movie, counting the days until his check falls through the mail box. This prancing about looks ridiculous, and it looks like he knows and doesn't care.The dialogue doesn't make any sense. The story is jarringly illogical and confusing, the special effects are slight and unimpressive, the basic premise an unpalatable rip-off of "Solaris", the pace alternately dragging and too fast, the music pedestrian and uninspiring and...Basically, I've learned that you shouldn't watch a film whose title is a geometric solid.So there.1 star. Would t'were zero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in the cinema and thought it was execrable. Watched it on TV a few years later to see if I was wrong. I wasn't.Stone sinks. Hoffman swims frantically but is inundated and drowns nonetheless. Fishburne, lucky for him, sleeps through most of it. A dream budget. A dream cast. A dream screenplay (from Michael Crighton's book). Put them all together and what do you get? Somehow, a turkey. How did they manage it? There are a few thrills and chills but these don't cover the cost of the celluloid. Some reviewers have suggested that if you don't like this, you don't understand it. I fear I understand this all to well - a reasonably enjoyable, mildly thought-provoking (if derivative) novel rendered a near-unwatchable movie. The use of captions, clumsy episodic editing and mangled plot bring to mind "Dune" and the original edition of "Bladerunner". Did "Sphere" suffer similar woes during production?Only a die-hard fan could care, and there can't be many. If you want a decent sci-fi about the dangers of having your dreams made real, watch "Forbidden Planet" or "Solaris". If you want a decent sci-fi about people discovering a haunted old spaceship, watch "Alien", or at a push "Event Horizon". If you want a decent sci-fi of any description, avoid this.</fullReview>
