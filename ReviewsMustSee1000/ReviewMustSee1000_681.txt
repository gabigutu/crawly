		<shortDescription>A Great Family Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are not many movies you can take the whole family to see these days. Our ten year old son really wanted to see The Last Mimzy so we went to a sneak screening last Saturday night. I was very pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the film as much as I did. My wife liked it even better. Our two other kids (daughter 12, youngest son 7) along with our son had a great time.Kids will really be able to identify with the brother and sister in the movie. They seemed very real. The kids' lives at school and their relationships with their parents and teacher seemed true. This is a story about a regular family with all the ups and downs of everyday regular life.Then, the story takes off. I don't want to give away anything about the plot because the surprises that gently unfold are what you and your family will enjoy about the movie. There are elements of science fiction and fantasy with nothing extremely intense to scare the kids. It's an interesting story told well with characters you care about. The visual effects are well done.I liked that the movie does not talk down to kids to get its ideas across. My wife and I also liked that the language and situations were truly appropriate for a family film. My kids all want to see the movie again and the movie is definitely good enough to see a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice, entertaining film, with a lot of neat ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see it's getting some bad reviews, but I really liked The Last Mimzy. I don't know how much it is like the book, but I liked the ideas the film was based on, the graphics were nice, and it was a new twist on an old storyline (the kids did a really good job acting too). Some people complain it didn't have any action and they "fell asleep" - well it's not an action movie, and honestly if you fall asleep, either you're really overworked or you're just not into light mystery and philosophical ideas. It definitely has a "new age" touch, it's mysterious, and with a nice bit of surreal/sci-fi - if you liked movies the same pace and style as K-Pax (though this one is a bit more geared towards kids), then you'll probably like Mimzy. I wouldn't suggest really young kids for this one, they might not understand a lot of it - 10 and up would probably enjoy it more.Also, the less you know about the movie, the more you'll like it. Don't spend a day reading reviews and looking at trailers. Grab your kids, go to the theater, and see it for yourself with a fresh mind. You'll probably enjoy it as much as I did. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought this was an excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my daughter to a screening and was very surprised at how good this movie was. My 13 year old could not decide whether she liked this movie or the Bridge to Terabithia better. There was never a dull moment. We were both very entertained. It was definitely worth the price of admission. The younger kids (10 and under) did not seem to enjoy it as much as the adults and teens though. If you are planning on seeing this, stay away from trailers. You'll have a much better experience the less you know about it. During the last 10 minutes, the reel or film broke. You should have heard the uproar that caused. Everyone in the theater waited impatiently while the projectionist repaired the film. I'll probably go see this again when it does open.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good adaptation of a classic sf short story, "Mimsy Were the Borogoves" by Lewis Padgett (pseudonym used by sf authors and spouses Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore). Some changes, of course, updating it to present time (story was originally set in 1942, published in 1943), expanding the story a bit -- but overall, nice work.I thought the kids' interactions were very true to life -- sniping and fussing at each other and at the same time being close and loving. Especially liked the little girl's interaction with Mimzy, dressing it in doll clothes, having a tea party.Very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read the book, which this movie is based upon, so I have no point-of-reference for comparison.All in all I thought this movie was perfectly appropriate for families, although from reading reviewers comments on another website, you'd think 'The Last Mimzy' had some kind of subversive plot. One parent said it was 'liberal doctrine' and another focused on the fact that it shows people who actually believe in Eastern philosophies and practices. Wow! You mean there are other religions besides Christianity out there?! Then they must be liberal in nature and are trying to wreak havoc on the traditional, family-values we all hold so dear.I am a Christian and had absolutely no problems with the ideas proposed by other points-of-view. Maybe you might have to walk out of the theater with some explanations of how other cultures see the world and their place in it, but that's part of the magic of this movie. 'The Last Mimzy' was by no means 'liberal doctrine' unless you think showing a different perspective as a threat.Personally, the weakest parts of the movie for me was the uneven direction and the point where I asked "Why is Michael Clark Duncan in this film?" He didn't really add much to it. The kids were believable and Timothy Hutton did a decent job. The effects were all-in-all low-key, but necessary. Before you judge this film for showing the mysteries of Eastern beliefs, try watching it with an open mind. It didn't give me the same vibe as 'E.T.' or 'Close Encounters', but it did a good job as being an entertaining family film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Think "12 Monkeys" but a bunny steps in for Bruce Willis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were to come up with a one sentence of "The Last Mimzy" it would be: New age tree hugging proselytizing wrapped in a children's film.Deploying a panoply of New Age pablums such as the interconnectedness of the universe and a kind of whitebread version of Far East mysticism, "The Last Mimzy" is nonetheless fun and stimulating to watch. Anything that can theoretically challenge the dumbing down of my children by the Disney Channel is, frankly, welcome.My daughter, a very bright girl if I do say so, was mentally energized after seeing "The Last Mimzy" and couldn't stop talking about it. Five points minimum right there.The visuals strike me vaguely as derivative of Bucky Fuller's concept of Synergistics or the Dymaxion, concepts which were precursors to his famous geodesic domes - the sum being greater than the parts basically.At its best, this film engages the imagination of both adults and children. The premise--a bunny sent back in time to save all of humanity--on its surface seems very silly, but somehow it works. It works because we know intuitively that children are often the only ones with the innocence and purity and that certain clarity of intelligence to communicate seemingly impossible ideas - the faith of a child in action. The people of the future still understand this too.I didn't find Mimzy's "New Agey" feel overdone and it worked cleverly for its intended premise.One thing that was very wrong about the movie was the overt product placement of Intel in a particular scene Though I suspect Intel rarely gets a chance where product placement even makes sense in a movie it was really inappropriate. Still, an extremely worthwhile film amid today's teen-oriented drivel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>imaginative entertainment with some trippy images and a very good, ET-style heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Mimzy doesn't pander needlessly to its core audience, but at the same time it also has a good accomplishment in that it also has an appeal to adults, or at least those that have passed that age of adolescence and look back on childhood with levels of nostalgia and relief that it's over. It delights as well as gives special meaning to putting a level of belief in what is unknown at a time when the rest of the world relies on hard facts and rigid control of personality. It also puts ET to a certain test: can the little creature from another world that needs to get home kind of story hold up to quasi (actually precise) psychedelia? Pink Floyd shirts and Roger Waters aside, this may even have a secret appeal to stoners just as much as your little boy or girl at the movie theater, who will obviously see it in a different life, that of light, efficient irreverence and lots of neat special effects.'Mimzy' tells the story of a boy and a girl, Noah and Emma, both at least under the age of 10 but old enough to be articulate enough as well as appropriately secretive in the fantasy they hold paramount, who come upon a strange rock from the ocean. In it lies a bunch of fragments, and, oddly enough, a stuffed, fluffy, cute bunny named Mimzy, who Emma takes as her most important possession. Noah meanwhile becomes transfixed with the new powers that soon come to him via these rocks: he can hear the smallest insect, and is transfixed by obscure designs. This strikes up the attention of his parents as well as his science teacher (Rainn Wilson), who also knows of the symbols Noah makes up. But after a power outage- it also happens to be a generator that Noah conjures- gets the attention of the government, not sure what exactly is going on. Emma has a problem, however, in that Mimzy, her closest confidant and "teacher" is dying and needs to get back home. That's the basic story, anyway, as there are little ins and outs as the story goes on, including a great product placement for Sprite, and a montage-free example of each child's new abilities.Some of this may be a little preposterous, even goofy, but Bob Shaye and his team bypass the obvious but still perilous pit-falls for filmmakers investing themselves into children's movies. No truly stupid gags, nothing with bodily excretions, none of that really, and if anything the humor, of a little wild and over-the-top in variety (some of which I was laughing at alone while the other kids were silent), is innocent and sort of knowing of the split of imagination between children and adults. The two kids are also very good at playing their parts, with Wryn as Emma very adept at being vulnerable and smart, and O'Neil being almost too close to looking like the boy Elliot in ET, however not without his own strengths. Shaye sometimes lets his control slip in just simple things like cinematography or making a fitting enough ending (too many futuristic hippies me thinks), and the goofiness does teeter on becoming a little too much. But I responded more to how the power of taking a long repeated idea, of kids becoming changed by outside forces in a very real world, and there being a sort of little twist to it all. It's not just about making friends and gaining in some alien intelligence, but in figuring the significance of the future, however weird it might be. It's definitely the finest children's movie, non-animated, to come out so far in 2007. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Movie for adults and children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very well written film about two young and quite brilliant children. They have a frantic mother and a somewhat aloof father. But the story ties them together well. If you are expecting this to be a simple film for the young,you will be disappointed. My children loved it. The mathematics and science are brilliantly weaved into this story of everything good and pure about us, or rather, what could be. E.T. for a new generation? It really could be. I have seen where some have said that children might be a bit bored with this movie. The theater I was in wasn't full of bored children. The children I saw were on the edge of their seats; as was I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe"The Mimsy before this one was apparently sent to Lewis Carroll, who shared it with his young friend Alice, who had an adventure in Wonderland. This last Mimsy, a stuffed rabbit doll from the future, is discovered in a box of toys, floating in the waters of a deserted beach, by Noah Wilder, a ten year old boy played by Chris ONeil, and his six year old sister Emma, played by Rhiannon Leigh Wryn. Like Alice before them, their lives are transformed into a fascinating and sometimes dangerous wonderland. So goes the short story, "Mimsy were the borogoves" by Kuttner and Moore, on which this movie, "The Last Mimsy" is based.Robert Shaye, the director, who has much more prior film experience as a producer of slasher and fantasy films, in this movie, emulates director Steven Spielberg, with a children's Science Fiction, Fantasy adventure. The premise is interesting; children discover a box of toys from the future. The uses of the toys, as well as their reason for being here, are a mystery.Noah and Emma are taking their spring break, with their parents, at a lovely isolated Seattle beach cottage. Their overworked father, David, played by Timothy Hutton, and his wife, Jo, played by TV veteran, Joely Richardson, are unaware of their children's discovery. They consider their children average, and therefore are concerned and alarmed as they see unexpected changes in their behavior.The toys the children discover are intriguing, pretty but mysterious, until Emma discovers in a hidden compartment, Mimsy, a telepathic teaching machine, in the guise of a cute stuffed Rabbit. Appropriate enough with the Easter holiday approaching. Mimsy has no motion ability, but is carried around as Emma's favorite dolly. We can tell Mimsy is communicating, the sound designers of the film, give the toy a pleasing electronic purring noise, that only Emma can hear. This aspect of the film works very well. The children can see the magic in the toys, whereas the adults can't. This is best exemplified in one scene where Noah hands his mother a glowing opal like rectangular crystal. In her hands it appears as a rusty paperweight. Two additional characters are added to the plot, Noah's Science Teacher, played by Rainn Wilson, and his kooky, New age girlfriend, played by Kathryn Hahn. They notice the effects the toys have on the children. The toys, have the ability to expand the mind and intellect of the children. At school, Noah comes up with a Nobel Prize winning Science Fair project, and both children playing with a generator toy, manage to black out the Seattle area power grid. This alerts Homeland Security, and in a scene that might have been lifted from the Spielberg handbook of quick panic shooting, has the CIA crashing the home of the unsuspecting family, and herding them off to a secret Intelligence headquarters. Notable is actor, Michael Clark Duncan as the perplexed but down to business, head of Homeland Security. One of the major pleasant surprises of the movie, comes with the cleverest example of product placement that I have ever seen. On the other hand, the movies Prologue nearly robs the film of all it's potential drama, suspense and magic. This I found to be a major flaw.It's a very acceptable family film, although the very young will squirm restlessly through the talkative exposition. The effects are just average CGI, it is to the directors credit that Mimsy remains throughout, a inanimate cute stuffed rabbit. The Ending is bright and optimistic, and dispels the sometimes threatening imagery depicted in scenes of the future. I give this movie *** out of five stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Children's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this with my 2 daughters - 10 and 7, and it was for kids just their age. My older daughter's heart was pounding so hard in the middle that when she clutched my hand I could feel it on my upper arm. She came out of it emotionally exhausted, but very very happy.The only film I can relate this to is "Contact". This film makes no assumptions about your political, religious, or spiritual beliefs, but presents something for everyone. The story is enjoyable (although a tiny bit long for the age group), and the premise is something that the children can understand and get into. The acting was par for a children's film - not as bad as Tim Allen in "Shaggy Dog", but still not on the level of an adult's film. Some adults may frown during the performances - but it has nothing to do with the story.The ending was drawn out and predictable - I kept telling my daughter that it was going to be 'ok', and knew it would be. But the ride was very fun and enthralling - a movie my daughter will ask me to get for her and she will watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining, but with huge plot holes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my two nephews (13 &amp; 15) to an advance screening just now and we all liked the movie. Although, to enjoy it requires a very high level of "suspension of disbelief". A lot of things do not make sense, circumstances that would never happen and some things that just go nowhere in the movie all led to us making fun of the movie afterward. BUT, we all still enjoyed the movie and thought it was good. It is pretty much a high grade B movie. I went after reading the comments on here and was a little cautious because all of the first comments were horrible and then the latest ones were all perfect so I figured "people" were fluffing the votes to get people to go see it because of it's release next weekend and that is why I am posting this. You might want to wait for DVD or go to a twilight viewing(we paid $4 each), but I would not have been mad if I had paid full price. Sorry for the uneven review (kind of like the movie itself), it is my first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank Goodness it's the LAST mimzy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had much higher expectations for this movie, and was greatly disappointed. It is a cool movie idea, but all in all, it was poorly adapted, produced, and acted. There are major holes in the plot, and the acting was very unbelievable. It is only a 90 minute movie, but it seems like much longer. The way the parents, teachers, and FBI respond to these children is utterly unbelievable. If your kids suddenly could perform telekinesis, draw ancient mandalas, and vaporize their arms, would you leave them unattended for hours upstairs? These parents do. They even fall asleep when detained by the FBI, allowing their kids to escape into the night. Guess you can't expect too much from the Nip Tuck mom. She's a horrible actress. Yuck- Don't rent it. Don't buy it, and don't subject your poor children to this mindless dribble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Mimzy, an excellent movie about saving the future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched the movie with my 7 year old. We both liked the movie. I tried to explain her couple of points about the story. She got little scared, but I told her that we get scared from the things we don't know. In my opinion, the movie is about saving the future. The people on the future are suffering from the pollution and their generation is about to come to an end. To save themselves, they are wearing the protective cloths. Emma's struggle and her one precious teardrop sent with Mimzy to the future, saved the future. Al they needed was a pure, unpolluted memorabilia (the teardrop) from the past that will help them save the earth from the pollution. At the end of the movie, we are given small toys of Mimzy, and we will cherish them to remind us about the future. We all have the job to save the future. Every little try will count, like every disrespect about the earth will harm. This movie was a very good source for me to teach my daughter the importance of being earth friendly. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Because Spielberg no longer makes Spielberg films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... we have this sweet, magical and engrossing little treat, written by Toby Emmerich of all people, that (and I have emphasized this factor in other reviews) "connects" with the audience (via the children) almost immediately; and then takes the audience on a pleasant little ride into the internal Fantasyland that each of us carries within us. Other reviewers have emphasized that this is a "family" film but of late I have come to regard that label with suspicion. A McLuhan scholar might well argue that in the world of simultaneous multi-band electronic media, children are no longer children as such, they have evolved into "tiny people" and it is increasingly more difficult to under-estimate them. Similarly, this film should not be under-estimated. It works, beginning to end, it entertains, it intrigues. It also reacquaints US viewers with Joely Richardson, a vastly underexposed actress on this side of the pond. Would see it more than once. And I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will go down as a truly important and remembered film in SciFi. It is along the order of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. The Extra Terrestrial.People who only like Action/Adventure flicks won't have enough brain cells to get it, but true SciFi fans (the types who can read books too) will love this film. It's very powerful and emotional.It had some minor problems as any film does. There were some weak acting moments and a poor edit that should have been cut tighter, but in general it was excellent.In particular, 6yr old newcomer Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as the lead character Emma Wilder did a wonderful job. Unbelievable that a 6 year old child could be that effective in a role.I highly recommend this well written and directed film. It's one to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the less I like it.First off - these parents didn't act like parents. They show no real concern for what is happening to their children. When the boy teaches spiders to create the bridge, especially after a lifetime as a mediocre student, I'd have him off to a psychiatrist, pronto! Secondly - the irritating science teacher!!! I despise the fuzzy, magical thinking him and his "girlfriend" espoused. Any "science" teacher spouting that crap needs to be fired.Third - the irritating girlfriend of the science teacher!!! Who honestly believes in palmistry in this day and age! Fourth - Michael Clark Duncan - really, what the heck! After everything that happened, everything he knows, he just walks away? Give me a break. In this day and age, any FBI/CIA/NSA/Men in Black operative who walked away, would be fired and charged with dereliction of duty.Fifth - the detention facility the family was taken too. Only one camera in the whole place? Nothing is secured? No guards? Sixth - a ten year-old driving a big van? In Seattle? Two kids beside the road in the middle of nowhere for an extended time. Nobody came by at all? Seventh - the science teacher and his dreams? Why the heck is he having dreams about what the kids are doing? He hasn't been exposed to the toys.Those are just some of the major problems with this mockery of the wonderful Lewis Padgett (Kuttner &amp; Moore) story from the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie for Adults, Disguised as a Children's Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great Movie! This is a movie for adults disguised as a children's movie. Chris O'Neil (Noah) and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn (Emma) turn in an excellent performance as two kids who've found a box full of amazing things on the beach. Their parents David and Jo, played by Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson are perplexed as their kids quit acting like kids and start focusing on their new "toys". Noah's teacher Larry (Rainn Wilson) taps into the awareness that the kids are connected to something much bigger than all of them. This movie is difficult to compare with other movies. While it remains down to Earth and family oriented, it might be a little too complicated for young children. Expect young kids to twist, squirm, and talk while you are trying to catch the story. The special effects are great eye candy, but they are backed by a great story. It was particularly fun to see real life mathematics prodigy and physicist Brian Greene play a scientist in this movie. His presence alone is like an endorsement that the plot has some intelligent thought behind it. It's a fun movie. It's suitable for all ages, but perhaps an older crowd will appreciate it more. It's worth buying, renting, or seeing in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing really original here but pleasant enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Mimzy" is not so much based on, more inspired by, a classic SF short story, "Mimsy Were the Borogoves" by Lewis Padgett (a pseudonym used by authors and spouses Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore), which was itself inspired by Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking-Glass." That children are different from adults isn't news to parents, but no author(s) ever took that notion and ran further with it than Kuttner and Moore. They must have found their kids deeply weird, or vice versa.The original short story begins millions of years in the future. The human race has found some kind of higher plane of existence, which they prefer to our own. People begin life in our ordinary sphere, but in early childhood learn the technique of crossing over "from Earth." They are taught to do this by educational "toys." An ingenious but eccentric scientist of that distant future invents a Box, a kind of time machine. Having turned on the power, he realizes that the Box is empty. The device needs a control, a 3-dimensional solid that will react to the conditions of another age so that on its return he can tell where and when it has been. By chance, near at hand are some of his son's old "toys." He stuffs some into the Box just before it vanishes into the past. It does not return. Eventually he builds another Box, filling it with the rest of his son's "toys." He sets it to travel to late-19th-century Earth. It does not return either, after which the scientist abandons the project. (The authors do not explain why his son brought his "toys" along "from Earth" if he didn't need them any more. Also, although they brilliantly imagined the "toys" as futuristic devices, they somehow could not envision a time machine equipped with miniature devices for recording picture, sound, and environmental conditions at the target site. But then they wouldn't have had a story, would they?) The second Box actually winds up in Oxford about 1862, where it is found by none other than Alice Liddell. Charles Dodgson (Carroll) records fragments of what Alice has learned from the "toys" and works them into the Alice books, especially the poem "Jabberwocky." The first verse of the poem is Alice's interpretation of the crucial datum that makes possible the technique of crossing over. But Alice Liddell is already too old, and never fully masters the technique. The first Box appears on the outskirts of an American university town in the spring of 1942, where it is found by 7-year-old Scott Paradine, the son of a college professor. He and his toddler sister Emma also learn from their "toys." Eventually, their strange behavior concerns their father, who is naturally baffled by the "toys" when he tries to investigate their properties. After conferring with a psychologist who spouts very trendy Forties psychobabble, the parents become alarmed, and take away the "toys." But it's too late: Scott and Emma have learned enough from the "toys" and proceed on their own, especially after Scott discovers the "Jabberwocky" poem in a copy of "Through the Looking-Glass." In the final scene, on an otherwise perfectly ordinary Sunday, while their father watches in shock and disbelief, the children, without fear, hesitation or regret, simply fade away, "crossing over" to that other dimension. "They went in fragments, like thick smoke in a wind, or like movement in a distorting mirror. Hand in hand they went, in a direction Paradine could not understand, and as he blinked there on the threshold, they were gone." "Mimsy Were the Borogoves" is a brilliant story, but it is now very dated, both in style and in substance. Any modern film adaptation would of necessity be pretty much a complete rewrite, and "The Last Mimzy" is just that. It's also explicitly a "family film," and as such, the creepy, nightmare-in-bright-daylight quality of the original story is completely gone. "The Last Mimzy" is rather tame, sweet, optimistic and light, not to mention pretty clichéd: It's an eco-fable crossed with that old, rather tired plot device about how the human race, in the near or far future, has been vitiated by pollution, inbreeding, eugenics gone bad, nuclear holocaust, etc., and they need somehow to capture the vitality of the old, undomesticated human race and reinfuse it into their genetic stock. There have been so many SF novels, stories, films and TV shows with this theme that I'm having trouble coming up with titles, but the two I can think of right away are "The 4400" and a film from about 20 years ago called "Millennium," which was based on a book of the same title that I actually read before the movie was made.The only element preserved from "Mimsy Were the Borogoves" is that a boy in the present comes upon some "toys" sent from the future, and, with his younger sister, discovers their unusual properties. Everything else is different. It's a rather sweet story in its own way, and the child actors, especially little Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as Emma, are very engaging. Probably the part of the film that works least well is the subplot that gets Homeland Security into the act, in a rather contrived effort to introduce some suspense into the story. Instead of having the children cross into another dimension, a computerized rabbit doll, Mimzy, goes back into the future bearing with "her" Emma's tears with their trace of genetic material, which of course became the basis for the regeneration of the entire human race. If you can overlook this silliness and just let the movie roll over you, you'll enjoy this mostly pleasant but inconsequential entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's good about it: The middle of the movie where it gets creepy, and a little scary (which I thought the movie would be like), also some of the jokes where pretty funny. The actors and director did a good job, and the story would have been good if they changed a few things.What's bad about it: The kids get powers after they find the box of toys, which is fine except for the "Spider talk" where the boy can talk to bugs, which sort of messes the story up.Overall: The story was good, but after the "spider talk" the story got crazy, and it was so hard to focus during all of there powers. The trailer for the movie lies when they say it's a scary movie, which its not. So overall I was very disappointed by this movie! Rating PG for some thematic elements, mild peril and language My Rating: Pg for brief language</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The siblings Noah (Chris O'Neal) and Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) travel with their mother Jo (Joely Richardson) from Seattle to the family cottage in Whidbey Island to spend a couple of days while their workaholic father David Wilder (Timothy Hutton) is working. They find a box of toys from the future in the water and bring it home, and Emma finds a stuffed rabbit called Mimzy, and stones and a weird object, but they hide their findings from their parents. Mimzy talks telepathically to Emma and the siblings develop special abilities, increasing their intelligences to the level of genius. Their father becomes very proud when Noah presents a magnificent design in the fair of science and technology, and his teacher Larry White (Rainn Wilson) and his mystic wife Naomi Schwartz (Kathryn Hahn) become interested in the boy when he draws a mandala. When Noah accidentally assembles the objects and activates a powerful generator creating a blackout in the state, the FBI arrests the family trying to disclose the mystery. But Emma unravels the importance to send Mimzy back to the future."The Last Mimzy" is a delightful and refreshing sci-fi story and a great family entertainment. Seven years old Rhiannon Leigh Wryn and thirteen years old Chris O'Neal are excellent in the lead roles of smart siblings but the adult support cast have many disappointing lines and attitudes. The screenplay discloses since the very beginning that Mimzy was sent from the future to save the human race, therefore there is no surprise or twist in the end. I did not have a great expectation in this adventure, and I had a wonderful surprise. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Mimzy, A Chave do Universo" ("Mimzy, The Key of the Universe")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre direction almost brings down a fascinating screenplay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a fan of Ray Bradbury's blend of fantasy and science fiction, you will undoubtedly find this small, endearing movie a pleasurable experience. The screenwriters do an exemplary job of incorporating hard science and child-like wonder into the story's DNA without bogging down the more intimate and important story of a family dealing with things beyond their understanding. The actors also do an exemplary job at playing believable human beings. This is something I rarely see in both family and science fiction films, with notable exceptions like ET and THE TERMINATOR. As a white, upper middle-class family they were entirely believable. The ideas regarding genetics, time travel, intellectual curiosity, and the endurance of humanity are refreshingly stimulating and thought-provoking. Some if it may go over your children's heads but there's enough whiz-bang to keep them planted in their seats.Unfortunately, Bob Shaye's direction isn't up to fully rendering the subtleties and thrills of the script. His framing is ugly and claustrophobic, his staging is awkward, and his take on the futuristic world is downright uninspired. Had this been in the hands of someone like Tim Burton, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, or Brad Bird, this may well have been a tiny masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The future of children's science fiction?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Mimzy is a film that I hope represents the future of children's science fiction. It is a future without bone-crunching comic book super heroes or malevolent movie bad guys or self-absorbed parents - a film that respects a child's intelligence, not to mention a kid's need to dream like a kid. I suggest Mimzy for anyone who has children, is fond of children, knows of children, or wants to simply feel really, really good about a film without being pandered to or suffer that condescending 'tude from Hollywood filmmakers who think they can sneak into your brain without you noticing.There's an honest, earnest dreamlike quality to the film, a low-key, homespun feel to these two normal kids with two normal parents, who stumble upon a strange box-like artifact bobbing in the Seattle surf.Ten year old Noah (Chris O'Neil) and his younger sister, Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) bring the box home. It contains several toys, including a worn, plush bunny that emits a strangely soothing electronic chirp. Emma is immediately drawn to the stuffed animal, whose name, she declares, is "Mimzy." Noah is instead infatuated with a strange rectangle of sparkling glass that seems to have advanced mathematical and geometrical powers. And very soon thereafter, their lives begin to change.In many ways, Mimzy is a clever, sci-fi tinged mystery thriller, and the toys are clues. The film manages to hold one's attention without resorting to pratfalls or, as mentioned, archetypal villains. There are, in fact, no real antagonists in this film. A few confused or misinformed adults hinder Noah and Emma's eventual challenge, but Mimzy seems to know its course. Even the inevitable government intervention (the movie's weakest device) provides little distraction. Yes, there are a few improbabilities, but kids won't notice. For the most part, the film remains delightfully unpredictable - so the less you know about it, the better.You may observe a few thematic similarities to E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial, but I can overlook these parallels. Steven Spielberg's E.T. is 25 years old after all, and Mimzy is based on a short sci-fi tale "Mimzy Were the Borogoves" published in 1943, long before E.T. ever phoned home.Several references are made to Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking Glass" and Roger Waters (of Pink Floyd fame) sings out the closing credits, with a casual reference to "the dark side of the moon." So any perceived trippiness you encounter isn't accidental. In fact, the word psychedelic seems occasionally appropriate, although it's marginal and kids won't be aware.The Last Mimzy is an unapologetic New Age ode to, essentially, the evolution (and survival) of the human race - and I kind of like that. Despite our mounds of Styrofoam, our SUVs and our blithe 'excessism,' perhaps every so often we can still pull a rabbit out of our collective hat. This particular bunny's name is Mimzy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're Doomed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a soft place in my heart for the Alice in Wonderland stories. They're deep. Oh they're not just deep in a Charlie Brown or Norman Rockwell sort of way, where we imput wisdom. They're pretty bottomless: logic, semiotics, geometric cosmology. I've spent a lot of time with them, and been uniformly rewarded.Part of the wisdom in them concerns how people get things wrong when they "explain" them. There's something about logic that it runs out of its own sense quickly. So its a special amusement of mine to see how movies use Alice, and the various ways they twist in the wrong directions. It has its own magnetic force that forbids you from avoiding looking like an idiot. That's the joke.The word around which this was built "Mimzy," is actually "mimsy." Its in a poem usually considered sonorous nonsense, in fact celebrated precisely for its nonsense. In fact, it was written while Carroll was a child and is a mix of Saxon and French words reflecting his father's obsession with the "pollution" of the homeland's language. This reaches into the Alice stories which came later by faking a photo that has Alice Liddell (for whom the stories were written) holding a stuffed animal identical to the one that features in the story. Presumably, Alice's toy was one of the earlier mimsies which though it made the girl brilliant, failed in its mission to return to the future with some unspecified payload.My gosh, let's see. There's some Tibetan mysticism, mixed paranormal phenomenon and ordinary magic involved, yet strangely unmagical tasks are required. Oh, and it needs regular old electricity, lots of it. This prompts the national police to confound things. Michael Clarke Duncan plays the top cop, a sort of daft fellow bordering on affirmative action satire. A new age couple is clearly humorous.I can't recall a bigger mess. The only thing not repulsive is the notion that magic is visible, has geometry and does not respect gravity.

		<shortDescription>Not unenjoyable, but a bit dumb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Noah and Emma find assorted toy-type items (including a toy rabbit which Emma names Mimzy and which seems to talk to her) which behave unusually and seem to make the two children much cleverer, piqueing the interest of Noah's science teacher. However, the Government gets wind of these oddnesses, and, well, you know how paranoid Government departments can get.In many respects this is quite a good family movie, with decent performances (especially from the two kids - the girl has an annoyingly squeaky voice but acts well) and a tolerable payoff. It is, however, as dumb as a plate full of chicken wings. Especially irritating is the fact that people question the children and, as soon as the children start explaining this stuff which everyone has witnessed, they are ignored, disbelieved, or both. And as for the paranoid Government department, well, 'nuff said.It's not bad if you don't feel very critical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of new-age hippie junk, too dumb for adults and too complex for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair, I thought some of the special effects were kind of cool, and the soundtrack was good. Otherwise, unless you're a yoga instructor, a soccer mom, Al Gore or an aging hippie, you'll find this movie to have far more pros than cons.First off, the family in this movie looks like their photo should be airbrushed onto the title of a modern parenting magazine. Emma is the generic fakely-cute little girl, lost in her own world, whereas her older brother Noah is a quiet, unmemorable, 2-D character with virtually no personality. The parents, Joanna "Jo" Wilder and Dave Wilder, act more like two newlywed college students than a mom and dad and have this belief that their kids are somehow much more gifted than any other kid out there. I mean, sure, every parent thinks they have the smartest kid on the planet, but the only thing to make these kids any different from all the other rugrats out there is an event that happens entirely by chance. Emma and Noah find a mysterious box on the beach which contains a variety of weird objects, including a stuffed rabbit named Mimzy. It's then that the kids start experiencing strange, new-found talents. Otherwise, this is a family so generic of the 21st century that there's nothing special at all about 'em.I know it's a fictional movie, but COME ON! The family gets dragged away by the FBI and locked away! Hello, Firestarter (1984)! This movie appears original at first but it isn't by any means. It seems to rip off many ideas from other movies.The acting in this movie is terrible! I've seen low-budget TV movies with better acting than The Last Mimzy, and I think the worst acting came from the roles of Emma and the parents.Elizabeth May, Al Gore, P.E.T.A. and Greenpeace would all love this movie. It's got a preachy, environmental message that underlies within the whole plot. When are those eco-freaks going to stop pushing their anti-pollution propaganda on little kids? Speaking of eco-freaks, this movie is full of bizarre new age crud, yoga-type stuff and weird zen things. Not in a religious way, more in a tacky way.All in all, this is a movie that claims to have a lot of deep intelligence and imagination, but ends up just being a big disappointment. If you want a truly amazing movie to show your kids, try Opal Dream (2006). Opal Dream is an Australian movie about a little girl who inspires the small opal mining town she lives in with her two imaginary friends, Pobby and Dingan. Opal Dream is one adults can enjoy as well, it's not childish but it's full of imagination and intelligence, believe it or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last Mimzy - letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another usual Children's story. A little girl and a boy discover an out of this world object that will change their lives and the people around them forever. Good one I should say. But with some serious drawbacks. Here and there you can see the producers trying to give messages to children. Considering the fact that this is a children's movie, It's justifiable. One clear message I got was how whacked Buddhist people are!?! I mean come on? Why do all movie people have such a little and completely misguided understanding of Buddhism. Buddhists don't meditate like that.The movie leaves you with just so many loose ends. It's like the writer has been indecisive of what the movie is going to be like. One time it gives the impression of being like a story based on aliens and It just changes without explanation. Maybe it was done intentionally to add an element of surprise, But obviously hasn't succeeded for me. Like for instance at first in the visions there are clearly aliens, and talk about a bridge across the whole universe and also Emma's curious questions about life on other planets. But all these lead to nothing and ends up with a totally different story based on time travel, which blows. I mean what about those "mandalas". What purpose do they serve. It's like I said. So many loose ends.But disregarding all the flaws in the flow of the story, I thought this movie was quite appealing. The visual effects, CGI, Gives this an extra edge which seems almost out of place. As ever Howard shore music add value. The poor cast really doesn't do that much justice either. For instance I've seen much better Kid actors in various other movies. But the director really seems to understand how kids work, how they think and their behavior. The enjoyment factor is above average for this movie. I mean as a kid, I would have been pretty much psyched about this movie. Oh, Simpler times! This really won my heart over until the last 3 minutes of the movie, Which leaves you dumbfounded and angry, why do they have to mess something beautiful like this. I mean It wasn't that great before that last bit, but that bit totally screws the whole movie up. Another good one ruined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice in Spielbergland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quite an entertaining film, and I liked the way it incorporated Lewis Carroll's evergreen Alice in Wonderland tale into its story of extra-terrestrial visitors, but it falters very badly in the last reel and ends up looking like just another inferior copy of ET.Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn play siblings who stumble across a mysterious box on the beach which happens to contain a cuddly rabbit transported from a dying planet in a desperate quest for the elixir it needs to revive its people. Previous mimzys, we learn, made it to earth before - most obviously in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century when it landed in the lap of the girl who inspired Lewis Carroll to write Alice in Wonderland (rabbit, geddit?) but failed to complete their mission. Now this merging of fiction with factual history is always something that appeals to me - I like the idea of grand stories unfolding around historical fact unseen by all those who record history, and for a while this film runs with the idea quite well. Then all of a sudden it runs into a brick wall and turns to Spielberg for inspiration. I'm no screenwriter but, to me, the obvious idea would have been to follow the Lewis Carroll/Alice Liddell theme and see where it took me: the options would seem to be far greater in number than simply regurgitating the childlike-alien-relying-on-earthling-children-for-survival storyline from Spielberg's eighties flick.The child male lead looks like the youngest incarnation of Harry Potter until advanced intelligence courtesy of the alien rabbit's bric-a-brac means he no longer needs the specs. For a while he looks as if he's going to be the focus of the film, but it soon switches to his cuter younger sister. There's a hippy type teacher who dreams of winning lottery numbers but neglects to write them down, much to the chagrin of his earth-mother wife. I thought he was going to turn into some sinister nemesis but it turned out he was simply a plot device to explain the situation to the kids' unwitting parents and provide the kids themselves with a lift to the damp squib finale. That's probably where this film's real failing lies: there aren't really any bad guys to root against. Michael Clarke Duncan's FBI agent is the closest we come to a bad guy, but he's really just doing his job and bears no ill will toward the kids or their cuddly alien friend.Bottom line: young kids will love it, older kids will be entertained without being fooled, and most adults will realise that what starts off as a promising tale loses its way badly around the midway mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's pretty harmless yet also fairly forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While vacationing at their parent's beach house, young Noah and Emma Wilder find a strange box. When they open it, they discover several bizarre objects and a child's stuffed rabbit named Mimzy. As the kids play with the objects, they discover that they do seemingly miraculous things. Even more amazing, the children themselves start gaining remarkable new powers. But where did the object come from? And what will happen when their parents, or even the government, learn about their discovery? The Last Mimzy is a perfectly harmless and bland film. It's mildly enjoyable for kids but it doesn't really offer much for people over the age of 14. I think the film's main problem was the sluggish pacing and dull direction. The film is a little over ninety minutes long but it felt so much longer because everything happened so slowly. Director Robert Shaye shot all of the scenes without really injecting any personality into the movie. Everything felt generic and nothing really stood out; not the acting, special effects or anything. The writing was better because it at least had some creativity to it. The basic premise was intriguing and the film presented some interesting ideas so I can't say that the whole movie was a bore.The acting was on the forgettable side, much like the actual movie. Rhiannon Leigh Wryn was pretty good as Emma. She's not the best child actor out there but at least she wasn't annoying. She had a few decent scenes and it never sounded like she was just reciting her lines. Chris O'Neil was the exact opposite. He was dull, annoying and he sounded like he was reading his lines. It's kind of sad that he got out acted by a seven year old girl. Although, they did have a realistic brother and sister relationship so he did help to do something right. Timothy Hutton was shockingly invisible. His performance here was quite similar to his performance in "Last Holiday". He showed up, did his lines and left. He didn't seem to put in much effort but of course he's an excellent actor so a simplistic role like this probably wasn't much for him. Joely Richardson was the very definition of bland and was in the same boat as Hutton. Rainn Wilson and Kathryn Hahn were both alright as was Michael Clarke Duncan although he didn't get a lot of screen time. Overall, The Last Mimzy was so harmless that it was really hard to hate. At the same time, nothing about it really stood out and it ended up being forgettable. Rating 5/10</fullReview>

Here the story is good maybe it expands to slow but still the movie is not boring.I liked the great acting from the two unknown small children, I could say that they made a much better job then the adults. Still it has some mystery that may not make any sense for the kids with the same age as those portrayed in the film.

		<shortDescription>Needed to follow the original story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Mimzy" was a movie I looked forward to seeing, since I have loved the story it was to be based on; the 1943 Sci-Fi story "Mimzy Were the Borogoves" by Lewis Padgett. I must say I was disappointed by the totality of the movie. The original story, as a movie could have been awesome due to the themes of the original story, and the state of the art in movie making. The story has two powerful themes;one from the parents view and one from a child's view. For parents, the struggle is how our children can sometimes grow to exceed who we are, and the parental struggle to keep them both safe and let them grow at the same time to be who they are. From the child's view, is the innate sense that they want new things and are passionate about independence and discovery. The movie really fails to get this through the muddled plot and uninspiring direction. I loved the location which worked well, the actors could have worked with better direction and better writing. Also, while I believe we need to be more responsible for maintaining the earth's resources, arbitrarily stuffing this theme into the movie, while missing the point of the original story, comes off lame and mechanical. If you are looking for a family movie, that would be a good project to compare and contrast to the original writing, this is the one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for Sci-Fi Geeks or Film Snobs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this on TV for the first time and found it charming. Based very loosely on a Sci-Fi story from 1943 by Henry Kuttner and his wife C.L Moore this story was adapted for the screen by a team led by noted screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Bob Shaye. Shaye is a longtime producer of films best known for the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the Lord of the Rings and although his film career spans 45 years this is only the second feature film that he has directed. The film is relatively small and comes across as low budget and the story as written for the screen is weak and full of holes but oddly enough it comes across as a good movie. It's central characters are little kids in Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as Emma and Chris O'Neil as her brother Noah. they discover a strange box on the sand at their parents summer beach house and it contains strange objects and a stuffed bunny rabbit that Emma calls Mimzy. Mimzy is an artificial life object built from nanotechnology in the Earths future. The future has been corrupted y an ecological disaster that threatens human life by the pollution of DNA. Mimzys have been created to be sent to the Earth's past to retrieve pure uncontaminated DNA because time travel for humans themselves is fatal to the human body. None have Mimzys have ever come back and this is mankind's last chance. The children develop supernatural skills and knowledge for the strange objects found in the box but a massive power outage they inadvertently cause alerts them to the FBI and in turn scientists. The film revolves around Emma and director Shaye gets the most out of the young actress Wryn as she and her bunny are just delightful. Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton co-star as the Noah and Emma's parents Jo and David. Rainn Wilson is Noah's science teacher Larry white, Kathryn Hahn is Larry's girlfriend Naomi Schwartz and Michael Clarke Duncan is the menacing but kindly FBI agent Nathanial Broadman. Yes, this could have been better and more believable and had better effects and more of the future but so what. It's a nice little family film and I will give it an 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone unless you are a sci-fi geek that only going to tear it apart or a film snob looking for an art film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartfelt effort that swings and misses...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but remains somewhat charming despite its flaws. "The Last Mimzy" (very loosely adapted from a classic tale by "Lewis Padgett," one of the many pseudonyms of the brilliant husband/wife writing team of Henry Kuttner &amp; Catherine L. Moore) is an all-ages sci-fantasy very much in the "E.T." oeuvre, but falls distinctly short of Spielberg's classic as well as the original short story. In a time-traveling nutshell, two youngsters find a box of toys sent from the future to retrieve something vitally needed for the survival/renewal of humanity in that future. The "toys" prove to be highly sophisticated machines designed to teach their discoverers what to do with them. The kids, played with great likability by newcomers Chris O'Neil and a precocious Rhiannon Leigh "Hulk" Wryn, gain the attention of parents, teachers, and Homeland Security alike as their interaction with the machines gets more...interesting.I'd had high hopes for this one, given screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin's past record with "Ghost" and "Jacob's Ladder," but this one's more on the level of "Deep Impact" or "Stuart Little 2," which is a shame. Robert "I AM New Line Cinema" Shaye handles the directing chores with a devoted producer's enthusiasm, but not a whole lot of real inspiration. Kuttner and Moore's neat little gem of fantasy/horror (yes, horror) has been transformed into a Hollywood New-Agey inspirational greeting card, replete with palm-reading, mandalas, and precognitive dreams. A groan-inducing instance of egregious product-placement doesn't help, if only because it's so utterly illogical.Production values are good, the fx are pleasing without being overly showy, and the score is suitable, featuring a typically plaintive single from Roger "Pink Floyd" Waters that plays over the titles/credit reel at film's end. The acting is competent but unremarkable aside from the aforementioned youngsters. Timothy "Why didn't I take that role in Risky Business?" Hutton and Joely "Nip/Tuck" Richardson are appropriately confused and concerned parents, while Rainn "Six Feet Under" Wilson and Kathryn "Crossing Jordan" Hahn are amusing in their geeky, hippy-dippy roles. Michael Clarke "Sin City" Duncan takes a paycheck as an uncharacteristically soft-hearted Homeland Security honcho. It's all very flower-power, eco-consciously earnest in its desire to tell a family-friendly story, but so ignores the theme of its source material as to become unrecognizable pabulum.I have to admit, watching it led me to the pleasure of rereading "Padgett"'s short masterpiece. Failure though it was at the box office, I hope it finds a better place in home video, if only to lead others to reading the work of Kuttner and Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People on IMDb are comparing this film to lots of others, none of which I've seen, so I can't comment on that aspect. "The Last Mimzy" from 2007 is a children's' film that adults will also enjoy. It stars Timothy Hutton, Joely Richardson, Rainn Wilson, Michael Clark Duncan, Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn.The story concerns a brother and sister who find a box in the ocean that contains toys with magical powers. The sister becomes attached to one of the toys, a bunny that is named Mimzy and who seems to give her messages.This is a fantasy, quasi-sci fi film that touches on several philosophies, including Buddhism and metaphysics, and it's also a bit of a mystery. It did remind me of one film I've seen, ET. The kids were cute and believable as brother and sister. Rainn Wilson, as the boy's science teacher, had the showiest role, and he brought a lot to it.I can't say too much about it except that it's a decent story with nice effects that kids should enjoy. For the adults, well, it's good to be reminded once in a while in this high tech world of the importance of humanity.</fullReview>

I had not slept when I watched this movie, and I think some conceptions mentioned in this movie are fascinating, but the whole story is a little too simple. And I also not very like some people describe ancient east culture as just something mysterious, without anything which is logical and scientific. The eastern knowledge is also science. I hope western people could know more about eastern culture than just laying figure of Buddha on the floor and speaking something maybe couldn't be understood by ancient Indian towards it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good SF film for kids (fun to watch for adults, too)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good film. I did not want to watch The Last Mimzy, because I thought it would just be a silly kids' movie. Movies for kids these days are very often very boring and unimaginative, and they both insult the kids' intelligence and teach them nothing new. Also, although it might be harmful for the child's imagination, most kids will enjoy simple movies anyway, but most adults will find them too silly. The Last Mimzy stands out as a kids' film, as it's interesting, imaginative and non-patronizing, for a kids' film, and it can surely be enjoyed by adults as well, especially those who like (literary) science fiction (the movie is an adaptation of a story by Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore).There are very many good things about this movie, but a word of caution is due at first: although this movie CAN be fun for adults to watch (like many other films that kids can enjoy too, like the animated My Neighbor Totoro), it is NOT a mature film with children and fairly-tale themes in it (like, for instance, Pan's Labyrinth). It is a good kids movie, and should be considered and judged as such. The CGI effects and the sci-fi-esqe gimmicks are all very cool, and all the performances in the movie are exceptional, with the female lead deserving a special mention. Somewhere half-way through the movie I noticed the seamless performance by Rhiannon Leigh Wryn - having not been aware of it before for the simple reason that it is so good that you are just watching a kid responding naturally to the situation she's in (and then you realize she's actually acting and delivering lines).I would have given this move a much higher rating if not for the looser writing and editing in the last 10-20 minutes. It seems like suddenly someone realized they had to make the movie end and they only had 20 minutes to fit the rest of the movie in, instead of 2 hours, so what we see of the plot is really jumpy, and it somehow affects (or is affected by) the editing too. However, even when the quality of the movie goes down for the last 20 minutes, it is merely as bad, plot and editing-wise, as Artificial Intelligence: AI, and a lot of people think AI was a good movie - which means that 4/5 of The Last Mimzy is A LOT better. My dissatisfaction with some of the plot-holes at the very end diminished somehow when I realized that this was not supposed to be a hard SF movie, but a kids' film, so a lot of what happens does not have to be explicitly justified, and can be considered metaphor or something seen from a kid's point of view.Anyhow, I seriously recommend this movie for people who like good sci-fi movies, as well as for people who have kids and would like to watch a movie together. One interesting point about this movie is that it portrays a positive view of intellectual giftedness, neither showing it as something akin to magical powers, nor as a disability, so gifted children could relate to those themes in the movie well (although they might benefit from the emphasis on a sci-fi explanation of some of the plot in a follow-up discussion of the movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't coincidence that this is actually an intellectually interesting children's movie, taken from a famous science fiction story 'Mimsy were the Borogoves' written by Lewis Padgett (Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore). It is one of my favorite short stories, although the story ends differently, and they had to embellish the story for the movie. Still, the deviations are acceptable and in the spirit of the story, and I understand why the ending needed to be as it is for the movie.My six-year-old granddaughter was enrapt as she watched the movie tonight, and I am going to buy her the Mimsy doll for Christmas along with a copy of the movie.This movie is seriously satisfying to watch in many ways. It treats children as being intellectually worthy and really plays on their intuitive superiority. It addressed the dullness that takes place over time and the way our brain processes crystallize as we age. Richard Posner discusses this in more than one of his books on law and economics, but particularly in his book Aging and Old Age. One example that comes to mind is that even children's cameras are crappy, they are cheap items that don't have the capability of taking high-quality pictures, because, after all, they are just for children. I say hogwash to this, and I wonder what pictures would come of high quality, albeit necessarily sturdy cameras in the hands of young children. Children are underestimated, talked down to, and it is simply a joke that we as adults come off our pedestals to present things in ways that children can understand them, when in actuality, we need to raise ourselves to higher levels to comprehend the sensibilities of children. The short story 'Mimsy were the Borogroves' and to a lesser extent the movie 'The Last Mimsy' explores the possibilities of childhood and the potential of children, in hyperbole, but it is aiming at something real. At least, that is what I believe the authors intended to convey.This was a movie that needed to be made, and it was well done to boot. Great acting, and the shooting looked good, high quality all around. They obviously had to take some dramatic license. Much like the ghost in Hamlet, you have to accept the terms of the story as presented even though in reality it would be absurd. There is a lot to glean here.After reading many comments criticizing the movie for not following the short story as written, it may have turned out great had they followed the story, but it could NEVER have been a family movie. They chose a direction with their embellishments and likewise changed the ending to be consistent with a family movie. Is that really such a terrible thing to do?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, this plays like the children's' version of What the Bleep Do We Know? Down the Rabbit Hole. This IS Down the Rabbit Hole in one aspect, and appears to bear ties to Through the Looking Glass, as well, but that is a large part of its charm.This is not so much Alice in Wonderland, but is more what would have happened had Wonderland come to Alice...had Alice been smart enough to have figured it out. I enjoyed this far more than expected, as there have been SO many kid's movies out lately with quantum themes, but this one had something lacking from most...and rather large amount of heart.I found this to be intelligent, touching, and inspirational. Regardless of age, this is an enjoyable film, with a great story at the center, some stunning (and realistic) effects, and a fantastic execution. This is wholly enjoyable and I love it.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read a number of the low rating reviews and I have to conclude that these reviewers either a) didn't actually see the film or b)have an grotesquely jaundiced view of the world (Actually exactly the sort of people the film sees as 'poisoning' our environment right now). I thought all the characters responded quite accurately to the circumstances they encountered in the film and were themselves believable types from the real world. The Mimzy was a sophisticated device for identifying a subject and collecting DNA from the past. It's non- threatening approach was in tune with the elevated moral standards of a future society. All the actors did an excellent job with their roles however modest they were and the end result is a joy to watch.</fullReview>

As others have mentioned, there are tons of plot holes (like how they walked out of a secure facility without anyone noticing all the cameras swarming with bugs), but the charming and genuine young girl keeps bringing it back to center. The parents are kind of two-dimensional, and the ever-wooden Michael Clarke Duncan isn't even flat (I think he should just call himself Mike Duncan, and i wish people would stop casting him in the part of anything more than a throwaway 80-IQ extra, god is he made of lead).

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable sci-fi family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Last Mimzy' is an enjoyable family sci-fi film that almost captures the warm glow 'ET' give me. Many films aimed at kids today seem determined to focus on bland, repetitive topics such as school and romance so it makes a pleasant change to find a rather intelligent children's sci-fi film, especially since most sci-fi films aimed at the family/children date back to the Seventies and Eighties ('DARYL', 'ET', 'The Witch Mountain' films, 'Flight of the Navigator', etc as examples).This film centres on siblings, six-year-old Emma and ten-year-old Noah, who find a strange box of toys on a beach. Emma discovers one of the toys, a stuffed rabbit named Mimzy, can communicated telepathically to her while the other toys gift the children with strange new abilities such as telekinesis and heightened intelligence. But the children soon draw the attention of both the adults around them and the FBI, who threaten to destroy their plans to send Mimzy back to where it belongs.This is a film where most definitely the child actors, Chris O'Neil as Noah and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as Emma, carry the story almost on their own and they certainly rise to the occasion. They give very solid performances, despite their age and inexperience, and as such their characters come across as being realistically portrayed and who the audience can empathise with. Their sibling relationship is shown in a realistic fashion, without being cutesy or something that escaped from 'The Waltons'. The adult actors, including Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton as the children's parents and Timothy Hutton as Noah's teacher, give good supporting depictions.This plot is involving and exciting, if perhaps a bit too complicated for the under eights, and- through the eyes of children-- explores topics such as the importance of caring for the planet, why not everything different is a threat and that sometimes children are far more intuitive than adults. While I see some people like to look for political agendas in 'The Last Mimzy' (these are probably the kind of paranoid folk who seem politics in everything), the story is told in an honest, well-paced manner without being preachy or blatant.'The Last Mimzy' is one for the family who is sick of films dumbing down to kids and re-hashing repetitive, predictable plots. It is an intelligent film that offers the chance to discuss important issues with children while also entertaining. It's also a good film for the budding young sci-fi fan who isn't quite ready for some of the 'Star Trek' episodes.</fullReview>

Upon opening, the puzzle box contained shiny rocks, a conch shell and a stuffed rabbit among other things. The rabbit tells Emma its name is Mimzy. The box contained a green crystal block that Noah discovers allows him to move objects. The box and new "toys" make their way back home to Seattle, and life really gets strange. The children's mom(Joely Richardson)is also trying to digest the fact Noah and Emma are specially gifted children. Half the state of Washington is blacked out and it alerts Homeland Security to the Wilder home. Mimzy is the phenomenon that holds the key to mankind's future. F/X are fascinating. Also in the cast: Michael Clarke Duncan, Rain Wilson and Kathryn Hahn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treat children like caring and intelligent beings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many adults whose vision has become clouded by the weight of the current materialist paradigm, children generally are much more open to the mystery and wonder of the universe. Most films geared to children, however, lack the vision to portray this wonder, resigning themselves to the conformist drum beat of ugly monsters and good versus evil confrontations. Robert Shaye's The Last Mimzy, however, treats children like the caring, intelligent beings that they are, showing an appreciation of interesting and beautiful things that are available beyond iPods, computer games, and other forms of commercialized entertainment.Based on a short story from 1943 by Lewis Padgett, a scientist from the future looks to children from the past to save his dying world. Apparently the future world is so poisoned that people have to wear alien-looking suits for protection from pollution. As 10-year old Noah Wilder (Chris O'Neil) and his 6-year old sister Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) discover an odd looking box that washes up on the beach near their family's summer home in the Seattle area, the door is opened to a non-linear reality that they could have scarcely imagined.In this reality, small rocks can spin on their own and provide the opening to a different dimension, a glowing crystal allows Noah to teleport objects, a sea shell emits strange noises, and a stuffed rabbit communicates telepathically and tells Emma that she represents future humanity's last chance. Newly possessed of heightened powers, Noah is able to create a science project that deeply impresses his science teacher Larry White (Rainn Wilson). Larry visits the boy's mother (Joely Richardson) and father (Timothy Hutton) with girlfriend Naomi (Kathryn Hahn) to tell the parents not only about Noah's science project but about the boy's notebook which contains drawings of Tibetan mandalas, images that the teacher has been seeing in dreams.He explains to the somewhat bewildered parents that mandalas may provide the path to focus meditation on healing the world. Naomi reads the palms of the two children and finds an unusual purity in Emma's palm but neither she nor Larry can understand or interpret the results or the changes taking place in the lives of the children. When Noah's experiments result in a sudden blackout of the entire Seattle area, the Feds naturally become interested. A Homeland Security official played by Michael Clarke Duncan traces the source of the blackout to the Wilder's suburban home and, using the authority of the Patriot Act, storms into their home, confidently filling the role of villain. If you've seen E.T., you know that the children will become the embodiment of calm and reason while the adults remain clueless and panic hysterically at the sight of anything unusual.I welcome the fact that a major studio has produced a film for children that dares to introduce elements of Eastern mysticism without the usual silliness attending such references. Unfortunately, the film takes a scatter shot approach to spirituality, throwing together a smörg?sbord of palm reading, meditation, Tibetan mandalas, lucid dreaming, mental telepathy, and levitation, in a way that lacks any organic relationship to the film's message. However, while The Last Mimzy lacks the imagination and stylistic vision to be a fully satisfying experience, it is nonetheless a timely and entertaining film that children can appreciate and identify with and adults may find thought provoking. If it can make us all more aware that the infinite affection of children is needed to restore sanity to a troubled world, it will have accomplished something much more profound than spinning rocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two children find what is called a toybox from the future with clues how to help save the world of that future time with help only they can provide. With assistance from some funny fringe-element folks along the way, they discover supernatural powers in the items they find, in the past, and the future, as well as new appreciation for their family and friends, and most of all, unlock powers of self-acceptance.There are tips of the hat to Superman and to some Spielberg films as well as some cute touches that you don't see coming.There were one or two points that I wish they had omitted. They made the resolution a bit frightening for children, so I wouldn't recommend letting very small children see it alone. They also involved religion (Tibetanism, Buddhism) which wasn't really necessary to the plot and just muddied things a bit. And there was a plot hole where the scientist is seen being attacked and is described as being "frightening" but suddenly all is well. The reason for the attack and the fright is never really explained, as is the sudden loss of interest by the authorities who just saw state secrets transmitted to another galaxy for all they know.Other than those points, however, it is a very interesting film that the family should and can watch and enjoy together. Adults will enjoy some of the subtler spots (like the literally "inside" humor of Intel inside). A good film for a family to watch and talk about. Thanks to the last and not so flimsy Mimzy.</fullReview>

Emma immediately took a strong liking to the toy bunny rabbit that was inside one of the main compartments. Everything that was found in the box resulted in the kids having remarkable talents that were simply unheard of in the past.

High marks for the two child actors, particularly Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as Emma Wilder, who with Chris O'Neil as her brother Noah, never seem to be acting, but come across as just two normal kids. The "government overstepping it's bounds" part of the plot seems a bit shoe-horned in, but it does give some minor characters a chance to get back into the story.

The adults who trust the children are richly rewarded and those in fear learn to trust and love - a gorgeous message. The Sci Fi/ Spiritual theme is refreshing and empowering to watch. With the planet in high fear momentum it is interesting to watch how the adults in the film react to the unknown and the children open and of course save humanity.

Oh and we have the evil FBI (if you are of the conservative persuasion, you will notice a little knock at The Patriot Act in this film, but it is slight and easy to ignore). There is a time travel element here that although a key point of the story, if you think about it very much, it leaves you kind of flat. But the child actors are awesome and the bulk of the journey is fun. We had fun watching the expressions on our kids faces while they watched. Pop some popcorn and enjoy.

I was expecting a kiddie flick, and while small children could view this film and be entertained, it has implications that are best interpreted by a more mature audience. It is a story that used children as a medium for influencing adults. Out of the mouths of babes, as they say.As I say, I really did not know what I was getting, but I was impressed with the story, the acting, especially considering the children largely carried the story. The weakest aspect of the film for me was the terrorist response unit, as their "we're sorry" attitude would not fly in the real world. That little bit aside, there was actually a measure of plausibility to this film; it was not so out there that it is untenable. It is an interesting concept, and the film was not your average predictable fantasy. I was just really surprised by the way the story carried, given the somewhat mature implications of the storyline and the leading actors being children.

The highlights of the movie are definitely the visual effects and the suspense at the beginning of the movie. The sound track is pretty neat too. the plot of the story is kinda hazy with far too much to digest. But then of course if your looking for some good enough fun for your money, this shouldn't tick you off.

The future shows in this film,that a society perhaps 15000 years ahead of us lost their ability to reason and to be compassionate in the darkest times. Law made by a swift hand,as well as efficient drone soldiers to correct mistakes often made by their own governments. Yet it took two innocent children to correct those mistakes in the past where the imagination ran wild and free,able to leap beyond years in order to bring some kind of order to chaos. The dna required was to be carried by mimzy,a stuffed rabbit with nano-technology so extreme,it would take decade upon decade to decipher by the best scientists. Yet it is this mimzy which would be transported back by use of unique objects held by the children,to open a bridge way across space and time,so that mimzy could go back to its creator. Thus giving back what they lost in the first place with the help of emmas tear drop soaked into mimzy during the transport home. This was a clever movie of what we can lose in so little time,technology is increasing 700 % and humanity is decreasing by double. We can learn from a little rabbit called mimzy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somehow, it's very forgettable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last Mimzy" isn't horrible. It's just forgettable. How? I'm not really sure.When I first saw it in theaters, and I thought it was okay. But the more I thought about it, the less memorable it became.The movie is about two kids, an older brother and a younger sister, who find a box on a beach full of weird items. One of these items is a stuffed bunny rabbit named Mimzy. But these items aren't just toys. Apparently, they're from outer space or something. And as the kids play with them, they become geniuses and gain supernatural abilities. But when the kids get out of hand, the FBI has to come in and investigate. As all this happens, the film gets weirder and weirder as it explores the past, future, space, and what these weird toys the kids found on the beach are doing to humanity.This is a really hard movie to criticize. Because it's really not that bad. The acting is decent and the special effects are weird and colorful - a perfect fit to the strange storyline.But as strange and creative as this movie is, it's really forgettable. Which is sort of unfair, because forgettable doesn't always mean bad. But why spend money on a movie that in a matter of weeks you'll be thinking, "What's that movie?" or "What was it about again?" Bpnix12 rating: 2/5 Stars (4/10) and not recommended. But out of all the movies of 2007 I'm not recommending, this one is probably the one you'd be least disappointed in. It was a close call.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How many characters did this movie need?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Mimzy is a slow moving, overly complex attempt at an E.T. style family drama that somehow ended up with a PG rating. The acting is fine, with the two young leads doing a good job, but the story unfolds slowly and never manages to generate enough tension or humor (there is really no humor that I recall) to hold the viewer's attention as it does so. There is nothing to draw this effort out of the crowd of films striving for the family film buck Noah and Emma Wilder are a young brother and sister (Neil and Wryn) who find a mysterious box during a family beach outing. Items in the box soon show themselves to have (and give) abilities to the youngsters, as their parents (Richardson and Hutton) gradually grow concerned. They are not alone in taking note of these changes. Noah's science teacher, (Wilson) along with his Tibetan Buddhist fiancée (Hahn) get involved, as well as government forces led by Nathaniel Broadman (Clarke). As you may have guessed, having this many characters any real character development and focusing on fewer characters with better dialog would have improved this film.If you took Phenomenon and crossed it with E.T., that would give you some idea what to expect here, but without a tighter script it is not worth renting unless one of your kids is holding the box and looking at you like the waterworks are about to start. This movie is so mediocre that I had to struggle to remember it long enough to write a review.(This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First , this is a very good movie. While enjoying with my family watching this great movie , my wife asked something that instantly caught my attention and pressed harder for an answer to the last minute of the film. It nearly ruined my night! When Emma came to her mother carrying Mimzy for the first time in her hands her mother didn't noticed that. My wife's eyebrows went up and asked :"Didn't she noticed her daughter's new toy?" Anybody that has raised children will agree simply that mothers almost always know their children's toys ; especially something like teddies or bunnies that they carry often. For this question I have not yet found an answer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Review: The Last Mimzy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a garden filled with a sea of color, a woman tells a story to attentive children. A story of importance for it saved humanity. It is the story of The Last Mimzy where two siblings, the elder, Noah (Chris O'Neil), a boy, and the younger, Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn), a girl, who found a strange box while vacationing over Easter weekend with their parents.In the box were strange objects and a stuffed rabbit named Mimzy. Being kids, Noah and Emma are fascinated with their newfound toys and without warning they developed amazing abilities playing with them. Their mom, Jo (Joely Richardson), felt distant as a result of it. Their dad, David (Timothy Hutton), think nothing of it, choosing to believe that his once ordinary kids are just growing up to their potential.Stranger things followed and they do not go unnoticed. Noah became incredibly intelligent in science while Emma developed psychic abilities. These abilities are out of this world, amazing yet terrifying. Noah's science teacher, Larry (Rainn Wilson) and his spiritual fiancée, Naomi (Kathryn Hahn) is the first to take an interest in the children. Larry noticed the strange drawings that Noah had drawn were those he kept seeing in his dreams. These drawings hold spiritual meanings to humanity's past and future. The toys even caused a massive state blackout that alerted the authorities.Just what are these toys about? What purpose do they serve? There are questions that needed answers. And they all point to one source, Mimzy the rabbit, that only Emma can relate.The Last Mimzy is a movie loosely adapted from the acclaimed science fiction short story, Mimsy Were the Borogoves, written in 1943 by Lewis Padgett (the pseudonym of husband and wife team Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore). I read the excerpt of the short story which can be found on the official website and it was brilliantly written, detailed and intriguing. The movie however fell rather short on these qualities despite the names behind the scene that were involved in films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Perhaps simplification was considered so kids can understand the film better. I really do not know but mostly the movie is unspectacular, preferring a more direct story telling approach. The trailer was well done however so it became contradicting.The stars of the movie no less were the siblings, Noah and Emma. After all, children are the key to the future. This focus is consistent throughout the film. Being a family film, the movie speaks to remind parents and adults to pay more careful attention to the children and their development. Negative exposures, which are becoming more and more apparent at this modern age, can affect the future. And the children are the future.On a less serious perspective, which everyone can relate, is imagination. In the movie we can see the difference between an adult and a child. The thinking process, the judgment, and the way the world is seen are in contrast. Children are the world's best teachers in imagination and creativity. Everyone can do with some imagination on a daily level to make life meaningful. Watching the children, their innocence, pure nature and energy, an adult may realized that what once were simple joy can no longer be found in themselves. We all seem to have forgotten what simple joy was when there used to be a child in all of us. Where is that child now? Lost?Mimzy is just a stuffed rabbit you say. That is because you probably haven't heard Emma. "This is Mimzy. She's my teacher. She teaches me everything." Emma will tell you with a sparkle in her eyes. That is why perhaps "The future is trying to tell us something".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Last Mimzy" is such a shameless and unabashed rip-off of "E.T.-The Extra Terrestrial" that Steven Spielberg ought to sue its makers for the blatant copyright infringement of his own material.Noah and Emma Wilder are two Seattle youngsters who discover a mysterious box floating in the ocean. Upon opening it, the children find it contains several abnormal objects including an odd stuffed-animal rabbit that calls itself Mimzy and speaks in a garbled, incomprehensible language to the little girl. In addition, the children themselves become endowed with strange preternatural knowledge and extrasensory powers as a result of their encounter with the material. The first part of the movie is dedicated to the kids' efforts to hide the secret from their parents, while the second involves the government scientist's typically clumsy efforts at studying the bizarre phenomenon.Virtually every major idea from "E.T." manages, at some point or other, to find its way into this film, starting with the basic alien-from-outer-space-being-hidden-by-adorable-children scenario, then heading on from there. The other similarities include the psychic connection between alien and child, the frightened, uncomprehending adults, the threatening government officials, the seemingly dying alien, and the kids' stealing of a vehicle in an effort to outrun the authorities. This is certainly not the first movie to try to siphon off some of "E.T."'s irreproducible charms for its own benefit ("Short Circuit," "The Iron Giant" and "The Indian in the Cupboard" come first to mind), but it is definitely the creepiest and most New Age-y of the lot. Then, after all is said and done, the screenplay gives us an anticlimactic epilogue so convoluted and muddled that Stephen Hawking himself would have trouble comprehending it.As Noah and Emma, Chris O'Neill and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn don't exactly set the screen on fire with their performances, but they are at least adequate to the task they are called on to fulfill - which is more than can be said for Timothy Hutton, Joely Richardson, Rainn Wilson and Michael Clark Duncan who are stranded in poorly written roles as the various adults on hand.Forget about phoning home; E.T. should be calling his lawyer.</fullReview>

The combination of different cultures all having a small role in a bigger picture was nothing new, but the way it was done was great I thought. The kids acting was pretty good, not as good as others have said, some of the acting, especially at the end, was not so believable. But overall the movie was great in my mind. Of course I knew nothing of the book and had not even seen a single review of the movie before I watched it, so that might have helped avoiding some of the other opinions. Then again I have never read Harry Potter and I love the movies, since I don't know what I am missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical hypnotic adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I went into this movie not knowing much about it.I only saw the trailer once or twice- the whole concept of the movie I found interesting. So, I went to see it. Story: The story is great, it's about two kids who find a box of toys from the future. One of these toys is a stuffed rabbit, Mimzy. Mimzy warns that the people of the future are sick. Our two main characters must find a way to help her. It's presented in very realistic way - even though the plot is very weird. It combines science, religion quite well, in a logic vs fantasy conflict... I think. I read that some complaint that the movie is dragged out... is not. The slow plot makes the atmosphere of the movie all more ominous and magical. It's 70% style and 30% substance.Visuals: Not much. But when it comes to the weird close ups and amazing CGI effects, it's quite a treat. Not Oscar worthy stuff, but it very cool. Audio: I loved the sound effects. Which made the movie stand out, the music was flat and un-original, but the weird and funky sound effects made up for it . Mimzy's cute rabbit talk voice rivals over the voice of Mogwai from GREMLINS. Creepy, but adorable at the same time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Film For Children! The Best Time Travel Movie Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If parents are looking for an excellent movie for their children to watch - then the Last Mimzy is a perfect choice. It portrays two children showing true courage to face the unknown! It proves filmmakers can make an interesting film with zero violence! And surprisingly, the youngest actress, who must be around six years old is, by far, the most talented in the entire movie! From an adult's point-of-view, this movie has numerous shortcomings: its slow start, the over-the-top product placement, and too many two-dimensional characters. But what saves this film is its very original premise: The time travel of a living machine, from the distant future, is necessary for the survival of the human race! Other pleasant surprises is music by Pink Floyd, the very clever mention of Lewis Carroll's Alice from "Alice in Wonderland," and the brilliant inclusion of Tibetan Buddhist Mandalas!If The Last Mimzy had a much bigger budget, this film could have been a masterpiece, like E.T.! This is a very, very clever story, which could have been a blockbuster with more special effects, better acting talent, and longer run time for a bit more character development! At one point, I was going to get up and leave the theater, but I'm glad I was patient. Once The Last Mimzy started to move along it turned out to be a delightful film, well worth my time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family movie hits home! (short &amp;sweet)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a wonder to watch, the acting was solid and not over done. The character development was a bit slow but accelerated as the drama began to increase. the plot developed the same way, slowly speeding up. The ending rushed through and missed some wonderful details that could have been fleshed out. The effects were crisp and well thought out, quite dazzling at times. The screenplay was well written with enough "meat" for all ages to get involved in. Good to see a movie that didn't assume that the average IQ of the audience must be in the sub 100's. The weakness was the weaving of the "homeland Security" plot throughout the middle to the end of the story. It was somewhat aimless and meandering and probably could have gone in a different direction. The way the Homland security officers just dismissed the whole thing in the end was not the least realistic.... In a fantasy drama like this one you are "set up" to accept a certain "reality" and if you go along with it, the reality needs to be cohesive throughout. The was possibly just a "hollywood" cop-out ending.Watching my 3 kids(5,7,9) watch the movie was wonderful. It opened up incredible creative discussions afterwords. This was so much fun, we laughed and cried most people gave a round of applause at the conclusion....... Heartwarming without being too Hollywood.Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Rabbit, Quantum Physics is For Kids?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon seeing The Last Mimzy, I can't help but describe it as E.T. with a stuffed rabbit, under the influence of John Titor (look him up!). When two siblings, Noah and Emma, find a bizarre chest near the family beach house they discover that it is filled with all sorts of quantum wonders, which seemingly increase the kids intelligence, give them bizarre metaphysical powers, and alienate them from their parents.This film is very interesting, but sort of misses its target audience. In a film that explores Tibetan ideology, quantum physics, and the space time continuum, it seems very strange to have the heroes as children. This angle does allow the fillmmakers to explore theories about how children often see things beyond adults because their brains work at a higher level, but they're also pitching this theory to children who don't have enough life experience to understand any of it, and adults who, well, are operating at a lower level of brain activity than the children.The name Mimzy comes from one of the toys, a stuffed rabbit, that Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) quickly becomes attached to, and believes is telling her things. Noah (Chris O'Neil), on the other hand, becomes intrigued by the box's "engine," and soon finds that he can hear spiders and teleport cans of soda.As all of these things begin happening, a larger puzzle looms and Noah's teacher (Rainn Wilson in a typical, but enjoyable role for him) starts to believe that Noah may be a special child as indicated in certain Tibetan beliefs. The children's parents, however, are not ready to buy into any hippie mumbo jumbo and are concerned for their children who only seem to interact with each other.Add Michael Clarke Duncan as an operative of Homeland Security and you have a presumed terrorism plot that puts the children and their toys at the center. But there's nothing terrorist about it. In fact, I wouldn't have minded the children having found Mimzy at the Circle K as all of their actions in the days that follow, will effect a doomed future.As someone who loved What The Bleep Do We Know?!?, devoured the books of Carlos Castaneda at the pace of a fat kid left alone in a pastry shop, and loved the darker fairy tale elements of Pan's Labyrinth, I really enjoyed this film. Somewhere it is missing something that would make it perfect and I really believe it's the mixing of a perfectly good quantum tale with children's' fare, but I really can't think of any other way to tell the story. It has a fairy tale element and even touches upon the magic of Alice in Wonderland, as our heroes themselves seem to be following Mimzy down the rabbit hole.Feel free to take the kids and enjoy a great family adventure, but be ready for the younger set to shift and squirm, possibly becoming bored ... if it's children over 12, though, this is going to be a fun discussion-filled car ride home!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes for passable family entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-AHOY: Possible spoilers ahead-! I saw this movie at an advanced screening, and came into it not expecting anymore than a typical kiddies-save-the-world-and-blah kind of movie. As the movie went on I was surprised at the thoughtfulness of its content and how the movie raised issues, albeit in a simple way, that reflect our society today: What are we, as scientists and humans, doing to ourselves? How do you trust, believe? Disappointingly, however, those issues were never truly explored, and the ending was weak. The plot, as well, seemed forced and disorganized.The part of this movie that saved me were the performances of the actors, who make do with a rather bland script and one-dimensional characters. The two children's interactions were spot on, and Naomi (Hahn) managed to interject moments of genuine humour. The look in Emma Wilder's eyes (Leigh Wryn) when she does her "magic tricks" is truly disturbing.The makers of the movie were afraid to really explore the issues they raised, and the prolonged excuse of an ending failed to resolve much. Instead, I am left with an unsatisfied feeling that this movie could have been so much more than an ordinary family movie. But hey, at least it makes for passable family entertainment if you don't try to understand it. Pass the popcorn, let's hope the munching will drown out the creepy gruntings of the last mimzy.</fullReview>

Noah begins to draw designs that turn out to be a map to the past and future. Due to a power outage caused by these toys gets the FBI involved, including an agent played by Michael Clarke Duncan. It turns out the rabbit is a time machine that must take human genes to the future to stop pollutants from killing their world. The family becomes involved in a mission to save the future.

		<fullReview>The fantasy world seems to have been reborn. There seems to be countless numbers of fantasy films, especially those involving children, coming to multiplexes all over the place. One of the latest is the cute, not so subtle left-wing entry called "The Last Mimzy".It is very hard to not catch the undertone of left-winged politics in this film. The negative connotations toward the Patriot Act, theme of environment, the loss of freedoms, etc. The film doesn't try to hide it's political message.Political message aside, this is a fun little film that has some really good performances by its young leads. The special effects are good enough to make the whole thing believable, though the ending does come off a bit contrived and too easy. None the less, this is an admirable attempt to continue the child fantasy genre and will probably gain a lot of new fans now that it is out on DVD.</fullReview>

What happened when we grow? Why can we only find that pure love and whole hearted passion for life only from a child? From a child's eye, it does not make sense to find it hard accepting new things (unlike the child's nanny or parents), but simply to recognize things as it is. Place no judgment on things but to enjoy them.Don't you agree? That when you polish your heart back to as a child, you too can start to fly and see only the beauty in the world?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked most of the movie a lot. Great concept, beautiful special effects, and appealing very well to children's imagination.There were a number of things that kept the movie from being perfect, though. There was a certain lack of substance, esp. with Michael Clarke Duncan's character, and several things that didn't make sense (like, why would the parents call the teacher rather than a doctor, and why did the scientists leave the alien artifacts unprotected in the lab at night, etc.).I was also rather disappointed by the ending. The element with her hand getting stuck was completely unnecessary and artificial, added on only to force some action and excitement into the climax of the movie. Also, there was no real explanation for why Alice couldn't have accomplished the same thing that Emma and Noah did. Emma did mention that "perhaps Alice needed a brother" in order to do it, but that's not a real explanation in itself. I'm not sure about the importance of the bridge; did it actually have to be built, or was it part of the future technology? Couldn't it just as easily have built itself? The explanation for why this project only succeeded at this point in time should have been much, much better.And the Intel logo? I think that takes the cake as most shameless product placement, like, EVER! The future society we saw didn't look at all like it was based on corporations and capitalism like ours is today.I also wanted to know if the kids' special powers were still there after the Mimzy left. I wanted to see some effect on the real world, rather than just the future.Still, it was a good and enjoyable movie with many great moments. It could have done a lot more with the concept of a new looking-glass having arrived, so it didn't live up to its potential, but maybe the short story is better. They usually are.But, a very nice movie.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For kids or adults? I don't think the film knows.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Rainn Wilson showing his nude rear-end (with CG underwear) and a Pink Floyd-esquire theme song, I'm not sure this film is aimed entirely at children. In addition, after I experienced some amazing child acting in "Bridge to Terebithia," these kids' acting ability is far far below that. I try not to be critical about young actors, but see "Bridge" and you'll be astounded by their ability to emote and portray real people. The two leads in "Mimzy" were passable to just plain awful at times. Mildly entertaining with terrific visual effects by The Orphanage. I felt it was a bit long and a few story arcs unanswered. Just why did Rainn Wilson's character dream about these mandala shapes in Tibet? His visions and his character had nothing to do with the main plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so before I went to go see The Last Mimzy tonight, I looked up some critiques and criticism of the film. It was either a love it or hate it type. I can't remember what it's rated...either PG or PG-13; it contains one scene where an adult could tell sex was about to follow (big deal but some parents may not want to expose this to their children). I loved the film, personally. You can't really criticize a seven year old's acting skills. There was one scene where Noah goes back and forth like four times to get things Emma needs from his backpack which was poorly written. Also, the suspense was basically not suspense at all but frustration with Noah's science teacher for hesitating on nearly everything during the end of the movie. I recommend this film for children/teens aged 10-18 mostly because the plot or situation would be a bit confusing for anyone younger than that. If you were confused, here's a summary of the situation: A scientist in the future is searching for something that people who exist in the past possess. Since a human would die traveling in the past, dolls, called Mimzys, are sent in their place. The point of a Mimzy is to gather the item that the scientist is looking for in order to save the people of the future; however, no past Mimzys have been successful. This item is Emma's tear, or a pure tear. (When the body cries or sweats, toxins are excreted into the solution; Emma's tear was pure, symbolizing her own purity). The people in the future cannot cry (I don't think, this wasn't really explained) and thus their toxins remained within their body, killing them. The scientist needed Emma's tear to find a cure and thus save the future. Yay. I recommend telling a small child about tears first before seeing the movie so they'd understand it better. Hope I helped. .</fullReview>

I can't define what kind of move it is but it was outstanding. It's great for a family. I hope there is some sort of sequel. Thank God that some good movies sneak out of Hollywood ever once in a while. I am so tired of the crappy horror, special effect, no plot, action movies the they seem to keep turning out. Hollywood listen up give us more movies like this. Even though this was a fairly long movie I wish it had been longer. Oh the cast was amazing. I only knew T. Hutton and the lady form (Crossing Jordon) before this. They all did a great job and the plot was cool. Please give us some more nice movies like this.

		<fullReview>Wow..what to say. Well, the short version of my thoughts after seeing this movie are "bad acting, bad story, bad continuity, horrible conclusion"... The children were flat and basically unbelievable. The adults were manic or just plain weird. The list of "why they heck did they do that?" and "why did they think that was a good idea" and "good lord is THAT ridiculous" is just too long to type. That being said, my 10 year old liked it. He doesn't care about the finer points of film making or acting. Plot holes you can drive a delivery truck through don't phase him a bit. Overall, this film gets a giant 'MEH'. Not interesting or entertaining in the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mimsy Were the Borogroves", Kuttner &amp; Moore's terrifying parable about the loss of innocence and the ending of childhood, is chopped up, its dark meat bleached until, like a chicken leg, it is converted into a breaded chicken nugget, suitable for a children's audience which holds that the only thing wrong with the world is that kids aren't in charge. Stir in Nepalese mysticism and CGI to taste and garnish with a paranoid government that locks up four-year-olds under the Patriot Act and you have this mandala-shaped piece of mystery meat.Director Robert Shaye does show a dab hand at directing children, and I suppose I shouldn't have expected more than this, but I am terribly disappointed.

My wife and I loved it! Everyone around us loved it too. There was one very young kid behind us that was confused by a time travel element, because he was too young to fathom the concept. Other than that, he liked it too based on little comments that he made during the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great story that could've been done 100 times better. I think they tried to cater to kids so much so, that it actually became borderline patronizing to kids and flat out alienated adults. As far as the acting goes, it was average at best...not bad enough to ruin the movie completely, but bad enough to detract from it.Overall, I would still recommend this movie, especially for families with kids of all ages, as I think it would be entertaining for kids of any age (even 30 year old kids like me!). There are definitely holes in the plot, the acting is average at the very best, but I'm still glad I watched it. One thing I couldn't help think is this; It's too bad someone like Spielberg didn't get his paws on this one! Could've been the next Goonies. With better writing and directing, this could have been a classic. I'm generally not a fan of remakes, but this one should be remade!</fullReview>

Some fairly advanced teachers that definitely doesn't talk down to the children and a prototypical white upper middle class family complete with overworked dad, stay at home mom and happiness seemingly a given. The kids 11+6 I would guess, find a strange artifact on the beach and start developing skills and a sense of the world around them not usually found in kids these days :-) From there we get a look into Buddhism, nanotechnology, wormholes, a little environment lesson and other stuff not found in many family movies that are usually so stupid it would make you barf... If you can look past product placements that are rampant throughout, then this is one of the better family movies almost on par with E.T.</fullReview>

Charming premise, although I'd just as soon kids weren't just flying around so freely in the future world! It's nice to see Timothy Hutton as the loving, yet distracted, father figure and when the story actually causes him to pay a little more attention, he's very effective. The two kids "introduced" in this film are just terrific. (Worry not about the geographic details of getting around the Seattle area -- all pictures based on a locale take liberties with the map for photogenic reasons. Remember "The Sandpiper"? Or "A Summer Place"? Both completely turned the Monterey Peninsula upside-down and backwards!) The DVD is well put-together with lots of extra features for those who crave 'em!</fullReview>

This movie doesn't tug at your heartstrings as does E.T., but the plot is more interesting. It's also nice to see good special effects that don't involve hordes of killer robots or bloodthirsty creatures. There are some funny moments, such as when the amazing bunny is found to have INTEL etched inside on one of its nano-sized microchips (for those who don't know, IBM once arranged individual electrons on a plate that, when viewed through an electron microscope, spelled out IBM). The "mimsy" in the title refers to a word in a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll, "all mimsy were the borogroves, and the mome rath outgrabe." Makes perfect sense to me.

		<shortDescription>Clever but slightly flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's strong points were the creative science fiction short story it's adapted from, and an enthusiastic cast that had some fun with their roles. The film also had weaknesses; awkward transitions between scenes, as well as some unrealistic characters. Because the premise of this story is a collision between reality and apparent fantasy, these two weaknesses hurt the story a little.This adaptation of the story strays from the original theme slightly, but is still reasonably faithful to the original intent of the story to work. Two children find a mysterious object washed up on a beach, and as they examine it, it turns out to have strange and wonderful properties, only fathomed by the children who suddenly exhibit amplified perception skills and genius intelligence. The mystery of who left the device, and why becomes the focus of the plot. The special effects involving the strange object and what it does are usually pretty good.The children's characters are written realistically enough (given the premise of the movie), but some other characters are not. The government loonies and the way they change in the story is too strange to accept, the science teacher and wife are too off-the-wall, and become cartoonish buffoons. The parents are over-emotional and at times just weird. The baby-sitter was a plus, with a fun comic relief role.Overall, the movie seemed at first a little too cerebral for kids, but the ones in the theater audience were quiet and seemed to be engaged in the story, so apparently they understood it, after all. Decent movie for a family viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good family movie for kids and adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my 10 year old and 12 year old to The Last Mimzy on opening night, 3/23. The audience was a mix of families with kids and adults, which surprised me at first but after I saw the movie, it makes sense. This is a movie for the whole family and there's something for everyone.Kids will like it because the two main characters, 5-year old Emma and older brother Noah Wilder are the heroes in the movie who succeed despite the befuddled adults trying to "help." Adults will like it because the interaction between the kids and family members will ring true, the special effects are well done, and some of the dialog and plot twists are clearly aimed at adults. (In fact, there were some scenes that one review said were over kids' heads -- and while it was obvious what scenes it was talking about, my kids didn't seem to mind.) Young Rhiannon Leigh Wryn steals the show as Emma. Fans of TV's The Office will love Rainn "Dwight Schrute" Wilson as Noah's science teacher.Is it a great film? No. Timothy Hutton, who played the father, seemed rather flat. Michael Clarke Duncan's character, the local Homeland Security chief, wasn't dastardly as I think he was trying to be. I can't tell if he was trying to be funny or nasty because he tried to be both at different times.Last and perhaps least, the film is supposedly set in Seattle but reportedly was filmed in Vancouver. Yet the film bangs you over the head with contrived and sometimes fake Seattle references (for example "Seattle Elementary School" - as if there's only one?), one of which they mangled (the "Music Experience" instead of the "Experience Music Project"). I'm not sure if anyone who isn't familiar with the area would even notice though.All in all, however, my kids and I enjoyed the film, the ending was poignant and thought-provoking, and it was a great way to spend a Friday evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the short story that this movie is based on, and although quite different, gave me some appreciation for what the movie would be.Essentially, far into the future our human race is in trouble. Pollution and other factors have altered DNA to the point that special precautions must be taken for our future species to survive.Time travel has been achieved, but real humans cannot survive it. Therefore highly advanced nano circuitry has enabled them to build a series of dolls that look like bunny rabbits, called Mimzy, and have an advanced artificial intelligence. They are able to survive time travel. During a holiday to their beach home on Whidbey Island, a brother and sister find an unusual "machine" in the water, and it contains a number of strange things, plus the last Mimzy.Chris O'Neil is the boy, Noah Wilder, and cute little Rhiannon Leigh Wryn is 6 year old Emma Wilder. Brit Joely Richardson is their mother and Timothy Hutton is their father.The story line is hard to describe, but it involves the children being greatly affected by the contents of the machine, and one outfall is greater intellect. A good movie, entertaining and thought-provoking.SPOILERS. To allow our future human race to survive well, some unaltered DNA must be transported back via a wormhole type of time travel back to where the last Mimzy came from. Little Emma had become attached to the Mimzy, and as they were getting ready to send it back, Emma shed a tear onto the bunny's face. This tear had enough DNA that it was to form the basis for the future humans. In a final scene set way into the future, little Emma was referred to as the mother of all of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Last Mimzy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by the current CEO of New Line Cinema, The Last Mimzy is a children's fantasy movie which goes along the grains of having its children protagonists developing special powers, communicating with one another and with an alien object that no adult (or anyone else for that matter) can, and to help save some futuristic civilization. Sounds like a typical walk in the park for any children's movie you might add.The Wilder siblings Noah (Chris O'Neil) and Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) find a mysterious box with strange markings, containing some weird toys, amongst which includes a harmless looking soft toy bunny christened Mimzy. Soon enough Noah starts developing intellectual prowess bordering on genius and like Peter Parker would do without eyeglasses, while Emma, with Mimzy clutched closely to chest, starts to exhibit powers that a psychic would, in addition to being able to play five stones that float and with a light show included.As parents and adults (Noah's schoolteacher and his wife), they have a natural tendency for disbelief and to second guess the children, as all adults would in a made for children's movie. And the authorities are hunting for them, just as they would, as targets of a resulting city wide blackout.If anything, the chemistry between the child actors playing the siblings is believable enough, and you would agree with me that Rhiannon Leigh Wryn is adorable as the kid sister whose innocence and love play a crucial role in the movie's plot. There are a few moments with injected humour, which I thought Asian audiences would identify with immediately with Kathryn Hahn's role as a "numbers" obsessed lady, and for technical geeks, watch out for that logo (I've actually had a friend who was expecting it to pop out, and to our surprise, it did!)Expect the rudimentary plot development, characters as well as special effects that are just functional rather than to wow. It should serve as pretty interesting for a kid, but for an adult, we would have already seen other more superior stories, beginning with Spielberg's ET.</fullReview>

Considering what a ham he is on The Office, it was nice to see him playing something so different so well.What I appreciated most of all was what it says about technology. The way it portrays our society is just a little embarrassing, since almost every character in this film is absolutely chained to their iPods or cell phones. But what's nice is that the film doesn't shove this into your face, it just leaves this element out there to be noticed, especially by older audiences.Overall, it was a great movie, and I think people of any age can relate to it.

The screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin, Toby Emmerich, James V. Hart &amp; Carol Skilken attempts to spin the yarn into a 21st century "E.T." but only manages to leave many large plot holes and some convoluted histrionics in the process.

		<fullReview>In the tradition of E.T., D.A.R.Y.L., and War Games, The Mimzy plays on our childhood fantasies and emotions, tugging at connections, innocence, and attachments. The political overtones are there, but the main focus is the storyline of fascination and discovery. This childhood sci fi version is a little more dark along with its humor. There are a few weak plot sequences that are softened by an attempt at continuity as well as a not great but adequate ending that soft lands or not in a nice way. This is an enjoyable romp with no dramatic, tension filled exhaustive play out on the typical chase scenario. The mother in this movie is strong in her delivery of this type. The cinematography, however, is a bit weak considering the past classics this movie was competing with though the special effects were fascinating and different. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Inspirational, and thought-provoking....even for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this on a sneak preview today by way of first knowing about it through the Sunday paper and was pleasantly surprised after seeing it.The story is inspirational in tone, bringing together a common worldly enemy that must be defeated by future scientists using something from present-day children. It kept my interest, and wasn't predictable, but was a bit slow to start. The dialog was concise, but a little flat between the parents and children and even between the children; it could have been on purpose to reflect the short-story element.The movie focuses on the children, rightfully so, but it seemed the parents were written in just to say 'oh-yeah, the characters are children and have to have parents.' The father didn't know how to be a father and I swear the mother was bi-polar; the parent actors just didn't seem interested in creating the look of a family - or the actors just needed the cash (Timothy Hutton, why are you in here?). The interactions of the characters in the family may have come off more realistic if there was a step-parent, then it could explain the distance between them and the children. Overall, the characters were fleshed out enough for this type of movie - how much of a backstory could there be with kids or accessory characters?While it wasn't tough putting together some of the story elements, I think it would test the limits of my 9 year-old trying to grasp the sci-fi elements displayed and/or explained. It does provide thought-provoking questions and discussions that any parent who actually converses with their child would be proud to discuss. The time-travel, psycho-kinesis, and DNA/genes might just be the spark a child needs to learn more about science.The graphics were very-good for a family film. I don't expect Lucasfilm quality, but this film's graphics were better than Zathura's and will keep kids attention.Some of the scenes played out as vignettes - bad editing? Other reviewers have stated that it's lefty-propaganda, but in sci-fi/fantasy the enemy could be just about anything. Thus, the reviewers were predisposed to dislike themes based on the false idea that combating environmental issues to help us live is only a "lefty" idea. Actually, what is interesting is that does have a religious undertone in the that bunny could be Christ-figure telling us we've made a mess of the planet his father gave us.I think it's a very-good real-life action film for kids (8 and above, maybe?), as opposed to the plethora of cartoon films that are easily passed off as quality entertainment. This movie could have played as an independent film at film festivals as it is not cookie-cutter pandering to our lowest intellectual standard. It's a fairly original imagining of the short-story from which it was based (the book parents were better!). You are not required to think while watching the movie as it is enjoyable with all the child-like discovery going on, but it does spark thoughtfulness and creativity. For those less inclined to have a movie make you or your child think you can have your kids learn to draw Nemo for the thousandth time just so you're not bothered by having a conversation about some of the issues this movie has in it.I rated the movie as an 8 since the overall themes, story, action, and plot overruled the lacking parents. Smart and enjoyable for kids, good eye-candy and sci-fi-ish inspirational for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last Mimzy was spectacular!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was inspiring. It shows that with a little faith,hope,and some imagination things can work out. The movie was good. The acting of some of the people in the movie was not excellent, but it was still good. Although the children who star in the movie were pretty good actors. The actors who played Emma and Noah were excellent!! They really seemed to be authentic kids, and they had chemistry like a real brother and sister! I think that this movie is a good choice for anyone from age three to Adults. Well, The Last Mimzy made me feel happy. The children worked together to overcome obstacles in order to accomplish their goal and to help Mimzy. If there is one thing I can guarantee you if you are planning to watch this movie is that your kids will love it,and you will find that you too are going to love it. So what are you waiting for? Go to the movies and enjoy it with your family!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sucked. People are treating this movie like The English Patient. They say 10 stars, but this movie was the complete opposite. The plot was pointless, and was as bad as Yu-Gi-Oh: The Movie. It's just a thing washes up on shore with a satanic bunny rabbit that does weird things that are just stupid. It has no meaning, then something has to do with Buddhism, and that's when everything goes downhill like a plane falling from 30,000ft. The power in Seattle goes out, and no one takes it seriously. The FBI guys take their family, and the little girl doesn't have the Mimzy with her. The FBI leader comes and says, "You're under arrest for a nation security emergency." The little girl goes "Can I get something?" Then with major stupidity he says, "Sure, go." And she runs into the room, and back out with the Mimzy. Did it ever occur to him that she could be raised as a terrorist? I mean seriously, horrible movie. There were scenes where the most impossible things were happening, and the kids kept a straight face like ABSOLUTELY NOTHING was happening. I'm surprised people said this movie was good. The first question I asked was, "Whats' up with the title?" The second was, "What the heck was that?!" This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen, and cheesiness out of Pokemon. The place where they take their family is a secure government facility for possible terrorists. Then, there is only one door locked out of the whole building, and one security camera in the hall. The Mimzy opens the door and turns off the security camera and unlocks the door. Hooray for plot convenience! Then find a truck and Mimzy hot-wire's it. They drive at like 3 AM on public roads without seat belts. Then send the Mimzy to the future with almost the little girl getting her right hand chopped off all because she likes satanic bunny rabbits. In the end you see children randomly flying away like they're about to get sucked into space. This was simply a movie to laugh at and the worst of 2007. Don't see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely watchable piece of whimsy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last Mimzy is one of the most contrived movies i have ever seen, notwithstanding it being in the fantasy genre. And for a person who loves entertainment that is wholesome and positive in its outlook, this one made me nauseous. The acting is generally awful, except for Chris O'Neil (as Noah Wilder) who comes off best; he reminds me of the young Henry Thomas in E.T. The teacher and his companion played by Rainn Wilson and Kathryn Hahn make quite a funny pair as well, but that's about it. However, being a fan of both Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson, i was disappointed with their roles. I felt embarrassed for Timothy Hutton, a superb actor looking tired in a pitiful part. And i didn't even recognize Joely, despite the fact that i have met her in real life. I was hoping that The Last Mimzy would be something quirky like Zathura, but no such luck. By the end, i was just thinking: "Give me a break!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a perfect example of taking a potentially great 100 minute movie, editing it down to 94 minutes and its still 35 minutes too long. I was anxious to be wowed, by a heart warming story of two kids who get amazing powers. I packed up the kids (13 and 11) and a reluctant wife. We got to the theater 30 minutes early and still had to ask people to move in order to put the four of us together. It appeared everyone there fell for the same hype I did.The movie centers around two kids from a normally dysfunctional family who discover a strange and wonderful item on the beach of their vacation home during Easter break. The magical items contained with-in, transform the children into something truly wonderful, setting them on a mission to save humanity. The magic however doesn't happen nearly as often as it should or could. And when it does, it is interrupted with long, redundant and monotonous adult dialog.Films, like all art forms are suppose to elicit emotion. The most empathy I had for any characters was the mother, finely crafted by Joely Richardson. Her character was as real as it gets. In one scene where she just can't deal with the events, she ceremoniously collects the items. Items we didn't know she knew existed and in typical mother fashion throws them in the trash. Every mother has this 'Out of sight out of mind' blinder. If they throw it away, all the problems will go away with it.Timothy Hutton, who is capable of so much depth seamed to phone his performance in. The two kids were charming enough but they lacked direction needed to make them endearing. Michael Clarke Duncan has too much compassion in his voice to be the hard ass G-man making his role a little, no , a lot on the ambiguous side.The film touted as the E.T. for the new millennium falls way short of what I believe its target market to be. Most of those under 14 we're bored and restless. Those over 14 spent more time texting on their cell phones than watching the film. And those over thirty like my wife were thrilled to get some nap time; Forty minutes worth.When you look at the last five years of the writers and director, it's not too hard to find the thought process or lack there of, behind this disappointing film. I would speculate director Robert Shaye has spent too much of his recent career in dark, and scary subjects. And both of the writers have been producing the same type of dark subject matter. It's almost like they were sitting around talking about this idea and they said this material is way to good share. Let's just do it ourselves.The film does spark dialog about the 'what ifs' and the theme is, at least for me, believable, But the film is only worth a $4 on demand status. Not the $30 plus price tag for a family of four.Four stars??? Bart Loiacono the NiteLife Group of Publications</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a perfect story that has been destroyed by the movie makers. I stated reading the work of this obscure but world class writer when I was very young. When I saw that some one was making a movie out of one of his stories I danced for joy. To think that people would get to know who this man was filled me with hope. Then I saw the reality that is Hollywood. I can not give you an unbias review of this movie. It made me sick. All hope that people would start reading his stories flew out the door. Do yourself a favor. Forget this movie and go find his books. The copy I have was printed in 1975 by Ballantine Books. "The Best of Henry Kuttner" The introduction is by Ray Bradbury and is titled "Henry Kuttner: A Neglected Master". I could not agree more with the title. I have read this book at least 20 times if not more. It is a perfect book. Gary</fullReview>

		<fullReview>However, I don't think it intended to be a comedy. I saw this film on a plane, and I was getting stares because juice was coming out of my nose while laughing. Ahh good times.This film is just crap. The story is TErRIBLE- some alien future scientist's last hope for the universe. It's liked they lined up every cliché POSSIBLE and strung them as scenes one after the other. The parents are just dumb, and seem to be blind in many scenes. YOu have this duo of morons (not the kids) who believe in aliens, and conveniently they know the protagonists... It's all just poo.There were literally only two good things about this films: 1) The special effects were fantastic.2) The 2 child leads were convincing actors, and were pretty much let down by the adults in the film.Some people have compared this to E.T...NO NOO don't do that. Children might find this film okay, sure, but honestly there are a THOUSAND other better family movies. Rent the Lion King or Toy Story which are simply a thousand times better than this.(I mean for God's sake the little alien thing is called a Mimzy....wtf!!

		<shortDescription>Cute, uplifting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie, and thought it was a rather uplifting story, at that. The plot had numerous holes and inconsistencies, but that is easily overlooked, given the subject matter. After all, if you are swallowing the whole bit about a doll being sent back from the future to save the future of mankind, the fact that the FBI would not, could not just walk away from a humongous Homeland Security event/situation with just an apology and a shake of the head hardly seems worth mentioning. Some things just need to be overlooked or ignored in the interest of furthering the story and the enjoyment of the overall general feeling generated by the story. The story contained many good points about being environmentally conscious without being preachy or annoying about it, which I appreciated, and it had many humorous moments as well. I found the school teacher's constant attempts to bring some semblance of sanity to a patently insane situation very amusing. Overall, a cute, enjoyable watch with no lasting effects other than that of having been pleasantly entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice...but not a home run.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I like the message of "The Last Mimzy." I like the gentleness and purity of the basic story. So I really wish I could say this was as good as "ET" or "The Wizard Of Oz" or any other great movie that appealed to both kids and adults...but nothing about it really fits.The story has promise -- Toys from the future are sent back to the past. They're found by a couple of very average kids living in Seattle, who use them to see the universe in new ways as they help the toys achieve their goal of finding some way of saving the future from the ruination of the past. There are moments of pure magic -- like when Noah, the ten-year-old boy, learns sounds can affect how a spider builds its webs, and when Emma, his five-year-old sister, sets the "spinners" going the first time.But nothing about this movie quite works. Not completely. Oh, the kids -- Chris O'Neal and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn -- do a good enough job of acting, especially considering how young they are and it's the first time they've been in front of a film camera. Rhiannon is startling natural in many ways, and Chris closely matches her. And Timothy Hutton, Joely Richardson and Michael Clarke Ward do well enough with poorly written roles. And therein lies much of the problem -- the script and choice of director.Bob Shaye has produced dozens of movies, so he probably thought he'd learned something about pacing and the shaping of an exciting story that is true to its universe. Instead, he comes across as a beginner. He's so focused on keeping the action going, he forgets to let the story breathe and grow. Maybe that was the way the script was written, but I doubt it. It seems like entire scenes have been cut because they didn't "move things along" in the way some action-adventure genre film might need. I especially miss the development of Noah going from a "C-" drub to a genius science engineer. All we're given is him looking at that spider, doing something on a computer and then BANG -- he's got a science project about bridges across the universe. It's like Shaye didn't know how to dramatize it, so just didn't. And many of the scenes' pacing is off -- like with the kids in the school. Boys tend to jump over each other, verbally, when they're talking; they don't talk, wait for you to talk, then talk. And the kids in this script don't use the same vocabulary as regular kids. Even the scene where the Feds break in -- usually a slam-dunk -- is done so amateurishly, it's disconcerting.Of course, the dialog IS what came out of the script, and much of it's lame. Simplistic. Unreal. The scene where Rainn Wilson and his fiancée meet with Joely to discuss Noah is brutal evidence of this. Nothing about it comes across as real or human...and that's the scriptwriting, not the acting or directing.The special effects are nice if a bit cheap. I love the look of Seattle and its environs as a way of showing what we're about to lose if we don't wise up. There are a couple of nightmarish moments that may scare kids under eight, but they work within the context of the story.Y'know...if they'd just had someone who knows kids' stories do a pass on the script and let someone else direct this movie, it would've been hit out of the park. Instead, I'm willing to give it a double for effort and intent. But man...why couldn't it have been a home run?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly game, if excessively "spiritual", attempt at filming the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What it's like: If you took the story ("Mimsy Were the Borogoves" by "Lewis Padgett"--Henry Kuttner and Catherine L. Moore), and gave it to latter-day hippies (such as script-repurposer Bruce Joel Rubin) to make as one of the sharper episodes of the revived THE OUTER LIMITS (it's slightly wittier and better-done than the "Sandkings" pilot). Less rancid and dumb than the typical Spielberg-gang outing, slightly less sanitized (for your protection) than the common Disney production (even if Michael Clarke Duncan's role is straight out of LILO AND STITCH), this film will annoy Kuttner/Moore purists.What's good about it: the actors are pretty deft, for the most part, including the kid sibs. Kathryn Hahn (of CROSSING JORDAN) and Rainn Wilson (of THE OFFICE and SIX FEET UNDER) are just about the go-to couple for the kind of reasonably latter-day hippies they portray here, and Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson do well by their increasingly-freaked parent roles. Nice early touch on how the first toy appears differently to our kid protags and to their mother. Some visuals not too shabby, if unspectacular.What's not so good: the product-placement goes from blatant to, at a key point, annoyingly unbelievable; the framing device, particularly at the end. The changed nature and reason for the transport of the toy package.What it would be paired with at the Kailua Drive-In or Holiday Theaters for double-features corresponding to those of my youth: DEJA VU or other more innocuous skiffy; probably not with 300.Another reason it's clearly not directed by Joe Dante: No one's watching THE TWONKY at any point.</fullReview>

The story continues with the children gaining special abilities from the objects inside the box. As things progress (slowly), the audience isn't really let in on any more than what was already established. The US government gets involved and yadayadayada. It focuses too much on new age beliefs and philosophy as though no other culture has contributed to the progress of mankind and civilization.

		<fullReview>The movie diverges sharply from the short story by Henry Kuttner, and falls prey to every single ET-based cliché, complete with floating objects and overzealous FBI agents, ancient Tibetan prophecies, etc. The original story was more akin to "Childhood's End", whereas the writers decided that every movie must have good guys and bad guys, and a crisis and a phony car chase. This results in a story that feels forced and fake, without any flow or sense. At many times I felt that items were "pasted on" in failed attempts to create humor or tension, but they were silly.Give this one a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love science-fiction, and will watch almost anything in the genre (although so far have resisted seeing Battlefield Earth). I watched Attack of the Killer Tomatoes with enjoyment. Last Mimzy was supposed to be another E.T. However, although E.T. was not Shakespeare (remember "penis-breath"?), at least it had Spielberg. Mimzy's director made William Shatner the director look like Alfred Hitchcock. Mimzy was humorless. E.T. had product-placement with Reese's pieces. Mimzy bludgeons with ersatz Tibetan Buddhism, crystal worship, palmistry, animal rights, and Silent Spring anti-pollution preaching. Alice didn't really go through the looking-glass, she had an abortive encounter with a vortex time-cloud hatched above some crystals from the future, presided over by a robot stuffed rabbit who is trying to get back to the future. Emma, the 21-st century Alice, is a "pure soul" who can help the future, perhaps because she recoils after learning the hamburger she eats was once a cow. At the end, the Gestapo FBI/Homeland Security forces, who track down Emma and her brother because they caused a multi-state power failure, instantly break off their pursuit and suddenly leave, immediately after witnessing Mimzy the robot rabbit disappear into the sky (a la E.T.?). I've never seen such a wooden scene in a movie. (Even Killer Tomatoes had a better ending!) Speaking of ending, the dad in the movie gets to moon the audience while walking around the house wearing only his pajama top (Mom stays fully clothed) and trying to get Mom to break her diet.

		<shortDescription>A film about a stuffed rabbit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep, that's about it. At least that's what I remember. There was a plush toy bunny sent to the past to save the future from the present.The toy was sent by a John Hurt/Peter O'Toole-looking mad scientist and ends up on a Washington State beach and discovered by two moppets, (the Harry Potterish Noah Wilder, Chris O'Neil) and his cute-as-a-button little sister, Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn, "The Hulk").The toy comes in a special box with some rocks, a green globule and a glowing rectangle that turns into stone when their mother, Joely Richardson (TV series "Nip &amp; Tuck") touches it.The special prism divides the earth into compartments that no one on screen (or in the audience) seems to understand the meaning of.These trinkets also make Noah, a dim bulb at school, turn into a nationwide science fair champion (since he can communicate with spiders and make then spin webs of his choosing). He also has become quite an artist, creating drawings of 12th century Tibetan tapestries and other obscure works of art.Meanwhile, Emma has become creepily attached to the rabbit, which is an exact duplicate of one Lewis Carrol gave to his young model for "Alice in Wonderland." Evidently, she "learns" from it and soon begins to advocate for its particular mission. She is also designated as a "very special child" by the flaky fiancée, (Kathryn Hahn, TV series "Crossing Jordan"), of Noah's new age science teacher, Larry White (Rain Wilson, TV series "Six Feet Under," "The Office").Later, while fooling around with the globule, Noah causes an electrical surge that blacks out Seattle, raising the ire of Homeland honcho, Nathaniel Broadman (Michael Clark Duncan, "The Green Mile," "Daredevil").After arresting the family, which includes befuddled dad, David Wilder (Oscar winner Timothy Hutton, "Ordinary People," bad hair and all), the kids promptly escape and attempt to send the rabbit back to the future with some current genes attached to it.Overall, this is not a bad film, just a little convoluted, and one which takes almost its entire running time to figure out. The unfortunate thing for "Mimzy" is that it opens with "TMNT" and "The Shooter," which means certain defeat at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like a little fantasy, but this plot sought to give validity to some lame old Hollywood spiritual fetishes, and their inclusion wounds the story line. So it ended up being shallow and silly.The kids are cute, the directing and acting engaging, and special effects kind of fun. But the plot premise and cult supports made it offensive and ineffective. It would have been better if the creators had made up a whole new set of fantastic causes and endings. And the story would have had a timelessness quality about it that makes for classics. This ended up being another environmental/social/air-headed anything goes plot based on current (and passing) passions typical of the times.They also stuck in 'live-togethers' in the role of a teacher that encourages life styles that never work, as if that aberration of society can be profitable. Live together people are a shame to us all and no one anywhere near them is proud of them. But here, as usual, it is laid before our children as normal and beneficial. But then, Hollywood doesn't live in the real world, has serious trouble with right and wrong, and cares not a whit about our children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I ventured to the theatre for the advance screening of The Last Mimzy, I honestly didn't know what to expect. What little I knew about the film was that its genre was part family film, part adventure and part drama. It was only a few weeks ago that Bridge to Terabithia left a bad taste in my mouth, so my walk to my favorite aisle seat was more of a saunter than a skip and a hop.The opening credits gave me a glimmer of hope. Timothy Hutton, Joely Richardson and Michael Clarke Duncan were names that appeared in big bold letters and each one of these actors I respected for their previous works on the screen. So I sat back in hopes that it was more Narnia than Terabithia. Wishful thinking.The Last Mimzy is about two children who find a box that has been sent back in time to save civilization. The children Noah and Emma Wilder (played not too convincingly by Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) open the box which contains some magical rocks, a seashell that allows them to hear things humans can't, a contraption that looks like a dead sea urchin and a stuffed doll rabbit that is the weirdest artificial intelligence to grace the screen since that stupid bear gave me nightmares in Spielberg's A.I.When the children start to experiment and play with their new found toys magical things start to happen. They can levitate, they can atomize their hands, they can borderline fly. Oh, and they can sap the power out of half of Seattle which leads to the F.B.I. (headed by an uncomfortable looking Duncan) to investigate and eventually detain the Wilder family.The story as I think to understand it, is that a scientist in the future sends back multiple rabbits in an attempt to gather some pure DNA to ensure their own being. (Spoiler: Why the scientist was shot in one potential futures by an alien is still puzzling). See, humans can't go back in time, so this freaky toy has to go back and save the world. Interesting? Possibly. Original? Hardly.So while the future awaits word on Mimzy's success or failure (that is that rabbits name for anyone that cares), the children run amok by communicating with arachnids, jumping on the beach like an extra from Pixar's The Incredibles and talking to the stuffed animal that represents futures only hope.The Last Mimzy is like crossing the worst of John Hughes and crossing it with a below average Spielberg. The film has no heart, no character and the scenes seemed to be cut together randomly with very little flow between reels.All the actors look like they are trying to squeeze some movie magic out of the very skimpy, unoriginal script based on the short story by Lewis Padgett. But director Bob Shaye, who has not been behind the camera since 1990's Book of Love, weaves an incoherent and completely unbelievable plot that goes nowhere fast and results in a dead end once we get there. The final scene which has the F.B.I. leaving the Wilder family was maybe the worst written scene I have bore witness to this year. And I have seen more poop than a dog walker.The Last Mimzy might be for the kiddies. They might get something out of it. I didn't. The redhead beside me that engaged me in conversation about the film at its conclusion didn't. And judging by the few that left the theatre during the screening and didn't come back ? I am guessing that they didn't either.www.robertsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a lot of people will say "this is just a kid's movie", and "it has a good message", etc, but this movie was terrible.First, the parents are completely unbelievable. Are they oblivious or what? OK, the rocks and stuff could be "toys" found on the beach; but the girl walks around with a new stuffed rabbit, and no one wonders where she got it? The father said he was going to talk to the babysitter about what happened. If he did, didn't she tell him what happened? Or did he not follow up, and just forget about the whole thing.Second, major plot holes: how did they get to the island after the escape. They had to take the ferry, no? Why didn't the authorities stop, or at least alert the ferry operators (assuming it was even running at that time of night). The kids had powers, but didn't seem to use them. If you had super powers, would you show them off? Third, the movie could not decide what it wanted to be, and it stole from a lot of better movies. Obviously "ET", and "Close Encounters" come to mind, but you could spend the entire movie going, "I remember that scene from (insert sci-fi fave here)" Anyway, I am sure that this will be a big hit, but just be warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually rate movies 1 out of 10, but this movie falls in that category. Everything about this movie is bad, from the horrible acting performances of the two lead kids to the plot that can't hold itself up. Not only was it not well made, it was not interesting whatsoever. I was trying to fall asleep but I couldn't. Not only that, though. Everyone I saw the movie didn't like it. If a group of six different people all agree that a movie is bad, they're probably right. The movie had no appeal at all to the six completely different personalities. Also to be noted is the shabby direction. Part of directing is not just planning how each scene is shot, but it's directing the actors involved in the film. It takes a good director to direct a child actor and turn it into a good performance, and the director of this movie didn't even come close. The two lead kids literally just said their lines and went through motions, without feeling. Please, do yourself a favor and see something else instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well... the kids in the row behind me thought it was cool....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i'm 15 years old-Alright, I was a part of the test screening of "The Last Mimzy" and i thought it was dreadful! The characters seemed very inconsistent. Near the end of the movie, when the Noah character has to gather the spinners he seems to know exactly what hes talking about. then gets confused until reminded by Emma. And the science teachers wife.. My goodness. She just starts going on about how its his DESTINY to do this just because he had seen it all in dream. It sort of fit in the story but i was like "...where did THAT come from"My brother is twelve and he said it was rubbish as well. though he couldn't think of reason why because hes like that..My mother who is 40 didn't understand it and my father (born on the same day and year as my mother) though it was really really weird. And he loves science fiction. Said it reminded him of this book "diamond age" which I'm not sure if it is. I think the points on DNA and how the pollutants are killing our genes and mutating us was quite interesting. it really makes you think.Other than that i found it a wasted evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko For Kids(kind of)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this at a pre screening and I have mixed feelings all around. Two children find a mysterious box in the ocean and discover that its contents not only have powers but give them powers in return. I have heard that this idea was adapted from a book but I haven't read it however I may seek it out because I dig the concept. The problems with the big screen version here are numerous. There are way too many plot holes for starters also there's no depth to the people on screen yet there are moments of great dramatic tension where we are supposed to be moved but cant be because its too shallow. Problem number three is that the plot is very childish yet is treated like some complex puzzle filled with wonderous surprises. In other words too silly for adults too serious for kids there's no medium. I saw Mimzy with my two children both under the age of 14 who enjoyed it but not as a whole only in part or parts. Seems whenever things started to slow down in Mimzy they would push Rhiannon Leigh Wryn(Emma)in front of the camera to do something cute to distract you and in that aspect this movie works very well. I cant say that I hated this movie it was just very jumbled and rushed. If you can turn your brain all the way off like borderline coma you might like it otherwise you'll wind up like the dad behind me cursing under his breath every 5 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie was an incoherent mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I am not in the target demographic for this movie, as it is clearly aimed at children (at least, the sneak preview I attended this Saturday, half of whose attendees couldn't be older than ten years old, said it was). So some might say I'm looking at it with a more critical eye than is warranted. However, I don't buy that for a second. Simply being a children's movie is not an excuse for putting together such a sloppy effort.The main problem is focus. The movie, based on a short (and excellent) SF story, has no idea what it wants to be. The plot is basically this: two children, Noah and Emma, find a strange box of even stranger toys, including a stuffed rabbit that is the titular last Mimzy. It turns out that the toys are...well, they're not from this world. As the children begin experimenting with the toys, they start changing, becoming smarter to the point of genius (plus, Emma develops psychokinetic powers and Noah gets the power to "talk" to spiders). The question remains...what exactly is the purpose of these toys? For a good 3/4ths of the movie at least (estimation has never been my strong suit), the movie plods along at a glacial pace, focusing on the powers that the children develop. You'd think that, with all the scrutiny on these powers, the point/purpose of the toys would actually have something to do with them. But no.Instead, nearing the end of the movie (final thirty minutes? I'm not sure, but it felt that way, considering how rushed it all was), we learn that that Mimzy is actually a sophisticated AI lifeform produced by Intel (product placement has never been so obvious...the people at Intel must be nearly beside themselves with excitement). She has been sent back in time because humans cannot travel themselves, or they will die. Basically, the toys are from the future, from a time when humanity is dying out because of pollutants and other stuff that the movie doesn't bother making very clear. People have to wear full-body protective outfits that make them look like stereotypical aliens.Anyway, Mimzy is in search of a remarkable child, someone who has not been polluted by the world at this point, to save the world. She finds that in Emma. Near the end, when Emma cries on the rabbit, Mimzy absorbs her tears into her system. These tears of an innocent child are the necessary blueprints that the future needs to save humanity. So Mimzy goes back to the future, and the future world is saved. Yay! Just typing out that last paragraph made my head hurt, it's so ridiculous. Basically, the entire previous plot point of the children developing strange gifts becomes irrelevant because the toys are never even about that. So why all the fuss? Why all the focus? It's conceivable that the children have to go through all that change to get to the point where they can step up as the saviors of future humanity, but the movie doesn't bother tying all that together. The ending is completely schmaltzy and so sweet that it gives me a toothache.For those adults interested in seeing the movie, I recommend reading the short story it's based on, instead. "Mimsy Were the Borogoves" is an excellent, thoughtful piece of SF.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must be incomplete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way I can describe this movie is incomplete. There are plot holes in this movie that are so big, you can fly an airplane through them. Here are some examples. There is a scene regarding a power outage all over Seattle that was created by the "toys" the children found at their beach house. A call goes in to this man (Michael Clarke Duncan) who is supposed to be the regional director of National Security. He, along with several officials discuss this around a table and that's it. Then, this entire issue of why the power went out seems to be forgotten because a good 20-30 minutes go by in the movie and BAM, the FBI is breaking down the door of the family home. There is no warning of this. There are no further scenes with the FBI/Homeland security about how they determine the outage came from THIS family's home. It's almost like the directors and script writers forgot about the whole National Security thing so let's reintroduce it right.....here...BAM.Later in the movie, after the children return Mimzy home, Duncan appears again and says "I don't know what just happened, but I just wanted to say I'm sorry" and walks away. HUH???? A regional director of National Security who just sees a portal to another world open up and take a stuffed rabbit and disappears into thin air and he does an OH WELL and walks away? Not likely.Noah's science teacher, played by Rainn Wilson, is a character that I anticipate was supposed to bring about some sort of comic relief, failed miserably. He is a quirky, earthy type guy who has dreams that he is supposed to do something great. What is this great mission of his? He drives the kids to their summer cottage so they can return Mimzy home. Wow. Wilson is great at playing the quirky guy as that is how he is always cast. He's got that down pat. His part in this movie made little to no sense and could have been eliminated entirely.There is absolutely NO chemistry between the characters and you never feel that the family in any way relates to each other. The children, played by Rhiannon Leigh Wryn and Chris O'Neil, have no chemistry whatsoever. Any scenes that are supposed to be dramatic or climatic fall flat because of the lack of chemistry between the characters.There are so many things this movie needs that I truly believe it should be postponed, returned back to the editors, or re-shot entirely. This movie has potential but in it's current form, it is an absolute waste of 90 minutes of your life. I saw this movie with my 6 year old and even he didn't care for it. Even if this is the only movie in the theater, save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why call it The Last Mimzy in the UK?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comment's a little offbeat...In this day of strange localisation retitling, changing scripts, etc. I wonder, when they changed the s in Mimsy to a z, why they didn't change the title for the UK release.Simple reason is that Mimsy is slang in the UK for a lady's genitalia (no, I'm not saying this to be insulting - it's true). Although it's more regional, i.e. the North who use this slang word, I still cannot believe that the localisation team never realised what a glaring no-no this is.Strange...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Circle the VW buses!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And the Academy award for editing together a trailer to get as many saps into the theater goes to the individual whom worked on The Last Mimzy. This was biggest let down I have ever experienced since I went to a horror movie in the 80's that handed out barf bags. For you Sci-Fi types who want to see a movie laden with time travel, worm holes and technology forget it, stay home and watch a rerun of Star Gate. This was a big pile of liberal-hippie, metaphysical, tree hugging, circle the wagons Al Gore panic that I have ever seen.When the North Western United States looses power for no reason, the FBI and other National security types are made to look like the bad guys. What right do they have busting into a house where millions of household's worth of electricity drained into in a few seconds. The nerve of some! The FBI played that wrong, they should of dawned jackets with "EPA" on them and demanded to know what right four people had consuming 50 million peoples worth of power. Think of all the radiation and carbon that was released during that power drain. Or for that matter, when all the greenies drive to this POS in their 1970's VW buses. You know the projectors consume about 10,000 KWh. Think about that before you kill a tree watching this mess.The movie was a predictable, chopped together, rushed project that a freshman at film school threw together with all the new film tricks they had learned. Move over Battle Field Earth and Ishtar, there is a new stinker in town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this in a sneak peek this weekend. If you thought (like I did) that this was going to be a good fantasy/sci-fi for the kids - Don't Go! This is not a movie for the kids. Any kid 10 or under will be bored out of their mind.I can't believe that they would market this movie towards kids. In fact I'm not even sure what the demographic for this movie would be.If you are into the whole global warming/pollution/etc then wait until it is out on DVD. Otherwise don't even waste you time on this piece of junk.I was so disappointed that I even thought of asking for my money back.This was the first time I have gone to a movie in over a year and now I know why I just wait for the DVDs to come out.</fullReview>
