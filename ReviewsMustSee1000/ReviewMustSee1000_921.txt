		<shortDescription>.Depressed writer goes to cabin and learns to live and write again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magic of Bell Island is a fantastic feel good movie especially for seniors.Four of us attended and left in a great mood. The scenery and the sets were very realistic. The acting was brilliant, especially the children.The film had many themes: Reality vs Imagination, Alcholism, Death of a spouse, Divorce, Bringing up children, Dog sitting, Baseball players problems, living with handicaps,and more.I recommend this film for seniors, married couples, and families with children.I wonder if the author went on to write for children, another positive talent that he didn't realize he had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the crap coming out Hollywood these days, this is a feel good movie and if you really pay attention to the undertones, the movie lifts you up and is inspiring. The acting is fairly good, and Morgan F. as always has the right line to say at each moment.If you are in the mood for a family gathering type movie with a happy ending, this is a one to watch.The movie is inspirational and although the love innuendo between the two main characters can be thought by some to be distasteful, the real age of Monty is never revealed in the film so assumptions should not be made based on Morgan Freeman's real age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great family movie about finding yourself again. Great acting and excellent message. I recommend this. I say A.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It don't happen often but sometimes we do bring out the best in each other." After the death of his wife famous writer Monte Wildhorn (Freeman) stops writing and takes up drinking. He moves into a lake house to escape everyone and relax. After meeting his neighbor Charlotte O'Neil (Madsen) and her daughters he begins to change the way he feels about life. One of the biggest problems I have with movies is that about 70% of them are so predictable that after ten minutes you know how it will end. Sometimes that affects how good a movie is and sometimes it doesn't matter. This movie is the later. After fifteen minutes I could have written the ending myself and it would have been identical to the way this one ended. All that said this is a great movie still and Morgan Freeman is about the only actor who can take a very ornery character and make you like him even at his worst. There are not many non-cartoon movies that are great for the whole family to watch. This is one of them. Rated PG but this is still something that you can put in with your kids and not have to worry about what they are seeing. This is a perfect example of how excellent a movie can be simply by using the best actors you can find and having a great idea. No special effects or nudity or swearing. What a strange idea. Overall, a superb family movie that I highly recommend. I give it an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wheelchair bound curmudgeon and heavy drinker Monte Wildhorn (Morgan Freeman), a writer of western stories house-sits for a friend in Belle Isle and softens considerably when he befriends single mother Charlotte O'Neil (Virginia Madsen) and her three children.I don't remember liking a movie as much as this one since THE ASTRONAUT FARMER. The cast were perfect. The dialogues were spot on and very entertaining. The banter between Monte and 9-year old Finnegan O'Neil (Emma Fuhrmann) was pure gold and proved to be the beginnings of Monte softening his outlook on life. I wished that banter never ended. Like I said Pure Gold. Kudos to the writers. This is indeed a feel good movie with a low key pacing and you never wanted it to end. For starters we see curmudgeon Monte be bam-boozled into reading an obituary for someone he "didn't know;" getting a side-kick in Carl (Ash Christian) a somewhat special needs person; giving aspirin to Ringo, the dog (that he renames Spot) with stiff hind quarters; and helping Finnegan learn to write stories. All this sets the stage for everything that follows. And, everything that follows shows growth of all characters. Sometimes like a big juicy cheeseburger you just "gotta have" you also "gotta see" a pure gold movie like this. (10/10)FYI: Virginia Madsen was also in the Astronaut Farmer.Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.Rating: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't trust the critics on this one; the movie touched me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can't trust the critics on this one; consulting my usual sources, I found unexpectedly low ratings. How could this be, I asked myself. Well, I found this, Morgan Freeman in a movie directed and co-written by Rob Reiner, was suspiciously slanted. Perhaps the story was grossly uninteresting or unappealing. I wondered; I certainly didn't think so when I read the storyline. After viewing the movie, I can assure that's not the case. It's a beautiful story, thanks to inspired writing, great dialogue and impeccable delivery by talented performers and not in the least by splendid directing.I'll grant one factor to critics, for their reason to underrate it; the ending is predictable. So what! Your favorite songs and books are some things you can listen to and read again, even if you know the outcome; that does not make it less good. If you want something unpredictable, watch 'The Skin I live In'. I was very surprised by that movie (one I liked for that reason), but I liked 'We Bought A Zoo' just as much, yet for the opposite reason; it is predictable, but the journey is the pleasure the movies provide the viewers, after all.Morgan Freeman is as good as he was in his Oscar wining performance. It takes talent to make you believe a character who is a Beethoven loving cowboy writer drunk, one who speaks like the best novelists of any period. Guys? you may want to write some lines his character delivers to Virginia Madsen's character Charlotte; they are the kind to woo any woman with a pulse. Two of Charlotte's girls are adorable, much like Maggie Elizabeth Jones was in 'We Bought a Zoo'; she was so good, it takes those two girls of Charlotte to give you that same charmed feeling, but you will feel it. Madsen was the perfect fit for the role of Charlotte; she can still use her eyes like a magnet to steel, and that's a good thing. I recommend the movie without hesitation and screw the critics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Magic of Belle Isle, sounds a bit cheesy doesn't it? Well, it's not. It has a disabled Morgan Freeman who gives up on life until finding a single mother with three girls. You think it will be predictable but not as much as you think; I thought it had a really good story and enjoyed it the whole way through. I loved the humour in this movie because who doesn't like a good laugh and the jokes in this film will make anybody laugh. I like the ways the characters were brought out and some really good ones that taught you about life and stuff. So I really would recommend this to everyone as it is good family entertainment which you don't get to often, so forget the rubbish you're going to watch tonight and see The Magic of Belle Isle.http://theojreviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this film without to many expectations even for a family drama, but as the story stars to develop you can tell this is going somewhere special and is definitely worthy of your time. This is the story of a writer on his winter days that goes to an island to spent the summer and discover that not everything may be lost. Without getting into to many details I can tell you Morgan Freeman is amazing as always, he delivers a beautiful performance and the rest of the cast is good as well. The script is fantastic, you can imagine your self in those situations and feel for the characters. The photography and the music is perfect and everything together leaves you with a taste of "Life is beautiful" in your mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>my wife and i sat and watched this last night and were glued to the story throughout the whole film. Morgan Freeman plays an excellent role as the wheelchair bound crippled ex professional writer who is the innocent victim of a hit and run driver. The accident, obviously leaving him bitter and turning to the bottle. Trying to find solace on the Belle Isle, he meets his neighbor and her three children and things start to change as he uses his writing skills to teach one of them in particular to use her own imagination. The acting from the Mother and all 3 daughters is very good and i would not be surprised to see Freeman win an Oscar for his role. If you have not seen this movie, i highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Writer Regains the Will to Live</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner's "The Magic of Belle Isle" tells the story of a man who regains the will to live after entering the lives of a single mom and her three daughters. This is the kind of movie that divides audiences into two basic categories: Those that like sentimental dramas, and those that don't. I'm sure my opening description alone is enough for you to determine which category you fall into. For my money, the film is simple, well-intentioned, and good-hearted ? flawed, yet protected and ultimately redeemed by its belief in second chances. Given the hardships of reality, the last thing we need is a movie that reminds us of them. What we really need is a movie that gives us reason to hope for something better. You may think I'm na?ve, although I prefer to think of myself as open to possibilities.The man at the center of the story is Monte Wildhorn (Morgan Freeman). As a young man, his athletic prospects were shattered when an accident robbed him of his ability to walk. He would go on to make a name for himself as a writer of western fiction, only to give up on it following the death of his beloved wife. Wheelchair bound, in his golden years, and having lost everything including his faith, he now spends his days downing bottles of alcohol and making acerbic remarks. An easy target is his nephew, Henry (Kenan Thompson), who made arrangements for Monte to housesit a small house during the summer in a quiet upstate New York lakeside town. Part of this involves taking care of an old dog, whose refusal to fetch a ball will be a running gag throughout the entire film.In due time, Monte meets his next-door neighbor, the soon-to-be-divorced Charlotte O'Neil (Virginia Madsen), and her three daughters. There's the rebellious teenager, Willow (Madeline Carroll), who really just wants to spend time with her unseen father. There's the little one, Flora (Nicolette Pierini), whose main purpose is to look adorable. Finally, there's the middle child, Finnegan, a.k.a. Finn (Emma Fuhrmann), a tomboy who has a flair for making up outlandish stories and testing them on Flora. Despite her obvious gift, she's under the impression that she doesn't know how to be a writer, and so she appeals to Monte to be her mentor. Monte, of course, will initially come off as cantankerous before taking a liking to Finn, admiring her curiosity and determination.Several things come of this initial encounter. Firstly, Monte and Charlotte take the first steps towards falling in love. Secondly, he's invited to attend a memorial service for a man he never met and is asked by the town mayor (Fred Willard) to deliver an already-written eulogy. This could, perhaps, be a lighthearted jab at Freeman's secondary career as a voice-over artist, but never mind. Thirdly, Finn will venture to Belle Isle, a tiny island in the middle of the lake, and retrieve a lunchbox full of her mother's school-age love letters. Monte will also befriend, as only he can, a mentally challenged man named Carl (Ash Christian), who hops rather than walks from one point to another. Finally, he will be inspired to start writing again; although his new stories are structurally and grammatically appropriate for Flora, it's obvious that the subtexts are aimed squarely at Charlotte.Some time is reserved for a subplot involving Monte's agent, the delightfully named Joe Viola (Kevin Pollack), who's eager to get his client back in the game. More specifically, he wants Monte to sell the rights to one of his books to Hollywood. Repeated phone calls go unreturned for obvious reasons, and so Viola is forced to drop by unannounced. I can't help but wonder how necessary this aspect of the story was, given the fact that the real focus is the relationship Monte shares with Charlotte and Finn. However, I do think it would have worked had it been separated from "The Magic of Belle Isle" and expanded into its own feature-length film, one a little less emotional and family- friendly.I grant you that the story is contrived and that specific characters, most notably Carl, are included primarily as foils for Monte as he undergoes emotional rehabilitation. What saves it, by my standards, was the fact that there was obviously no malicious intent on the part of Reiner or Guy Thomas, the screenwriter. The only questionable aspect of "The Magic of Belle Isle" is Monte educating Finn on how to be a writer. It's clear right from the start that she already knows what she's doing; to have her approach him and ask for guidance was forced and implausible. Apart from that, the film is no more or less that what it is, namely a harmless, feel-good story. While it may not win a spot on the shelf next to Reiner's more substantial films, it at least won't be mentioned in the same sentence with the year's worst films.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine summer movie. Just what you would expect from Rob Reiner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love and sharing can come in many forms. So too, growth and development. Reiner scores well touching all aspects of the good side of humans.He also gives a complete picture of life seen through the simplistic eyes of children while allowing the complex world of adults be part of the story without taking any of the magic from childhood. The cast is wonderful and I loved the strength, power, and insecurity of Morgan Freeman.One again admires Reiner's ability to show complex stories through the strength of his actors rather than depending on CG and other cheap slight-of-hand fakery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it's Sunday afternoon and you're kind of bored, if you're not in the mood for anything in particular, press play on "The Magic of Bell Isle".These movie will not disappoint you, it will not leave a bad taste but rather it will leave you smiling and feeling good.The story is very original and well written. The characters are not well developed but it doesn't matter because the dialogue is remarkable. You will find some great quotes in this film and I guarantee you'll be smiling at the end.It's a very light comedy with just a pinch of drama, and the reason is such a good film is, of course, Morgan Freeman.I myself enjoyed the movie and recommend it for a rainy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rob Reiner's Latest is a Feel Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner's latest is a little rough around the edges and somewhat formulaic, but I also found it to be humorous, touching, and a feel good film. Morgan Freeman, in another wonderful performance, plays a wheelchair bound(after an auto accident many years before) cantankerous, crude alcoholic who has become extremely jaded since the passing of his wife six years ago. Once he was a famous writer of Western fiction, but now just wants to drink and isolate.His nephew drops him off in the small resort town of Belle Isle, where he will stay in the home of a friend Dog Dave, who's away for the summer. Next door lives a woman(Virginia Madsen) and her three daughters of varying ages. Although he tries to avoid it, Freeman soon is interacting with his neighbors and even the townspeople. He slowly begins to bond with the family next door especially with the two younger daughters. One wants to be a writer and Freeman helps her use her imagination. He even starts writing a few stories for the youngest girl, who loves elephants.One thing that does not work is the possible relationship between Freeman and Madsen. I found it to be far fetched, to say the least.However, overall I found the film quite enjoyable if you overlook the schmaltz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A predictable, yet surprising gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While you must admit, Morgan Freeman is the type of actor who generally falls into the category of playing the same style for each of his films, he does it with solid style and the "Morgan Freeman-esque" on-screen persona we can all recognize from voice alone.In this story, it was incredibly reminiscent of "High Crimes" (2002), a film directed by Carl Franklin where he also plays a character with a bit of a weakness for the booze, except of course, he was a lot older in this one. When Morgan Freeman plays a man with a weakness for alcohol, he still manages to appear so wise and commandeering of the role that you can't help but to admire him anyway.As any other review will tell you, the story is very predictable although I personally feel that it's not a story about the ending and resolution, but one whose importance stems from the very journey itself. Sure, we all know what kind of movie this will be based off the film's introduction sequence alone, but you must let go of traditional Hollywood movies where the focus is all on the resolution, and appreciate every minute for what it's worth -- a series of small and magnificently written and directed dialog that all adds up and becomes the sum of the film, regardless of the overall picture you may have already deduced from the first 15 minutes.Throughout this movie, I found myself to be smiling constantly even after I'd long stopped paying attention. When I saw the single mother and her children, I began wondering what sort of "chick flick" I'd gotten myself into, but Rob Reiner did it right (although he only seemed to have time for the bigger picture and had no choice but to neglect some smaller elements).I only had two major complaints with this movie and neither contain spoilers, so feel free to read on.First, the product placement was a bit on the absurd side. There is a scene that takes place in a small convenience store where way too many minutes are devoted to discussing certain snacks by name-brand, going so far as to have the cashier *slowly* hand over merchandise with the product labels even perfectly facing the camera, and even a bit where the cashier announces a certain cereal to be "gluten-free". As I watched Morgan Freeman recite a brand by name and borderline a slogan too, I had to wonder, "What are you doing, how can you say that with a smile on your face?" The other problem I had was with believability in Freeman's character. This is a rather pleasant, heart-felt story that'll leave you with warm fuzzies, although Freeman's character is introduced as an ornery and bitter man. So I thought, "Okay, there is going to be some character transformations in store, right?" Not quite. Despite a convincing performance as a cranky (but still Morgan Freeman type) character, we see that he flawlessly integrates himself into social situations as an overly warm, polite, and cheerful sort, even when supposedly drunk. It is almost as if the movie went from start to finish with no in-between, since Freeman was already charming as could be, despite being a cranky old sod.But then again, this is Rob Reiner, and the goal is to get a wonderful story told as smoothly as possible, even if it means putting away some of the smaller details. Also as refreshing, is the PG rating. I'm really not used to seeing good, wholesome films like this, although it is still very guy-friendly. The ongoing dialog with the dog was absolutely brilliant.While this is not a story about its end, but rather the smaller moments throughout the journey itself, I still found it unusually pleasant and fun to watch, and will not be forgetting it, but recommending it.. especially to the parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and clichéd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How people can say this film is amazing is beyond me. I was embarrassed by the paint by numbers "old drunk becomes lovable" routine. Morgan seems to be in need of a paycheck or his judgement is on the way out. Also at the end a glaring error when old Monty uses his arm to hug the little girl. The same arm that is pointedly totally immobile during the whole film....(and yes I know Morgan has some real life disability in the arm) On the positive side is Emma Furhmann, the little girl's acting is beyond her years and she could be one for the future. Also Ash Christian gives a surprisingly real edge to his character. All in all, may be worth a view if you are into slush and sentimentality but it was a little syrupy for my tastes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanted to like more, but way too contrived...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie and was looking forward to enjoying the premise of a curmudgeonly writer "finding" himself in an idyllic lakeside cottage, through his interactions with the single mom and her kids next door (and even through Spot, the dog). However, my eyes rolled and I yelled "NO" at the screen, when the story chose to go down the romantic path.The scenery was beautiful, and I did enjoy Monte's erudite manner of speaking. The acting was fairly good all around, except for some over-reaching on Finn's part. There were way too many contrived moments for my liking, though: 1) When a 9-year old damages a jump house, there are consequences. Monte should have been arrested for assault, for brandishing his gun. 2) As a single mother myself, I would surely not ask the much older gun-brandishing neighbor, on the spur of the moment, to watch my children, while I attended a scheduled meeting and planned to be away for 14 hours or so. 3) The romance element was downright creepy. Period. We all know that Morgan Freeman is in his 70's, and Virginia Madsen's character would have realistically been only in her mid-40's (as the mother of a 7-year old). This was too much of an age gap to be believable, even by Hollywood standards.I gave this film 6 stars based solely on my respect for Morgan Freeman as an actor. Perhaps I am too cynical for this much syrupy sweetness, but in my opinion, a reality check should have been applied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow pseudo-inspirational movie, but it could have been worse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magic of Belle Isle is one of those supposedly inspirational movies where a lonely character who has been embittered by life's misfortunes gets his lost hopes back through an accidental encounter that changes his life. In this particular case, the character is a wheelchair-ridden western book writer who hasn't written anything in ages and is plagued by alcoholism. The sparks that reignites his life are befriending a smart 9-year old girl and falling in love with her mom. The fact that the aged writer is Morgan Freeman (aged 75) and the mom is Virginia Madsen (aged 50) makes the relationship odd if not creepy, but teary-eyed audiences have seen and forgiven far worse the that.The movie, to be fair, is not too bad. Director Rob Reiner has done "When Harry Met Sally", and somehow he avoids most of the cheesiness and emotional blackmail that comes with such a story. But not even he can avoid all of the clichés (e.g., Morgan Freeman recounts the story of how he lost his legs. Dramatic pause and close up of his face. Beethoven's sonata begins). The fact is that most of this movie's pitfalls lay beyond what any director can do. The screenplay is messy, and a number of plot points are careless. The most blatant case is that Morgan Freeman is left alone in an empty house despite being in an electric wheelchair AND having lost use of his left arm (no, you cannot lift yourself to bed with one arm only. Not even if you are Morgan Freeman). Some subplots are thrown in there and simply forgotten. For example, at a certain point the three girls find a lunch box that belonged to their mom. Inside the lunch box is her 7th-grade diary. The oldest girl steals it and reads it. And that's it---we will never know what was inside that, besides a causal remark towards the end of the movie.Some elements are exceedingly cheap. Morgan Freeman constantly speaks with an erudite selection of words that is what the average viewer can identify as "literary English". Why? Because the authors need to make sure everybody remembers that he is a writer. In the meantime, they forgot that he writes western novels (they clearly never read one) and not Elizabethan drama. Also, at a certain point Morgan Freeman threatens a clown at gunpoint. Why? Because the clown yelled at the little 9-year old girl for puncturing his air-blown castle. The goal of this scene is to make Morgan Freeman look like the hero for defending the girl, and to make him look badass despite his wheelchair. They needed to do that because they felt (correctly) that they did not convey much of Morgan Freeman's character in the preceding 60 minutes. But the clown (as made clear in the preceding scene) makes his living out of renting his rubber castle for birthday parties! And the girl did, in fact, just destroyed it! And why is Morgan Freeman bringing a gun to a 9-year old birthday party? The fact is that these "technical" issues betray what is the movie's most irredeemable fault, that is, its underlying emotional shallowness. This is best revealed in the case of one secondary character, Carl. Remember that the movie hinges upon Morgan Freeman's handicap and the pain it causes him. But then the authors throw in a secondary character, Carl, who is a young adult with Down syndrome. Carl is the movie's equivalent of the town's fool; he goes around hopping like a bunny (which is, apparently, what the screenwriters believe people with Down syndrome do), wears scuba goggles while shopping, and almost drowns in a shallow pool of water. What's the point of Carl? To give comedic relief, of course, even if it is cheap comedy (a grown up man the hops like a bunny is sad, not funny, unless you are 5 years old) and at the expense of a character who ALSO has an handicap. Somehow, Morgan Freeman's handicap is serious, but Carl's can be laughed upon. So, overall, the movie does rise above the meager standards of similar flicks, but not quite enough to make viewing it worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sadly predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monty Wildhorn (Morgan Freeman) is an alcoholic wheelchair bound Western writer who has stopped writing. His nephew Henry (Kenan Thompson) gets him a place to stay in Belle Isle for the summer. The place is next door to recently divorced Charlotte O'Neil (Virginia Madsen) and his three girls Finnegan (Emma Fuhrmann), Willow (Madeline Carroll) and Flora (Nicolette Pierini). Finnegan loves to tell stories.I hoped that Rob Reiner retains an ounce of originality but feared that this would be sadly uninspired. This ends with too much of my fears coming true. These are great actors doing their best. The story has its share of eccentric characters. I really like Freeman with Fuhrmann. This could be a sweet kids movie especially if it concentrated on the girl instead. It's depressingly predictable to have the May to December romance. With such great actors, this has the opportunity to be good but the material doesn't have much meat on the bones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe Virginia Madsen and Morgan Freeman agreed to be associated with this film. It is poorly written, poorly directed and with the exception of the two actors mentioned above, poorly acted. Essentially it is four cliché stories that have been done before, meshed into one big, cheesy mess. There are some unbearable scenes that were obviously crafted by the writer who couldn't find a transition between stories. There is a character who is mentally challenged and the actor who played the role did such a poor job, I actually thought he was joking for a few minutes. The story is so predictable, I could actually finish much of the dialogue. On the positive side, the cinematography is pretty good and the scenery is nice to look at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this but I nearly choked on the clichés and plot holes and to top it all off the ending straight out of Hollywoodland Central.Really good cast, apart from some stilted children (look maw, I'm acting school), plot holes to drive a tank through and an odd character with a mental disability used as a butt for jokes. Offensive.75 year old man in a wheelchair with unusable left arm (except at the end when everyone forgets and he hugs a child)falls in love with a 50 year old woman who reciprocates.She plays piano at a classical level, has no visible means of financial support, he's a jaded alcoholic western novel writer who speaks classical English all the time.Plothole # 8: He takes a gun to a children' birthday party and threatens a clown with it, a clown who makes his living off renting a blow-up castle that one of the children punctures. I'd be one angry clown losing my income like this but no, he skulks off leaving everything behind.The grounds of this movie is littered with such contrivances.It would have been somewhat redeemed with a better ending. But no, I guess the preview audience wanted that old Harlequin thing...shame.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. This film is not for me. I'm a bloke. I'm a geek. I am "North of fifty".So why did I first catch it at 5 AM in the morning intending to continue my channel hopping then gradually have it pull me away from my backlog of Arrow and Dr Who episodes that I have pre-recorded for such moments? And after watching it once, a week ago I think, I am so hooked that when I found out that it was on this morning and it was so near the beginning It easily won over watching The Gadget Show or even going off to my usual morning open-source software writing?!I found the film to be highly engaging without being too "mushy"; and on the other hand, neither does it try to be too gritty in the hope of being more "realistic". The film is well written with a story I wanted to hear and once heard, I wanted to hear it again so I could ensure I had truly discovered some nuances and was rewarded by finding more!Normally, I am not moved to write such reviews, but the film deserves my first mainly because it shouldn't be a film I like so much. Hats off to the makers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie became so predictable. The script is lame and the acting stilted. If it weren't for Morgan Freeman's delivery and acting skills this would have sunk way down to the bottom. Perhaps his interaction with the girl (Emma Fuhrmann) is the only worthwhile bit of acting ? and even then. It struck me that this was a movie for 10 year olds. Really not a whole lot going on with the same old clichés ? crotchety drunken author becomes rehabilitated with the daughters of beautiful, enticing divorcée next door ? and he befriends a dog. The conflicts ? such as they are (between mother and daughters) ? are totally uninspired. It's a film you can walk away from to nibble at potato chips or dessert and come back to without missing a beat. I was expecting better considering the IMDb rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet drama! 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: How can anyone say anything bad about a heart warming movie with Morgan Freeman playing the lead? I saw this movie some time ago on Sky so I knew what to expect. Although I knew the whole storyline, I still found it quite entertaining I enjoyed watching the softer side to Morgan Freeman, even though he is playing a miserable git. All of the actors put in believable performances, and the storyline is well put together by the director. It's good that people are still making movies that rely on a great storyline and a good cast. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This movie definitely deserved a bigger gross. Morgan Freeman played his part extremely well and it really does show that he is in a league of his own. No one can play roles like these, as well as Morgan, which is why people always have him on the top of there list when it comes to movies in this category. Anyway, it's not the type of movie that will blow you away or watch time and time again, but if your in the right mood, you can't help but feel touched by this touching drama.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $102,000 (Terrible)I recommend this movie to people who are into there witty dramas about a grumpy old man becoming friends with a fatherless family. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rob Reiner and Morgan Freeman team up for a 'feel good' movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you look at his entire resume' as a director, you see that Rob Reiner has come a long way since playing the 'meathead' on 'All In The Family', and as a director has given us many memorable movies. He has done it again here, and while this one will not likely rise to the top of his list of accomplishments, it is a very nice one with a good story.Morgan Freeman is Monte Wildhorn , somewhat formerly famous author who has quit writing, and has become a curmudgeon of sorts. He is in a wheel chair, we don't find out why until much later in the movie, but he is going to spend the summer in this New York State 'Belle Isle' community, in a small run-down house. Next door are a single mom and her three daughters.The mom is Virginia Madsen as Charlotte O'Neil . Her middle daughter is 11-ish Emma Fuhrmann as Finnegan O'Neil , the most interesting and precocious of the daughters. She becomes friends of sort with Monte pretty quickly, and plays a role in getting him interested again in writing. And he helps her learn how to use her imagination better. Monte and Charlotte also seem to be developing a bond, in spite of their large age difference. And of course his being confined to a wheel chair.Very nice, rather quiet movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely, melodramatic, too sweet for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner has certainly slipped a little from Hollywood greatness. If anything proves that its the onslaught of negative feedback from this film. Its obvious that our cynical society hates anything that tries to be sweet and nothing else. Its true that being just sweet and nice doesn't usually entertain very well but thanks to a lead star who can do very little wrong, and a cute well written simple script I found it very entertaining and simply nice. No it won't blow anyone away, and it certainly won't take any awards home but why can't something just BE NICE! I will be the first one to laugh at May-December romance movies especially ones that choose to ignore the fact that the leading man is downright old and his love interest could be his granddaughter. However, the film actually handles this potential romance very well. Not once is there anything physical between them, or any blatant romance, its simply an unspoken attraction and not physical but rather something deep and meaningful. I left with the impression that their romance would never blossom but rather be left this unspoken deep connection. People are correct...it is syrupy sweet, it is simple and unassuming, it is even a little predictable and stereotypical but it is still a nice movie to sit back and simply enjoy.There is very few people on the planet that would argue the intense talent and charisma of Morgan Freeman. He's a legend, a true Hollywood star, and most people could watch him do anything and he does just about everything. He probably instantly turns this six out of ten movie into an eight just by being there. He's grouchy and grieving and having trouble getting a grip on his life. He's just so lovable and you just want to hang out with this man the whole time. Virginia Madsen is not one of my favourite actresses but she does a great job in this film as a struggling single mother wanting to connect with her children and protect them from their absentee father. Madsen and Freeman are terrific together and despite what reviews say I think they're romance (done very subtly) was lovely. As many reviews have also said the three daughters are excellent and really bring life and chemistry to the film. They are the magic of Belle Isles. Emma Fuhrmann, Madeline Carroll and Nicolette Pierini are just so good together and so good with Freeman easily making it believable that they could break through his grief and win him over. I think Emma Fuhrmann gives a terrific stand out performance amongst the three girls although they are all great. Ash Christian gives a decent and moving performance as the lovable disillusioned Carl Loop.Maybe the only problem with the film is that it tries to cram too much into the story and because of that some of the more important details don't get enough time spent on them. Rob Reiner has been accused lately of not showing some of the strength he showed in his younger days but he's always excelled at melodramatic romance films. If you can just go into this without having unrealistic expectations...its not an Academy Award film...and just be entertained and enjoy the characters and it really is a good solid movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let the "professional critics" steer you away from this delightful family drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know anything about this movie before watching it. But with Morgan Freeman as the leading character, I believed it had potential. Even my husband, who rarely watches movies and likes even fewer, thought it was a movie worth watching. It has humor, pathos, and leaves the viewer feeling good when the lights go up. Morgan F. does his usual amazing performance as a jaded writer suffering from writer's block who (reluctantly) moves to a small community for the summer. He ends up dog-sitting in a house next door to a lovely woman (who is going through a divorce) and her three daughters. The middle daughter, Finnegan, charms her way into his life and his heart in her pursuit of imagination. Although Morgan F.'s character starts out pretty rough around the edges, he is witty, articulate, and increasingly endearing as the story progresses. A "feel good" family film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magic is a theatrical illusion of what could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not heard of this movie before but knowing that Morgan Freeman was the star actor and Rob Reiner was the star director I had basic expectations that it would at least be a "good, solid" movie. Given their track record this movie was a disappointment overall. It was a feel good story that could have been a really good movie but had a bad start.Firstly the script was so full of fluffy, wordy dialogue I found myself thinking the writer likes to "hear himself write" especially the first two thirds or more of the film. I felt like this is not how these people would talk or act. It seemed like a middle school play where the actors were enunciating and "acting" some bad lines.My apologies to this wonderful director of other Oscar nominated movies, but I wondered at times if Mr. Reiner was "phoning it in" on this one.It was not until the lead character Monte rediscovered himself, his imagination and talent for writing and the joy of living through his relationship with this family that the movie started to feel genuine.I am not a writer, and definitely not a critic but I felt compelled to share my opinion. Hell I actually don't even like reading "professional" movie reviews because the critics seem to want to sound smarter than everyone else and I think the viewer should like a movie based on their on their own tastes and values, etc not what someone that gets paid to sell papers or TV time says.This an honest opinion from and average guy. My 2 cents, I am sure it worth less to some of you.Tracy in TX</fullReview>

Great art touches an individual deeply and I shall not try to put this fine piece of great art into words. I would be a bit amazed of a person who does not get anything out of this one. Recommended for every living Soul.

		<fullReview>There is something nice about putting on a movie and never having the urge to skip and jump forward. If you want to feel good, wrap yourself up in a story like a warm, familiar blanket, and listen to the amazing tones that is the voice of Morgan Freeman, this is very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.A man who has lived life and with the ability to describe it vividly finds himself spending the summer in temporary quarters...where he learns to heal, to recover, to influence, to teach, and to love again. The dialogue is spot on, and while Freeman can make a recitation of the phone book sound wonderful, the lines he delivers with that voice that was created by God himself (hey, I saw that movie, too) give this pic a great foundation to build upon. In the end, you can analyze the stuffings out of it, but it comes down to whether a movie makes you feel good and that it was time well spent. It does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An aging alcoholic writer is dropped off at a small summer resort town by his nephew, who advises him to stop drinking, start writing again, and take care of the dog. Morgan Freeman grudgingly makes friends with some of the town's off-beat characters. He develops a relationship with the divorced mother next door and her three daughters. And, with their encouragement, he does indeed stop drinking, start writing again, and takes care of the dog. A romantic arc develops and provides a sweet, slightly surprising ending. This is an unexpected movie for Freeman fans, and is a nice change from his action films. Definitely worth the time of anyone who doesn't need to see morgue porn or stuff blowing up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rob Reiner's little piece of Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie had been made back in the 1930's it would probably be remembered as a 'classic' today! But with today cynical movie going public, it most likely sunk without trace at the box office? I came across it on DVD when I was looking up films that Fred Willard had appeared in, having enjoyed him in 'Everybody Loves Raymond' and the short lived 'Back To You' TV series. As it turns out Fred isn't in this all that much, but as always, he's quirky and good, however, the off beat casting of Morgan Freeman as a disillusioned author of westerns who's taken to drink, and the gorgeous much under rated Virginia Madsen as his next door neighbour works a treat in this delightful, feel good little movie! In fact everyone in it is perfect casting, and all deliver the goods. No violence, no explosions, no foul language, no brats, no CGI, how refreshing, mind you, there is one gunshot, fired into the air! Now and again a little gem like this comes along just to remind us of better cinematic days gone by, if you haven't got a big smile on your face, and a warm feeling in your heart at the end of this movie, I'm afraid there's no hope for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunday afternoon, sitting on the sofa, marking work for school so decided to pop a movie on TV (via Net Flicks). As a fan of Morgan Freeman l chose this movie and am so glad l did. Towards the early part of the movie l put down my work and watched with full engagement and commitment. What a lovely movie. Such a touching story line of real people, gently executed. Caring and calming. Not one swear word or aggressive outcome. Lovely human tale. Morgan Freeman has such a wonderful voice that l could listen to him reading the ingredient list on a tube of Pringles and be blown away. The script for this movie was so natural and heart warming that Mr Freeman was all the more mesmerizing. Loved this movie. A very positive story line. Uplifting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misfired feel-good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy most kind of movies if they're well made. And director Rob Reiner has done a few I liked quite a bit. it's been some years since his heydays ("The bucket list" in 2005, "A few good men" in 1995, "Misery" in 1990, "When Harry met Sally" in 1989). But I wonder if this is a sign that he's getting too old.This story should have all ingredients to make a great feel good movie, and starts off OK, but I'm afraid to say that the praises it gets here in other reviews are quite far off. This is just like a mediocre TV-flick, and though it's well played by most actors, it's tediously boring, slow and misses the mark that a feel good film should have.Morgan Freeman is good as always, and Virginia Madsen is good, but here they had almost nothing to work on. The script is very thin, and a film like this should push the nerves like f.e. "Driving Miss Daisy", "Pay it forward" or "Good Will Hunting" if they are to deserve a rating on almost 7 here on IMDb.I can see Rob Reiner probably didn't have the best writing material to work with here, and I wish him luck with "And so it goes" which are due next year. He's got a great cast there, and the writer Mark Andrus succeeded with "Life as a house". Good luck, mister Reiner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The professional critics seem to truly hate this film. I honestly don't understand why, nor do I even care. My taste is conventional enough that I find I agree with the critical consensus far more often than not. But not this time. This time I think the majority of critics have pursued a conventional rabbit right up a passage where the sun don't shine.Morgan Freeman can often express more with just his face than most actors can with their entire image and in this he truly shines at it. There's no question as to what he's feeling. Not once, which is critical since the entire film really revolves around the transformation within him.This is not a great film, to be sure. It's definitely a "feel good" movie. So what? I think there's always room for a few of those . . . and this one absolutely nails it. For anyone other than a professional movie critic, I suppose.

It is a romantic comedy that is a breath of fresh air without all the cursing and nudity. One man can make a difference and a family can make a difference in a lot of lives. It is a sad movie at times, but the caring for each other makes all the difference. Just sharing of each other can change the world. These are the movies you wish everyone could watch.

		<shortDescription>A brilliant feel good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why people hate this movie. Perhaps it's the romance element between a 30 / 40 something woman and a 70 something man. But why does this matter? When it comes to love, age is just a number. I thought the movie was well acted (Morgan Freeman, as always, did not disappoint) and the story was great. I think what many people miss is the element of a struggling author. And the people that miss it are those who are not authors. As a writer myself, I know what it's like to lose the ability to write a particular story or even character when something associated with it happens. In this movie Monte lost his love of writing when his wife died. If you're not a writer, you will never understand how something as terrible as grief can screw you over. It can either ruin you forever, or for a very long time. Monte was fortunate to find a family who gave him inspiration. A brilliant movie I will most likely watch again. The scenery was beautiful, the kids were great and blossomed throughout the story and everything about it was near perfect. I knocked off a couple of points for some cliché moments, which is pretty much in every romantic movie. Otherwise it was exactly what I needed and highly recommend it.</fullReview>

How many times have you met someone in passing and have remained friends for years? We can all relate to that I think.

		<fullReview>Granted, this is the kind of "feel good" movie I like. Morgan Freeman is excellent as the former writer who seems to have given up on life since the death of his wife (been there, done that). What he needs is a reason to live the rest of his life somewhere that matters. He finds that with a family of 4 (mom divorcing, and 3 girls missing their old life with dad and all) who are the friendly people next door. Lots of really good funny one liners. And, a promise from the former author to sue the operators of a bus service if they weren't providing accessible services...good for him! I guess it might be too stereotypical for some people, but I loved all the characters! Nice to watch when you want to watch a movie that's not too heavy and has a happy ending.

Kenan looks pretty much the same, while Kel has developed a debilitating condition where he looks fifty years older than he really is, and is forced to use a wheelchair. He's also become an alcoholic and lost his wife, making him unable to keep writing his novels.Well, anyway, Kel moves to Belle Isle in order to watch a house over the summer, where he'll soon meet a lovely family next door and befriend one of the daughters, who'll help him get less grumpy as he teaches her how to be a writer. He'll also fall for the girls' divorcing mother, possibly getting enough inspiration to start writing in the process. In summary, 'The Magic of Belle Isle' is a heartwarming film focused on a man who's struggled a lot in life but luckily finds enough reasons to keep living. Definitely a must-watch if you want to know how the story develops!Starring Kenan Thompson and Kenan and Morgan Freeman as Kel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about Morgan Freeman? Why do we enjoy his on screen appearances so much. He's a very good actor. True. But our affection for him seems to go beyond that.This is a well-meaning movie, but I couldn't help but think that maybe Rob Reiner is slipping a bit. The general plot is fine, but I thought the performances from the three kids -- while crucial -- seemed a bit disingenuous. Lots of potential, but I thought that Reiner should have seen that something in their acting was just a little off.Morgan Freeman makes this movie. All the others that we see are in the periphery, even though some of their roles are essential. Freeman is the anchor.I'm not a particular fan of Virginia Madsen, but she does her job here, and as the film progressed she grew on me...somewhat. Emma Fuhrmann -- the middle-aged daughter -- is a promising young actress, although here she sometimes had very adultish expressions on her face that just seemed a bit out of place.This movie doesn't exactly set the world on fire. Sometimes I ever felt it was just plodding along. But overall I enjoyed it...but it's not high up on my list. A good, small motion picture.</fullReview>

Morgan Freeman is himself, giving to his role entire support of emotions, gloomy sides, humor and fragility. and Virginia Madesen is best choice to create inspired balance. a film about reality as seed of life , discoveries and lesson, sweet and gentle, warm and touching. a film like many others but not common. because it is not only demonstration of splendid acting but, in same measure, a soup for soul with many ingredients , necessary in crisis period but, in fact, speech about small things - bones/seeds of happiness. a beautiful film. and a seductive story. a isle. for each searcher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The acting makes it watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shakespeare it ain't, but it's a likable film well-acted. Nobody phones it in. If you can watch the Hallmark Hall of Fame, you can watch and enjoy this. The story is simple and believable (more or less), the script is a bit clichéd, but the characters come to life on screen in spite of that. If you prefer your clichés to be dark Steadicam sequences of mortal combat between dangerous, stylishly-clad characters with switchblades for fingers, or exploding cars, or ancient curses, or primitive monsters wasting their energy roaring into the camera lens rather than scarfing up the hero and heroine, or werewolves turning into zombies, or, for that matter, zombies into werewolves, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seldom comes a film that you can call a masterpiece, yet The Magic of Bell Isle is just that. Its simplicity is what endures throughout the film, especially at a time when most films have computer generated imagery. Far to many films these days never take you away into a simplistic world, yet this one did and that is why i called The Magic of Belle Isle a masterpiece. The acting especially from both Virginia Madsen and Morgan Freeman is second to none, i wont give anything away as i think the audience should experience the film as it is intended. But i will say this The Magic of Bell Isle will be always be in one of my all time top 5 its that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent! Great story, cast and acting! The actors worked together beautifully! Emma Fuhrmann did a great job as "Finn" -- she really made her role come to life. And, of course any movie with Morgan Freeman (Monte Wildhorn/Freeman's acting is exceptional, as always. I don't think I've ever seen a film he's done that I didn't like. ) and Virginia Madsen (Charlotte O'Neil -- beautiful and talented) can't go wrong, they are both such wonderful actors. The story is heart warming and the relationships are real. The movie is inspirational and keeps you entertained throughout. This is a movie that you can watch alone or with others...I wish I could find movies like this to watch all the time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! It is rare for me to write a review about a movie (actually the first time), but this one was so exceptional that I wanted to share my enthusiasm!! I would hope that this movie (and others like it would receive more publicity in mainstream media),but since that is not the case I hope that there will be more hype on the Internet so that more people can enjoy such a superb plot and equally strong acting!I am very disappointed in so called "critics" that had mediocre reviews on this movie. They are probably so use to drugs, sex and murder that when they see something that deviates from that mode they think that there is something wrong. It is amazing the disconnect between critics and casual movie goers. I hope that Hollywood would follow this directors lead and look at feel good movies such as this one! Excellent job and two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even Morgan Freeman could save this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK.....who owed whom the favor that resulted in this film being made? Not even the great Morgan Freeman, whose performance is the ONLY positive thing about this movie, could completely save it. It comes off as a piece written as a college - or maybe even high school - drama class assignment. The writing is just plain bad, the dialog stilted and trite. The plot is predictable. You know 5 minutes into the film exactly how its going to turn out. The characters are caricatures and the casting a disaster. This is the first film I've ever seen where even the great comic Fred Willard didn't make me laugh. This movie was painful to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Belle Isle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I can see that this movie is overpriced due to it's story. Freeman's acting is smooth and it's always a delight to watch a movie with him, but in this case there;s nothing more. As I said, his acting is really smooth and I'd dare to say that I got bored early enough. The feeling which grows among Freeman and Madsen is so out of the blue and totally not believable. There's an awkwardness among them and its like Madsen is afraid to react with such an actor and Freeman on the other hand is just being bored.My 5 star is only for the kids in this movie but that's overall. I wouldn't go to see it at theaters that;s for sure and it's almost sure that it's not going to the Oscars as other reviews saying. It's just a typical Sunday movie, spineless and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I agree with miscasting comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One reviewer talked about the miscasting of Morgan Freeman and Virginia Madsen and I have to agree. Another reviewer also mentioned that many of the issues within the movie were solved too easily and also the idea of Freeman's character being a mentor to a wildly imaginative little girl was implausible, as well.I got the impression that Rob Reiner had to have Morgan Freeman in the role from the get-go and the role did fit him to a tee. Because Virginia Madsen was a strong actress, she was signed on, too. But there was little believable about why there would be a romantic/sexual attraction between the two for any reason. Virginia's character is very vulnerable yes but she is also vital, sexy, beautiful (the scene of her on the roof when Monte first saw her) and a heck of a lot younger than Freeman's character. Then there is the fact of Monte not being able-bodied and I kept thinking through the movie that would be an issue over time, added to the great age gap.The setting of the movie was one of the main characters of the film, bucolic and idyllic so it was easy to fall in love with it. One kept thinking, 'where is the place and how can I get there?' Everything is perfect even Monte's cottage is pristine in its masculine decor. That being said I had so many questions. I wanted to know more about Charlotte's husband, about why did she place her treasure trove on the island and what was written in her diary that caused her eldest daughter to suddenly grow less sulky towards her? I did not feel that the mentally handicapped boy/man was believable. The way Monte transformed him so suddenly just was not credible to me. Then the arrival of the literary agent and the Hollywood star who would solve all Monte's financial woes. Too contrived and if this person was an important star, why make such a questionable journey? Though I may seem too critical, my husband and I enjoyed the film in its generality mainly because they are so few 'feel good' movies anymore. Being an avid movie buff all my life, I am a stickler for plausibility and there were a lot of plot and character holes that could have been realistically plugged. However, if I would have opined that a more mature black woman would have been better cast opposite Freeman and the three girls her granddaughters, would I have seemed racist in my opinion? Now Alfre Woodard would have been my pick overall. Strong,feisty, sexy, mature she'd have been a strong match for Freeman. And more believable, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't quite work out the way it wants to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is obviously not really being a movie with a real point to it but it instead rather wants to be feel-good movie. It however for most part fails as such because of its lacking story, that is lacking any good emotions and handles its characters poorly.The characters actually confused me. First of all, it was a strange thing that at the beginning of this movie the Morgan Freeman character was supposed to come across as a grumpy old man, old Clint Eastwood character-style, so to speak but at the same time he also came across as an humorous and soft guy. It didn't quite resonated with each other and was somewhat confusing to watch. It was as if the film-makers themselves didn't really knew what to do with the character or were too afraid the viewers would distance themselves from the character and this movie if its main character was being purely a grumpy old man, in the first part of it.But also the dynamics between all of the different characters doesn't quite work out well or convincing enough. Why oh why did they had to turn this into a love-story as well? It isn't being a convincing thing anyway that a single mother would fall for a cripple 70-something year old guy and it doesn't exactly gets made believable in this movie either. I would had most definitely preferred it if the movie focused on the friendship between the man and the family instead. The movie was perfectly good and sweet when it did just that and nothing more than just that.The movie also most definitely has some pointless characters in it. What was the point of having Fred Willard in this? And why did there needed to be a mentally challenged character as well, that behaves like an absolute moron, instead of a mentally challenged person. I hate it when a movie does that. It's so offensive! Not just to mentally challenged persons but also the audience in general. Perhaps they though they would get some cheap laughs and drama out of it but I have some news for them; it just doesn't work out very well.Also, the Morgan Freeman character was supposed to be a mentor to one of the young girls and I thought at one point that the movie would entirely become just about that. However, by the end of the movie it doesn't at all feels like he finished teaching the girl everything she needed and wanted to know about writing. The movie definitely feels incomplete when it comes down to some of its story lines. Who knows, maybe an additional 15 or 20 minutes could had improved this movie significantly.It's always a dangerous thing to have young kids playing a significant role in a movie like this. The danger is that these movies tend to get overly sentimental and sappy and it's also risky since children often aren't being the best at acting. But I have to say, as far as all these things for this movie are concerned, it isn't being anything too bad. The kid actors were good, though the writing for them was still definitely lacking.It's hard to care about anything that happens in this movie, since the characters just aren't being handled good and interesting enough and they aren't going through some interesting enough developments and transitions. In that regard this movie truly fails and falls completely flat as a genre movie, though it's not a movie that I hated watching, so I'm still being somewhat mild with my rating for it.Perhaps it was also thanks to the fine actors that appear in this movie. It's never a punishment to watch Morgan Freeman acting in a movie, even when the movie and his character aren't being all that great or interesting.Virginia Madsen also did a great job, as did all of kid actors, like I mentioned earlier on already.Just not the best of most effective genre movie out there. Try again Mr. Reiner!5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Leads but Awfully Silly and Soapy Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Magic of Belle Isle (2012) ** (out of 4) Rob Reiner's latest film thankfully has a couple great performances or else we'd be looking at one of the worst movies of the year. Morgan Freeman plays Monte Wildhorn, a writer who has lost pretty much all of his touch, desire to live and has become a cranky alcoholic. He's sent to a summer home to try and come up with some fresh ideas but he just keeps going deeper into the bottle until he meets his divorced neighbor (Virginia Madsen) and her three daughters. THE MAGIC OF BELLE ISLE is one of the most sentimental movies ever made but it's so poorly directed, edited and written that you can't help but roll your eyes at how stupid it actually is. I don't mind movies trying to make you cry or feel warm but this thing here goes so far overboard that it really did seem like an eight-year-old girl wrote it. The dialogue is beyond bad and for the life of me I couldn't figure out what the film was trying to do. This is the type of film that is so lazily written that you can't help but want to throw your hands up and just give up on the entire thing. Everything in this movie just happens for no apparent reason. Normally you'd have some sort of character development with a mean drunk turning into a nice angel but that doesn't happen here. Instead of giving us situations that we can believe in, the film simply has stuff happen just so the film can move along. Mommy having trouble with the oldest daughter? The problem is easily solved in the matter of seconds. Every "issue" is so easily handled that you can't help but feel the lazy writing is letting everyone down. What keeps the film going are the performances of Freeman and Madsen. Both of them deliver strong performances, although I must say that neither has too much to work with. One wishes that the screenplay had been a little more demanding so that the two really could have had more fireworks together. Thankfully both of them are great enough because otherwise we'd be left with a real mess of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely story, but a little disconcerting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the story idea is sweet, the casting leaves me a bit perplexed.The children are wonderfully cast and fabulous in their given roles, as is Virginia Madsen as their mother.Yes, Morgan Freeman is a genius actor and plays the part well, but the romantic undertone is a little creepy. He is twenty-five years older than Virgina Madsen, who is exceptionally attractive for a fifty-year-old woman, but they do not fit romantically and his character comes off a little pervy for his subtle lusting after her. If the genders were reversed, it would be a total turn-off for the viewer. The continuation of the much older man/younger woman scenario (think "The Bridges of Madison County") is dated and unrealistic.The setting is beautiful and the storyline sentimental, so, overall, it is a solid summer film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like bad magic, this May-December romance is ridiculously contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monte Wildhorn (Morgan Freeman) is a wheelchair bound geriatric man in the twilight of his years who chooses to get away for city life in hopes that it'll cure his writers' block. While there he meets much younger divorcée, Charlotte (Virginia Madsen) who along with her three daughters, warms his jaded, bitter heart.The fact that this movie is well-acted doesn't really make up for the fact that the two leads have little to no chemistry with each other which given what the film is about is pretty counterproductive to its intent. As such this turns into less of a 'feel good' film with romantic leanings and more of a 'feel perplexed' one. Also the obstacles the two need to overcome (for there always has to be obstacles in these kind of films) seemed to be solved way to easily.</fullReview>
