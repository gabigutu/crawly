		<shortDescription>A predictable 9 for The Nines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote this without reading any of the other reviews, mostly cos i didn't want them to influence my own, and partly cos i'm lazy. This was a very interesting film that left some to the imagination and a lot to interpretation (but not too much).The film consists of 3 stories: the first about a house-arrested destructive TV star, the second a TV show writer with a new show in the works and the third a computer game creator stuck in the woods with his family. All three are played expertly by Ryan Reynolds. He is supported by two women, Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy, who are also very good at enforcing the bizarre yet irresistible vision of John August, who has a good track record of writing screenplays, most notably with Tim Burton (it's worth ignoring the Charlie's Angels jobs though). The three leads play different parts in each. That alone should prepare you for the world he has created in The Nines.It is difficult to talk of the story without giving too much away, John August has found a great concept and worked it brilliantly into a interpretable screenplay and image. The world he has created seems very real, with characters that operate in abnormal situations, but ones in which i think we all can relate, given our excessive access to reality TV and celebrity.The direction is good, you know from the very start that the green woollen wristband holds significance, and the witty, experienced, inflective screen writing is a joy (though at times August gives a little more away than is necessary).The film is a fantasy and the nines are a mystery, both collaborating in a way that captures the imagination. The three stories intersect and overlap with themes that confuse and inspire, which will leave many audiences pondering for awhile. But it is not as confusing as it may appear as the plot unfolds fairly intricately to those paying attention. All of the stories hold explanations, and the last explains it all.I saw this with a friend who i wasn't expecting to enjoy it, but surprisingly they did. I giggled, guffawed and gasped, while we exchanged plot ideas and interpretations, throughout. Sometimes it became a little dry, but on the whole this a very well thought out drama mystery thriller with an excellent philosophy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look For The Nines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this movie after looking it up on IMDb. The plot summary said: A troubled actor, a television show runner, and an acclaimed video game designer find their lives intertwining in mysterious and unsettling ways.I thought it sounded interesting, but never did i expect it would be such a thoughtful, intelligent and awe-inspiring experience.At first, I'll be honest, I didn't understand it. It was extremely random and didn't seem to make much sense. It seemed like Ryan Reynolds' character might be a little insane or something, as he played these three different personalities, whose only connection was the people in their lives. But as the movie progressed and I learned more about what 'the nines' actually are, it starts to dawn on you that this movie has a very unique twist.When the whole thing comes together and the big secret is revealed, everything else in the film falls into place. It is very rare for that to happen in a film, especially in such an effective way, and it is a product of fantastic writing. To have the audience realize what the whole movie has been about at that one revealing moment is a great achievement. And it is accomplished in this movie.So don't worry if you have trouble understanding what is going on at first. When you do find out what the movie is about, I guarantee you will experience an "oh i get it now!" kind of feeling.This movie is sensational and subtle at the same time and i recommend it to anyone who wants to have their minds blown!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major spoilers in second half of post.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the premiere in NYC tonight. Ryan Reynolds and one of the producers (Bruce Cohen) spoke beforehand.I thought this film was first-rate. It quite bent my mind. Often after seeing a film that affects me I can't get up from my seat (like most people do) when the credits roll, or even when the credits end (like everyone else does) because I need to process what I have just seen, plus it's hard to bring my self back to reality when a film has taken me to a profound place, like this one did.What I noticed after this film was that practically the whole theater sat in pensive silence until the end of the credits, something I think I've never seen. For me it was stunned silence.I can't see The Nines playing in the big Multiplexes, but no bother. Most of the best films don't.____________________Spoilers start here.____________________I think I understand about 75% of the script, the rest I figure is ambiguous or inscrutable. Here are my takes. I'd love to hear other's:- He is a god (i.e., a "Nine"), not The God, but one of many. For 4,000 years he has been creating Universes for his amusement. He is addicted to doing this. - In each Universe he has a different persona. At some point, he eliminates the Universe and starts another one. (Why doesn't he know Who He Is in each incarnation?) - The 3 recurring characters (Hope Davis, the guy who plays the policeman, and the woman who plays the prostitute) are from his cosmic "world." They are trying to bring him out of his addiction and get him to return "Home," i.e., back to being a celestial being without a body. - I'm not sure of the Melissa McCarthy character(s). She is clearly a human (a Seven) and is very attached to him. She is trying to keep him on earth because she enjoys, loves, needs him. There is a battle between her and the Hope Davis character(s) over keeping him human versus spectral. I think this is why several times Hope tells him "We had to get you away from her," because she (McCarthy) is the embodiment of his addiction to being human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nines Keeps You Guessing Till The Very End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nines tells three short stories, the first of about an actor who is under house arrest after flipping over his car, the second is about a writer who's pilot TV show is in jeopardy and the last deals with a video game designer lost in the woods after his car breaks down. All three stories are told with the same actors.When I first heard about The Nines, everyone was raving about how original it was and how it was like nothing they have ever seen before. So obviously it peeked my interest. After finally watching the film, I can see where it gets it's praise, but don't fully understand why it's getting so much of it. Yes, The Nines is original and keeps you guessing until the very end, but the pay off isn't as good as the rest of the film.This is John August's directorial debut, if you don't know who August is, he's the writer of such films like Big Fish, Corpse Bride and Go. The Nines is another impressive entry to his already good resume. It seems that August was confident enough to tackle this big project. I applaud him ambitions. He didn't fail by any means, but he didn't blow me away either. It is always a love hate relationship when the writer is the director. When it works, you get Pulp Fiction, when it doesn't you get Blade Trinity. When the writer is the director, he knows exactly what he wants, he knows the characters inside out and how to bring everything together. The Nines doesn't seem to fall into either category, it seems to sit on the fence.Ryan Reynolds proves again that he has more range then people give him credit for. He might have painted himself into a corner with Van Wilder and Waiting, but he seems to be slowly breaking free of it. He showed range at the very end of Smoking Aces and in the recent rom com Definitely Maybe. With The Nines he again proves why he is underestimated and will bring greater things in the future. Reynolds plays the lead in all three shorts. We see him as a crack addicted actor, gay writer and family man video game designer. While he doesn't blow you away with his performance, he does manage to capture you and bring you along for the ride from start to finish.Hope Davis appears here in a supporting role, again playing three different characters in all three shorts. She manages to get so much across the screen by doing so little. A look here or move there and you know exactly what she is thinking. Melissa McCarthy plays herself in one segment, I think she had the hardest job. She has to be bubbly, scared, mean and informative.The three segments are all shot differently. The first segment, titled The Prisoner, showcases bright reds and yellows and was shot on 16mm. The second segment, titles reality television is shot on video. The entire segment plays out like a reality TV show as we follow Gavin (reynolds) and his troubles in trying to get his pilot on air. The third and final segment, titled Knowing, is darker and shot on 35mm. The third segment has the same title as the pilot that Gavin in the second segment is writing. Even the same events take place. Without giving too much away, all three segment interconnect with each other. But not exactly in a way you want or think.If you are confused after watching the film, join the club. I knew what happened and sort of got some things, but had to read up on it to see what others thought to finally connect the dots. The films does a very good job of teasing the viewer with bits of information and bringing them along asking questions left right and centre. As the film concludes you sit there wondering if you are satisfied or not. I still do not know really. I like the idea behind the film and the presentation was nice, but the way they dragged us along seemed like it would amount to something bigger, something deeper, something more then what we are ultimately given.The film doesn't answer everything and it doesn't need to. It's a film that leaves it's answers up to the viewer, to make whatever assumptions they want. But even this isn't satisfying enough. I guess because all the hype I head prior, I expected more. If you go into it not knowing anything about it, you will be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Splendid Little Film the Challenges the Mind and Forges New Ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE NINES is a film that may seem like a tough story to follow, but the concept and the 'autobiographical' script by the gifted John August are so fine that once seen, this film demands re-visiting. It is tremendously entertaining, blessed with a superb cast, and offers food for thought far beyond the running time of the film. For this viewer it falls into the 'brilliant' category.More of an existential exercise than a traditional movie tale, THE NINES has the courage to challenge our concept of that is the real world, what is fantasy, what exists beyond our concept of our 'space' here on planet Earth, and just how significant is the current obsession with television reality shows and videogames on the way we are stuck in the present. John August explores these issues by interweaving three stories, using the same actors to change vantages and personalities to raise questions and pose problems for the audience to attempt to resolve. It works.Part I ('The Prisoner') views the life of a famous television personality Gary (Ryan Reynolds) who na?vely takes on a 'crack' trip that results in a house arrest controlled by a jovial officer Margaret (Melissa McCarthy) and whose only outlet is a neighbor Sarah (Hope Davis) with whom he has a seductive affinity: while both women appear real, events occur that make their existence questionable to the crack-addled Gary. In Part II, 'Reality Television', Gavin (Reynolds) is a television writer attempting to get his pilot film accepted by executive boss Susan (Davis), but falls into troubled times when he is told his best friend Melissa (McCarthy) must be dropped from the project. In Part III, 'Knowing', Gabriel (Reynolds) is a gentle video game creator, happily married to Mary (McCarthy) with a daughter Noelle (Elle Fanning) who has been weaving in and out of the film as different characters, gets stuck in a forest and in attempting to seek help encounters Sierra (Davis), a strange woman who finally approaches the possibilities of Gabriel's 'mission on earth'. The title of the movie becomes apparent when Sierra informs Gabriel that while God is a 10, human beings are only 7s, koala bears are 8s because they control the environment, and Gabriel is a 9 - an extraterrestrial being in a human incarnation to test the goodness of the earth. How this information affects Gabriel and how the story is resolved is yet more of the intellectual exercise and joy of THE NINES.Ryan Reynolds is extraordinarily fine in his three roles: he is a far better actor than the usual films he makes would indicate. Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy are as always reliably excellent. But the magic of this film comes form the mind and direction of John August who thankfully gives the audience much to ponder. It is a gem of a film. Highly Recommended.Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant in all aspects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat in the packed Sundance theater watching the final scene of John August's, The Nines, I shuttered. The film had sent chills down my spine, and it lasted into the night. The script was brilliant beyond anything I have ever experienced, the character development between the three parts dissecting the film was astonishing. The metaphorical tie- ins left your mind racing and your imagination spinning. It was not ironic in a sense that it allowed you to contemplate the scenarios that had just unveiled. John August is a brilliant writer and holds himself magnificently in front of the film industry. Ryan Reynolds blew me away and Melissa McCarthy was amazing. The character interaction between them and Hope Davis reflected on the complexity of the dialogue and scene structure. The film is broken into three intertwining sections, serving as "acts" that play into a plot scheme that defies the contemporary and conformist thought of todays screenplay writers.The best to come from sundance this year... by far. John August matches Charlie Kaufman as a writer, and parallels Michel Gondry as a director He is outstanding in himself The film is one to reckon with and hopefully will hit the big screens but last its authentic, rare, independent flavor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See The Nines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is divided in to three acts: "The Prisoner" tells of a troubled actor, Gary, under house arrest living in another person's house because he burned down his own. While living in the house he is befriended by both a P.R. 'handler', Margaret, and the single mom next door, Sarah, who may or may not be interested in him romantically. Over the course of his house arrest, Gary becomes convinced that he is being haunted by the number nine."Reality Television" tells of a television writer, Gavin, trying to get his pilot made. The house he lives in is the house Gary later stays in. During the process of post production and the 'upfronts', a television executive, Susan, pushes for Gary to ditch the unconventional lead actress of his project, Melissa. This segment was somewhat inspired by writer/director John August's own experiences in the television industry."Knowing" tells of an acclaimed video game designer, Gabriel, who is lost when his car breaks down, a situation shown in Gavin's pilot. Gabriel leaves his wife and daughter with the stranded vehicle and meets up with Sierra, a mysterious woman."The Nines" is a film definitely worth watching, just for the weirdness of it and how thought-provoking and unlike any film you've ever seen. It's in the vein of, let's say, "Being John Malkovich" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." This is the film where you won't stop thinking about it and that you'll talk about it with the people who have seen it.It's not a film that you'll forget after the credits start rolling. Now that you get the point, it's time to talk about the movie. Even so, it's hard to describe this movie in words. When you ask people if this movie is good or not, they'll either like it or not, but it's hard to explain their reason and it's hard to explain why I love this.The performance by the three main characters from the three stories, Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy, and Hope Davis, were all fantastic, having themselves to change their personality so much. It's pretty amazing. But of course, the movie will arise more questions than answering them. It's like "Donnie Darko," per se. This should be a cult hit, even though it isn't right now.This is a really weird film and it's hard to explain anything, as you can tell. All I can say is watch it because the way the stories are told, the thought put into all of this, and the strong performances are already some reasons to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting idea but ultimately disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nines has some fantastic ideas and some really rather good performances (Melissa McCarthy is a constant joy throughout and Ryan Reynolds shows an impressive diversity for his acting league) however, after a promising start, loses its way as the story progresses.A film of three distinct parts in a Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) style, The Nines deals with some seriously deep themes including philosophy, theology and betrayal. However, unlike Eternal Sunshine, the direction of John August (writer of Go and Big Fish) seems too straight and, dare I say it, Teen-like for such a film where a better choice of helm would have seem to be someone like David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks) or maybe Darren Aronofski (Pi, The Fountain). As it is the film progressively gets weirder and weirder and with it surrealism jars with the previous tone to the point it feels preposterous.Worth a watch and nice to see someone try something new but ultimately disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Surreal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John August really outdid himself in his directorial debut. We all knew he could write, and now we know that he is one hell of a director. He took risks, and accepted major challenges, including filming out of his own house to save budget. With a cast lead by Ryan Reynolds, who really exceptionally out-did himself, this movie was the best movie nobody has ever heard of.Filmed in three parts, "The Nines" connects the three worlds using a simple, common term...the number 9. Now, this isn't like The Number 23. There are reasons, and there are valid points to why 9 was chosen, and you'll just have to watch the film to figure it out. The result is something very existential and outside the box when it comes to typical cinematic works. The relationships between Ryan Reynolds, Hope Davis, and Melissa McCarthy are so perfectly intertwined, and little Elle Fanning deserves major credit for playing what role she did. (a mute child who has a curious omniscience about her) She's really following in her sister's footsteps to becoming a fantastic actress.This film did not get the credit it deserved in the theaters. Let's make sure it does on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I saw at Sundance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a "9" This was the best movie I saw at Sundance Film Festival. An extremely creative script broken into three smaller stories where the actors play three sets of different roles... or do they?Spoiler Alert!This movie encompasses Psychology, Metaphysical multi-dimensional Theory, personal philosophy, and Theology. As a Seminarian, I loved this movie. It demonstrates an image of God that is believable but challenges most religions view of the omni-present, omni-loving, and omni-powerful God. It begs the question and reminds you of the song title, "What if God was one of us?"Practically, this movie is three smaller stories all brought together when the secret is revealed. The first segment is a Comedy, the second a reality TV series, and the third a Drama. When the third segment starts you're ready to get serious, and delightfully surprised.I gained a new respect for Ryan Reynolds as an actor, you fall in love Melissa McCarthy, and in the all is well with God... and all is well with us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Underrated, overlooked, under-appreciated.Ryan Reynolds has yet to let me down, he's always been excellent, you can tell he has passion in his roles and this is no exception.Melissa McCarthy did excellent, her portrayal of her character is spot on, makes me wonder why she isn't given more quality roles, she has potential Any film Hope Davis is in has always been good, she knows how to pick her roles.This film is a bit confusing, complicated, and you might need to search for some information afterward, but it's a solid film.The only advice I could give without spoiling the film is to pay close attention to the ending of each chapter in the film, in particular, what is decided.I enjoy films that bend the rules, thought-provoking films that allow for creativity to seep through the screen into your own life. Artistic and creative, the possibilities in life and/or the meanings of life are endless, so it's great some films focus on something other than the normal linear perspective.If you enjoy any of the actors listed, or sci-fi, or under-appreciated films, check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not spoil the movie for anyone. I watched this film last night. This is a film that is worth renting and watching. It has a Donnie Darko flavor to it and is very interesting. The script is solid and very intelligent, as well as the acting. There are three different movies all linking up into one movie about creation in my opinion. All three films contain the same characters, it is just that the roles interchange and do not make sense until the end of the movie. The film begins as almost a comedy and turns into a thriller so just be aware of this and do not get turned off too early. I give this a 7 (as opposed to 9) for a truly unique film with a solid cast. This one is worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's not metaphysics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-- possible spoilers --Seeing all the comments, I was just wondering if I'm the only one seeing this film differently. In my mind, there's a much simpler perspective to this film than the 'metaphysical' one. I think it is all about writing. The protagonist is the Writer, and what we see is a clever unfolding of the creative process. Writers tend to fully live and inhabit the world they are creating, at least at the time of the creative process. If you watch the film through this perspective, all the references and happenings fall into place. The god-like protagonist, his relationships with the characters - especially the painful parting -, etc, etc. Having said that, it's a great film, and even its indecisive filming tone falls nicely into place when you finally get to realize what is it that you're watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movies suffers from one major flaw, it goes from being a really good movie to a really bad movie and back again. During the times when this movie was good was when it wasn't trying too hard to explain things. However when the explanations come, the movie becomes a exercise in patronization. Apart from these flaws and a musical number during the first act in the film, this film is pretty good. Sometimes I think these type of movies are made for the purpose of making people feel more intellectual than they really are. Nonlinear mysterious stories such as this one deserve more than what this movie has to offer. This movie had so much potential and in the end I'm left wondering what might of been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost in John August surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary (Ryan Reynolds) is a troubled actor who plays a cop on the TV show Crim9 Lab. While on crack, he crashes his car. His perky publicist Margaret (Melissa McCarthy) takes care of him while he's under house arrest. He gets involved with his Canadian next door neighbor Sarah (Hope Davis). He leaves his house and meets deaf little girl Noelle (Elle Fanning) at a bus stop but then she disappears. Strange things keep happening and there is something about him belonging to the Nines. Then Part One ends and Part Two Reality Television begins where the actors play different characters.The first part has some interesting surreal aspects. It suggests a pretty weird but compelling story. It lacks the surreal visual style to match but some of that is the everyday problem of the low budget indie. Then the second part of the movie comes and the story stumbles. The disruption is too much. The third part starts off with some interest because its title is Knowing. However the explanation is too convoluted to understand or even to follow. I question whether it's even understandable. This is John August trying to write like Charlie Kaufman. He fumbles the ball which the director John August had no chance of recovering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the whole point of that movie was to leave you in the dark, it certainly did its job. When I saw it on netflix with the great cast that it has I was excited for it! But it just seems like this movie doesn't know what it wants to be! It starts out a drug like hallucination, then starts of in the comedy direction. It gets a little horror movie, a little scifi and none were really that enjoyable. The whole world of this movie was just confusing and rather overwhelming. Not one that brings whimsy to your mind or makes you want to jump in. It doesn't really give a point of why we should care for this protagonist at all either. This movie just did not have me interested, though it seems like it would have a better premise as a novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A troubled actor, a television show runner, and an acclaimed video game designer find their lives intertwining in mysterious and unsettling ways.The Nines are gods. The eights are koala bears. Humans are sevens. The plot was ludicrous, and I say that with passion. The build-up and suspense was pretty good, but the film never builds towards anything but things we haven't already seen before. I saw THAT with confusion because although the film can be considered "original" it's originality has been done before, albeit the twist... So instead of putting it to the point by telling you it's not good, I'm going to list nine reasons why the film doesn't do it:1. Plot holes. Every movie suffers from these, but the Nines contains so many it's hard to count. Maybe the director thought it was a good idea to place NINE plot holes to make the film more unique. No.2. Donnie Darko. Yeah, the movie is so identical, it's hard to put it into words. Although the Nines is a much worse film, Donnie Darko at least contained some good into it. 3. Trying to be unique. It must of been a long, long night for the writers to think of this crap. I mean the twist is silly, and the whole numbers thing was just stupid. I know, movies are movies, but movies need to learn to make more sense too. And don't get me started over the three intertwined stories, that wasn't unique...4. The Sims. I think this was the director's motivation. 5. Complications. This is what annoyed me the most, sort of. Unique films are confusing, yes, but the Nines takes this idea and shreds it to pieces. It uses confusion in order to pace the film correctly, and ends up leaving us feeling like dumb people. But truth is, the writers are.6. Story is too draggy and boring. Now although the film wasn't the worst, I was seriously questioning the prolonged scenes. I got the point the first time, only followed by more minutes to fill in the film. 7. Artsy. This may tie in with unique factor, but the film tries too hard to become something it's not. If the twist was more relevant to the story, maybe the film would succeed coming off a different way. But this way, it failed... 8. Ryan Reynolds. Yeah, yeah, lame excuse. But I don't like him nor his characters he depicts. Me and him just have a hate/hate relationship, but he made the film worse than it needed to be. 9. The ending. Yeah, the ending was bad. Not because it wasn't satisfying, but because is didn't make any sense and it was just.. Bad.The movie is bad. 4/10.</fullReview>

A truly awful film in every sense.A film should have a story line that makes sense and not be arty for the sake of being arty. I mean at what point did the actors read the script and goes "Hmmm that makes sense on so many levels...I must put my name to that".

		<fullReview>This film should have been titled Cutesy Wootsy, Trendy Wendy and the Faux Boho Wannabe. Although the premise of the script was quite interesting, it was presented as a self gratifying homage to the annoying world of Hollywood cell phone attachment and nouveau cuisine addiction. Sorry, after years of being there I dropped out and have realized how much better my life is now that I avoid those horrible impolite and self-centered people. However, if you like that kind of thing then this film could really tickle your pleasure center, and I'm sure it does the trick for some people, just not me. Consider this review a polite warning for those that dislike the exciting fast paced world of obnoxious California Feral Swine.</fullReview>

Having just watched 'The nines', Im left feeling upset that i invested, just over an hour and a half of my Sunday afternoon watching and scratching my head over a ludicrously over- complicated piece of nonsense that goes nowhere fast and then has the cheek to be described as a 'Intense psychological thriller'. I do not wish to sound rude or negative but this film is very poor and even on a basic level it just doesn't cut the mustard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really like what did I just watch? "A God is 10, and you are nine"!! The concept was interesting, Reynolds failed to deliver and so did the scriptwriters. I found the movie dragging the whole thing way too long. It could easily have been a short film of 15 minutes and I think that would have been more interesting as half of the movie isn't even connected to the plot anyway. Ryan Reynolds have come a long way since this movie as I watched his recent performances in Buried and Deadpool.I gave this a four star rating because the concept was interesting and as a video game designer and artist I can relate to the fact that creating a world inside a computer and working on it and making rules for that world, does feel like a little God. So yeah that concept is interesting in some ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat fresh concept - Gets boring at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies which scatter all the pieces and in the end all of them start fitting together into something beautiful. So as expected the best parts of the movie are towards the end but what 'The Nines' lacks is that these pieces get pretty dull and boring at times. One cannot watch an entire 90+ minutes movie just for a pleasing end and exploration of concept. When done with the movie i got that 'not worth it' feeling with a mixture of dissatisfaction for a good concept been wasted.Should you watch it? Yes, it is watchable.If the story ended in a way where it left the movie open to various interpretations (a presentation very much possible with this one) and left the audience in surprise and with questions, would have been more appropriate than the usual happy family ending. A Donnie Darko end with a sad mysterious feeling could have added great quality to the movie.I had a feeling that i was watching a sitcom the entire time with Ryan Reynolds in it. Give me that movie feel and add one more star but for this its 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have always been people how want really badly to be artists but being aware they are not blessed with sufficient amount of true inspiration they all fall to the same old strategy: if I make something without any point what so ever people will think they are stupid for not seeing the (missing) point, will be embarrassed to admit it and will pretend my work is a masterpiece. Dear Author, please do go through the history of art. From all those pieces, defying oblivion for hundreds and thousands of years, there is not a single one whose value cannot be recognized by literally everyone regardless of culture, education, upbringing. A true piece of art does not have to be liked by everybody but it "speaks" to everybody whatever may be the level of their understanding, evokes emotions (good or bad it doesn't matter) and demands respect. The only feeling a true piece of art does not leave a single consumer with is - waste of time. And so eager to be original... You either are or not. If you have to think real hard to come up with something "different" just accept it - you are not. Yet among all that hard thinking a "masterpiece metaphor": numbers floating above people's heads, 9 literally bigger than 7s... What was that!?!?!? Just... what... That said, hats off to Hope Davis, Ryan Reynolds and Melissa McCarthy. It's far easier to prove yourself in a good movie with a strong story than in this... Good good work!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranormal Activity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Placed under house arrest, a television actor with drug problems starts experiencing strange and paranormal occurrences in this unusual thriller from 'Big Fish' and 'Corpse Bride' screenwriter John August. The title refers to the fact that, among other things, the actor seems to be plagued by the number nine in the form of dice roles, mousetraps set in his house, newspaper advertisements and so on. It is an undeniably intriguing premise, and one for which not a lot more can be said without ruining a fresh experience, but it can safely be said that the film is a triumph of mood and atmosphere. The film is divided into three chapters and the first is both suspenseful and unsettling as we are given little in the way of exposition. The final two chapters pale by comparison as more and more clues are dropped regarding the twist, but an ample amount of thought-provoking dialogue keeps things afloat. Several curious ideas abound such as "what life needs (is) a reset button" and a notion that actors don't "really exist" if nobody is watching them. A young pre-'Somewhere' Elle Fanning gives an excellent performance too that mostly comes out in the third chapter. Some have commented that the solution to the central mystery is underwhelming, and perhaps it is, but the personal identity issues that surface in the course of the film reaching its conclusion are endlessly absorbing. Reading about the film afterwards is also just as interesting; apparently August regards the movie as semiautobiographical, inspired by a part of his life in which he actually began to lose his grip on reality!</fullReview>

Her pain and dreams are so intense that she creates another world, where she is important, famous and mother at the same time. But all of this has a high cost, each price showed in each chapter. Ryan is the crack itself: he is her best friend, her lover and her husband. When he goes away her imaginary world comes to an end: she is cured. The movie just shows us what her mind creates while she tries to get rid of the power of the drug, the crack. What does Ryan think of all this? He is God, such is the power of the drug. He created Melissa's world and He has the power to destroy it when she is cured.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must watch for the fans of David Lynch. There are enough enigmas within enigmas to reel your mind. It starts with a troubled actor, played with Ryan Reynolds being sentenced to house arrest. There are two other characters. One is Melissa, his publicist. The second is Hope Davis, his sexy neighbor. He slowly begins to realize that something is wrong. The segment ends on a mysterious note. Then the second part begins with Reynolds essaying the role of a TV show writer/creator wherein he again encounters the same characters essaying different roles. The last segment has him playing a video game designer. All the three segments are related to each other in "deeply mysterious" ways. There are hints given about number nine and the connection of Ryan to the number. I can't help but marvel about Reynolds' acting prowess. With the awesome Buried and this he has totally broken through the facade of an actor who could do only vulgar comedy. Hope Davis and Melissa, particularly the latter, are very impressive. The direction by August is good and the viewer is hooked till the end. The movie falters a bit at the denouement but still the viewing experience is above average. 3 out of 5 for the Nines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A troubled actor, a television show runner, and an acclaimed video game designer find their lives intertwining in mysterious and unsettling ways. Gary, an actor who plays a cop on television, uses too much lighter fluid when he burns his ex-girlfriend's things, then he drinks and drives, uses crack, and crashes his car. He sobers up in jail and is placed under house arrest and the watchful eye of a publicist, the cheery and tough-minded Margaret. She moves him into the empty house of a writer who's away in Canada on a shoot. Gary meets Sarah, an attractive and seemingly-willing neighbor. His friendship with Margaret blooms and strange things happen: he finds notes he doesn't remember writing, he hears noises, and he seems to bump into himself in the kitchen. Two remaining chapters reveal what's going on. The film doesn't answer everything and it doesn't need to. It's a film that leaves it's answers up to the viewer, to make whatever assumptions they want. The Nines is a superb intelligent philosophical film that I recommend to anyone who wants to see an intelligent film.</fullReview>

It's hard to say what this film's about without spoiling it, so I'll just say watch it and open your mind to the very edges of your mind's horizon. The movie is cut into 3 parts all containing the same actors, who play different roles in each part. It ties together in the end very nicely. The concept is pretty magical.Advice: If you read gossip mags, idolise the Kardashians, watch programs like Big Brother or anything on ITV you'll hate this movie as there's not enough glitter.

		<fullReview>Description: Fantasy and reality collide in a cinematic conundrum, which ponders the bonds between a writer and his creations, intertwining three narratives starring the same actors in different and sometimes overlapping roles. A troubled television star is placed under house arrest with his publicist, but a next door neighbour hints at a covert plot revolving around the number 9. Meanwhile, writer Gavin Taylor makes a pilot of his new TV show with his best friend in the lead role, only for a television executive to throw a spanner in the works. Then, a video game designer and his wife break down in the woods with their young daughter and must make tough choices to survive.On the surface The Nines appears to be an anthology film. It ostensibly tells the story first of a down-on-his-luck actor (Ryan Reynolds) confined to house arrest after a drug binge, and then about a scriptwriter (Reynolds again) who has to ditches an actress friend from his planned TV series in order for the show to go ahead. In the third and final segment Reynolds is a loving husband whose family gets stranded by the side of the road and he has to find a cell phone signal to call a tow truck.The same actors appear over and over again as different characters in the seemingly unrelated stories which is of course a clue that the various stories and their layers of meaning are all connected somehow as the viewer will come to suspect. However, to be honest the way in which they are connected is a bit of a cheat ? a metaphysical sleight of hand that veers the movie straight into sci-fi territory, probably Philip K. Dick country . . .The ending may a cop out, but The Nines is still an intriguing enough directorial effort by John August, who supplied the screenplays for movies such as The Corpse Bride, Titan AE and Big Fish. The Nines reminds one a bit of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that there is an autobiographical undertone to The Nines. One gets the feeling that the film is actually inspired by real events in the screenwriter's life, whereas most of today's movies seem to be complete impersonal fabrications.Altogether a brilliant film that captivates the true essences of fantasy drama. This film is definitely not for everyone, and many people will find it boring and confusing. But for those who watch it the first time, and don't understand it. I strongly suggest to watch it again. You will notice things you didn't notice the first time around.</fullReview>

However, independent film aficionados will likely be delighted by this movie. There is absolutely nothing I would change about this movie-- nothing that could have been improved even slightly (and that is saying a lot). The acting, writing and directing were outstanding, with the main characters each playing three different roles convincingly. I found this film stirring, touching, frightening, and hilarious in parts. And most importantly, extremely profound. For weeks afterward, the questions about life that this movie brings up will haunt you.</fullReview>

As with all good films with a meaning I found myself asking questions toward the end (which is sometimes a good thing), such as how virtuous am I? The quote near the end along the lines of fixing what was created was personally poignant, each scene beautifully shot, the middle section a little flat however the ending more than made up for this. It is a film I will leave for a while and watch again for times when life seems to have no meaning. If you want action and popcorn then stay well clear.... if you want a philosophically sophisticated film then I can think of few better! I have to give this 9 out of 10... no doubt the sixes amongst you will give a little less!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing puzzle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting that you some people thought this got worse as it got along, because it was the absolute opposite for me. I thought the first part was a little dull but I was hooked in by the end of it and I only got more and more curious as the film went on. John August did a very impressive job here as writer/director, successfully making three sections distinct in tone and character while also having them work together as a collective whole. This was helped by a superb performance from Ryan Reynolds, who crafted three individual characters who all felt genuine and unique, while also having them be believable as one primal being. The film as a whole was wildly entertaining and contained some very intriguing messages about identity, obsession, power and spirituality. The connections through the stories craft a wonderful puzzle, constantly having you wonder what's actually going on and what it all means.One of the more surprising things after seeing the film, for me, was that people seem to be so confused by it. Again, going the opposite way, I found the film to be a great puzzle but the "what it all means" scene was actually too laid out. I think the whole exposition scene giving us all the answers really spoon-fed the audience and that the film would have benefited more by not giving us the answers so plainly. I've seen a decent amount of people complaining about how confusing it all is, but one of my few complaints is how plainly and easily it was explained in the end. Because for the most part it was a unique, intelligent and very mind-bending puzzle.</fullReview>

You really see the struggles and victories of each character in a much more vivid form.I dig movies that require thought from their audiences.

		<fullReview>Here's what I came away with: The universe is nothing more than a story running through God's mind. We are characters that it has dreamed into existence, and we exist solely at it's whim, just as a writer creates characters, moves them around, changes plots until he/she has come away with something satisfactory. God decided to inject itself into this particular story, as it sometimes does. Hope Davis' character felt to me like God's subconscious, telling it to leave the story, that it ends up causing more trouble than not when it involves itself in the plot (indictment on the various prophets that have come and gone and maybe on organized religion as a whole?). I'll admit that I haven't taken the time to explore all the possible metaphors or even to substantiate the ones that I've drawn, but it just all came together for me personally in the final scene when the universe unraveled (yet again, for the umpteenth gazillion time, one presumes) and then burst forth again as a new story line in God's mind. And I thought to myself, before I even realized/remembered the song from the first scene, "Is that all there is?".This movie touched me very deeply. I thought it articulated some difficult/heavy concepts in a really subtle, honest way, and I while I felt that the entire film was very well cast, I thought that Ryan Reynolds was brilliant (never thought I'd attach that adjective to his name).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always knew Ryan Reynolds was a God.But in this one, he plays God (like a literal, actual God) into three parts. There's Gary, a TV star who is under house arrest after he accidentally sets his house on fire. And then there's Gavin, a TV writer struggling to keep his show "Knowing" on the air. Finally, we have Gabriel. A character in Gavin's TV show trying to get a signal from his phone after his car broke down.Trust me, all is not it seems with this film. Its all so complicated it even challenges the complicated-ness and intricacy of the hit TV show "Lost". But from what I understand, Ryan Reynolds is a multi-dimensional being literally playing a God who can create worlds and play different characters. Despite the fact that the plot gives "Lost" a run for his money, it actually kinda clicked with me.Maybe it was Ryan Reynolds' acting or maybe the flow of the story. I liked it a lot. John August, who is best known as a screenwriter, weaves these three tales in a harrowing epic in galactic proportions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie didn't get a lot of attention, but its weird enough nature made me curious enough to watch it.I have to say, it's one of the most intriguing movies I watched lately. I hate to watch most of the Hollywood films and being able to predict with 95% accuracy of what's going to happen. Now here is one movie that keeps you guessing till the end and still maintains a highly coherent and intricate plot. I would say it has a bit of Mulholland Dr. in it minus the 100 unanswered questions. This does not mean that everything will be laid out for you on a platter, but you will have to race back and forth in your mind to connect the dots during the film. Then, sleep on it one night and it might all come together. If you ever played role-playing games like WOW you will find yourself in a strangely familiar place, a little flashback of Dj? Vu. John August, an amateur of WOW or Everquest? More likely than not, as he depicts with eerie precision the states of mind of an RPG addict, cleverly sneaking in a familiar soundtracks and points of view.Weather you like playing games or never played one before I guarantee you will be glued to the screen till the end. With really honest performances by the whole cast, this movie is definitely as good of a watch as any highly praised movie out there. Too bad half of the Hollywood cr?me won't get it and it will most probably pass under the radar like most movies that use at least 1% of your processing ability.</fullReview>

It is a true jigsaw puzzle of a movie and will leave you scratching your head and wanting more.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough but ultimately disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this a 6 because it is actually quite good fun and entertaining, but it is not the intellectual exercise that some here seem to think it is. The film is divided into three parts and of the three the first part is the only one that is entertaining and gives you some mystery. The way the first part ends, however, just does not make any sense. Why does the world disappear when the 'being' steps back over the line? There is just no need for such dramatics. The second part is where they use metaphors to explain what exactly is going on, not that it needs it once the world disappeared. If you have a functioning brain you could have figured it all out from there. The absurd floating numbers at the end of Part 2 and the fairly explicit explanation from Melissa totally dispel whatever mystery might remain, for everyone surely but the most hard of thinking. The third part is just totally pointless. Reynolds is supposed to be a video game designer in this part, but nothing is actually made of this which renders the whole subterfuge pointless. The actor and the writer were given some prominence but not the video game creator, which is about as close as you could get to the god process. With the 3 parts you get a comedy, followed by a documentary, followed by a piece of cod philosophy. The writer then denies that the 9s are actually gods by implying that there is a 10. The numbers are just stupid, because if they are suggesting that humans are 7s and koala bears are 8s (so what are tricking dolphins and mice then? (yes Douglas Adams did it better)) and then the very next beings up are the creators of the universe who are 9s, suggests that there is nothing in between. So you go from a telepathic teddy bear to the creators of the universe in 1 number, not very imaginative then. One final point, the character played by Melissa, who is of course a 7, knows all about the 7s and the 9s and even the putative 10. How come? Did a careless 9 tell her all this? Worth seeing, maybe. Worth any intellectual capacity, not a chance. I am, of course, an atheist so all of these god type movies, like Lucy, leave me with a hugely stretched credulity. The real universe is much more awe-inspiring than any religious type mumbo-jumbo or meandering cod-philosophy could render.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of reviews here are undeservedly harsh. "The Nines" has a fresh and unsettling strangeness that reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock's stuff in the Sixties. A lot of people just HATED Hitchcock then because he refused to follow the herd and churn out more of the same feel-good, cookie-cutter movies.Like Christopher Nolan's movies, this one requires extra effort on the viewers part. It's not a terrific movie. But, it's not terrible either. It's well worth watching if just to mull over the big "what if" idea. That's what I watch movies for, to leave with something, something I didn't have a few hours earlier.There is a clip from the claymation movie, "The Adventures of Mark Twain" that meshes very well with, "The Nines". The bit was written by the great Mark Twain. (You can find the clip online.) I wonder if the clip inspired "The Nines"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all,I need to say it was a good movie,not excellent in my opinion.My vote was a 8 because of Ryan's acting which was pretty amazing,like all of his roles.People tend to say it's an amazing movie,with a subliminal message that many of us don't get it.------After half an hour,I thought I'm stupid and I don't get that message,just to realize it wasn't one.So,my point is if you don't like the movie don't start thinking that you're no capable to understand this movie.------It is not a movie that needs to be fully understood,the story it's nice,I got to admit,but not what I expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 7's review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, my vote is not 7 because I'm a human! Second of all, my vote would have been 9 if there weren't two flaws in the movie. But overall it's a pretty interesting movie. On my 30 ears on this planet (that I did not create :D) I've seen a lot of strange movies so I'm not too much impressed but the movie is indeed based on a good and original idea.About those 2 flaws:1) the middle part, with the reality show. I was bored out of my mind. Some pretentious new yorkers living their petty little lives. I did not care about them.2) the balance of the mysteries was not right. One one hand there was Melissa who was a part of his world, clearly, because she stayed but we did not learn much more about her. On the other hand I would have enjoyed more elaborate scenes about the overlapping worlds, for example the guy bumping into himself and more like this.You know it's really hard to express my feelings about the movie, so my apologies if my review makes no sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solving this puzzle just requires you to watch it till everything falls into place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nines was a movie I procured after looking at a list of Ryan Reynold movies, and reading its synopsis, all at IMDb. Another preconception (why are these often considered inherently invalid?) was that the movie was made with a million dollar budget.Therefore, expecting a drama of nearly un-watchable proportions, I was pleasantly surprised at finding a movie that left you confused for 4/6ths of its length, before revealing a missing piece that you initially discount as subversive babblings meant to throw you off the plot. It is only 5/6th of the way through (halfway through the Third Act of the Three-Act movie)that it is all conclusively put together.I've read other reviews on this site, and they range from comparing the movie to some of David Lynch's offerings, to praising it effusively for its intellectual candyfloss and performances, and others, finding it a tantalizing puzzle that barely gets put together by the end.I wrote this review simply because I found myself sharing almost none of the views espoused by the other reviews I'd read, apart from the fact that this movie was worth watching, and definitely captured you as an audience. Instead, I found the movie impressively satisfying by holding as unimaginable, yet, identifiable (yes, we all can) a premise as it did.No grey matter was exercised, apart from what goes into trying to puzzle the first 5/6ths out. The revelation at the end is unexpected, yet so readily visceral that the jarring truth never makes you scoff, or think back and make connections that make you feel smart. No, sir. There are no obscure, semi-pretentious David Lynch themes of male violence and Hollywood's effect are detectable here - no mouthing "what was the film maker trying to say" at the end.Quite pleasantly surprised that such a solipsistic concept was being handled by such a major motion picture, I quickly remembered it was a small budget movie I'd just seen. Thus, I find found The Nines a near perfect mix of an intellectual script and mass entertainment, never dumbing down its intricacies, nor fanning the (let us admit it) self-adulating fire of the intelligentsia. Rather, you are moved by the performances on screen, silently applauding the elegant but not verbose prose of writer, and controlled scope from the director (one and the same here - John August). Ryan Reynolds, my draw to the movie, did a spectacular job portraying his three characters in the three part movie, and despite his good looks, let you feel like a part of the three protagnist-s. Melissa McCarthy was also riveting - with her character alternating between something almost impish in its deviousness, a loving mother and wife, and a best friend. ************* SPOILER AHEAD *************I must say the manner in which The Nines dealt with number nine was quite subtle, and I wish more big budget Hollywood movies would try this trick of a name that leaves you guessing about its significance nearly throughout, and then, even after revealing it, makes you wonder about its veracity till it bludgeons you with its reality. The movie certainly is not flawless, but quite entertaining nonetheless. The character of Hope Davis is one that is perhaps the least fleshed out by the end, and leaves you wondering what near omnipotent and omnipresent beings are doing being so jealous. Also, if Ryan is just one of the gods - why is he SO required back home?If Ryan Reynolds is a god, or perhaps Gabriel, it makes you wonder what exactly he's doing being a normal, almost suburban human. After all, are his forays through his avatars' interpersonal relationships actually helping shape the/his world for the better? Is the "human factor" really being made clear to him by his time spent as first a crack addict, a brilliant self-obsessed but weak-willed screenwriter, and a loving family man? While the writer seems to think so, I'd find that time being spent as both the common man, and as one of the prime movers of human society, would be important, and is a missing portrayal of the human- universe creating god at his uncertain best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does anyone agree with this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some of the perceptions and thoughts on the movie but no one seems to think what I think. This whole thing will be a spoiler, so do not read this if you haven't seen the movie.Basically, I think the writer of the movie is a 9, and is also the main character of the movie. All the other characters in the movie are 7s, because they are only fictional characters he's created.So, in real life, outside of this movie, the creator/writer of the movie is a 9, which also makes his character in the movie a 9... The God who created this writer, also outside of this movie, is a 10, as they suggest in the film... and all the others are 7s because as I've said they are fictional made up characters.After re-writing how he wants this story to go many many times (90 times as the film suggests), the writer realizes he's living in a fantasy world, and at the end of the movie he realizes he has to end it, because he's missing out on life outside of writing.But he has trouble leaving because he's addicted to his 'favorite' character in his story (the shorter chubby woman).The blonde woman in the movie, I would think is his real life wife, trying to pull him away from writing, and from his love for his favorite fictional character. Which is why she is also portrayed as a 9, because she is not a fictional person. She's his wife, trying to write her way into the story to snap him back to reality.So when he does he kills off the world, in a sense, and leaves it with the happy ending of his favorite character living a happily married life, with the writer's fictional child.The shorter woman, 'his favorite character', also mentions that he's been talking to her for 25 years, So maybe he's been writing for 25 years, trying to work on the ultimate story involving her.That's my opinion anyway. If I'm right I don't understand why they had 3 stories... My only guess would be that they were just giving examples of how in depth all of his stories were, and how he'd get so absorbed in them he'd lose track of reality, And of course they didn't want to go through and show 90 stories, so 3 summed it up. Feedback much appreciated!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally unique concept, presented very well. View it for a different experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Reynolds is the nominal star, and he does very well playing 3 distinctly different roles. As does Melissa McCarthy of "Gilmore Girls" fame. As does Hope Davis.This is a movie that can't readily be explained on paper, or on a computer screen, in any meaningful manner. It is an approximately 90 minute movie, which consists of three distinct approximately 30-minute segments. Each is different and the actors play distinctly different people. But they are all connected in a way that only becomes clear at the end.I like it a lot. It is a totally different concept, looking at an alternate reality that as far as I can tell has not been explored before on film. It gets your mind going, my wife and I were totally immersed in the story. Our attention never wavered, and that is why we see movies, mostly to be entertained. We were. But viewers who like to see movies more casually, without thinking too hard, probably would not like this.Major Spoilers follow. The key to understanding the movie is one of the three characters that Reynolds plays. He is a renowned game creator, and one of the episodes we see is actually the characters in his game. But he has gotten so involved that he has also entered his game, and has lost touch with what is "game" and what is reality. His characters plan an "intervention" to get him back to his real life. But they take a chance also because in the wink of a thought he could erase all of them. The title comes from the explanation that people are "7s" and God is a "10", but Reynolds' character is a "9", an almost god-like person in relation to his game creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off this is not a great movie, but it is a really good movie. It has a really underrated story line. considering all the crap that comes out of Hollywood that's well suited for a plastic cup at Mac Donald's but sucks ass when you go see it. Its nice to see something that doesn't just go out and seek mass appeal and really tries to tell a new story. It has a few points during the movie that seem made for TV such as the car crash scene which may actually make sense to a crack head.( if you haven't seen the movie this does actually happen after they smoked crack, I'm not just being sarcastic). Overall this is an incredibly unique movie that doesn't try to mimic anything else out there. I would have given this a 10 based on all the dialog post movie we had about it, but I think the 9 I gave it is fitting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I did watch this film pretty much for Ryan Reynolds, the majority of roles I have seen him in he does leave him as the romantic lead or an all out wise cracking, smart alec maybe with some action thrown in, not that there's anything wrong with that, he does it well. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised with him in this, he showcased the ability to diversify and I enjoyed his performance. I feel that he had great chemistry with Mellisa McCarthy, so much so the end couple of scenes reduced to me to tears. Having just watched the film and all I can say is that I was blown away... Whilst it was complicated and left me guessing at what could be going on I do feel that as the film progressed it did do a good job of explaining. This film was utterly brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to be kinda open minded to watch this movie. i can't recall that movie when there are many universes, but this is like it. He is kind of like god, he created many worlds, if you wanna call it that, 90 versions of it. It is a beautiful film, I got it in so many ways! This film does have a meaning, many of them. To get the full experience turn off the lights, and pay attention. I left the film for about 4 hours to take a break and go over what I learned. If you take breaks and understand what you just learned then it's great. I'd love to think that it's about teaching people a lesson not to use crack. And to love life as it is. One other one is keep your mind open that there might be a different universe out there, maybe even 90 of them? This movie is one of my favorites because it was confusing the first 40 minutes, but you begin to realize the factors that the movie is trying to tell you, it's inspirational. Way to go Ryan Reynolds! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting to give this a lower score than the average IMDb score. I was pleasantly surprised to have not. This movie is really a joy to watch. Sure the plot is pretty silly (and we get the hint the writer's know that as well {koala's are 8's}). But, that doesn't really kill the movie.The film really works on its own as a set of different short stories. Each time you see one playing out, you get hooked in. This happens three times in the movie. Its also nice that all of the stories do get put together in a somewhat clever way in the end (although not too clever). In a way, the film works the same way that Donnie Darko works. It has some really great scenes interlinked by an interesting (but not too clever) science fiction premise. Its a really good formula and is executed well here.The other thing great about the movie structure is we get to see the actors play out multiple roles in the same movie. Its kind of an out of viewer experience when this happens. This makes it more apparent that you aren't watching real people, only a movie. I kind of like that feeling every once in a while.The bad things about the movie are the special effects and the acting of some the characters (as well as some bad lines).Even though it isn't a 9, it made an 8. And that is as good as a koala, which is a compliment no matter which way you turn it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I value these sorts of complex constructions.But I got into this appreciation because I believe that they can greatly increase the power of the storytelling. When we have a case where there is clever machinery but no power, I have to examine my assumptions.The machinery in this case is three stories played by the same actors that overlap in time and space, where two characters have influence over a story from a different story. Finally there is a fold where a narrative stance is created outside all three (actually three plus a tiny extra one at the end). Extra cleverness has all three stories involving film professionals trying to shape stories like the ones we see and having troubles. This is my backyard, understanding these devices and how they work.But here, not of the power that could come from this connects with the actual humans involved. I believe this is the fault of the writer/director who is a far better writer than a filmmaker. Simple as that.Or is it?Cleverness when paraded as the engagement strategy rather than supporting technique is bound to seem sterile, an exercise, an excuse for not understanding the human soul.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reynolds in top form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nines tells the story of Gary, Gavin, and Gabriel with each character given a specific segment in the film. The first segment tells the story of Gary, an actor who has more than a few issues. The second introduces us to Gavin as we're given a reality TV show look behind the scenes as he tries to get his show onto the air. The final segment is about Gabriel, a married man who designs video games. All of the segments are related and focus around the number 9. Discovering the truth about these characters and what they really are is what really makes the film worth watching.I had been wanting to see this for awhile and I finally got around to seeing it today. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be. I haven't seen a film tie together multiple segments like this in a long time. Everything comes together quite well and it's pretty satisfying once all the cards are put on the table. Ryan Reynolds proves once again that his acting is quite strong and has more to him than being the casual funny man. Melissa McCarthy is also worth mentioning. She starts off being kind of irritating, but turns out being incredibly charming once the credits roll. Hope Davis was the last piece of the puzzle and is crucial to the overall story. At first, she just seems like the typical jealous and conniving female character who didn't get what she wanted. As the film progresses, however, her role becomes more interesting and it's revealed how important she is in Gary/Gavin/Gabriel's path to discovering what's really going on.The Nines deserves a watch from anyone looking for something a little different. It'll definitely satisfy Ryan Reynolds fans and it'll probably meet or exceed what you expect from the film once it's all said and done. It surprised me quite a bit with a strong story, a great cast, and an incredibly solid script. Give it a watch. I don't think you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this 2007 film mainly because of 2 of its 3 stars,Ryan Reynolds &amp; Hope Davis are 2 performers that I do enjoy watching.I figured I would sort of like it &amp; would give it a passable 7.WAS I Surprised, Note my 9 (above average) rating.John August a Television writer of some years both wrote &amp; directed. This is his first directorial effort, the tale is partly from his own career.. This is a 3 part story, each of the 3 actors does a different characterization in each part; only one part is true.I mentioned 2 of its stars at the beginning,The third character is portrayed by a actress from Television. Melissa McCarthy, This lady is a STAR, at least she has all the potential to be major actress. For a change we have an actress who is a bit on the hefty size,not playing a stereotype role.All 3 stars are pure delights,The script is quite thought provoking at times &amp; I advise all to pay close attention, It is a rewarding effort.Of course, since this is not an action film, it regretfully only had a 2 week run on about 5 screens in 2007. It deserved better,One more role to mention, Elle Fanning (Dakota Fannings little sister), she is as talented as Dakota.Rent this film or look for it on cable television, you will be glad that you saw it. If You are a reader of my reviews, you will notice I do not give a 9 rating that often.ALSO it has a first rate music song score.Ratings; ***1/2 (out of 4) 83 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The nines gives nothing away in the title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The nines gives nothing away in the title and contrary to the plot line starts as a real life feeling Hollywood reality show, the star of a major hit series is on a downward spiral, setting fires, being arrested for DUI's and picking up Hugh Grant style hookers. It is almost as if this movie could be renamed Hollywood's fallen or dare I say a day in the life of Robert Downy JR, but the movie is a great example of sustaining momentum and just as soon as you feel you have the plot worked out it thickens so much its almost like trying to see through mud.The directorial debut of acclaimed screenwriter of 'Go' and 'Big Fish', John August delivers a truly breath taking movie that mazes so much you feel you could run into David Bowie at any moment. With the help of the ever growing and brilliant Ryan Reynolds (Smokin' Aces, Just friends) the film is expertly dealt with. The way Reynolds has come of age as an actor is really impressive and he uses this stage to show that he has the quality and depth to go after far more serious roles than his CV suggests, let us not forget 'Waiting'.The film does touch on areas that have been pursued before with the main character convinced he is losing his mind, think 'A Beautiful Mind' with Russell Crowe, however as if to zip a critics mouth before it has a chance deal the 'been done before' line, it makes fun of the fact that it is almost stealing from one of the greats with the sharp witted script.Overall the movie is a tough watch, as you never really feel you know what's going on or where and when it is going to become clear, despite all this it is an ultimately rewarding experience when the conclusion becomes clear, you've been suckered in! Taken into a world of uncertainty, twist and turns and who, what, when's for the last 99 minutes it feels like you have been peering over a mates shoulder while he plays 'The Sims' on his pc, but take nothing away from this truly great test of a film that is in my mind the most intelligent and surreal ride I've had since 'Being John Malkovic' felt kind enough to let us into his head.What are the nines?

		<fullReview>Summarizing the plot line makes the movie sound trite which it definitely is not. The combination of the sound track, excellent acting, and mystical thread gradually unveiled makes the movie memorable and enjoyable from start to finish, even as it forgoes gimmickry and special effects. It leaves you intrigued but not overwhelmed and is a solid movie experience overall.The world as we come to know it has been created by a designer who stays and plays a character in that world. The movie is a struggle between two forces, those who want the designer to leave the world and return to the overview of design, and those who want the designer to remain as a character and keep them company. The designer himself has self imposed amnesia from which he gradually escapes. He is caught up in the decision of whether to leave and let the world potentially deteriorate in his absence, or remain and enjoy his role while recognizing it limits him from further design.Calling the lead a "game designer" is really somewhat misleading and trivializing in that the creation appears more akin to an advanced simulation. There are rules, but no dragons or orcs, although the latter are referenced.A most unusual and worthwhile experience. I found it both intriguing and relaxing. The sound track is nearly perfect, and not the type of music I ordinarily prefer; another example of the movie opening windows to a different view of reality.</fullReview>

The rest of the cast, especially Melissa McCarthy, were superb, and the complex plot kept me hooked until the end.

But at every turn he tries something different and succeeds each time.The Nines gives Reynolds the chance to show his chops as a dramatic and comedic actor. Melissa McCarthy is adorable as always, but, gets to play out a dimension of her acting we haven't seen yet either.It's is a good film, but, it does have flaws. At times it can be too quirky and mellow dramatic, but, in the end it helps more than it hurts.The acting is solid. The story is interesting (strange as it may be at times). But, the end is what seals the deal, it changes everything in a good way. That said, don't quit half way. In a Hollywood that packs too many twists into there movies, this is one film in which they work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is basically a philosophical and psychological movie that has all the right ingredients to make you just say "WOW". The movie is divided into 3 parts, each played by the same character, but each character is unique and their personalities and traits differs from one to another.What I found excellent in the movie is Ryan Reynolds' performance. Each and every part with him was dead on. His portrayal was so real and worthy of his characters. It just goes to prove just how great of an actor he really is. In my mind he is a genius actor, the best of the best. He can move from comedy, to chick-flick, to action, then drama, etc. All his transitions are smooth and a great pleasure to watch.Overall, this is a great film that will leave you breathless and questioning the rhetorical question of "is this real"? I highly recommend this movie, in fact I recommend all Ryan Reynolds movies because his portrayal of each of his roles will surprise you and make you want to cheer him on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the movie was positively brilliant. I admit that the beginning was a little difficult to get into but after a while, the movie completely absorbed me. Contrary to popular belief, the story is NOT three separate movies intertwined, it is three parts of one person's life.The movie was very explanatory, I found. True for the first half you may not have known the full deal, but that's the point of any movie. To keep you in suspense is to keep you in your seat. If you knew the answer right away, why would you watch it? I believe Melissa McCarthy is a convincing and wonderful actress and I've always admired Ryan Reynold's ability to perform in any role thrown to him.This is honestly the first movie I've watched that still had me in tears well after the credits were run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The IMDb rating for this film is totally wrong. Its not a leave your brain at the door film so if those are the films you like don't watch the nines. For the rest of you who actually like to think about things and not just look at the pretty colours this is a smart and interesting film. It is a new idea on the take of the universe and god and really applies the term what if god was one of us. this film was interesting all the way through and will leave you looking for the nines and wondering are you a nine? It left me wondering and will have a lot of people believing in it. well its just as believable as Christianity. It is about the lives of three men, well when i say three men a mean one man, a man who is one less than god. it was well directed and Ryan Reynolds plays each of the three men differently showing that he is a true actor not just someone who plays themselves in a movie. Its worth your time to watch and is better than a lot of films out there at the moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the strange ones. Is like Dogville, Being John Malkovich or I Love Huckabees, in a way. They make you think hard. They make you feel deep . And they leave some kind of strange feeling about reality, human kind and existence. The End is what makes the movie great but the firs hours is entertaining so its easy to see at first and then you would have to be a person who really wants to understand the message to really enjoy the final product. If you are looking for a Transformers kind of entertainment, this is probably not what you have in mind.If you enjoy the kind of titles that I mentioned above then Im almost sure you will LOVE this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome movie! Great Acting with a twisted yet connected storyline. The ending brings it all together and is the big payoff. This movie also has fairly good ties to bold philosophy and science. I highly recommend reading this link after or before watching the movie. It does not have anything to do with the writing of the script as far as I know, but has very similar tales. see http://www.fullmoon.nu/articles/art.php?id=tal Try to be open minded in both reading the article or watching the movie *Hint; pay attention to the backgrounds. A movie I will likely buy. A good movie for those who like to watch intriguing shows and then sit around and talk it over. I found myself talking about it for days. Some of my friends did not like the complexity of the plot, but that's just normal for some folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd never heard of "The Nines" when I started watching it. Now, I'm not sure what to think of it. Portraying three interconnected stories set in Los Angeles - and all starring the same people - it seems to be saying something about happenstance...but I don't know for certain. I can't say what the overall gist is supposed to be. But I do think that the movie is worth checking out. Seeing what happens in the middle segment, one gets a sense of just how cutthroat the entertainment world must be (is it just me, or does nobody focus on that more than the entertainment world?).Anyway, worth seeing, but don't be surprised if it totally blows your mind. Starring Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy, Hope Davis and Elle Fanning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art-house Poetism, 4 Mar 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: A TV actor (Ryan Reynolds) goes on a bender before crashing his car after smoking crack with a hooker. Under house arrest, he hears noises and sees hallucinations that suggest a haunting. However, the truth is much stranger, and a portal to other dimensions is opened... My Review: The Nines is a more poetic version that questions Humanities existence. It is another startling and perhaps more original idea that bares the likeness of M Night Shyamalan or whatever his name is. It begs to answer on its own accord the simplest questions, like "What is going on? Why are we here? We've all thought these things?" providing an answer to our own inadequate answers. Science Fiction fans will love this, with that in mind it has a beautiful intrinsic idea behind everything (literally everything) that seems to glimmer with its own inner-self incandescence. Mixes and mingles parables and plethoras of edgy indie realism with bizarre metaphysical surrealism, providing much needed provocation and genuine food for thought. Verdict: A well-cooked and interesting piece of 90 minute cinema. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is no word in any language for what this film might be about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is, or are, The Nines? I'm fresh from this fantastic freak fest of a film, and I use that term not lightly. This film is a mesmerising, if at times unpolished, masterpiece that not only intrigues right to the end, but at the end leaves you as if you have just done three Kaiser Sozes, two Matrix trilogies and half a dozen Monkeys.It's like one of the best quirky tales from 2000AD but made into a modern, well acted movie with great production. It has an unusually compelling style - and oodles of conceptual layers. But it's complex and weird and hard to follow in a close to exhilarating way.We just kept asking... "but?"... "how?" I think one of the brightest aspects of the movie is that it doesn't try to out weird you. So unlike, say, Eraserhead or Jacob's Ladder (both great films, mind), there is always the chance that everything you see could be normal. And maybe, at the end it is all normal. Even with the revelation (I won't spoil it by telling you what that is), even if you accepted it as this reality, even then, it could still be normality for all of us.Q: Is it complex and weird like The Number 23? A:No, the biggest part of The Number 23 is a number two.I won't tell you what The Nines is about, but I will tell you the nearest thing it reminds me of. My wife and I both will testify that my clothes (and of this weekend some soft toys) sometimes duplicate. Literally. As if someone has logged into reality, taken an unusual T-Shirt bought in a "London fashion sample sale" and then made an exact copy of it (except that one now has an oil stain that cannot be removed. I think it's probably WD-40, so any tips appreciated). An exact copy. The same with a pair of brown trousers that I know, and would testify in a court of natural laws, that I only bought one pair of. No questions. I now have two pairs of them.I think it also happens with socks, but my wife is sceptical of this.Sure, the trousers and T shirt spontaneous duplications are mind boggling in the degree to which they render all notions of laundry normality.... abnormal, but it gets worse: There have also been discoveries of soft toys that there were never, until recently, two of. One of the ontological clones was won five years ago by my dad in a raffle (probably Rotary) and could not possibly be duplicated (OK it's possible. But I don't think so). We have debated the possibilities. All of them, with a Doyleian keenness to the causal and material structures of our domestic reality that could allow this. Sure, perhaps the crazy lady across the road saw me wearing the shirt, spent four months on Ebay to get a copy, bought it with Paypal and slipped it in my smalls one spring morning. Maybe so. Maybe my brother in law, when he bought me the shirt, bought two, one for me and, knowing I'm a sharp dresser, one for him. And then at Easter three years ago accidentally left it in my house. Maybe....It is rare in these days to have even the smallest of epiphanies.Just as The Nines has lots of "buts", this crazy flux in our existential architectonics makes us have many more "maybes" than simple folk deserve. If you have objects disappear in your house, it can be weird. In English we call this "losing things". But when things don't vanish, rather they are duplicated... that's mega weird... there is no word in any language for that kinda spooky. No word (ED, how about "isoanatanmorphic?", but that only applies to fruit.?).These events, along with some before the little people came and took all my liberty away, have made me question the nature of reality at a very fundamental level, or at least, the nature of the material world.. and I guess I mean "material" in both senses here.I wouldn't wish these kind of metaphysical palpitations on anyone, but luckily for you, you can experience even more weirdness than this by watching The Nines, without any actual weirdness in your clothing inventory. What is more, the weirdness The Nines can massage into your porridge is a kind of meaningful weirdness... a thought pumping weirdness... a metaphysical maelstrom... set conveniently in the Hollywood Film and TV world.The Nines is in my Top Ten. That's top ten of all time.</fullReview>

There are sudden jerks in the story, whether this is intentional or not never made unclear. The ending of each one seems random, there is no tie between the beginning and ending of each of the three stories.I applaud the attempt to use the same characters in each setting, but the stories were too closely related and too fragmented to be effective.The stories together ended up costing me an hour and fifteen minutes of my life. This film is clearly not to my taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As a Panda. You'll Understand After You See It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will begin with the admission that this is not a boring film. It succeeds in holding one's interest, as it might be one of the very least predictable movies I can recall. Essentially, without giving anything away, although you won't be missing much, it's divided into three vignettes. The first one acquaints us with a distressed Hollywood actor, Gary, under house arrest living in another person's house because he burned down his own. While confined, he is taken care of by both a chubby P.R. 'handler' and the sexy single mom next door, who may or may not be interested in him sexually. Over this time, Gary becomes convinced that he is being haunted by the number nine.Then comes the next segment while we are reeling with curiosity. It follows a gay television writer, Gavin, played by Ryan Reynolds, who played Gary before, trying to get his pilot made. We raise an eyebrow when we find that the house he lives in is the house Gary later stays in. Hm. At some stage in the course of post-production, a television executive pushes for Gavin to ditch the unconventional (chubby) lead actress of his project, played by the same actress who played the PR rep before.And then in the third act, a video game designer, again Ryan Reynolds and again a name beginning with "Ga," is lost when his car breaks down, a situation shown in Gavin's pilot. He leaves his wife and daughter with the stranded vehicle and meets a mysterious woman. By the time this act reaches its revelation, the wide-eyed look of curiosity on your face becomes an empty expression, a time void for your muscles, as the big surprise that binds these bizarre fragments and concludes. You will have been led on a wild goose chase and once you catch the goose, the filmmaker, John August, has been pandering to his own wishful fantasies of spiritual grandeur, under the oh-so-impressive guise of a film that explores the concept of simulated reality.In any case, the film has no atmosphere, the cast surrounding Reynolds has no charisma in spite of decent deliveries, and when it's over, one only wants to forget about it. The only props I give are for its aforementioned success with its lack of probable expectations, even if it's all for the least satisfying pay-off. Imagine Sharon Stone flirting with you, playing footsie, offering you a ride home, putting her hand on your lap, then going to her place and finding that she enticed you there only to show off her collection of china patterns. On a smaller scale, that is what you will experience if you see The Nines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Ridiculous, but Wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After ejecting "The Fountain" after a grueling 20 minutes, I was in the mood for a movie that was well grounded, and without the symbolic and "intellectual" pretension found in movies such as "Mullholland Drive" and the like. For some reason, it seems the common notion is that a nonlinear and obfuscated plot combined with a plot twist epiphany automatically create a great movie. As soon as I began to realize the deeper nature of "The Nines", I gripped my temple and moaned, "not this again." That's because I felt the sinking feeling of a movie about jerk me around and forcefully slam my rational mind into a blender of nonsense. You know what I'm talking about: everything seems fine and makes sense, and then WHAM! But wait, that's not happening. Instead, we're being spoon fed weirdness one bit at a time; allowing our rational mind to slowly come to grips with what is going on. "Fight Club" did it, and it certainly worked there. But why do I say ridiculous? Because parts of it are. But what makes it wonderful is that despite any apparent absurdity (which did go a bit far), if you take the premise and run with it, it all adds up. But all that aside, I was enthralled from start to finish, and really enjoyed watching it.</fullReview>

Very good directorial This type of movie has many genres and is difficult to pick just one and i love this about it. Though a warning for this movie... you should only really watch with people serious about film...as it will just ruin the whole atmosphere of the film if you watch it with people who aren't. 10/10 Perfect.Amazing and would happily watch it again...and again.

		<fullReview>I just finished the movie and something doesn't feel right. A movie is like a falling object, you can either catch it and embrace it or rather see it crash on the ground. This movie just crashed to pieces in front of my eyes and left me feeling somewhat incomplete.The story was really great, i mean the originality was in action. The execution is where the movie takes a seat. Acting is fair, not bad. The movie will keep you hooked and will drive you through the tunnels, but for your final destination you might be left in a misty and hazy scenery.Story revolves around 3 men with different professions like one's an actor, second's a writer and the third's a game developer, their lives crash against each other while the story progresses. Saying anything else might screw the movie for you guys so i'll end the review by hoping you catch and embrace the movie.In my opinion, if you do watch it, watch it during the day while you still have some light in the sky. Morning and afternoon's just fine.. You won't be needing a snack for this one, drink's good.</fullReview>

I think the movie was trying to be a sci-fi film on a very low budget. It may not be obvious at first but half way through it becomes a science fiction film. Ironically, I love low budget sci-fi "B" films but this one was not even in that class. The central idea behind the film seemed like it was dreamed up at the last minute before they finished filming -like they did not know how they wanted to end it when they started filming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God forgive Fight Club and Vanilla Sky for what they've done ! So, after a strange atmosphere, interesting characters, some good performances, and exciting questions this movie ended up as a speech about how the seven must not think of loving a nine, the seven must love another seven. OH MY GOD! As if the scriptwriter found the best thrilling plot for a movie and not a proper meaning out of it !! While this was on, I loved every moment of it, yet with the third act, I found myself laughing loudly in disappointment. I refuse labeling. The matter of gods living among us, then forgetting about it, is just absurd. The movie's genius goal, about how we mustn't fall in the human gods' love, while labeling them, us, and the others differently is utterly stupid. Accordingly this is the most captivating, most naive, X-File I have ever watched ! It works fine as a mirror of silly megalomania of the actors, writers, directors. Or as a lesson of lifetime that a fat girl had while dreaming the wrong dream of being a cheerleader !!! So that's why the movie's fat girl satisfied with her *seven* husband at the end, as long as she's a *seven* also, and the *nine* returned home with the rest of the *nines*. Well, I feel stupid already by only writing this ! It puts forth, seriously, one heck of a Shakespearean question : To have a bellybutton, or to have not ! For me I don't care. I'm the one who marks this Nines with 8 as a plot, and zero as a meaning out of that plot !</fullReview>

And that's fine, but you dang well better make it all come together in the end. It's one thing to give me a disappointing ending if I'm watching something that's easy to follow, but if I'm seeing the same actors in three different roles and I have no idea how they relate, you have failed miserably if you don't reconcile everything.And... it does, but in the most "I've painted myself into a corner and this is the only explanation I can make work kind of way."

This movie was not only intellectually intriguing, it was endlessly entertaining, and my attention didn't flag for a moment. I attribute this not only to the excellent script, dialogue, and pacing, but to the superlative acting, which was so natural, so spontaneous, and so intuitive that I literally never "got off the train" throughout. I could single out Ryan Reynolds, of course, because he carried the movie seamlessly and convincingly, but his whole supporting cast was just as great, and inhabited their various roles completely.

At first I was like "What the hell is going on" It's a film that you really cannot sum up without giving away the plot so I'm sorry for the lack of information. Basically if you like a good funny but quite disturbing plot then watch it. The nines is split up into 3 parts and they are all shot differently. Part 1 is like an indie movie with quite grainy visuals, part 2 is a documentary shot on a video-camera and part 3 is a horror-style Hollywood camera style. The 3 main actors (Ryan Reynolds, Hope Davis and Melissa Mcarthy) all play 3 different characters in 3 different parts of the film and it is interesting how they played them to be different but have the same thing so you can recognise them. The only problem is that it's too short. It would of been better if there was more in it but overall it's a very good "Guess Who?" film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the vague tangents of the story line, the ending pays off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nines is a metaphysical suspense story about Ryan Reynolds playing three different characters, and how they are all connected. Not much to discuss on the movie as I would provide immediate spoilers. It is divided into three parts, each delineating the three personalities played by RR and the consistent relationships with the two concurrent supporting actresses, played by Melissa MacCarthy and Hope Davis.The transitions between the three parts originally raised eyebrows for me, and I was almost getting bored scratching my head with The Nines midway when watching the second act. That was the only weakness I saw in this movie which led me to feel slightly uninterested. Once the final act came in, in which he plays the Video game Designer lost in the woods with his family, the story reconciles with its preceding contrivances. The clever ending gives us the typical flashbacks on the apparent plot-twist, yet it doesn't become overbearing in metaphysical exposition, which might have led to increased boredom. I felt actually satisfied with the ending, once I got past the first two acts. Despite the adult situations, I recommend this movie for the general audience. The Nines has a certain gentleness about its delivery and doesn't come on too strong, I can't think of any reason why anyone would hate this movie if they watched it through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Nines is a fantasy - mystery drama written and directed by John August (also known as one of the writers for Dark Shadows and screenwriter of The Corpse Bride, Big Fish and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). The story tells us about the lives of a struggling actor, a video game designer and a TV show writer melding together in a mysterious way.It's a cosmic point of view, it's about signs and remembering. All it needs is some extra attention and an open mind; the rest are being taken care of by a really nice cast. If any of you ever had doubts about Ryan Reynolds' performances, you better watch it cause he's fantastic here. He and Melissa McCarthy have a beautiful and unique chemistry. Some of the actors involved are playing as themselves, which makes the film more real and quirky at the same time.The whole film has a vast amount of great music. There's not an official soundtrack but you can find and listen most of the songs listed online.The outcome may not be as rewarding as the rest of the story but give a chance to the unconventional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was going through Netflix and came across this movie and went on IMDb and everyone was giving it good reviews, and I happen to be a huge Ryan Reynolds fan. But this movie was PURE disappointment. The movie itself was so/so. The ending was just stupid...which didn't even make sense. Even in movies like inception, after you leave you can still try to understand the ending, or the movie as a whole. But this you can't. Nothing makes sense. The ending literally rapes you, and there's just no way to recover. And it's such a shame that Ryan had to star in this wreck. He's so talented. I had watched buried this morning (which also stars Ryan) and it was amazing! And then I turn this on. I just wish that something would have had happened to help explain the ending and to make the movie a bit more enjoyable. SPOILER!!! After finishing I did some research and other people say that in the end he was god. Um okay. I don't even remotely see how they got that idea. He's sitting with Melissa in the last scene, there crying because he has to leave (where he goes, no one knows), and then a bunch of stars appear, and Melissa appears with a new husband very happy for some reason. The ending just made no sense, neither did the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was truly stunned to discover, just after the second third of the film, when the explanations about what are these strange things happening over there start arriving, that what binds (more of this later) the film together, is not so much a familiar or innovating filmic experience, but a poem. A poem by the late James Merrill, the six hundred pages "The Changing Light at Sandover".It is an epic, luscious, thoughtful, campy, deep-felt, virtuoso exploration of all grand themes. The poet and his lover, at first playing with the Ouija board, come to escalating conversations and revelations, with all imaginable spirits, humans and gods, in an arch of almost Proustian proportions. Where does this far-reached specimen fit into the 'Nines'? As I wrote, I was stunned to discover the exact imprint of the book when Margaret tells him he is a God-like being and that God is a 10, humans are a 7 and that he is a 9. In a sprawl that covers hundreds of pages, the spirits inform the poet what number he is, what his lover, other beings and patrons, God etc. in exactly the same manner the film delivers the offbeat arithmetics! (Arithmetics being here an excuse and an irony for hierarchy, the strange, if not unassimilable, nature of numbers, and the necessity of their existence in our lives.) And the main responsible spirit for the mess and the glory in the book is the Archangel Gabriel. As in the film.And yes, with the same offbeat humor concerning pandas (in the book there are aphorisms concerning vegetables and crystals of the same tone and tenor)! As if one expects with numbers the really serious seriousness of metaphysics. And this is where, for me, the film hits its mark: not in the more serious portions of the script (as if one could isolate them), but in what gives off an alarming sense of the situation.What I mean is this: although not exactly shifting in tone from one scene to the other, or even more, in the same one, one gets the feeling of not knowing how to stand: is this ironic, or not? And if it is, why the sense that we don't get what's the irony about, although we sense there is? As if the thing could be tacky, bathetic and serious, all at once. And this is, I think, a lesson Mr. August has learned by James Merrill. For the film, as well as the poem, is not just an exercise in the abstract realm. If it was so, then the sarcastic humor and/of the situations, most evidently in the second story would be either weird or self-indulgent (these two attributes exist in the reviews), while I think they are valid for the story and contributing into understanding that what we watch is a nuanced, if not altogether successful, piece of fiction, close to autobiography and fierce satire, rather than an exposition of philosophical and religious questioning - I mean, look around where the stories revolve! Why should we be bothered to know the writer-and-director's biography to appreciate the film is where I think the whole piece is not bound together. In "Sandover" the writer can deploy his cosmology for hundreds of pages, but in less than two hours, and with visual means, that is with means that lack the suggestiveness and the cunning of the written word, then certain pronouncements (God is ten, you are a nine) smack our ears in a register that does not quite match well with, let's say the somewhat leisurely sarcasm of the second story just before (let alone some Lynch-sync in the third act). Or, the chilling question at the end, "dear what is my name?" is in need of some foregrounding, like other details, in order for them to fully work, remain ambiguous but creep under our skin, or be unambiguous and full-fledged.For I think this is a work of almost unprecedented savage irony in certain aspects: in the end it seems to ask us (after Gabriel has exited in the most hilarious and looming way kissing wifey away, and yet they have shown us that love is god-like!) Would you like to find yourself in a family (the film ends in a happy family mode, or does it?) cosmology and all abandoned, and you blink asking your child the chilling question (in a superb deliverance by Melissa McCarthy) "What is my name?" just to receive the chilling answer "You are mommy!" - that is, you don't have a name. If the director could control the hint that, all this may be some housewife's hallucinations in the end (for it does not dismiss or fully engage in faith or grace), or some other heavyweight double-entendres then this would be a pitch perfect film.As the beginning of "Sandover" reports: Admittedly I err by undertaking this in its present form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good idea, kinda lame outcome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, what is really great about this movie: - Ryan Reynolds, great acting! There are very few actors I really like and for now he is one of them. He has an amazing skill to impersonate characters. - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. - The idea of a nine lost in his own world, incapable of leaving. Still, I give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: - Horrible second part. It seems that the director was very eager to make something new, but despite of the efforts it was really boring - Very annoying character Melissa. I couldn't stand the scenes with her - i.e. it was constantly annoying. She represents everything that is wrong with American woman. - Terrible explanation of the numbers. The director was so busy with character development, that he completely missed the point of a good story.. excuse me koalas? brr... terrible!This movie had great potential. The filming is nicely done, the music is really good, but nothing more.See it only if you are a fan of Ryan Reynolds, or have a lot of time to spare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've seen this type of premise used before, in "Dark City" and "The 13th Floor"; "Possible Worlds", "The Machinist", "Pi", "Eyes Wide Shut", "Matrix" and even "Fight Club" come to mind as well. Flicks that deal with what constitutes reality have become a mini-fad (or a mini-mini-fad), but in a good way. These films are the antidote to "10,000 BC", "Eragon", "Avatar", and any Jennifer Aniston or Nicholas Cage turkey.Watching a film like "The Nines" serves as a way of neutralizing at least some of the brain-damage that occurs while viewing any political drama with Robert Redford, a propaganda turd by Michael Moore, a pathetic social satire/drama by Spike Lee, or a "comedy" by Wes Anderson. If you feel you've been partially lobotomized by Jackie Chan films, Brian de Palma thrillers, or big-budget Will Smith crap-o-ramas, you might find comfort in the fact that a filmic lobotomy might be reversible. However, the only way to achieve this is by painstakingly digging out a handful of intelligent, well-structured, somewhat bizarre films such as the above-mentioned and then viewing them, more than once if need be. (5 to 10 viewings of "Possible Worlds" is the recommended dosage for canceling out all of the damage caused by a single viewing of "Dead Man Walking")."The Nines" isn't quite as good as its film brethren. The first part and the ending are very good, but the middle part, with Ryan playing a gay Hollywood scribbler, drags on: it seems like a prolonged moment of self-indulgence by the makers of TN.A smaller complaint regards the stupid comment that "Koalas are 8s, because they're telepathic". You certainly don't want a dumb thing like that in a movie that tries to come off as thought-provoking. Yeah, Koalas are 8s... Was that fishing for cheap laughs? If any animal is telepathic, it must be the penguin. I feel such a strange strange vibe when I pass their section in the zoo...Ryan Reynolds's character is a 9. In real life, a number more suitable for him would be a 5. (He dated Alanis Morissette, frcrissakes...) Needless to say, all Sean Penns are 3s, David Schwimmers are 2s, and Cruises/Travoltas are 1s. Hope Davis chews up the scenery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No Spoilers Here! I would like to make it clear that this movies just entered my all time favorites. The Writing, Directing and most important of all, the Acting were all far higher then I had anticipated. I wasn't sure what to expect but I will suggest this to everyone I associate myself with. Absolutely amazing the way this all falls together in the end, yet leaves you second guessing yourself the whole way. The potential left in the end for you to either think about or bring into a discussion with others who have seen it, is endless. The only downside to this type of movie at least for myself, is that it's not one to watch it again and again.The only way I can see anyone disliking this movie is if you watch movies for the explosions and not so much the story lines. Also if you can't stand when a writer leaves the ending open to your personal speculation, the conclusion is not definitive in any way. If you rated this less then a five and feel you understood the writers direction, or even if you didn't get it at all, please message me as I would love to hear opposite opinions to try and understand where you generated them from.

		<shortDescription>So good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nines is wonderful. Echoing the other reviews, it is difficult to discuss the plot without giving too much away. Basically, it is made up of three parts of what I consider to be the same story. The connections between the three stories are gradually revealed in often eerie ways. The twist precedes the last part of the film, which further develops the new information the viewer has been given. The Gnostic undertones make this a film that many traditional Christians might consider offensive or blasphemous, but with that caveat aside, this is really something that makes you think.The acting here is amazing. Each emotion seems very real and can be felt by the viewer. The writing is superb and witty. The Nines is at once funny, trippy, creepy, sad, musical, and most importantly, mind-blowing. My only complaint is that the second part, though necessary, kind of presents a bit of a lull at times. By the time the third part rolls around, though, this is more than forgiven. This is a new favorite of mine, and is recommended to any fan of original, cerebral movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much of a cult film as a curiosity that is a good idea but not as brilliant as some would have you believe (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of this film until it came to DVD and even then it was just the odd comment here and there. What I was picking up was the feel that this is a film in the sort of vein of Donnie Darko and other "cult" successes where the meaning is complex and subject to lots of discussion and debate later on. Watching it for myself I was a little disappointed that the film didn't deliver in the same way although it is still an interesting and unusual film.The film provides the viewer with three separate stories featuring the same actors playing characters with similar names. So we have a TV actor in rehab/house-arrest, a TV producer pitching his new show and a video game programmer with car trouble. The three stories are distinct on the face of it but all interact to a certain degree, not least of which is the presence of the number 9 within all of them. Each story starts in an "ordinary" way but in each things happen that point to something truer and bigger behind the specific situations we think we are watching. It is approach that is interesting in itself but yet also causes weaknesses in how the film engages and plays out. What I mean by this is that the device of having distinct stories that are linked by actors and other connectors informs the audience that they are NOT distinct stories and invites you to watch to learn more. However at the same time it does create the problem that the narrative doesn't unfold in quite the way that you would like it to and it instead makes rather stuttering half steps for the majority of the film before spilling its guts rapidly at the end. I was engaged enough but the structure did prevent a real flow as each story essentially puts us back to the beginning only slightly wiser.It doesn't totally reward at the end either because it does take some thought and a lot of interpretation to understand. I have read another review that said the reason it won't fall into place for many viewers is because they are not thinking like a writer (or creator if you will). I think that is a very good statement because that is essentially what Gary etc is, a sort of lower-level God who has created these worlds and stayed within them to play them ? hence the final character being what else but a guy who designs RPG's. It is not a stunning twist but quite a nice solution. Is it epic enough to complex enough to really fire viewers and produce a cult classic with wider appeal a la Darko? Well no but it is a strangely engaging film that is enough of a curiosity to be worth a look.Writer and director August does a really good job to be true to each strand and create a tone that is convincing, only to then strip it away in each case as he does with the characters. It works in a really strange way where the viewer is constantly unsure quite how to take what is happening. The cast seem to understand though and everyone's performance is good. Reynolds does a lot better than I expected. When he is not in the know he is "normal" within the context of his character. As he starts to suspect something he is convincing and also from then on he works too. McCarthy, Davis and, to a lesser extent, Fanning are all good in similarly replicated roles and I did enjoy the way they all worked together within each chapter.Some may say that The Nines is due bigger things but I'm not so sure that it is because it is not as complex nor as engaging as similar cult films that have done well. However there is more than enough about it to make it one of those films that you stumble upon, get surprised by but never rave about ? a curiosity more than a cult. The style and delivery by everyone adds to this and is mostly good, while the nature of the story gives you some room for debate and discussion. Not brilliant by any means but an interesting and imaginative film nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, loooong, boooring, movie, not worth the paaain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was long drawn out and boooring, in my opinion. I fully understood the movie and the overall concept was intriguing and the acting was great, but, all the stories seemed to have a lot of unneeded footage and dialog. It seemed as if they tried to fill time by shooting footage of meaningless, unrelated, scenes. In getting to the point of the movie there could have been a little action or something thrown in to add a little balance to the movie.I also just don't get why people think this movie was thought provoking, the concept of multiple gods dabbling in human existence has been around for millenia, this seems to be just a rewrite of an old Greek myth, with more modern dialog.Conclusion, I would not give my worst enemy a copy of this movie as I don't hate anyone enough to let them sit through this painfully agonizing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, I don't like gimmicky movies. All right, I'll admit that I enjoyed "The Third Man", "Vertigo", "Psycho", "The Usual Suspects", "The Sixth Sense" and "Memento". But usually when I see something like "Persona", "Miller's Crossing", "Jacob's Ladder", "Mulholland Drive", "Lady in the Water", or "The Prestige", I want to throw something at the screen because I feel the writers and directors of these movies are either insulting my intelligence, or displaying a lack thereof on their part. "The Nines" is that refreshing sort of gimmick-film that shows intelligence on the filmmaker's part, but doesn't insult the viewers'.The film is divided into 3 distinct chapters, each starring Ryan Reynolds as the protagonist, Melissa McCarthy as someone who clings to Reynolds, and Hope Davis as someone who is trying to pull Reynolds away from McCarthy using the phrase "Look for the Nines." And each chapter ends ironically in a way that partially reveals what the catch-phrase means and connects the chapter to the other two.In chapter one, Reynolds plays Gary, an actor under house arrest for buying crack. Since he doesn't have his own place, he is assigned to live with his hyper-perky publicist Margaret (McCarthy) in a house belonging to a TV producer, currently in New York shopping his new show. Gary and Margaret eventually develop a flirty relationship, even though "flirting" tends to involve viciously insulting each other. Eventually, the idyll ends when next-door-neighbor Sarah (Davis) takes an interest in Gary, and tells him that since he is a nine out of ten on the attractiveness scale, he should dump the overweight Margaret and "look for the nines".In chapter two, Reynolds plays Gavin, the TV producer who owns the house where Gary is confined in chapter one. He is in New York shopping a new supernatural series starring Melissa McCarthy (playing herself in this chapter) as a mother who is left sitting in a car with her creepy mute daughter (Elle Fanning) while her husband looks for help. Test audiences love the show, but want him to replace the overweight McCarthy with someone more conventionally attractive. Gavin resists because of his feelings of loyalty towards McCarthy, and eventually network exec Susan (Davis) steps in, and tell him he needs to see how the test audience voted from one to ten and "look for the nines" and see what they have to say about the show.The third chapter is the drama that Gavin was producing in chapter two. Reynolds is Gabriel, a software designer out for a drive in the woods, when his car runs out of gas. He leaves his wife Mary (McCarthy) to care for their creepy mute daughter Noelle (Fanning), while he looks for help. Eventually he runs into Sierra (Davis) who leads him on a wild goose chase before finally telling him what the phrase "Look for the Nines" really means, and why he has to abandon his family.I like that each chapter has its own genre. Chapter 1 is a musical romantic comedy shot conventionally on film, with lots of close-ups. Chapter 2 is a pseudo-reality-show shot on shaky-cam DV that never gets particularly close to the actors. And Chapter 3 is a thriller with cinematography that splits the difference between the first two chapters: It's shot on DV; and when the characters run, the camera shakes; but in the still moments, the camera is still; and there are plenty of close-ups of people's faces.I also like that when the secret of "The Nines" is revealed, it doesn't feel forced or like writer-director John August has pulled a fast one on us. And I thought it was cool that the female lead went to someone who doesn't fit the conventional body type of a Hollywood actress.The only complaint I have about this movie is that the acting, directing and camera-work were merely adequate. Only the writing was truly exceptional. But good writing can absolve a multitude of sins far worse than what this film is guilty of. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a very neat story in this movie, and it's one of those movies where you have to put reality on pause and just enjoy the ride. At first it's a bit confusing and somewhat eerie, which is always good to see in a movie, it's nice to have to wait for an answer sometimes and put things together, instead of just be given an answer to everything.The acting is pretty good with a few funny quotes in it. There was one part that stood out to me that wasn't really necessary, a little song routine. But it was pretty minimal in the great scheme of the whole movie.Hope people will check this movie out, it might not be the best movie out there, but it's definitely worth a rent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I actually had high hopes watching this last night on DVD. Mainly as I try to avoid reviews until I watch something myself and form my own opinion Big mistake! My 2 /10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have risen above the 5/10 mark.Once it moved into TV 'reality show' territory it stank to high heaven. Ryan Reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay TV writer and famous games creator / devoted family man he was definitely less effective. From the blurb on the box I expected a flashback thriller along the lines of 'Memento' - unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those 'have to see' movies that can't be explained with just words. I am not usually very kind to what comes out of Hollywood and I suppose my average rating for a movie is 4-6 stars. The Nines however is really something special, in a world where I believe I have seen everything thousands of times. Ryan Reynolds is superb, who knew he had this in him? The Nines is a rarity, where thinking is not only allowed but necessary to enjoy and understand the movie. If you don't enjoy this it is probably above you, perhaps you should read a few hundred books. I have never seen a 10 movie, and I doubt one exists or ever will exist, so this is as close as it is going to get - in my world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A regular reader of John August's blog I've been expecting to watch The Nines for quite a long time, unfortunately my long long wait was not rewarded for I think the movie doesn't work.The opening credits are great, they put me in a certain mood that made me eager for the show to begin. Alas, first reel contact fails as there is not a narrative flow that would get me in the picture. OK there's supposed to be some kind of suspense that keep us waiting for the first plot/sub-plot to unfold. This doesn't work. For one Ryan Reynolds doesn't do particularly odd things (picking up stuff then going to burn it) while the camera movements are odd. In short, John August's skills as a screenwriter are at odds with his first major directorial effort.That's only first reel contact, I think you'd agree there are no movies that will pick up after a poor first reel contact (maybe there are but I can't remember those, which makes them non-existent either). The biggest flaw initiated during the first scene is the understated narrative with a visual-style that forgets from time to time to be low-key, it doesn't add up to an ambiance, an engaging narrative...What I enjoyed the most - even if I barely had one foot in the movie - were the female characters. Melissa McCarthy and Hope Davis are wonderful. I did prefer them in the more buoyant first parts of the movie, still they were very good in the pathos-ified deli-mellow Shyamalan closing part. This also means I found Ryan Reynolds bland in comparison but I acknowledge his part lacked definition. To me this stands out eventually as the biggest flaw in The Nines: he is a godlike hero, which makes him thoroughly un-humane.On the other hand The Nines could have been a great framework for David Lynch. I love Lost Highway, the narrative is understated, you're hardly ever sure about the story but you're little by little straightened into the mindset of the main character. But even Lynch can't be that brilliant every time: Mulholland Drive was brilliant too but only for the first 2/3, before it became messy and annoying. Obviously nobody expects a first-time director to come close to that kind of directorial brilliance, so John August directing his three-fold story in a supernatural atmosphere and a metaphysical background, that is certainly much more than he can chew.BONUS. How telling... The best scene I can remember from the DVD was left on the editing floor. I understand it would have been odd for the character to show up like this in the final cut, but that "hetero-flexible" joke is really very good!</fullReview>

Other people pay attention and are able to comprehend or at least make a solid interpretation out of what is going on and it makes it great for them. Some people say it is boring at parts but i don't believe there was any footage that was not useful to the story, it was brilliantly written, brilliantly casted, and excellently executed. It is not a great movie to go buy right away cause you most likely will like it a lot or just not care for it much at all, its better to rent first then decide.</fullReview>

I agree with others that it is a bit boring... at times. I liked part of the film and was interested yet other parts I felt as if I could care less about what the director was trying to show. I can deal with the ludicrous ending if people want to go there. Compared to The Fountain with Hugh Jackman this movie would be a 9 but on its own I find it just average. It tries to break new ground in the 3 stories merging to one and the ending being what it is but it just doesn't quite pull it off. I wanted to like this film a lot because I like Ryan Rynolds and I can say that he did a superb job in this film along with the rest of the cast.

What if this movie is like the wake-up call we have been awaiting. The movie reaches out and touches us, profoundly, because it begs us to ask ourselves - What if I was God?Now, it can also be viewed as a pessimistic movie, one where God is as flawed as all of us, an experience-junkie who by the end of the movie - has left us all to our own fate.

Of course, it was another ridiculous explanation for it all, but the pretext was rather elaborate and the script thought through. Some of the symbolism of the movie was deep as well.Alas, the delivery was totally boring. Except the scenes with the writer trying to get his pilot series accepted, most of the film had no emotional content. Or rather, less than expected. Like an "Uncanny valley" of emotion.Bottom line: I found the message to be interesting, the way in which describes the wrongness of the world, without actually making the movie about it, a bit like The Matrix, but you have to be in the mood and even then you will probably consider it a tad too lengthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see this movie, I thought it would be something in the line of The Number 23 (maybe because of the name), but it's even worse then that movie.The story is really bad, makes no sense, and Ryan Reynolds should stick to basic comedy roles because he is no great actor, he can perform, but nothing too serious.About the story, I'm all pro Science Fiction and Fantasy, but this is just way out there, the idea behind the movie it's not bad, it's quite intelligent actually, but the way the story is presented is bad and removes credibility to the whole idea.Once again Ryan Reynolds, please stick to Comedy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Waste of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not care for this boring uninspired film. If you are not a woman or over the age of 16, and not gay; you will almost assuredly not like this movie. At the start I thought it was interesting, even as the scenes transitioned and the plot started trickling, I still was game. It was when the main concept was revealed and the setting switches for the first time that I understood the lack of polish this movie received. There was nothing put out there to infer, by yourself, the direction the plot would take, and thats because such a story was excreted from the laziest pen pusher of the most conglomerated Hollywood hacks. Either that or it was written by a college student that watch hitchhiker's guide one to many times and smoked some bad stuff or perhaps it was written by ryan himself. lol. Also how does Ryan Reynolds continues finding work as a drama actor or anything other than comedy? Anyone? Bottom line watching this drivel makes me suspicious of movies whose plots I know nothing about, Can you believe this.... thing got almost a 7 average score?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love unusual films such as Donnie Darko and The number 23 so naturally when I heard about this film I had to watch it! What a waste of time?! Is it meant to be a spoof or something cause how can you take it seriously?! When Hope Davis randomly bursts into song I actually considered turning it off and demanding my ?3.50 back! What is Ryan Reynolds thinking?! He's a comedy actor and nothing about this film was funny! Fair enough people might see a deeper meaning to it and I can understand that but I think there are far better ways this sort of idea could of been handled. Instead it's been made into this awful film that makes no sense! It's only high point is Ryan offering a bit of eye candy other than that it's definitely NOT worth a look!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im just not too sure what to think of this film .. mostly weird and I'm sure this probably went way over my head - 3 films in one with a combining storyline ... i dunno what all that was about, but i'd definitely score this film 2/10 tops to save the 99mins i've lost from my life forever! I think it got too complicated and i found it too difficult at times to understand the story, I watch a lot of films and I think this film could have been made a lot better, entertaining and thought provoking should it have been kept a lot simpler.On the plus side tho - the cinematography and acting was actually good - shame about the story line sorry guys i'd love to rate this with a much higher score but .. i cant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A swing and a miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie tries hard to make a grand metaphysical statement, but crams it into the last 15 minutes with the barest explanation. My wife and I were left scratching our heads. We both liked "Mulholland Drive," with which "The Nines" shares some similarities (multiple story lines, disorienting shifts of perception, realities that may exist in a character's head). But "The Nines" aims higher than the Lynch film, trying to make a sweeping statement about reality and even the soul. Unfortunately, it falls flat. I wouldn't call the movie a complete waste of time. There are some engaging performances, particularly the blond supporting actress (whose name escapes me). The movie was only 1 hour and 39 minutes. I would rather the director have spent another 10-15 minutes exploring the "surprise" he drops at the film's end. Or perhaps the concept was half-baked to start with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have ever wanted to just loose 1 1/2 hours of your life and never get it back, this would be the movie to watch. Ryan Renolds promised a descent performance in the first 5 minutes of the movie with several funny quips and numerous, drug related jokes, but after that this movie takes a turn for the unknown which left me, my wife, and our friend Regina thinking "WHAT THE HELL?" About 1 hour and 15 minutes into the movie it is finally somewhat revealed what is going on with whichever character Ryan is playing at the moment and the light comes on. Unfortunately it was like being stuck in a dark room for over an hour and when the light finally comes on it is revealed that you are actually in a boring old closet.This movie would have been turned off within 20 minutes of it's beginning if it wasn't for one thing. I KNEW the movie was going to get better. What a let-down. I could have been getting amateur eyeball surgery instead of watching this movie, and I feel as if I made the wrong decision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part One: The Prisoner ? In Los Angeles, the television actor Gary (Ryan Reynolds) accidentally burns his house while burning the belongings of his ex-girlfriend. Then he drives drinking booze, uses crack and capsizes his car. He is sentenced to home imprisonment under the surveillance of the public relation Margaret (Melissa McCarthy) and befriends and flirts with his neighbor Sarah (Hope Davis). However, weird things happen in the house haunting Gary.Part Two: Reality Television ? The screenplay writer Gavin fires his old friend Melissa, the lead actress of his reality show, following the advice of Susan, who is the liaison with the direction of the network, and finds that he has been betrayed.Part Three: Knowing ? The car of the video game designer Gabriel runs out battery and he leaves his wife Mary and his daughter, seeking a signal in his cellular to call a tow truck. He meets the drifter Susan that tells Gabriel who he is."The Nines" is an overrated movie, actually a pretentious mess, with three tales entwining the lives of three lead characters. The first part is intriguing, but the other two and the conclusion are awful. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Nmero 9" ("Number 9")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Concept - Drag On Forever With Three Stories.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose not many people here know anything about the video game called The Sim? Cause if you do, you will know exactly where this movie came from. The difference is you don&#x2019;t get to control the character and is not very complicated as this.In fact this movie is not very complicated at all; it got a brilliant idea which has been transform into a very decent screenplay. But at the end I don&#x2019;t quite see the purpose of this movie, was it suppose to be weird, entertaining, moral teaching, what is it? It was not very good cinematic. Fine if you want to watch it one time, for it got different (than most movie) story, but what does it suppose to make its audience feel. I felt nothing. It got three different stories that doesn&#x2019;t really go anywhere or really intertwine with each other.Like everyone else I&#x2019;m attract to this film because of Ryan and or fan of John August, I&#x2019;m a big fan of both of these guys. John August has written some very decent and one utterly brilliant screenplay so I wanted to check him out with his first feature film. And he did a pretty decent job, in fact really good for first timer, with good additional sound effect.As I suppose people are here for Ryan, and like most serious movie that he was in, he did a pretty good job being himself. I cannot say he was brilliant because the character development is very limited here cause he have to play three characters, and those character hasn&#x2019;t been written very well, it was shallow. There was also two female lead, there are there in your face but you don&#x2019;t really get to know them.So at the end this proves that John August can direct a film to the certain extent. Nice this guy is improving. But this movie does nothing for me, it was just plain and flat and no purpose. There should be more something than that and more character involvement. This is like a brief intro of The Sim which I suspect it got its inspiration from, because it was too much similarity and one character is even a game designer.Recommendation: I don&#x2019;t think even catch it on cable will be worthwhile.Reason to Watch: Ryan love to show his sexy body of his doesn&#x2019;t he?Reason not to: Pointless.Rating: 5.5/10 (Grade: D).Please Rate Y/N Only After Read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little bit too arty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd rather call this movie a piece of art rather than a movie (not that movies are not art, but you get my idea). Throughout the entire movie, it feels ass if the director is trying to put up a piece of crafty art for the general public, but I must say that that the final product is a bit too crafty for my liking.For three quarter of the movie, I'm left wondering what the heck on Earth is this movie all about. The story is really slow and feels draggy. There are parts where I feel is redundant and the reason it is there is just to make the audience more confused. It feels as though the director is deliberately leading the audience round and round the bush just for the fun of it. There are many times where I felt like just shutting the movie off. It is only at the end of the movie where you get to understand the essence of the movie, but I cannot say that it left me with a satisfied feeling. Don't get me wrong, I am not the kind who hates to use my head. In fact, I'm all for movies that forces me to use my 'little grey cells' and I usually pride myself as one of those who can understand a complex movie before my friends and family but to me, this just isn't one of them. There is just no way for you to make sense out of the movie in the first 3 quarter of the movie. It kind of left me dry as I kept trying to figure out what the hell is going on. The way the movie is renditioned is too convoluted, and it feels as if the director's main aim of this movie is to display how creative and uncontemporary he can be. I do appreciate art to a certain extent, but I think this movie took it a bit too far. There's not really a main message to convey throughout the movie, and the plot is just there to propel the movie, instead of the other way round. If you're the type that likes to see uncontemporary films, this might be the movie for you. I rated this a 6 because:PROS: - Great piece of art, unconventional - Audience are given an answer for most of the mystery at the endCONS: - Too artsy, feels as if art comes above everything else - Can't say that I'm totally satisfied at the end, although I get the general plot- Audience is left confused too long, story is draggy for some part</fullReview>

Although I wouldn't quite want to interpret it's mysterious and stupid ending, it's just not worth a watch, trust me. I really felt like breaking the TV screen as the end was approaching. It starts off pretty well, keeps you guessing for a while, then it becomes predictable and then, the inevitable happens, you feel like reaching for your gun and shooting the director, script-writer and every other person involved in the making of this garbage.

Really something new.The film starts slow so don't watch it if you are in the mood for a fast paced thriller/drama whatever. If you have the time and the mood for a thought provoking, philosophical(!), steadily developing movie go watch this one.Don't watch it if you're dumb (no offense to dumb people). You won't get it and you'll find it boring.Acting was great by the way! The lead was awesome, I really like the actor now. The ending was a little too "happy" for me.

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT I dare say that, like me, you avoid 'Christian' movies like the plague. Bible-thumping film producers are obviously aware of this because the makers of this one have come up with, I concede, a rather clever little wheeze for getting us to watch a Christian themed story. Namely you get all your Christian buddies to vote for the film like crazy on this website to ensure it gets a high rating. Then you avoid any overt religious references in the film till the final few minutes where the whole storyline is resolved by revealing that the main character is the son of God who created the world 4000 years ago and loves everybody.The film was so boring that the only reason I kept watching was that big IMDb rating. I figured it had to start getting good sometime soon. It didn't. And when the punchline was delivered I felt so cheated I wanted to throw a brick through the TV screen.In future I'll know not to trust IMDb ratings when the number of voters is so low.Here endeth the lesson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nines is a computer game movie base on The Sims 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have not watch this movie yet.There have been words spreading in the Sims 2 players community of a Sims 2 movie coming to theater for some time now, with great expectation from the hardcore fans like myself, while at the same time, many also think it will turn out a very bad movie. Well, if you play the game, you'll understand why people would perceived it to be a bad movie, because they do not see the potential of creating a good script with a game where the player controls the life of the "pixel characters".However, looking at the comments here on internet movie database, it just may have turn out to be a good movie after all.I have only watched the trailer, there's one tiny detailed that confirm for me that The Nines is in fact based on The Sims 2 Game, the prism thing floating on top of the people head is a classic Sims 2 trade mark. Green means you are happy, white/platinum if you die while having the platinum on top of your head means you've had a good life.So since no one has mention this I thought I share this with everyone here about the nines being based on The Sims 2 game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one can be safely filed under young adult metaphysical romp, nestled somewhere in between The Fountain and Donnie Darko in both quality and execution. A movie that manages to convey the former's tri-narrative transcendence much smoother and offer far more head-shaking, teenage-cultifying rewatchability then the latter, still only to find that in the end, Nines does not even add up to eights or sevens. As fun as this space bending, Lynchian-lyte, 99 minute long film tends to be at times, John August's ambitions, both stylistically and plot-wise, outweigh his abilities. Even if viewers feel gypped for investing too much into the deflating concept, it was still an impressive contemporary meditation into the nature of thought, albeit in an often laughably entertaining way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI regret to say that this movie did not deliver. As the summary of this comment states, it really is a glorified love story. And such a pity to waste a nice idea on such a concept on something as boring and over rated as movies about love. As I always have said, and will say again movies about love are less believable than sci-phi movies. A celestial being, that has the power to change all with a single thought, has been hanging around for 4000 years for a girl?? Please! If the whole movie was more like the first ten minutes of the movie was, it would have been more reasonable, and a little fun. Believe it or not there is more to us humans than just love. This might be just my silly point of view, but that is basically what I meant when I mentioned that the movie has a beautiful idea and a concept, but it was wasted on one topic, love. And I guess if a celestial being was so addicted to creating universes, and wanted to experience human life, he would like to see all the angles we have, not just one. Finally I will mention again, the concept is virtually an amazing playground for being creative, and making this celestial being do all that we would love to do but never do, and they killed it by keeping such a narrow perspective of the idea instead of experimenting with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it seems that nowadays its harder and harder to really come up with an original material in Hollywood. At least judging by the s*it they're been spewing out lately, so writers today try often to create these "original" complex and mysterious story lines that, no matter how little sense it makes, fascinates and captivates the viewers imagination. So towards the end of the movie, the viewer is pumped with anticipation for the logical conclusion that ties all the strings together,for the big bang... Only to get non satisfactional or irrational anticlimax belly flop at the end.The ending for this movie could be described like John August was pitching the movie to the executives. Which i would imagine went something like this:Executives: So how would you describe this movie in one sentence?John August: K... i have 3 words for ya. OK?...

I will say this movie has good acting by Ryan Reynolds as he usually does comedy and I will always remember him from Two Guys A Girl And A Pizza Place. In this movie he plays a Hollywood actor who falls into drug addiction and starts doing crack. Personally I don't even think Ryan Reynolds would even know what Crack looks like. This movie plays around with time and the idea of gods and usually would be tripped out and enlightened but thought this movie sucked. I'm so happy my roommate thought this movie sucked too because I turned off Woody Harrelson in Kingpin for this new melo-dramatic artsy fartsy crap film that I'm glad is free to rent to me as a Blockbuster employee and when people asked me this week if I liked it I can honestly say no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of sci/fi and anime fans like this one, but I found myself laughing out loud during the absurd third act.The first two acts are insider portraits of Hollywood--first a self-absorbed actor's tale and then a gay screenwriter's. The first is kind of fun, but the second drags in my opinion. Ryan Reynold's plays the lead in both acts convincingly. The one thing I do give this movie is that it is reasonably well acted.Without giving anything substantive away--the third act tries to connect the first two in an essential way, apparently drawing on L.A's affinity for New Agism and Scientology as inspiration. The third act is hurried, and somewhat random.The hurriedness of the third act leaves room for the viewer's imagination to fill in ample blanks--thus some will see it as deep, where others will simply scratch their heads.Honestly, though, it simply struck me as a desperate attempt of a writer to connect two largely unrelated "shorts" and call it a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The multi-verse of a narrative reminds me of how esoteric screen writing and film-making can be, the lacking of profundity in this film startling and depressing. Mr. August hasn't returned to his level of GO in quite some time, which is depressing just to imagine, his closeness to the Hollywood process tainting him. The puzzle he tries to weave into a masterpiece just isn't distant in form as it should be. Just read this synopsis: "A troubled actor, a television show runner, and an acclaimed video game designer find their lives intertwining in mysterious and unsettling ways" and tell me August is way too close to the subject material. The old adage, "write what you know" sometimes backfires, which I believe is the case here. There were a few moments of intricate genius with a correlative here and there, but for the most part the sanctity of the canvas created elicits only fractions of a pay off; in other words, this is an empty, vapid expression of expressionism rather than a meaningful dialogue on existentialism.</fullReview>
