		<shortDescription>A Magic Candy Moment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year, at a crisis time of imminent homelessness, I went to the video store with the idea of renting some banal new release to distract me from my troubles. Waiting in line holding a video starring Tom Hanks (or was it Kevin Costner? Maybe it was Julia Roberts. Such a blur is Hollywood today) something in the foreign section an aisle down caught my eye. It was the video for Jacques Rivette's 1974 masterpiece, Celine and Julie Go Boating.Immediately upon seeing the cover image of Juliet Berto (Celine) posed as a magician, her Dietrich hauteur kinky and comical, I knew it would be my kind of film. I was also pleased to see it was such a long film it had to be contained in a two-video set. It had long been my suspicion that all secrets of life would be revealed in a film over three hours long and in French.Indeed, Celine and Julie is just that film. But it conceals as it reveals, which is to say that its great mysteriousness results from its floribundance of revelation. Yes, my friend, a floribundance! I never even thought of such a word until seeing Celine and Julie.Critics have been unable to explain what it's "about". I cannot. I can't explain the plays of Shakespeare or the poems of Emily Dickinson, but I am moved by them. Attempts to understand them can lead to intense mental spasmodics, but the pain, if the work is good, can be great.Those who've seen the film will remember the hard magic candy the women savored on their own path to understanding. Vision giving, the candy became an addiction to them. Once is never enough and hasn't been for me. I have seen Celine and Julie three times and thought of it many more.My favorite scene is where Celine performs her weird magic act in a nightclub where, as far as I can tell, the customers are all convicted poets. The atmosphere there is fascinating. Time stops while she does her act, which is beyond words, indescribable. The whole feeling in that scene of a kind of super sophisticated moment of comedy and sex and mystery all shared by a group of people in silence is one that I find marvelously inspiring. Surely some clever entrepreneur in San Francisco, where I reside, could open such a club. Oh, I suppose it won't happen, but at least one can dream.Really, it's the importance, power and pleasure-pain of dreaming that this film reawakended me to when I saw it months ago. To be like Celine and Julie with their minds moved by candy is a state I aspire to daily.When I was briefly without a place to live, I thought of this film and was taken to a sunny day in Montmarte, a house where the living and unliving mingle, a library where stalkers and smokers meet. I savored that magic, the effect of great art on the mind, and I knew I was not truly homeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I dream it, or was it real...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a teenager in the 1970s, I was a frequent visitor to an art gallery in Liverpool called the Open Eye. When they started a film club, promising to show all the stuff I had read about but would never otherwise get a chance to see, I signed up like a flash.It was a humble affair: a bare room with temporary blackouts on the windows, a makeshift screen at one end, a projector at t'other and a dozen or so ill-assorted chairs inbetween, but I loved it. For me it was a magic grotto: a portal to another place of endless fascination and discovery. It was here that I had my first exposure to the works of Bu?uel, Renoir, Fritz Lang; Dziga Vertov's "Man With a Movie Camera"; the experimental shadowgraph animations of Man Ray; David Lynch's Eraserhead ? and, unforgettably, "Céline et Julie vont en bateau".Even for one as keen on "Art" cinema as I was, Céline et Julie was a bit of a challenging prospect: a low-budget French thing about god-knows-what, by a director I'd never heard of, that we were warned would run over three hours without interval. Little did I know, as the opening credits rolled, that from then on time would mean nothing and I would be held captive; enthralled; the hours slipping by unheeded, as when dreaming.It is this quality that, for me, makes this film so special. European (especially French) cinema is full of works that lay claim to the label "Surrealist". I have to say that in my opinion most of them have little to do with the truly surreal at all. More often than not they are simply a cocktail of absurdism and social satire.Céline et Julie, on the other hand, is a genuinely surreal film ? possibly the ONLY genuinely surreal film ever made (!) - insomuch that its narrative (and hence the experience of watching it unfold) is uncannily dreamlike. From the outset the viewer is drawn inexorably forward by a teasing sense of curiosity. Frequently along the way there seems to be far too much going on that is unexplained, and little hope of fitting it all together, yet one cannot help but remain in the story. In time, we become aware that our mixed sensations as viewer are mirroring those being experienced by Céline and Julie ? and thus we find ourselves in that familiar condition of the dreamer: of being simultaneously both onlooker and protagonist in our own drama. Afterwards, I was left feeling curiously elated, yet struggling to recall its details with any precision. The impressions it had left behind were powerful and thought-provoking, yet intangible, and recalled but imperfectly, in the manner of one who has just awoken: with a frustrating uncertainty as to exactly what had occurred, to whom and in what order. Any attempt to explain it to a third party was equally doomed. Just as with a half-remembered dream, the very act of telling caused the peculiar para-logic of the narrative to disintegrate, and I'd be left speechless.It's been part of me ever since. Over the last 30-odd years, the themes and images of this film have, in the nicest possible way, haunted me: lurking in the shadows of consciousness, beyond the clumsy reach of rational query, quietly informing my imagination, to appear, unbidden, in subtle and unexpected ways in my own creative output.The whole strange business has been made all the more uncanny by the fact that, throughout those 30-odd years, the film itself has been lost to me. Having experienced it the once, I was never able to find Céline et Julie again, nor any reference to it, even in the pages of famously trusted and supposedly 'comprehensive' movie guides. Likewise, whenever I mentioned the film in conversation I could never come across anyone who had ever heard of it. Having worked its mischief, the contrary creature had melted back into the half-light, leaving no trace of its existence.Then, in October of 2006, a miracle: there it was, right in front of me, listed in the TV schedules! Film4 was showing it ? at the suitably unconscious hour of 3am. Unwilling to risk losing it for another 30 years to the vagaries of my video recorder's dodgy timer, I sat up, my finger hovering nervously over the Record button...A few days later, having found an afternoon in which we were free of commitments, my partner and I settled in to watch it: she with some scepticism that she would be able to maintain her interest for the whole 3 hours, and me both a-quiver with anticipation and privately praying that, in the hard light of reality, this thing of treasured half-memory would not prove itself to be The Worst Load Of Pretentious Tripe Ever Made.I needn't have worried. No sooner had I hit "Play" than that fragrant, familiar magic began weaving itself all over again. I am delighted to report that Céline et Julie is just as powerful an experience now as it was in my youth.What I had forgotten, or perhaps never noticed at all on first viewing, was just what a rough-edged, homespun creature it is in technical terms. It was shot entirely on location, on 16mm and with a very small crew, and it shows. The soundtrack is patchy in places and frequently prey to whatever ambient sounds were present when the camera rolled (usually Parisian traffic noise). Now and then the acting is self-conscious, and some of the reaction shots are clumsily done. In the end, though, none of this matters a damn. Indeed, it is the film's very lack of studio polish that gives it much of its special flavour. Céline et Julie is an imperfect creation, but an honest one. It is also charming, playful and frequently hilarious. As such, I recommend it unreservedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What we miss most about our childhoods, distilled in a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A PERFECT, SHARED IMAGINATION: something we become entirely incapable of evoking in our adult lives. As children, it's still possible to create an all-engrossing, parallel existence played out in symbiotic harmony by two individuals calling themselves best friends. With an uncluttered and unfettered creativity, these friends are sucked into their inner story to a point that time, place and the mundane habits and duties of one's routine no longer exist, or rather, are incorporated and/or adapted to fit what then becomes one's main existence - the imagined one. What makes this movie so convincingly evoke the yearning for the magic of childhood is exactly this: the fact that this imaginative world is shared so perfectly by two friends, and not just cultivated within an isolation and individuality typical of adult age. No other movie has made me think back at my childhood best friends as vividly as Céline and Julie Go Boating!Hours spent in a room surrounded by familiar objects turned into so many powerful talismans. Earnest "magic" rituals punctuated by benevolent, mutual derision in the little moments in which one risks getting too serious or devoid of irony. Convulsive giggling fits which end in snorting noises. Relaxed, spontaneous, touchy-feely languid poses making two friends feel like they fit each other's company like a glove. Living the present so perfectly that one is momentarily, blissfully freed of any baggage from the past or the insecurities for the future that stunt one's spontaneity in the present. This isn't just a definition of perfect, child-like friendship, but also of a simple, uncluttered state of pure happiness. Rivette captures the spirit of all these things - childhood and happiness - in a movie unlike any I've seen before. Or rather - the movie may have seemed familiar thematically, but the execution and spirit of it was something else altogether.As other users have commented here, Céline and Julie Go Boating is inspired by both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Henry James, as well as being reminiscent of Bu?uel - not just his "surreal" movies but also That Obscure Object of Desire. In the latter, Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina play the same character interchangeably. Céline and Julie do the same when they both, interchangeably play the nurse in the closed-circuit, story-in-the-story involving the man, the blonde woman, the brunette woman and the little girl in the "haunted" house - this story's plot is being played out over and over again in the two protagonists' heads as they strive to both figure its intrigue and the dark heart of its mystery out, all the while deriding the stuffy rhetoric of its melodrama (delightful!). There are clear echoes of Bergman's Persona as well, as Céline and Julie stand in for each other - namely, Céline pretends to be Julie when she meets her childhood sweetheart and cousin Guilou, while Julie stands in for Céline when she attends the magician's audition. Touches of Bu?uel and Fellini are also evoked by the dream sequences, with their typical, fragmented rhythm which mixes in dreams, reality, thoughts and imagination. Though innovative and timeless, Céline and Julie Go Boating does also belong to the decade in which it was made, as it has a recognisable 1960s/70s surrealist aesthetic and an interest in "inner landscapes", not for their own sake but for what they say about the psychic goings on of human beings. Purely thematically, this movie also brought to mind Peter Jackson's 1994 movie Heavenly Creatures. However, though the latter was made exactly 20 years later than Céline and Julie, it is decidedly more "misogynistic" in spirit, to be fair perhaps not consciously or intentionally so. Why am I calling Jackson's movie misogynistic? Because ultimately, unlike Céline and Julie Go Boating, it treats the symbiotic, shared, female imagination that's allowed free rein as something negatively irrational, uncontrollable, dark and finally, destructive, the lesbian undertones becoming morbid rather than light-hearted, humorous and feel-good as in the Rivette's splendid and highly original movie.What this Céline and Julie Go Boating told me was that in some cases, guiltlessly cultivating, salvaging and exploring one's inner and imaginative life is far more important than meeting the expectations of one's day-to-day, material duties. Therefore, solving the mystery of a "haunted" house is more crucial than, say, furthering one's career (for example, succeeding in an audition for an important, international magician's tour - Céline should have attended it but Julie does so instead, to very amusing and disastrous effect! I loved, loved, loved actress Dominique Labourier's droll histrionics during that scene!). I have never seen a movie treat with such humour and gaiety a subject as serious, complex and potentially heavy-duty Freudian as exploring one's unresolved childhood issues. Much of this movie is about Julie's (and perhaps everyone's, to a degree) inability to assimilate the past completely (her tarot reading by a fellow librarian reveals this at the beginning of the movie - "Your future is in the past"). To put it stereotypically, the "inner child" needs to be freed before one can truly become an adult - a happy, healthy, sorted, serene, childlike adult. This process of healing is punctuated by the two protagonists by playful role-playing (both Céline and Julie have a ball taking on different identities by also donning different costumes throughout the course of the movie), an endless string of occasions for giggling fits and what is essentially a cheerful use of childish "drugs" (candy and home-made magic potions) to evoke that crucial, life-giving shared imagination. In a sentence, the psychic ailments typical of adulthood are cured with the spirit typical of childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A celebration of childlike imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies would seem to be the ideal medium for surrealism, yet there are almost no good surrealist movies. There is the venerable "Un Chien Andalou", and there is "Celine et Julie vont en Bateau", and that might well be the lot. "Celine et Julie" has been one of my favorite films since I first saw it in the 1970s, because it is hypnotic, thought-provoking, mysterious, and funny, all at once. Its overall style could be described as magical realism, in which the quotidian life of Paris serves as a mere background for the magical fantasy life of the protagonists, two young women on a psychic journey, which may or may not end in madness ("vont en bateau", which literally means "go boating", is also slang for "go crazy").The film is made of moments that seem to happen outside of time. In fact, the passage of time, the succession of events in everyday life, becomes an intrusion on the increasingly shared inner life of the two women, and each takes (hilarious) action to prevent those intrusions from continuing. They determine, in effect, that they must return as adults to their childhood in order to change the past. This may sound like a boring Freudian nightmare, but there is no heavy-handed psychologizing in the movie; it is all play, lighthearted yet beautifully composed. The sound-track is particularly effective, almost hyperrealistic, with no background music. The click of heels on pavement, or the motor of a taxi, loom out of the silence as in a dream, which the movie may be, at its heart.I give this one a 10. You probably know already whether you would like it. If so, see it in a theater if you can, and on video if you must, but don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING (5 outta 5 stars)Wow... one of those really great, really strange movies that I love so much! Over 3 hours long but I got so absorbed in the story that I didn't even notice it was that long. I wanted it to be longer, in fact! Kinda hard to describe... sort of a cross between a Bunuel and a Rohmer movie... starring a French Laverne and Shirley. The plot takes its time getting started... but once the premise became evident I was totally hooked! Our 2 heroines take turns going into a strange house. They emerge some hours later, totally disoriented and with no recollection of what happened inside. Later they are able to recall certain events... but not the whole story. This goes on day after day... the exact same scenes take place with the 2 women taking turns playing a nurse to a sick child... who, it turns out, may have been murdered by someone else in the house! But who? The girls keep going back into the house to find out the secret. The 2 women who play the leads are EXCELLENT! They start out not knowing each other but become close friends as the events unfold. They are both slightly kooky and enjoy playing pranks on each other... at times taking over the other person's life while that person is busy in the house. Some of the later scenes in the movie... when the 2 girls go into the house together... are HILARIOUS! I was actually laughing at loud at stuff... but I fully admit that normal people don't always see the humour in the same things that I do. 8) Wow, I need to see this movie again! Will someone PLEASE release it on DVD with a decent picture? This grainy bootleg just doesn't do it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Beautiful Troublemakers Go Boating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Praised by the critics as "delicate , mysterious, and exiting", "an original and entertaining metaphor for film-watching and, perhaps, film history", and named "The most radical and delightful narrative film since Citizen Kane! The experience of a lifetime" by New York's critic David Thompson, "Celine and Julie Go Boating" (1974) is all of the above but first of all it is incredible fun to watch. This magic candy of a movie tells the story (or rather plays with the story) of two friends, Julie, a librarian and Celine, a magician. The film starts one sunny summer day in Paris when Julie follows running through the park and losing her stuff all over (a scarf, a shoe?) Celine exactly like another girl in the English country side one sunny summer day had followed a White Rabbit into a world of her imagination. Two girls became friends and soon with the help of a magic memory-inducing candy, they both will be the observers and participants in a bizarre soap-opera like drama that takes place in a mysterious house. It involves two stunningly beautiful women, a blonde and a brunette, who are in love with the same man. The man is a widower with a young daughter who had promised his wife that he would not remarry as long as their daughter is alive. When the blonde and the brunette become desperate enough to try to do something about the situation, it is up to Julie and Celine to come up with the plan and to rescue the young girl. Will they go boating? Well, you will have to stay with them for all 193 minutes to find out. Yes, Rivette takes his time but his movie never seems slow or boring. Playful yet complicated, mad and funny, "Celine and Julie" is a magic movie. It grabbed me from the opening scene - which is of course the opening chapter of "Alice in Wonderland" - and it never let go. Buniel would love this movie, I think. It also reminds me of "Mullholand Dr" and even "Persona" but in the absolutely different mode. Simply DELIGHTFUL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halfway through CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING my opening line for this review would have been something like this; "a drawn out, poorly photographed mish-mash of uninspired surrealistic images. However, gradually as the film drew me further into its unescapable web, I began to realize that the films images weren't uninspired, they were simply detached, in the logic of a dream. True to that statement, CELINE AND JULIE is the most realistic demonstration of a dream state I have ever witnessed. It is drawn out, but it's also meditative, not to mention fascinating, and strangely, as in dreams, realistic. Gradually you don't notice the irrationality, like a dream you simply feed off its aestheics. And as the "swiss cheese" plot begins to fill in, your excitment grows as you long for a better understanding. Now, Freuds will no doubt aply their psuedo-symbolism to a film such as CELINE AND JULIE, I myself find it to be a film about a search for inner childhood (notice the "haunted house" plot is the womens attempts to rescue a small girl). It is a film that demonstrates the way imagination gives our lives a needed purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phantom Ladies Over Paris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Céline et Julie vont en bateau" a few years after watching "3 Women" and Claudia Weill's "Girlfriends." The next day I saw it again, and then again and again... This was a time when I was very interested in the depiction of modern women in films: some were quite original and revealing, and this was indeed one of them, dealing with the creative process, and women's imagination. Made in 1974, it had a similar origin as that of "3 Women", in which the female cast (Juliet Berto, Dominique Labourier, Bulle Ogier, and Marie-France Pisier) worked with director Rivette and writer Eduardo de Gregorio on the script. It is also a story of female bonding and solidarity, but instead of relying on dreams, it uses magic and literary sources, Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" being the first to come to mind. Librarian Julie (Labourier) becomes intrigued by weird rabbit-like magician Céline (Berto), but soon one is after the other. They become friends (or sort of) and exchange roles in each other's life, but nobody seems to notice the difference. Then Céline reveals she frequently goes inside an old house where a melodrama is repeated on and on (based on Henry James' "The Romance of Certain Old Clothes" and "The Other House"), enacted by two women (Ogier, Pisier) who are both in love with a very pale man (filmmaker Barbet Schroeder.) In the old house there is also a little girl (Nathalie Asnar) who is in danger, so Céline and Julie become the "phantom ladies" of the title (including Fantômas outfits) to rescue her. This post-modern movie is a puzzle, and the audience is intellectually involved in the making. Critics went crazy and called it "the most important film made since 'Citizen Kane'." I don't know if it is, but I love it: it is funny, demanding, entertaining, and sometimes boring, in the best tradition of Satie's repetitive "Vexations". Reworked as "Desperately Seeking Susan", without acknowledging it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Celine and Julie show us that magic is everywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For over 30 years I have been calling this my favourite film. Like Céline and Julie I was young in 1974, there was magic in the air: dressing up with floating scarves and feather boas brought performance into everyday life, fashionable dalliance with the magic symbols beloved of the Surrealists contrasted brightly with the still fairly recent, drab post-war world. Rivette's film had more than a little of "l'air du temps". So would I be disappointed over 30 years later, seeing the film (subtitled in English) in London's National Film Theatre in May 2006? Emphatically, no. Rivette's genius is to recreate a timeless magic which weaves seamlessly through city streets and gardens and which is to be accessed in a more condensed form in the cinema (symbolised here by the rather more wooden and conventional story within the film) .This is a film for those who can sit for hours on a park bench in Paris, or at a café table, unaware of the passing of time, but entranced by the details of the surrounding architecture and the glimpsed lives of passers-by. Over three hours long, it is not a film for the person impatient for the plot to race to its conclusion, when every question is answered and every mystery solved.Magic is the magic of Paris itself. Lingering shots of cats hold our focus on the magic of the prosaic, while also reminding us of witches' familiars. Magic exists in the performance of the magician Céline. The viewer is also reconnected to the magic of childhood. We see Céline in the children's section of the library, and it is with the solemnity of small children that the two girls are happy to substitute the perfume "L'Air du Temps" (ultimately just air) for the element of air in their magic potion. The whole adventure can be seen as a return to childhood, an old photo in a toy box giving us a clue as to the origins of the mysterious house in which the girls alternately act the part of the nursemaid.It is a film with layer upon layer of allusions. The magic sweets echo the madeleines with which Proust's Marcel regained with immediacy memories of his childhood, just as they echo the magic potion in "Alice in Wonderland".Humour abounds. Try, if you understand French, to follow the word-play in the original (sometimes necessitating inaccurate translations, as when the punning pair of words "persil" (parsley)/ "esprit" are rendered as "clover"/ "clever"). Delight in the natural exuberance of the two girls as when, fearful of being discovered as one and the same nursemaid in the mysterious house, they almost literally fall about laughing as they try to disguise themselves as mirror images of themselves.Mirror images and symmetry shape the film, and are extremely satisfying to the viewer. This time round I noticed many details that I hadn't noticed before. In the penultimate scene, for example, both girls are wearing identical boating jumpers. We have to wait for the last scene for the patterns of identity to come full circle.I think this will always be my favourite film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wondrous trip and a stunning piece of original cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I approached this movie for the 1st time with few preconceptions. The title was vaguely familiar and I'd recently seen Paris Nous Appartient which at least set me up for Rivette's obscure and allusive style of film-making. That was a film which I admired for its atmosphere and direction rather than its now-dated cold war paranoia schtick. The chief drawback for me is its treatment of the lead characters, none of whom one can really feel any engagement with or interest in. When the action peters out, one is left intrigued but ultimately rather empty. Perhaps that was Rivette's commentary on the blankness of the society of the time - the grim late '50s. It's evident that with certain directors, a "macro" perspective of their movies serves one better than attention to matters of plot and character. It's certainly true of Celine et Julie vont en bateau. Don't look for a tight narrative, plot exposition or credible character motivation, you'll find all that in dime-a-dozen movies that will be forgotten before the popcorn's been cleared away. Celine and Julie is a child's adventure, enjoyed by two adult (and rather beauteous) women. It's not a lesbian love story although the intimacy of the characters would normally suggest this. Indeed sexuality is noticeably eschewed and even scorned here. Naturally, because it has no place in the imaginative world of the child which requires freedom not the slavery of innate bodily desires. I found it a pure delight - original (ok,but for dollops of Lewis Carroll), human, engaging and fresh with only a vague taint of early 1970s whimsy despite its age. As with many of the other posters here, watching this movie was a revelation, like the first time you taste a really good wine or hear Nick Drake. And after 3 and a half hours of patience you feel so glad you didn't get served a typical denouement and that you have, like the main characters, been treated to such a wonderful,wonderful experience. Never mind that all of it is illusory. After all,what else is a movie but an escapist jaunt around another's imagination. Undoubtedly the film's principal theme is childhood innocence and how the child's imagination transforms mundane reality. Inherent in Rivette's treatment is an understanding though that the imagination and reality cannot co-exist for long. One is essentially the enemy of the other and C and J become progressively removed from reality, ending up closseted in their darkened room with their transforming psychedelic boiled sweets and magick potions. Their mission is to save the young girl in the mansion from harm but this is surely heavily symbolic, really they are intent on preserving their own "inner child", their innocent separatism from an evil and unattractive "adult" world (peopled with sleazy club impresarios and Julie's "bandes de maquereaux"). Feeding one's imagination thus (even a deux) is basically masturbatory however, it has no life of its own and the reality it feeds on soon sickens and dies, just as visibly do the 3 characters in the ghostly love-triangle who have become grey and mute by the end of the film. C and J's gauche and unpractised interventions in saving the imperilled young girl remind us that we cannot enter our own dreams without seeing their fundamental flimsiness, they are our creation but are less sophisticated than us - simplified and unreal. The blue-remembered hills are much greyer when seen close-up. The joyous finale tells us that, nevertheless, another adventure always beckons, even if it does simply recycle old elements for new. I'm not sure if Rivette's is a sad or an uplifting message - what do you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read about this movie I decided to give it a go, even though the plot didn't seem to exist in any way that could keep you interested for 30 minutes, let alone 195. I like distinctive and different films, sprinkled with surrealism, as much as I like popular classic cinema, but there has to be something that drives the story, and keeps a viewer follow it through. If the story hangs on a thin line, there has to be something other truly mesmerizing (photography, set design, etc.),that pushes a movie to another level. A series of self indulgent drama class exercises, that drag on for more than three hours, testing the patience of best-intentioned and most willing viewer to it's outer limits, is what happens in Celine and Julie. This is a sort of a movie, that has so little to offer, that your mind keeps wondering to all other places but the screen. Two leading actresses play with each other, and it drags on and on, in most parts looking like a student film of an overly ambitious but less talented student. The trick is, they keep student films to under one hour in duration, and it should have been done with this one, it might have improved it's quality. Story of mysterious house in which strange things happen is marred by silly pastiches of unexplained and often absurd actions two leading ladies undertake, in an effort to solve the mystery that has a self serving purpose, same as the movie which is trying too hard to be incomprehensible, in order to be different. And it succeeds. Whatever frenzied gallery of scenes that have no meaning for the general audience, is shown to you, and the least you understand the intentions and ideas of so called "auteur", more it will be considered by many outside of their intellectual capacity, thus, probably representing something really extraordinary.Borrowing heavily from Sedmikrásky (1966), Vera Chytilova's pearl of the Czech new wave and world cinema, Jacques Rivette, couldn't emulate it's freshness, playfulness and cinematography, simply because he didn't have the ability, and because he lost any direction he could have had, when he passed the magic mark of about 76 minutes, after which, these fountains of ideas turn to stone. Difference is coherent uniqueness, difference is Kubrick, Teshighara, Clouzot, Truffaut. Surrealist is Bunuel, Cocteau, Ferreri... Distinctive is Polanski, Allen, Melville, Hitchcock, Welles. This one is not. No plot, no cinematography, no ideas and several pretty scenes is all there is. Nothing to justify three hours of your life. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film for aging children......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I was amazed by it. The freshness and the imagination of the two protagonists, the way in which it recognised the magic (real magic) of Paris, and the strange parallel worlds it created in which Celine and Julie are both deeply involved and creating, and then acting, their own parts. On re-viewing it more than ten years later though, I was surprised to be a little disappointed. The magic is so thin. Celine and Julie have taken the, very conscious and explicit, decision not to grow up, and as a result, although they are beautiful adults, their world is a child's world. Their imagination is child-like, in its imagery (sweets, plastic "dinosaur eyes", rather thin puns), in its chosen surroundings (cases full of dolls), its disasters (a grazed knee), its aims (largely disruption of the concerns of surrounding adults), in its ridiculing of sexuality and its steadfast refusal to admit that fantasy is sometimes, necessarily, dangerous. Without any danger or any desperation, it seemed on second visit a charming but slightly futile game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excruciating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some directors use less than 2% of their footage in the final cut but Rivette must have used 92% of his to make this - perhaps he used absolutely everything, including, apparently, out-takes. Tedium sometimes has a point, but not here. This is annoying-tedium for every scene seems calculated to test our patience. There's no humour or verve or flair or great lines or classic scenes, not even sad attempts at those things, only a forced drollerie that falls flat in every scene There is endless silly giggling, scenes such as those in the nightclub that are just tiresome to watch, fantasy sequences that are presumably meant to look like a corny TV sitcom, but, lacking any scrap of humour, the point is entirely lost and the actors flounder. The girls try far too hard to be cute, and only succeed in being cloying. And I'm waiting for a director to grasp this simple truth: that giving the actors free rein does not make the action more spontaneous and natural, only more strangulated, more self-conscious, more unnatural and cringe-inducing than if they were following a consistent and meticulous script.After a while you realise Rivette is just playing silly buggers. Fluffed lines are left in, characters glance inadvertently-deliberately at the camera. Rivette will be saying: 'Regard, c'est un film that is pas un film, we're deliberatement toying avec your illusions'. I'm saying: Vous etes un wankeur.Why three hours? A Senses of Cinema article is eager to explain: 'The tradition of rigid adherence to the 90 minute to 2-hour time frame, enforced by the laws of free market capitalism, is exploded by Rivette. As a filmmaker, Rivette refuses to confine himself to these arbitrary lengths, or to the even more arbitrary, if unspoken, rules about demands on subject matter and mise-en-sc?ne in films of epic length. Instead, Rivette extends the lengths of his films to a point beyond necessity, where it is understood that the film's length in and of itself is a statement about the system he works in and rebels against.' 3 hours simply to defy (capitalistic??) convention? Wankeur.The audience are the dupes here - poked fun at for trying to apply reality to what is self-consciously only a film. This is not New Wave. I'm gazetting Rivette as a hanger-on, a copyist. He wants to shoot in the style of Rohmer, but he hasn't got Rohmer's indefinable deftness. He wants to break the rules like Godard but he has not got Godard's indefinable style or charisma. He wants to say something meaningful in an offhand way, like Truffaut, but he hasn't got that indefinable intellect for it. All he can do is try. You can feel him trying. It boils down to a single lame joke that isn't funny and a single idea that isn't clever. Three hours of film-flam, tiresome beyond belief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a hot afternoon Julie, reading a magical treatise on a park bench, decides to follow Celine, a stage magician, as she hurries through the park and keeps dropping her belongings. The two develop a friendship and become involved in a mystery involving a house where the same day seems to repeat itself and where a child is murdered.It's a strange premise for a strange, semi-plot less movie where either/or logic and narrative causality are less important than the repetition of scenes, the symmetry between the heroines' actions, recurring symbols, memory-inducing candies, cats, dreams and magic.Jacques Rivette seems to revel in breaking all the rules of film narrative and inviting the viewer to experience cinema in less traditional ways. This is a movie appreciate with a meditative, wandering mood. Scenes, situations, gags and slapstick just flow from scene to scene without nexus and purpose. Depending on the viewer, it can be frustrating or delicious.Juliet Berto and Dominique Labourier give wonderful performances as the eponymous heroines, transmitting a sense of fun and pleasure in every frame. From a technical perspective, the movie is quite good, with Rivette's camera capturing a colourful, sleepy and peaceful Paris on what seems to be a never-ending afternoon of childhood games.Watching Celine and Julie go Boating is almost like returning to that world of imagination and boundless fun we all inhabited when we were younger. Few movies transmit that feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is this an end of the world film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this film again. It must have been 30 years ago (gulp!) that I saw it last but I had such fond memories I had to drive across Scotland to see it in the art house film theatre that was finally showing it again. The film quality was very suspect - it must have been the original film print (ie the one I saw 30 years ago!) or a very dodgy copy. However what a buzz to see the film again! Can't say I noticed the heavy lesbian overtones last time - must have been young and naive. The plot takes a while to settle down but once it decides it's going to be a ghost/lesbian/murder mystery/science fiction/comedy story (!!) it really gets going. As the ghosts in the house are locked in a daily loop, re-enacting the murder of the child, so we see at the end that the film is locked in a bigger loop, when Celine and Julie (finally in a boat) with the rescued girl find the ghosts have dragged them into a cycle where the whole film repeats. They thought they had rescued the girl and broken her out of the loop, only to find that there's no escape and they are all trapped in a bigger loop. But what is the meaning of the interchangeable roles? Celine pretends to be Julie and vice versa at one stage in the story. And in the re-loop of the film at the end we see that we start off with the girls swapping roles. Is it a piece of social comment? - we're all trapped in roles that we repeat every day and these roles are interchangeable, one is as trapped as any other? If life in the film is stuck going round and round forever, doomed to repeat the days of the film like some sort of broken record repeating a song (vinyl - the good old days) - is this the ultimate end of the world film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The coincidence of opposites bypassed, then magic renewal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, some of the films we cherish as classics seem to unfold straightforward narrative as a means of making human destiny known to us, even briefly. What sacrifices to make to reach what actually matters. Seven Samurai, Lawrence; the transformation is always tucked out of sight, inferred. Instead we see the transformed being struggle in the world of organized inadequacies.More sophisticated films enter the place were narrative is formed so that we can have tangible insight of our place in it (and our role in creating it). This is a type of film I am seeking, that places consciousness within itself to give us actual in-sight, where what we see is, itself, the transformation taking place. It always comes back to seeing inside, where the purging must take place. To the place that Nicholas of Cusa describes as obscured by a 'wall of paradise' constituted by the coincidence of opposites (good and evil, being and nonbeing) which conceal from us the divine. A place seemingly inaccessible, as Zen teaches about the level where things arise and disappear being unattainable, but only because guarded by the mechanisms of reason.Fairy-tales are perhaps the earliest narrative form where those mechanisms are bended to allow passage into the unreal. A geography vaguely recognizable but skewed with portents that suggest spontaneous arisal. What narrative we find in a fairy-tale, indeed like every narrative, is only our means of navigating images, images that make inherent sense as picture language.We have one such modern fairy-tale here, about two girls drawn to the pursuit of mysterious adventure in modern Paris. Magic happenstance in a world of fiction and limitless possibility.But notice how Rivette pursues his way through the coincidence of opposites. Two girls who are really figments of the one mind, the mind daydreaming the entire movie. Who not so strangely then behave like lifelong friends when they were seemingly introduced at the start of the movie.Two girls who each adopts the other's guise as a way to eliminate for the other the anxieties and responsibilities of adulthood that would threaten to yank them from this magical world. By impersonating one another, Celine chases Julie's boyfriend away, Julie foils Celine's plans for a vaudeville tour in the Middle East.This is the first half of the movie, delightfully carefree and radiating with improvised discovery. It plays a lot like the Czech film Daisies from '66. Unlike Vera Chytilova's film though that riffed on a simple feminist rebellion, this is complex, structured stuff that delves deeper.Nested inside the one fiction is another, which the two girls taking turns explore inside a mysterious house. This second narrative is a parody of soap opera (itself an unintentional camp about adult responsibility), hysterical stuff about obsession and illicit love involving a husband, mistress, and the presence of a dead wife. The two girls watch from outside, as though shaping the story. They guffaw at the overwrought histrionics or become distracted by boredom; more importantly they participate.So, having persisted in this magical childhood world, here they devise the circumstances that will permit them to assume responsibility for saving a young daughter (an inner child) from a suffocating household life. Circumstances of a boring life that perhaps begat the imaginative flight back into childhood in the first place.Eventually we surface back to the level of reality where, true to the cyclical rule of self-referential fiction, it all starts again. So that the life-centering, life-renewal rites that restore balance inside can be performed again.The actual stuff of the movie could have fit in half the length. But it's the other half of extraneous wandering bubbling with excitement that makes it all breathe with vitality. Compare to how constricted feels Resnais' Je t'aime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone bored with the mundane in cinema or life should get hold of this by hook or by crook. Enchanting and exhilarating, the film defies precis but revolves around the two adorable loons Céline and Julie, captivatingly played (and brilliantly semi-improvised?) by Juliet Berto and Dominique Labourier - Berto is possibly the most entrancing comedienne/sex goddess since Carole Lombard, but Labourier runs her close here and their chemistry is fantastic. I don't think that most lovely and carefree of things, female friendship, has ever been better captured on film.The style is somewhere between a slight surrealism and cinema verite - in its blend of the everyday and the utterly bonkers it reminded me a bit of the book 'Zazie in the Metro' - and in many places it's laugh-out-loud funny. The two heroines are drawn to a haunted house, whose ghostly inhabitants recurringly unfold a neurotic melodrama from an earlier epoch, contrasted with and subverted by Céline and Julie's joyous free spirits.Be warned that you should abandon any modern fidgetiness before embarking: the running time is over three hours, the opening is protracted, and the main plot takes a back seat for around half the duration. If you don't like art-house you won't like this. But somewhere in the universe there is a planet of film-lovers where this is the Christmas movie on every channel in every country every year. I wished it would go on forever and it made me feel reborn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderfully odd?Julie (Dominique Labourier), a librarian, sees a frazzled Céline (Juliet Berto) hurry by dropping things, and follows her to return them, but before long the presence of the pursuit shifts, and then shifts again, and Céline is staying with Julie and the story blurs. Somehow one of them has the address of a house, 7 bis Nadir des Pommes, and when they go there (separately) they inhabit fragments of some sort of fraught mysterious past. Gradually the two women, as they inhabit each other's lives, also discover they are in turn participants in the melodrama, which they recover by various sorts of magic, until they manage to observe the plot as a whole, revisit the site and take over, rescuing the intended victim, a little girl. The most charming parts of the movie are the pacing (fragmented and slow) and the repetition of the melodrama scenes, intense and scary at first, and then funny as the two women observe and giggle about the overwrought language, and then hilarious as they prance together through the scene once they've mastered it. Rivette plays constantly with following blind leads and verbal jokes and setting up tableaux from different angles, and mirroring?disguised as her friend, Céline dispatches Julie's suitor (and rightly so), while Julie blows Céline's audition for a seedy magic tour to the middle-east ? and in the last minutes of the movie, Julie races past Céline in the park, dropping thing, and yes, the chase is on again. The mirroring may have something to do with the most charming part. The inexplicable bond between the two, the way they inhabit each other's minds even as they are just beginning to know each other</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Celine and Julie Go Boating is a hilarious, incredibly surreal, and hugely enjoyable film by Rivette (my first from him), one of my more anticipated directors. And after having seen this, I'm looking forward to Out 1 more than ever. C&amp;J is a really fun, imaginative movie. This is one of the few films I could say I felt enchanted by. It has a childlike innocence that I don't think anything else has captured. The best word I could use to describe the film is "magical". From the nonsensical plot, to the dreamlike feel, to the childlike purity, it has magical written all over it! The two leads, Celine and Julie are super likable characters, they're easily one of the best parts of the movie. They tie the whole thing together and are really fun to watch. Describing the plot is pointless because it's basically just a series of random, funny, and interesting scenes loosely connected, if at all. In this, it's truly ingenious. There are some points brought up by others that I wanted to look over. Some people have said that the only good thing about the movie are the two main leads and everything else was plain tedious, which is understandable but not necessarily something I agree with. The style definitely isn't for everybody and I even have some minor gripes with it (I know they're using the French New Wave style of editing and being experimental, but were the scenes where a character was walking or doing something and they would have a jump cut every second really necessary?). Plus, if you take into account the childishness, writing style, and visual style, it's completely understandable why someone would think that. That brings me to the next thing a lot of people bring up, the film is visually unappealing. Yeah, the film is without a doubt lacking in the visual department, but I wouldn't say the film needed to be very visually appealing to begin with. In fact, a lot of films don't have to be visually appealing to be good. Just look at PTA's Magnolia (ok, maybe not the best example seeing that a lot of people are split on it), it's a masterpiece but definitely not very good in the visual department. Good visuals aren't necessary when telling a good story, they simply add to it. C&amp;J had so many other great things going for it that I didn't care. Besides, it wasn't really bad. Not very appealing but certainly not so bad that it ruined the movie. Again though, if you look at it as a problem then that's fine. Finally, there are some who say the film is just overall obnoxious and boring. Well, that just comes down to personal taste. If you like it, you like it, if you don't, you don't. Anyway, I loved Celine and Julie Go Boating and I'm giving it a strong 9/10 which may change overtime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recommend people read "Excruciating" (federovsky, 8/30/12) and "Much Ado About Nothing" (Milan, 4/15/2012) if they want to know what they are in store for. "Celine and Julie Go Boating" is difficult, frustrating and over long. However, it is also the kind of film that after seeing it, you wonder what other people have to say about it.I didn't enjoy it much. Visually, it is not terribly special. The relationship between the two women and the "haunted house" is what keeps us watching, but the scenes come very slowly.Several people have said it unfolds like a dream. Others have pointed out the lesbian/feminist side to it. Another possibility is that the two women represent two personalities of a schizophrenic nurse who committed an unspeakable crime. That would explain the repetitive cutting between one woman as the nurse and then her counterpart switching in. The two sides of the same madwoman angle possibly explains why the story includes the woman who is a performance amateur subbing for the experienced magician.Between "Celine" (Juliet Berto) and "Julie" (Dominique Labourier), I think Labourier is the strongest here. Labourier has a lot of charisma; too bad Rivette has her often just laughing directly into the camera.The characters in the "haunted house" are interesting. Marie-France Pisier is a favorite of mine, and she is very mysterious here.If the scenes didn't unfold so sluggishly, and if the narrative were tighter, I think it would have been great. Unfortunately, it is too much work to recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for cineastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Jacques Rivette's genre-defying opus is an unsung hero upon its release in 1974, but 40 years later when we are all stumped in light of the cornucopia of derivative outputs, this masterpiece attests that it is never too late to burrow into historical archives, advocate some hidden gems and introduce them to the fast food generation, and CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING could overtly widen one's filmic horizon by its unprecedented storytelling and the contagious jovial aura. We are like in a blind man's bluff, the film begins with a head-scratching hide-and-seek tailing between Julie, a librarian and Celine, an amateurish magician, we will never know from the context whether they are acquaintances before or the first-sight attraction draws them closer, after a chirpy episode of putting out feelers, they lives together in a small apartment, where Celine casually mentions of her unpleasant experience working as a nanny for a mystified ménage-?-trois family, it intrigues Julie's curiosity, from then on, a very unique ghost-house yarn has been ingeniously unveiled through Celine and Julie's multiple impersonations as the reserved nanny in a boudoir drama. The film is such a pioneer in its blending liberal modus operandi of whimsicality (the first half looks like everything is done impromptu) with elaborately calculated ad hoc murder scheme, Celine and Julie's laid-back and bubbly kindred spirit permeates the film and modulates its rhythm and pulse up to a labyrinthine fantasy, utterly absorbing and an influential progenitor to many future rule-breakers (MEMENTO 1999, 10/10 for instance). It is a diptych in its cinematographic style as well, the insouciant nouvelle vague influence vs. a multi-angle observation indoors, which magnify Berto and Labourier's disparate temperaments, intensify Ogier and Pisier's distinctive mystique and functionally wrap us up into this whodunit during the long-haul. Meanwhile, Rivette adequately leaves viewers many open threads to chew on, like the jumpy inter-cutting of the shots in the house during Celine's magic show, is a perplexing maneuver to lure us into the mystery, and it works. Also, one snippet when they let a coin to decide whose turn to visit the mansion, Julie cannily says "head I win, tail you lose", one should not miss the ephemeral stimulation which plainly gives more credits than its ostensible spontaneity.At first glance, its 193 minutes running time looks daunting, but as I watched it separately in two days, it turned out pretty well. It is a film can wholly alter one's notion of story-telling in an anti-cinematic methodology, and Rivette pulls it off effortlessly, a must-see for all thirsty film gourmets plus, it has a sterling ending which will make all its time worth the wait.</fullReview>

They are so funny and so talented and they play off each other so well that if this was a slice of life film where nothing much happens it would still be worth watching. But this is not slice of life. This is a carefully constructed mystery which questions the nature of reality and personality and memory. And it stands the test of time. I first saw it in the mid 1970s. I watched it again last night. It was great both times and every time in between.I am surprised that there are so few reviews for this movie considering the fact that so many directors have copied it.

		<fullReview>It's a joy to try to put this movie in perspective, I think, because of how unique it really is. The closest I've come is to say "It's Wayne's World meets David Lynch but 20 years earlier." It's got the quirky clever fun of the former, and the dreamy eerieness of the latter.Well, let's stick to the facts for now. Inspired by "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" as well as by the drug culture of its day, Rivette's "Celine and Julie" is a brisk romp with two girls as they meet and share an intense experience. I call the romp brisk even though the movie is 3 hours and 13 minutes long, because the casting, acting, script and direction are all so genius, that the time flies by. The story starts simply like a regular French drama and, then, because of the powerful characters (and daring actresses) we are following, it shifts into unexpected territory, and we feel as if we are on a thrilling ride as a participant in a new friendship. The girls may not be doing much physically, other than walk, talk eat, sing, laugh and trip out, but the plot is so cleverly written that somehow we find ourselves in a cabaret, and then an old English murder mystery!The whole treat of the movie is that it manages to be a Marx Brothers-style unpredictable comedy while still having all the richness and variety of emotions normally found in melodramas. It's as if the director doesn't believe in being pinned down definitely in any one genre. Also admirable is the fact that the complexities of the plot are achieved without any special effects at all and instead only by wit, precision, and good humor. It is obvious that the film team had a good time during the planning stage. For these reasons, the movie doesn't seem in danger of ever growing outdated. Far from it, it blows me away! It's one of the greatest buddy movies of all time. It's about a good time. It's about what movies should be! It's liberating. I guess, like any good magic show, it has to be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it goes without saying that Celine and Julie is a terrific riff on Alice in Wonderland, but FYI, I'll reiterate it and give a few details. Julie chasing Celine at the outset = Alice following the March Hare hurrying down the rabbit hole. There's a (Cheshire) cat, of course. EAT ME and DRINK ME are key instructions throughout. There's even a tea party, complete with over-sized utensils.This superb, incomparable movie is a thing of wonder for sure. And of all the feminist and quasi-feminist works of art of the period, I don't know of another that revels so delightfully in the sheer fun of being a girl and/or women (and that blurs the differences between the two so tellingly). I also can't think of another film that has so much twisted fun with the ritual of watching TV (the only thing better than following the melodrama playing out in C&amp;J's minds is watching their reactions to it).Two caveats: Much as I love long movies, C&amp;J is a bit overlong - the boudoir melodrama plays out a bit more than it has to, and loses some of its fascination as a result. And Labourier's performance in the last third turns somewhat arch and cutesy (NOT in her "audition" scene, however, which is for the most part wonderful).Lastly, I'm again struck with wonder at the New Wave filmmakers' ability to make something extraordinary out of next to nothing. No fancy sets or costumes (the production even in the upperclass melodrama sections is refreshingly threadbare), plenty of available light, no special effects of any kind. Godard, Rivette, Rohmer, etc, were Dogma avant la lettre, without being, er, dogmatic about it. One can pore over their self-referential filmic-ness all one wants, but what they give us so generously is real people (stars deglamorized without constantly nudging us in the ribs for congratulation) and real places. Cinema that gives us the world.C&amp;J, like all the best of the school, is something lived in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An indecipherable yet magical puzzle of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see why many find "Celine and Julie Go Boating" rather tedious, despite its art house classic status. It's a very lengthy surrealist exercise which defies any traditional form of narrative. Just exactly what it means is left up to the viewer. Still, for anyone with an interest in deconstruction, this film is absolutely mandatory. Few films have so successfully beckoned the audience to reconsider the way they view traditional linear films. Meta-fiction and self-reference are two concepts I find fascinating, but they're extremely difficult to pull off without coming across as self-indulgence. "Celine and Julie Go Boating" avoids being merely pretentious because it accomplishes what it aims for with the various themes. While the over three hour running time will frighten many away, the adventurous will be rewarded. The length is completely necessary for the film's meta-discourse.In addition to the wealth of subtext, the film actually manages to be rather entertaining. There are moments of pratfall comedy, including chase sequences which reference silent comedies along the lines of Mack Sennett, which work very well. Plus, the film often seems to mock its level of inaccessibility. There are scenes where Celine and Julie are watching the second narrative unfold, and commenting on how "deep" the whole matter is. Plus, the second narrative involving the ghosts which Celine and Julie enter, is essentially a parody of the classic Gothic melodrama (apparently its loosely based on "The Romance of Certain Old Clothes" by Henry James, a text which I've yet to read). Ultimately, the film is about imagination and childhood fantasies. Celine and Julie play house with a certain awe, letting loose their inhibitions. "Celine and Julie Go Boating" is understandably an inaccessible film which will turn off many viewers. However, those willing to go along with it will be greatly rewarded in the end.

Basically Julie (Dominique Labourier) is reading a book about magic spells, and a woman, Celine (Juliet Berto), walks past dropping various possessions, and she follows her picking them up and seeing where she goes, at one point she loses her, but they catch up with each other. Eventually Celine has moved in with Julie, and they go out to various places using each other's identities, including Celine meeting Julie's childhood sweetheart, and Julie filling in for a cabaret audition for Celine. They are also seen separately visiting a quiet and walled off mansion, seemingly empty, and these visits become repetitive, each entering and disappearing for some time, one of the times they somehow get a special kind of candy. This candy enables Celine and Julie to transport into the house and an alternative reality, seeing the lives of supposedly the house residents, and as they suck the sweets and try to solve a mystery concerning the people. Besides seeing all this stuff Celine and Julie relax by going boating on a placid river with young girl Madlyn (Nathalie Asnar), but by the end of the film you find out that Celine did not leave the bench she was sitting on at the beginning, it was all an Alice in Wonderland style dream, and Julie does walk past again, so she picks up her possessions and presumably it will all happen again. Also starring Marie-France Pisier as Sophie, Barbet Schroeder as Olivier, Philippe Clévenot as Guilou and Marie-Thér?se Saussure as Poupie. Lebourier and Berto give interesting performance, my only problem with this film is that I had pretty much no idea what was going on, it was really confusing; it is only afterwards I can see some of the resemblances to Alice in Wonderland, and I can't agree with the critics' five stars. But there were certainly moments to catch your eye; I would say this is for those who really pay attention to things, but it is not a bad experimental supernatural drama. Worth watching, in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most overrated movie of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I don't really know where to begin. I am totally at a loss as to why this is considered a great film. In my opinion, the movie isn't even a good film let alone great.No matter how I approach the film, I can't really think of anything good to say! Let's start with the cinematography: Big nothing. There's nothing about how this film was shot that would make it stand out in any way. In fact, I'd say the film was poorly shot.The lead actresses: Neither of the two lead actresses in my opinion brought anything of substance to their performances. Forgetting the fact that neither actress was in any way physically interesting to look at...nothing special in the looks department nor did either actress at least have just an interesting style or some quirky, feature that one could at least debate...like say the American actress/comedian Sandra Bernhard...Nope..just plain janes with no style or anything. Nor did their performances strike any kind of note..simply blah. It's as if the director had taken two women from a bar one night and said: "You can star in my movie!" The plot: Meandering at best. And I love movies that don't necessarily have a strong plot. Films of Michael Anonioni come to mind where not much happens, yet Antonioni brings so much subtext &amp; mystery &amp; atmosphere to his films whereas this film...well forget it. Actually the plot reminds me as nothing more than an amateur attempt at making a home movie.The actual writing: No great memorable lines. No style to speak of. A junior high school student could have written the screen play for this movie.Editing: Frankly, I don't think the movie was edited. Except for a couple of times in the movie where he inserts a quick cut here and there, I think all the director did was put together everything he shot and called it a movie.So what is this movie about? Well it's really not about much of anything. Two women meet &amp; move in together and have lots of boring conversations then they start to kind of have these weird fantasies. You can read the other reviews for more detailed info.So why then does this movie have the reputation it does? I think a lot has to do with what the movie was trying to accomplish. The intellectual aspirations of the movie in my opinion blinded the critics at the time. I think they were so pleased to see a movie attempt to be more than a simple narrative that they praised it way more than the film deserves. And certainly in the late 60s early 70s there was this sensibility that simply being different, not mainstream gave a film a certain cache.A notable film from the same time period that also had a surreal bent to it and does deserve its reputation is le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie made by Luis Bunuel in 1972. Of course, Bunuel started the whole surrealism game back in the 20s with his Un chien andalou.So I don't really know what to say about this film. I mean one of my favorite films is 2001 A Space Odyssey which is notoriously slow and lacks much dialog at all, yet is hailed as a masterpiece which I agree with.I really do think the fact that it was considered cutting edge for it's day and yes, dare I say, that is was a FRENCH film I think a lot of critics really felt embarrassed not to jump on the praise parade.Don't feel bad if you miss this flick or if you do happen to see it and can't see what all the fuss is about.This film really is much ado about nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film about friendship and magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing i could say about this film is: it is certainly not for every taste. First of all its plot is totally non-liner, second this movie deals with strange themes in a very strange way, third it has the typical for the french cinema slow development of the act and fourth - it is over three hours long. It is a film about magic and friendship, about two women and their fascination with each other and with magical tricks. It is also a Jacques Rivette movie and I think any one who has watched some of his other films will notice it - it is an extremely long enigmatic movie with interesting dialogues shot in a beautiful way. It somehow reminds of L'Amour Par Terre but is not so dark. This movie can be considered as a comedy, a drama, a thriller or a mystery but first of all it is an experimental film with notes of surrealism and at least for me one of the biggest masterpieces of the french new wave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Alice meets Julie and the rabbit becomes the past?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The traditional story of 2 women attempting to save a little girl from the craziness of growing up is turned on its head in this unique tale. The first 2 hours of the film are tiresome and you wish that it would have ended before it started but by the end of the film (over 3 hours in length) you are glad that the story has an outcome and are so engrossed into the story then you even hope the little fish in the apartment has a good ending. I suggest that the movie is an attempt for us to see the world of Céline and Julie as Céline and Julie saw the scenes in the house, from a disjointed perspective of bits and pieces strewn together by little green candies(this is not a drug film rather the candies are like memory pills that would help an elderly person remember things that his old age had suppressed). If you are looking for a movie about boating go somewhere else but remember that the boating scene reflects heavily on the transformation of their universe as it looks into the future. Is it all a game and does it repeat at the end? I do not have the answers but I suggest that you watch and find out for yourself.The acting is okay (not the best but it feels real and not scripted), there are Alice and Wonderland references in many places including most of the first 4 minutes, the camera angels are cool at times and make you sea sick at others, the sound effects (expecially from the cars/transportation) are louder than my ears would like but not too loud as to cause hearing loss and the music (when there is music) works well, and the plot (what ever you find that to be for yourself) is a wonderful mix of classic storytelling, blurred flashback moments, brief flashback moments, interesting cab rides, interesting character development, cats, jump cuts, psychic montages, long shots, and just plain silliness and funny confusion.Is this a Comedy or a Drama... You tell me because I do not know!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Candy is dandy, but the only liquor here is a bloody Mary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am partial to films that verge on the surreal, and have enjoyed nearly all Luis Bunuel's films (except for the iconic Bunuel surrealist film, The Andalusian Dog, which is too fragmented even for me), most of the works of Peter Greenaway, and more recent venturings in this direction such as Mulholland Drive. And I especially like Celine and Julie.It is true that the film is too long, and the first 45 minutes or so are dog-slow. Things gradually pick up, though, as you (hopefully) become intrigued by an adventure the girls have embarked upon; then they pick up more; then they get really wacky; then things go silly-slapstick, there's a sudden thunderclap, the girls fall off the moon, and afterward there's a quiet boat ride to recap. To summarize: don't let the initial lack of action put you off. Things get more and more interesting, right up till the end. And after the end, there's the fun of puzzling through the various levels of the movie, and what they each mean.A film for those who would enjoy an "Alice in Wonderland" experience for adults. 10/10BTW, the "clover/clever" pun is a clumsy attempt to render the repeated gag "persil" (parsley)/"esprit" (spirit, including ghostly spirits).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>magic candy and giggling girls in Rivette's near-masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite an amazing experience, and I mean that in good and potentially Bad-WTF-Is-This-Anything ways. In a way it reminded me of the sci-fi short film Heaven is Now, if it were more like Inception. And in French. And it didn't have really much music at all. Matter of fact what makes the film so unique and strange and both highly entertaining/engaging and off-putting sometimes in the same scene is that it's less about is story than it is more like a documentary Rivette shot on how much these two women (Juliet Berto as Celine and Dominique Labourier as Julie) love laughing and giggling at the silly scenarios and dialog they've come up with (they were also co-writers). It's as much about watching them, how much chemistry they have together as friends and bosom buddies (so to speak) as it is about watching what they watch in their 'visions'.In short, it's about... still not totally sure exactly. The 'plot' that's to speak of (and really, who should care about that anyway, but I digress) is that these two women, Julie and Celine, meet by chance after one drops sunglasses or something and the other one follows the other to return them - all across the city. And then they strike up a friendship, based around... I suppose that they're both amiable young women who have a fancy for magic. That is, one of them is officially a magician, the other is a librarian (I think). And then... one of the women, Celine I think, goes into some strange house. Why she does go there I don't remember - perhaps thinking back now is like a dream unto itself - but when she emerges it's like she's totally drunk, stumbling around, and has a hard candy with her. When she eats it, she can see what goes on at the house, which is basically like a macabre daytime soap opera ghost-directed (so to speak) by Alfred Hitchcock.So it goes, the two women get drawn more and more into this realm of the 'house' and these people, particularly a little girl who seems subjected to the cruel, Bunuelian streaks of these rich people who roam around in a trance (maybe they have done a better job already than Tim Burton could've ever done with his Gothic 'Dark Shadows'?) and it turns kinda like into a drug movie. Or a hallucination movie. And all the while Berto and Labourier, both attractive in their own way if not gorgeous, more like naturally pretty (for Julie, and she was sweat-stains under her arm-pits, how rare/cool is that to see in a movie?), and both actresses are having a ball in this movie. That's the key for me I think; for the length that it's at, and it's pretty goddamn long, and for how obtuse things can seem (i.e. that scene at the sink where the woman's hand is bleeding and the nurse - interchangeable from shot to shot of the two leading ladies, a gag that gets funnier and weirder the longer the movie goes on), there's always a sense of play.In fact, Celine and Julie Go Boating is one of THE movies about how to 'play' in cinematic terms, and not only that but watching other people play. It turns into an Inception deal where we're the audience to the audience that is the macabre nightmare that is a home life (and with Barbet Schroeder as the husband!) There are some stretches in the film, like when Julie is by herself in the apartment looking over a picture of her ex-boyfriend, that just goes on too long, and grows into tedium. But there's no other film like it, and when Rivette and his ladies hit their stride it brought me into its arms that would sometimes combust and dance and giggle, especially in the last 40 minutes or so when Celine and Julie go together (not separate) into the house. Maybe the girls should count themselves lucky: it could've been the house out of Hausu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luis Bunuel + Lewis Carrol + Laverne &amp; Shirley?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an indescribably bizarre film this is. I couldn't relate the plot to you who read this. There really isn't one. Only at the very end of the film did I recognize a bit of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as being a framework. That novel is mentioned once or twice during the film, but only the last scene rang a bell in my mind. Otherwise, this film is comprised of a lot of random and only peripherally connected sequences involving the two main characters, who are lesbian lovers, apparently. The film is three hours and nineteen minutes long. The available VHS is split into two tapes, of course. The first tape, about two and a quarter hours long, didn't seem to have any internal structure. I very well might just have missed it. But, anyhow, these early and middle sequences are all interesting, some better than others, but they never seem to equal anything. The second tape, however, being a little more than an hour long, is much more coherent, as far as that word can be used to describe anything in this film. Eh, it's really pointless to try to figure this film out. My final assessment is this: it is a very interesting film, but often far too slow and definitely far too long. Too much of it is incoherent, and the characters are unreal, as they are meant to be, but you can't really attach yourself to anything in the film. It's easy to grow bored of it. I like a ton of New Wave films more than this one. However, it is rare that a film beckons me to view it again. Like I said, this is a three hour and nineteen minute long film. When I feel not only the need but also the desire to rewatch it, that has to be taken as some sort of endorsement. 7/10 for now.P.S. Although I did not get a chance to watch it again, I know I will come back to it someday...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This the story of a friendship between two women. It is however not clear why they are friend. They have basically nothing in common. They experience some kind of adventure in an haunted house. But this adventure is more or less senseless. The narrative telling of this adventure is nonlinear and very original. This together with the amusing light tone of the film (which is sometimes not humorless) is maybe what made the fame of it.I found that film quite boring. I was wanting to go out after the first quarter an hour. It seems this film should be funny but it really wasn't to me. I usually like art-films even surrealist/poetic ones like "Zazi dans le metro", "Breaking the waves", "Dead man" and "the eel" ("Unagi"). But this one was really not appealing to me. Maybe the only film I could compare this one with was "une femme est une femme".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rivette seems obsessed with making films lasting about 3 hours. This film is in a way very unique, Alice in Wonderland in modern, well, Paris. Stylish. A film that makes you happy. If you can stand the length... a few in the theater left after an hour. I too felt it quite boring in the middle...and Rivette seems to despise music in his films; it's no background music at all except for a few wonderful seconds in the beginning and the end. Well I think it was worth the wait anyway. I sort of get used to it after an hour or two; it felt like I was a part of the film, it felt real. The film payed off well. Beautifully shot too.I rate this film a 4 out of 5, but remember it is not a film for everyone. More for true cinéastes. I myself like the New Wave directors very much. I still keep The Nun as Rivette's best film though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong and difficult to watch with the interesting themes and material stretched surprisingly thin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie is a quiet and quite shy librarian who is in the park reading her book when a sort of white rabbit runs by in a hurry ? dropping stuff as she goes. Julie follows the girl to return her glasses etc but loses her, only for the girl (Celine) to turn up at Julie's workplace and put their two lives together. Julie discovers that Celine has been visiting a mysterious house during the day but leaving without a memory of what happened to her in there, so she decides to visit it as well ? only for the same to happen to her. The pair try to remember what they have gone through and gradually piece together that the house is trapped in a ghostly loop of the day a young girl was killed.This plot summary is perhaps a bit flattering to the film because it does suggest that this is a tight little mystery with an element of magic and the supernatural to it, however nothing could really be further from the truth. As others have said this film is not really so much about what it seems, but few reviewers here have been able to shed much light on what it is actually about, with the majority just gushing about what a wonderful experience it is. I do concede that watching the film is an experience because it is very different from a lot of stuff I have seen before, but that does not necessarily read that it is brilliant as a result. I know there are things here that I am missing and I'm sure I'm being a total philistine, but it does seem that some people (particularly those who can barely stretch their love of the film to longer than a few lines of text) seem to be falling over themselves to praise a French art film for being, well, French and arty.It was difficult for me to get through, I'll be honest, because it is very long by anyone standards. The first hour seems to be mostly silent and very, very little happens. Later in the film we do get more into the mystery of the house but even this is stretched to the point where it is hard to really care. Rivette has directed with a nice hand, using edits and atmosphere to produce a sense of wonder where really there isn't one. It does seem like his way of letting his cast explore has helped produce some of this natural air of imagination but I did wish that someone had maybe suggested to him that he reign it in to some degree but I guess nobody did (although seeing some of his other work, maybe this is him in total control!). The overall theme of childhood and imagination within this Alice in Wonderland rip is OK to discuss and think about but it is nowhere near interesting or clever enough to justify the long running time given to it here.The cast do well to improvise and both Berto and Labourier have bought into the material well, producing the imaginative wonder and lack of restraint that the material needed ? it never seems like they are questioning anything they are presented with, which is pretty important with all the crossing of identities etc. Outside of them though there really isn't anyone else as the "ghosts" are mostly quite stagy and unconvincing.Overall then an interesting film on paper but a frantically difficult one in reality. I'm sure many viewers will fall for its meandering scenes and imaginative subtexts but for me personally I found myself "getting it" quite quickly but then still forced to watch the scenes as they drag on. Call me a philistine if you wish, but I didn't really see what all the fuss was about and didn't find the heart of the film to reach me as it appears to have done with other viewers. Have a go by all means but please see it for yourselves and don't let the critical hype tell you what you "should" see.</fullReview>

It lost its momentum in the opening chase up to the sacred heart church. Although the story could of been formed into a good movie I think the director completely failed.

		<fullReview>This is the most incomprehensible film I have seen since "Last Year at Marienbad." I have read all of the previous reviews, so I know I am not alone. Even those who praise the film seem not to be able to understand it. I think there is good reason for this: there is nothing to understand. This film is a total con job. There is no doubt that it was improvised, much of it by the actors. This demonstrates that there was no overriding vision from the start. Do the words "pretentious" and "self-indulgent" come to mind? As Gertrude Stein said, in another context, "there's no there there."</fullReview>
